<text>Immortality is the concept of eternal life. Some species possess &quot;biological immortality&quot; due to an apparent lack of the Hayflick limit.

From at least the time of the ancient Mesopotamians, there has been a conviction that gods may be physically immortal, and that this is also a state that the gods at times offer humans. In Christianity, the conviction that God may offer physical immortality with the resurrection of the flesh at the end of time has traditionally been at the center of its beliefs. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial soul exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of religion, as well as the subject of speculation and debate. In religious contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of divinities to human beings who perform virtue or follow divine law.

Some scientists, futurists and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century with the help of certain speculative technologies such as mind uploading (digital immortality).

==Definitions==
===Scientific===

Life extension technologies claim to be developing a path to complete rejuvenation. Cryonics holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as hydra and Planarian worms, it is indeed possible for a creature to be biologically immortal, these are animals which are physiologically very different from humans, and it is not known if something comparable will ever be possible for humans.

===Religious===

Immortality in religion refers usually to either the belief in physical immortality or a more spiritual &quot;afterlife&quot;. In traditions such as ancient Egyptian beliefs, Mesopotamian beliefs and ancient Greek beliefs, the immortal gods consequently were considered to have physical bodies. In Mesopotamian and Greek religion, the gods also made certain men and women physically immortal, whereas in Christianity, many believe that all true believers will be resurrected to physical immortality. Similar beliefs that physical immortality is possible are held by Rastafarians or Rebirthers.

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer.

Pursuit of physical immortality before the advent of modern science included alchemists, who sought to create the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, and various cultures&#x27; legends such as the Fountain of Youth or the Peaches of Immortality inspiring attempts at discovering an elixir of life.

Modern scientific trends, such as cryonics, digital immortality, breakthroughs in rejuvenation, or predictions of an impending technological singularity, to achieve genuine human physical immortality, must still overcome all causes of death to succeed.

===Causes of death===

There are three main causes of death: natural aging, disease, and injury. Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
Aubrey de Grey, a leading researcher in the field, defines aging as &quot;a collection of cumulative changes to the molecular and cellular structure of an adult organism, which result in essential metabolic processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in pathology and death.&quot; The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), DNA damage, oncogenic nuclear mutations and epimutations, cell senescence, mitochondrial mutations, lysosomal aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, immune system decline, and endocrine changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls engineered negligible senescence. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable by technology. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body should not typically have to deal with its natural make up. Human understanding of genetics is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. Preventative medicine is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s may soon be curable with the use of stem cells. Breakthroughs in cell biology and telomere research are leading to treatments for cancer. Vaccines are being researched for AIDS and tuberculosis. Genes associated with type 1 diabetes and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the nervous system may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
Physical trauma would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of paramedic response remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma. A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for nanotechnology, would mitigate this factor. The brain cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change====

Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, death through resource limitation is still possible, such as hypoxia or starvation.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the cumulative probability of death over an infinite horizon is less than certainty, even when the risk of fatal trauma in any finite period is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving &#x27;actuarial escape velocity&#x27;.

===Biological immortality===

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it is the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

Biologists have chosen the word &quot;immortal&quot; to designate cells that are not limited by the Hayflick limit, where cells no longer divide because of DNA damage or shortened telomeres. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is HeLa, developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of Henrietta Lacks without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of Leonard Hayflick, there was the erroneous belief fostered by Alexis Carrel that all normal somatic cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a &quot;cap&quot; at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. Telomerase is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times. No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.

====Biologically immortal species====
Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* &quot;Bacteria&quot; – Bacteria reproduce through binary fission. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 PLoS Biology paper suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.
* &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot;, a jellyfish (phylum Cnidaria, class Hydrozoa, order Anthoathecata), after becoming a sexually mature adult, can transform itself back into a polyp using the cell conversion process of transdifferentiation. &quot;Turritopsis dohrnii&quot; repeats this cycle, meaning that it may have an indefinite lifespan. Its immortal adaptation has allowed it to spread from its original habitat in the Caribbean to &quot;all over the world&quot;.
* &quot;Hydra&quot; is a genus belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, the class Hydrozoa and the order Anthomedusae. They are simple fresh-water predatory animals possessing radial symmetry.

====Evolution of aging====

As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no thermodynamic necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in free energy from the environment and unloads its entropy as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of evolution, but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere &quot;end replication problem&quot; are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms. This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by Peter Medawar in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* Antagonistic pleiotropy is a theory proposed as an alternative by George C. Williams, a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by Thomas Kirkwood, which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.

====Immortality of the germline====

Individual organisms ordinarily age and die, while the germlines which connect successive generations are potentially immortal. The basis for this difference is a fundamental problem in biology. The Russian biologist and historian Zhores A. Medvedev considered that the accuracy of genome replicative and other synthetic systems alone cannot explain the immortality of germlines. Rather Medvedev thought that known features of the biochemistry and genetics of sexual reproduction indicate the presence of unique information maintenance and restoration processes at the different stages of gametogenesis. In particular, Medvedev considered that the most important opportunities for information maintenance of germ cells are created by recombination during meiosis and DNA repair; he saw these as processes within the germ cells that were capable of restoring the integrity of DNA and chromosomes from the types of damage that cause irreversible aging in somatic cells.

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
Some scientists believe that boosting the amount or proportion of telomerase in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre (Madrid) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were &quot;genetically engineered to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice&quot;.

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their Hayflick limit. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of DNA, and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

Embryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most somatic cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and &quot;swallowing the doctor&quot;====
Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of human cloning, cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. Robert Freitas, a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical nanorobots could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them. Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and using as yet hypothetical biological machines, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a &quot;medical&quot; use for Feynman&#x27;s theoretical micromachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) &quot;swallow the doctor&quot;. The idea was incorporated into Feynman&#x27;s 1959 essay &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.&quot;

====Cryonics====

Cryonics, the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to &#x27;pause&#x27; for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients&#x27; diseases have been discovered and aging is reversible. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called vitrification which creates a glass-like state rather than freezing as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual&#x27;s mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
One idea that has been advanced involves uploading an individual&#x27;s habits and memories via direct mind-computer interface. The individual&#x27;s memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. Extropian futurists like Moravec and Kurzweil have proposed that, thanks to exponentially growing computing power, it will someday be possible to upload human consciousness onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment.

This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person&#x27;s entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of identity, thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer.

Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual&#x27;s original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.

It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of consciousness in the functions of the mind. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.
Research on neural correlates of consciousness is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.

====Cybernetics====

Transforming a human into a cyborg can include brain implants or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
==Religious views==

As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the &quot;Syntopicon&quot; found in their compilation of the Great Books of the Western World, that &quot;The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man&#x27;s soul.&quot; Thus, the vast majority of speculation on immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the afterlife.

===Abrahamic religion===

The viewpoints of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism regarding the concept of immortality diverge as each faith system encapsulates unique theological interpretations and doctrines on the enduring human nature soul or spirit.

====Christianity====

Christian theology holds that Adam and Eve lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants through the Fall, although this initial &quot;imperishability of the bodily frame of man&quot; was &quot;a preternatural condition&quot;.

Christians who profess the Nicene Creed believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be resurrected from the dead at the Second Coming; this belief is known as universal resurrection. Paul the Apostle, in following his past life as a Pharisee (a Jewish social movement that held to a future physical resurrection), proclaims an amalgamated view of resurrected believers where both the physical and the spiritual are rebuilt in the likeness of post-resurrection Christ, who &quot;will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body&quot; (ESV). This thought mirrors Paul&#x27;s depiction of believers having been &quot;buried therefore with him [that is, Christ] by baptism into death&quot; (ESV).

N.T. Wright, a theologian and former Bishop of Durham, has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told Time: &quot;Jesus&#x27; resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon his return. Part of this will be the resurrection of all the dead, who will &#x27;awake&#x27;, be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says John Polkinghorne, a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: &#x27;God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.&#x27; That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the Intermediate state) is a period when we are in God&#x27;s presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering Christ&#x27;s kingdom.&quot; This kingdom will consist of Heaven and Earth &quot;joined together in a new creation&quot;, he said.

Christian apocrypha include immortal human figures such as Cartaphilus who were cursed with physical immortality for various transgressions against Christ during the Passion. The medieval Waldensians believed in the immortality of the soul. Leaders of sects such as John Asgill and John Wroe taught followers that physical immortality was possible.

Many Patristic writers have connected the immortal rational soul to the image of God found in Genesis 1:26. Among them is Athanasius of Alexandria and Clement of Alexandria, who say that the immortal rational soul itself is the image of God. Even Early Christian Liturgies exhibit this connection between the immortal rational soul and the creation of humanity in the image of God.

====Islam====

Islamic beliefs bear the concept of spiritual immortality within it; following the death of a certain individual, it will be arbitrated consistent with its beliefs as well as actions and will embark on the ever-lasting place where they will abate.
The Muslim who holds the five pillars of Islam will make an entrance into the Jannah, where they will inhabit eternally.

&quot;Al-Baqarah&quot; (2:25):
&quot;But give glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that their portion is gardens, beneath which rivers flow. Every time they are fed with fruits therefrom, they say, &#x27;Why, this is what we were fed with before,&#x27; for they are given things in similitude; and they have therein companions pure (and holy); and they abide therein forever.&quot;

In contrast, the &quot;kafir&quot; hold the contradictory notion that they abide in &quot;Jahannam&quot; perpetually.

Angels in Islam are reckoned as immortals from the perspective of Islam but most people believe is that the angels will die and that the Angel of Death will die, but there is no clear text concerning this. Rather there are texts which may indicate this, and there is the well known &quot;hadeeth&quot; (narration) about the &quot;trumpet&quot;, which is a &quot;munkar hadeeth&quot; (rejected report). Alternatively, &quot;Jinn&quot; have a long lifespan between 1000 and 1500. In some Muslim Sufi mystics, &quot;Khidr&quot; is given a long life but not immortality or there is more than a little argument stated about the demise of &quot;khidr&quot;; however, it is the matter of debate, and there is a fabrication point that goes around the Khidr drank from the fountain of Life, which is thoroughly invalid. Jesus in Islam was summoned to the sky by Allah&#x27;s sanction to preserve him from the cross and endow him with long life until the advent of the &quot;Dajjal&quot;. &quot;Dajjal&quot; is, additionally, given a long life. Jesus Christ dispatches the &quot;Dajjal&quot; as he stays after 40 days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and the rest of his days like normal days. The Qur&#x27;an states that it is the ultimate fate of all life, including humans, to die eventually.
====Judaism====

The traditional concept of an immaterial and immortal soul distinct from the body was not found in Judaism before the Babylonian exile, but developed as a result of interaction with Persian and Hellenistic philosophies. Accordingly, the Hebrew word &quot;nephesh&quot;, although translated as &quot;soul&quot; in some older English-language Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to &quot;living being&quot;. &quot;Nephesh&quot; was rendered in the Septuagint as (&quot;psūchê&quot;), the Greek word for &#x27;soul&#x27;.

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated &quot;soul&quot; (&quot;nephesh&quot;) in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.
In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated &quot;soul&quot; () has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.
&quot;Soul&quot; may refer either to the whole person, the self, as in &quot;three thousand &quot;souls&quot;&quot; were converted in (see ).

The Hebrew Bible speaks about &quot;Sheol&quot; (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave – the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence, until the resurrection of the dead. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the intertestamental period.

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in Second Temple period. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in , according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh. Resurrection of the dead is specified in detail in the extra-canonical books of Enoch, and in Apocalypse of Baruch. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism P.R. Davies, there is &quot;little or no clear reference ... either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead&quot; in the Dead Sea scrolls texts.
Both Josephus and the New Testament record that the Sadducees did not believe in an afterlife,
but the sources vary on the beliefs of the Pharisees. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not. According to Josephus, who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be reincarnated and &quot;pass into other bodies&quot;, while &quot;the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.&quot;
The Book of Jubilees seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.

Rabbinic Judaism claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the Messianic Age, with the coming of the messiah. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The Tanakh is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.

===Indian religions===

The perspectives on immortality within Hinduism and Buddhism exhibit nuanced differences, with each spiritual tradition offering distinctive theological interpretations and doctrines concerning the eternal essence of the human soul or consciousness.

====Hinduism====

Hindus believe in an immortal soul which is reincarnated after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called &quot;samsara&quot;. If they live their life well, their &quot;karma&quot; improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss. There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.

There are explicit renderings in the Upanishads alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated &quot;When earth, water, fire, air and sky arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi&#x27;s body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death.&quot;

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi:

That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, &quot;Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life ... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life.&quot;

An Indian Tamil saint known as Vallalar claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.

====Buddhism====

One of the three marks of existence in Buddhism is anattā, &quot;non-self&quot;. This teaching states that the body does not have an eternal soul but is composed of five skandhas or aggregates. Additionally, another mark of existence is impermanence, also called anicca, which runs directly counter to concepts of immortality or permanence. According to one Tibetan Buddhist teaching, Dzogchen, individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the rainbow body.

===Ancient religions===

====Ancient Greek religion====
Immortality in ancient Greek religion originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in Homer, Hesiod, and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either Elysium, the Islands of the Blessed, heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground.
Among those humans made immortal were Amphiaraus, Ganymede, Ino, Iphigenia, Menelaus, Peleus, and a great number of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Asclepius was killed by Zeus, and by Apollo&#x27;s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.

In ancient Greek religion a number of men and women have been interpreted as being resurrected and made immortal. Achilles, after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis and brought to an immortal existence in either Leuce, the Elysian plains or the Islands of the Blessed. Memnon, who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. Alcmene, Castor, Heracles, and Melicertes, are also among the figures interpreted to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot;, the seventh century BC sage Aristeas of Proconnesus was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. He would reappear alive years later. However, Greek attitudes towards resurrection were generally negative, and the idea of resurrection was considered neither desirable nor possible. For example, Asclepius was killed by Zeus for using herbs to resurrect the dead, but by his father Apollo&#x27;s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.

Writing his &quot;Lives of Illustrious Men&quot; (Parallel Lives) in the first century, the Middle Platonic philosopher Plutarch in his chapter on Romulus gave an account of the king&#x27;s mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification, comparing it to Greek tales such as the physical immortalization of Alcmene and Aristeas the Proconnesian, &quot;for they say Aristeas died in a fuller&#x27;s work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton&quot;. Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in ancient Greek religion, writing, &quot;many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal.&quot; Likewise, he writes that while something within humans comes from the gods and returns to them after death, this happens &quot;only when it is most completely separated and set free from the body, and becomes altogether pure, fleshless, and undefiled.&quot;

The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of Jesus was not lost on early Christians, as Justin Martyr argued:
: &quot;when we say ... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus.&quot;

The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a belief first appearing with either Pherecydes or the Orphics, and most importantly advocated by Plato and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls.

====Zoroastrianism====
Zoroastrians believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for &quot;immortal&quot; is associated with the month &quot;Amurdad&quot;, meaning &quot;deathless&quot; in Persian, in the Iranian calendar (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or Ameretat is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the &quot;Angel of Immortality&quot; won over the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; in this month.

===Philosophical religions===

Within the realm of philosophical religious paradigms, engage in a profound exploration of the concept of immortality. Simultaneously, expand the breadth and depth of this intellectual inquiry to afford a more intricate examination of the subject matter.

====Taoism====
It is repeatedly stated in the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; that death is unavoidable. Henri Maspero noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality. Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a &quot;way of life&quot; than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done. In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
Alcmaeon of Croton argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.

===Plato===
Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; advances four arguments for the soul&#x27;s immortality:
* The Cyclical Argument, or Opposites Argument explains that Forms are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily &quot;imperishable&quot;. As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.
* The Theory of Recollection explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot;, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in &quot;Phaedo&quot;.
* The Affinity Argument, explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.
* The Argument from Form of Life or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
Plotinus offers a version of the argument that Kant calls &quot;The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology&quot;. Plotinus first argues that the soul is simple, then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with Moses Mendelssohn&#x27;s Phaedon.

===Metochites===
Theodore Metochites argues that part of the soul&#x27;s nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.

===Avicenna===
Avicenna argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Thomas Aquinas&#x27; elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;.

===Descartes===
René Descartes endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.

===Leibniz===
In early work, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his monadology he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.

===Moses Mendelssohn===
Moses Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Phaedon&quot; is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue &quot;Phaedo&quot;, in which Socrates argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.

==Ethics==
The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include persistent vegetative states, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, social and economic disparities created by longevity, and survival of the heat death of the universe.

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in the myth of Tithonus, or in Mary Shelley&#x27;s short story &quot;The Mortal Immortal&quot;, where the protagonist lives to witness everyone he cares about die around him. For additional examples in fiction, see Immortality in fiction.

Kagan (2012) argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan&#x27;s argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not:
* If our characters remain basically the same – that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now – then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious.
* If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed – e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures – then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them.
Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the world&#x27;s social structures. Sociologists argue that human beings&#x27; awareness of their own shapes their behavior. With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global demographic shift of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates. The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

Sociology has a growing body of literature on the sociology of immortality, which details the different attempts at reaching immortality (whether actual or symbolic) and their prominence in the 21st century. These attempts include renewed attention to the dead in the West, practices of online memorialization, and biomedical attempts to increase longevity. These attempts at reaching immortality and their effects in societal structures have led some to argue that we are becoming a &quot;Postmortal Society&quot;. Foreseen changes to societies derived from the pursuit of immortality would encompass societal paradigms and worldviews, as well as the institutional landscape. Similarly, different forms of reaching immortality might entail a significant reconfiguration of societies, from becoming more technologically oriented to becoming more aligned with nature.

Immortality would increase population growth, bringing with it many consequences as for example the impact of population growth on the environment and planetary boundaries.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable, there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.

Some scholars critique the increasing support for immortality projects. Panagiotis Pentaris speculates that defeating ageing as the cause of death comes with a cost: &quot;heightened stratification of humans in society and a wider gap between social classes&quot;. Others suggest that other immortality projects like transhumanist digital immortality, radical life extension and cryonics are part of the capitalist fabric of exploitation and control, which aims to extend privileged lives of the economic elite. In this sense, immortality could become a political-economic battleground for the twenty-first century between the haves and have-nots.

==Symbols==
There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The ankh is an Egyptian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the gods and pharaohs, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The Möbius strip in the shape of a trefoil knot is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the Ouroboros, the Chinese fungus of longevity, the &quot;ten&quot; kanji, the phoenix, the peacock in Christianity, and the colors amaranth (in Western culture) and peach (in Chinese culture).

<text>Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport (GMIA, ) or Moncton/Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport is located in the city of Dieppe east northeast of downtown Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. Originally named Greater Moncton International Airport, the airport was renamed in 2016, in honour of former Governor General Roméo LeBlanc.

The GMIA handled 674,406 passengers and 122,308 aircraft movements in 2019.

GMIA covers a total land area of 760 hectares (1,878 acres) of airport property.

Designated as an international airport by Transport Canada, it is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport currently can handle aircraft with up to 300 passengers, although planes as large as the 580 passenger Boeing 747 have been handled.

GMIA is home to the Moncton Flight College, the largest flight college in Canada.

== History ==
On January 11, 1928, the first scheduled air flight out of the Greater Moncton area took place. This flight was carrying mail and passengers to the Magdalen Islands. Two sites were considered for the first air strip. Leger&#x27;s Corner was chosen however because of more favourable landing conditions. Part of this land was donated by Simon B. LeBlanc of Leger&#x27;s Corner, a developer, land owner and owner of the LeBlanc general store and post office located on the south corner of the now named streets of Acadie Avenue and Champlain Street.

In 1929, a local private company bought the land at Léger&#x27;s Corner airstrip and through the years two runways were constructed as well as structures for aircraft maintenance. It was also in 1929 that the Moncton Aero Club was founded, as was the International Airways Flying School. These later became the Moncton Flight College, one of the pre-eminent flight schools in Canada. Also in the same year, the airport expanded its air mail service to include Prince Edward Island and Montreal.

In 1936, Transport Canada and the local government discussed the possibility of the construction of an airport suitable for trans-Canadian routes. The Léger&#x27;s Corner site was unsuitable for expansion and instead they chose a site in nearby Lakeburn as the new site for the airport. A paved runway and two additional dirt landing strips were constructed.

In March 1940, the Department of National Defence opened a No. 8 Service Flying Training School(SFTF) at the newly developed RCAF Station Moncton under the auspices of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The school trained war pilots for the Commonwealth nations. A new hangar was also constructed at the airport during the war to serve as a repair and maintenance facility.

During the 1940s, civilian air services expanded and became available serving Montreal, Halifax, Charlottetown, Sydney, Saint John, Fredericton and Newfoundland. The hangar of Trans-Canada Airlines (later Air Canada), became the location for the first air terminal. In 1952, a larger hangar was converted into a modern air terminal but it was very shortly thereafter destroyed by fire. In 1953, a replacement air terminal was constructed.

Further expansion in 1964 brought many changes to the airport including an air traffic control tower and a new operations building. In 1976, the air terminal was again expanded.

Throughout the years, many renovations have been made to the air terminal building, including in 1998–99, an international arrivals area to suit the needs of 1999&#x27;s eighth Sommet de la Francophonie. A large landing apron was constructed at the same time at the opposite side of the airport in a location which would later become the site of the new international airport terminal. This landing apron would be pressed into service in a dramatic manner on September 11, 2001, when airspace over North America was shut down following the World Trade Center attacks. A dozen flights with over 2,000 passengers were diverted to the Greater Moncton Airport.
In May 2001, the new, state-of-the-art international air terminal was completed and officially opened in 2002 by Queen Elizabeth II. The Greater Moncton International Airport is the busiest airport in New Brunswick, serving more than 552,629 passengers per year.

In May 2006, Continental Airlines&#x27; subsidiary Continental Express began Moncton&#x27;s only nonstop service to the United States with once-daily (sometimes twice daily) flights to Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, near New York City. However, the service between Moncton and Newark was ended on September 19, 2014.

FedEx Express, TC Ventus Freight and Purolator Courier also have large hangars at the airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On February 11, 1963, a Curtiss C-46E Commando operated by Maritime Central Airways was destroyed in a hangar fire at the airport.
* On March 24, 2010, a Boeing 727 operated by Cargojet Airways was damaged after its crew was unable to stop on the available landing distance. The aircraft overran the runway and became stuck in deep mud off the end of the runway. None of the crewmembers onboard were injured and the aircraft received minor damage. Investigators found that the presence of standing water on the runway caused the aircraft to hydroplane, causing a loss of directional control and braking ability, significantly increasing the required stopping distance. The reduction of reverse thrust following touchdown to realign with the runway centreline, in accordance with the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended practice, increased the aircraft&#x27;s required stopping distance. The crew&#x27;s decision to fly the instrument approach by hand instead of monitoring an autopilot-coupled approach likely contributed to the aircraft&#x27;s higher than required airspeed that was maintained until touchdown. The combination of delayed touchdown , a higher-than-required touchdown speed, and standing water on the runway prevented the aircraft from stopping within the available landing distance.
* On October 14, 2016, a Beechcraft 1900D operated by Exploits Valley Air Services suffered a hard landing following a steep flare. Though the crew did not notice any damage on their postflight walkaround, the operator&#x27;s maintenance personnel subsequently discovered that the rear tail strakes had suffered damage from a previous landing. An investigation into the incident is ongoing.

On November 20, 2015, Del Castillo launched a new brand of tequila named &quot;Honor del Castillo&quot; in association with the Vivanco Family. She serves as the spokesperson for the brand. Del Castillo has also appeared in advertising campaigns for L&#x27;Oréal and Ford.

In 2012, Del Castillo starred in the Mexican film &quot;&quot;, which centers around the assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The following year, she starred in the American prison drama film &quot;K-11&quot;. In later years, Del Castillo appeared in many American movies, including playing Idris Elba&#x27;s ex in the 2014 thriller &quot;No Good Deed&quot;, Antonio Banderas&#x27; wife in the disaster-survival drama &quot;The 33&quot;, &quot;All About Nina&quot; (2018), &quot;El Chicano&quot; (2019), and &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot; (2020). In 2017, she went to star in the Netflix political thriller series, &quot;Ingobernable&quot; playing the fictional First Lady of Mexico, Emilia Urquiza. The second season premiered in 2018.

In 2019, del Castillo made her off-Broadway debut in the Audible Theater production of Isaac Gomez&#x27;s play &quot;The Way She Spoke&quot;. The performance earned her Drama Desk, Drama League, and Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Play nominations, making her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for three theatre awards in New York.

In 2022, del Castillo starred in the Peacock comedy-drama series, &quot;&#x27;Til Jail Do Us Part&quot;. She is set to star and produce &quot;Volver a caer&quot;, a six-part miniseries that a modern take in Spanish on Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. In 2024 she joined the cast of Fox series &quot;The Cleaning Lady&quot;. In 2024, del Castillo was cast as Mexican singer Chavela Vargas in the miniseries &quot;Chavela&quot;. She also was cast in the comedy film &quot;The Biggest Fan&quot; for Netflix playing the role of disgraced actress Lana Cruz.

==Personal life==
One of del Castillo&#x27;s first known romantic relations was with Emilio Azcárraga Jean, son of media mogul Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, and now CEO of the largest mass media company in Latin America, the Televisa Group. On February 3, 2001, she married football player Luis García. The marriage was dissolved on September 1, 2004. In August 2009, del Castillo married Aarón Díaz in a Las Vegas ceremony. On July 26, 2011, it was announced that Kate and Díaz were separating. Del Castillo was briefly romantically connected with Sean Penn from 2015 to 2016, although the actor&#x27;s representatives contest this. It has been frequently asserted in the media that del Castillo was romantically involved with Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, allegations that the actress vehemently denies.

On August 22, 2005, it was reported by the LAPD that del Castillo&#x27;s new house in Los Angeles had been broken into by thieves, who took some jewelry from the actress. Del Castillo was in Los Angeles filming &quot;Bordertown&quot;, a film about the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, when the burglary occurred. A frequent activist for a variety of causes, she posed in a 2012 PETA ad campaign encouraging pet owners to &quot;fiercely protect&quot; their dogs and cats by keeping them indoors. She became a citizen of the United States in September 2015 and resides in Los Angeles.

===Relationship with El Chapo===
On January 9, 2012, del Castillo publicly posted an essay on Twitter (using Twextra) discussing social issues in Mexico that included controversial statements directed towards Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán, the infamous head of the Sinaloa Cartel. The essay included requests to Mr. Guzmán to &quot;deal with love, with good things&quot; and to &quot;[begin to] traffic in love.&quot; The most controversial portion of the essay stated: &quot;Today I believe more in Chapo Guzmán [than in] the government that hides painful truths from me, that hides the cure for cancer, AIDS, etc., for their own benefit and wealth.&quot;
Unbeknownst to del Castillo, Guzmán was a longtime fan who harbored romantic feelings for her. Authorities found DVDs of &quot;La Reina del Sur&quot; at the safe house stormed during Guzmán&#x27;s initial capture. Del Castillo was contacted by Guzmán&#x27;s lawyer to discuss producing a biographical film about Guzmán in 2014. As a result of the meetings, she obtained the rights to his life and was unknowingly placed under CISEN surveillance. Communication increased following Guzmán&#x27;s escape from prison in July 2015. She received a cell phone and the code names &quot;Hermosa&quot; and &quot;Dama&quot; from Guzmán. She brokered an interview between American actor Sean Penn and Guzmán in October 2015, shortly before Mexican Marines recaptured him (del Castillo claims in her documentary for Netflix that she did not know Penn intended to interview the drug lord during the meeting). CISEN later released photographs of del Castillo at the meetings with Guzmán&#x27;s lawyer and of the arrival of the actress and Penn to Mexico.

====Aftermath====
Sean Penn and Del Castillo&#x27;s actions remain under investigation by the Attorney General of Mexico. She was subpoenaed on January 18, 2016, and was to testify before the public prosecutor at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles. Del Castillo was originally under investigation for money laundering in relation to the planned movie about Guzmán and her tequila brand &quot;Honor del Castillo&quot;. The investigation was suspended in 2017 as there was no evidence that proved that Guzmán ever paid del Castillo any money.

On February 5, 2016, a Mexican judge granted del Castillo&#x27;s petition for an injunction against any arrest related to the federal investigation into her ties with Joaquín Guzmán. The Mexican Attorney General issued a detain-and-interrogate order on del Castillo; however, that would only become effective if del Castillo set foot on Mexican soil. That order was issued after she did not heed a request to voluntarily appear before Mexican prosecutors.

Kate del Castillo did not return to Mexico until December 2018 and therefore since the injunction was issued in 2016 and 2017 filming locations for &quot;Ingobernable&quot; were changed to San Diego to accommodate restrictions on her travel.

&quot;The Day I Met El Chapo: The Kate del Castillo Story&quot; premiered in 2017 on Netflix, based on the events surrounding del Castillo&#x27;s communications with El Chapo.

<doc id="177059" wikidata="Q2633232" url="?curid=177059" title="Dinaric race">
<text>The Dinaric race, also known as the Adriatic race, were terms used by certain physical anthropologists in the early to mid-20th century to describe the perceived predominant phenotype of the contemporary ethnic groups of southeast Europe. According to the discredited theories of physical anthropologist Carleton Coon, the Dinaric race was most commonly found among the populations in the Balkans and Carpathians, such as Montenegrins, Serbs, Bosniaks, Croats, Ghegs, Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians, Western Ukrainians, and Southern Poles. Additionally, in Northern Europe, the South Germans were also identified as having Dinaric characteristics.

==History==
The notion of a Dinaric race originated with racial anthropologist Joseph Deniker in the late 19th century, but became most closely associated with the writings of Carleton S. Coon and Nazi eugenicist Hans F. K. Günther. The term was derived from the Dinaric Alps (the western part of Southeastern Europe) which was supposed to be the principal habitat of the race. 

==Origin and distribution==
Several theories were advanced regarding the genesis of the Dinaric race. Günther argued that the Dinaric race shared a common origin with the Hither Asiatic (Near Eastern) race in the Caucasus region. They left the Caucasus region and underwent selective pressure, with the Dinaric race eventually possessing mental traits similar to the Nordic race. Jan Czekanowski believed that the Dinaric race arose from admixture between the Nordic and Armenoid race.

Coon also argued, however, in &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; (1962), that the Dinaric and some other categories &quot;are not races but simply the visible expressions of the genetic variability of the intermarrying groups to which they belong.&quot;

He referred to the creation of this distinctive phenotype from the mixing of earlier separate groups as &quot;dinaricisation&quot;. In his view Dinarics were a specific type that arose from ancient mixes of the Mediterranean race and Alpine race.

According to the Dinaric model, Dinarics were to be found mainly in the mountainous areas of southeastern Europe: Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria, part of northwestern Bulgaria, and northwestern Northern Macedonia. Northern and eastern Italy was considered mostly a Dinaric area as well as western Greece, Romania, Moldova, western Ukraine, southeastern German-speaking areas, and parts of southeastern France.

==&quot;Noric&quot; subtype==

The Noric race () was a racial category proposed by the anthropologist Victor Lebzelter. The &quot;Noric race&quot; was supposed to be a sub-type of the Dinaric race more Nordic in appearance than standard Dinaric peoples. The term derived from Noricum, a province of the Roman Empire roughly equivalent to southern Austria and northern Slovenia.

<doc id="177072" wikidata="Q1921755" url="?curid=177072" title="Merit (Christianity)">
<text>In Christian theology, merit (Latin: &quot;meritum&quot;) accrues when a believer&#x27;s good work incurs &quot;a future reward from a graceful God&quot;. The role of human merit in Christian life has been a point of dispute between Catholics and Protestants. 

Both Catholics and Lutherans affirm the common Christian belief that a person&#x27;s justification is not determined by that person&#x27;s merit: &quot;By grace alone, in faith in Christ&#x27;s saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works&quot;. 

The Catholic Church further teaches that &quot;When Catholics affirm the &#x27;meritorious&#x27; character of good works, they wish to say that, according to the biblical witness, a reward in heaven is promised to these works. Their intention is to emphasize the responsibility of persons for their actions, not to contest the character of those works as gifts, or far less to deny that justification always remains the unmerited gift of grace&quot;. The idea of merit underpins many obvious Catholic doctrines: prayers for the dead, indulgences, the Church&#x27;s treasury of merit, and the intercession of saints.

Protestant and Reformed doctrine has not developed a positive theology of human merit, except for the merit of Christ that humans receive through divine grace, and also generally dismisses the idea that charitable good works by Christians have any intrinsic merit.

Merit bears resemblance to Thawab in Islam.

== Catholicism ==
In Catholic theology, merit is a property of a good work which entitles the doer to receive a reward: it is a &quot;salutary act&quot; (i.e., &quot;Human action that is performed under the influence of grace and that positively leads a person to a heavenly destiny&quot;) to which God, in whose service the work is done, in consequence of his infallible promise may give a reward (&quot;prœmium&quot;, &quot;merces&quot;). It is treasure &quot;laid up in heaven&quot;. Just as God is just to punish demerits, he is just to reward merits.

The Church has a figurative communal Treasury of Merit. Merit is transferable: it increases by sharing it: a person with merit who prays or acts effectively with that merit increases their own merit and transfers merit to the person prayer for or interacted with. This transferability is part of the Catholic doctrine of the Communion of Saints, which entails that salvation is more than an individual fiduciary arrangement but has communal involvement. It also underlies the doctrines of indulgences, prayers for the dead and the intercession of saints.

Prayer need not be made by someone who has merited any reward to be effective, nor is there any aspect of extortion or transaction: God also hears anyone &quot;who prays appeals solely to the goodness, love, and liberality of God for the fulfilment of his desires, without throwing the weight of his own merits into the scale...&quot; (known theologically as the &quot;effect of impetration&quot; &quot;effectus impetratorius&quot;)

===Nature of merit===
Merit exists only in works that are positively good. 

In Christian theology, humans possesses nothing of their own; all that they have and all that they do is a gift of God, and, since God is infinitely self-sufficient, there is no advantage or benefit which a human can by their services confer upon God. Hence on the part of God there can only be question of a gratuitous promise of reward for certain good works. For such works he owes the promised reward, not in justice or equity, but because he has freely bound himself, i.e., because of his own attributes of veracity and fidelity. 

====Kinds of merit; justice and grace====
Many Catholic Scholastic theologians attempted to explain merit by distinguished two kinds:

* Congruous merit (&quot;meritum inadœquatum sive de congruo&quot;) or quasi-merit is, according to historian Thomas P. Scheck, &quot;God&#x27;s loving promise to reward human effort, even that carried out by a man outside the state of grace.&quot;
** Congruous merit attracts a reward only on the ground of fairness or appropriateness not obligation. 
** The reward for congruous merit is not salvation, but may be supernatural grace, which may lead to justification and salvation. &quot;The doors of divine mercy are closed against none who sincerely ask for mercy.&quot; 
** Whenever &quot;merit&quot; is mentioned as preceding grace, it is congruous merit only.

* Condign merit (&quot;meritum adœquatum sive de condigno&quot;) or merit in the strict sense of the word is, according to Scheck, &quot;God&#x27;s &quot;obligation&quot; to reward man&#x27;s efforts.&quot;
** Outside an infusion of grace, humans have no ability to oblige God.
** However, someone who has been adopted by God is granted rights: &quot;If sons, heirs also&quot; (Rom 8:17).
** Condign merit supposes an equality between service and return; it is measured by commutative justice (&quot;justitia commutativa&quot;), and thus gives a real claim to a reward. 

Philosopher Richard Cross notes &quot;Underlying it is the claim that the reward for condign merit is everlasting life, and that the reward for congruous merit is the gift of sanctifying grace ... &quot;

This early-scholastic distinction and terminology, which developed in the controversies with the Pelagians and Semipelagians, were again emphasized by Johann Eck, the famous adversary of Martin Luther (cf. Greying, &quot;Joh. Eck als junger Gelehrter,&quot; Münster, 1906, pp. 153 sqq.). The essential difference between meritum de condigno and &quot;meritum de congruo&quot; is based on the fact that, besides those works which claim a remuneration under pain of violating strict justice (as in contracts between employer and employee, in buying and selling, etc.), there are also other meritorious works which at most are entitled to reward or honour for reasons of equity (&quot;ex œquitate&quot;) or mere distributive justice (&quot;ex iustitia distributiva&quot;), as in the case of gratuities and military decorations. From an ethical point of view the difference practically amounts to this that, if the reward due to condign merit be withheld, there is a violation of right and justice and the consequent obligation in conscience to make restitution, while, in the case of congruous merit, to withhold the reward involves no violation of right and no obligation to restore, it being merely an offence against what is fitting or a matter of personal discrimination (&quot;acceptio personarum&quot;). Hence the reward of congruous merit always depends in great measure on the kindness and liberality of the giver, though not purely and simply on his good will.

The relation between merit and reward furnishes the intrinsic reason why in the matter of service and its remuneration, the guiding norm can be only the virtue of justice, and not disinterested kindness or pure mercy; for it would destroy the very notion of reward to conceive of it as a free gift of bounty (cf. Rom., xi, 6). 

If, however, &quot;salutary acts&quot; can in virtue of divine justice give the right to an eternal reward, this is possible only because they themselves have their root in gratuitous grace, and consequently are of their very nature dependent ultimately on grace, as the Council of Trent emphatically declares (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in Denzinger, 10th ed., Freiburg, 1908, n. 810): &quot;the Lord ... whose bounty towards all men is so great, that He will have the things, which are His own gifts, be their merits.&quot;

Another term used is supererogatory merit, which is merit given for doing above what a Christian is required.

===Conditions of merit===

In Catholic teaching, for all true merit, there are seven conditions, of which four regard the meritorious work (&quot;viz&quot;. a work must be morally good, morally free, done with the assistance of actual grace, and inspired by a supernatural motive), two regard the agent who merits (&quot;viz&quot;. they must be in the state of pilgrimage and in the state of grace), and one regards God who rewards.

# In order to be meritorious, a work must be morally good.
# As to the second requisite, i. e., moral liberty, it is clear from ethics that actions, due to external force or internal compulsion, can deserve neither reward nor punishment. It is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence that no one shall be punished for a misdeed done without free will; similarly, a good work can only then be meritorious and deserving of reward when it proceeds from a free determination of the will. This is the teaching of Christ (Matt., xix, 21): &quot;If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.&quot;
# The necessity of the third condition, i. e., of the influence of actual grace, is clear from the fact that every act meriting heaven must evidently be supernatural just as heaven itself is supernatural, and that consequently it cannot be performed without the help of prevenient and assisting grace, which is necessary even for the just. The strictly supernatural destiny of the Beatific Vision, for which the Christian must strive, necessitates ways and means which lie altogether beyond what is purely natural (see Grace).
# Finally, a supernatural motive is required because good works must be supernatural, not only as regards their object and circumstances, but also as regards the end for which they are performed (ex fine). But, in assigning the necessary qualities of this motive, theologians differ widely. While some require the motive of faith (&quot;motivum fidei&quot;) in order to have merit, others demand in addition the motive of charity (&quot;motivum caritatis&quot;), and thus, by rendering the conditions more difficult, considerably restrict the extent of meritorious works (as distinguished from merely good works). Others again set down as the only condition of merit that the good work of the just man or woman, who already has habitual faith and charity, be in conformity with the Divine law, and require no other special motive.
# The agent who merits must both be in the state of pilgrimage (&quot;status viœ&quot;). By the state of pilgrimage is to be understood our earthly life; death as a natural (although not an essentially necessary) limit, closes the time of meriting. The time of sowing is confined to this life; the reaping is reserved for the next, when no man or woman will be able to sow either wheat or cockle. The opinion proposed by a few theologians (Hirscher, Schell), that for certain classes of men there may still be a possibility of conversion after death, is contrary to the revealed truth that the particular judgment (&quot;judicium particulare&quot;) determines instantly and definitively whether the future is to be one of eternal happiness or of eternal misery (cf. Kleutgen, &quot;Theologie der Vorzeit&quot;, II, 2nd ed., Münster, 1872, pp. 427 sqq.). Baptized children, who die before attaining the age of reason, are admitted to heaven without merits on the sole title of inheritance (&quot;titulus hœreditatis&quot;); in the case of adults, however, there is the additional title of reward (&quot;titulus mercedis&quot;), and for that reason they will enjoy a greater measure of eternal happiness.
# In addition to the state of pilgrimage, the state of grace (&quot;status gratiœ&quot;) (i. e., the possession of sanctifying grace) is required for meriting, because only the just can be &quot;sons of God&quot; and &quot;heirs of heaven&quot; (cf. Rom., viii, 17). In the parable of the vine Christ expressly declares the &quot;abiding in him&quot; a necessary condition for &quot;bearing fruit&quot;: &quot;He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit&quot; (John, xv, 5); and this constant union with Christ is effected only by sanctifying grace. In opposition to Vasquez, most theologians are of opinion that one who is holier will gain greater merit for a given work than one who is less holy, although the latter perform the same work under exactly the same circumstances and in the same way. The reason is that a higher degree of grace enhances the godlike dignity of the agent, and this dignity increases the value of the merit.
# Merit requires on the part of God that he accept (&quot;in actu secundo&quot;) the good work as meritorious, even though the work in itself (&quot;in actu primo&quot;) and previous to its acceptance by God, be already truly meritorious. Theologians, however, are not agreed as to the necessity of this condition. The Scotists hold that the entire condignity of the good work rests exclusively on the gratuitous promise of God and his free acceptance, without which even the most heroic act is devoid of merit, and with which even mere naturally good works may become meritorious.

===Church teaching===
Apart from earlier dogmatic declarations given in the Second Synod of Orange of 529 and in the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 (see Denzinger, 191, 430), the Council of Trent upheld the traditional doctrine of merit by insisting that life everlasting is both a grace and a reward (Sess. VI, cap. xvi, in Denzinger, n. 809). It condemned as heretical Luther&#x27;s doctrine of the sinfulness of good works (Sess. VI, can. xxv), and declared as a dogma that the just, in return for their good works done in God through the merits of Jesus, should expect an eternal reward (loc. cit., can. xxvi).

==Protestant==
=== Lutheranism ===
In the Latin version of his &quot;Assertion of Article Thirty Six&quot; (1521) Martin Luther denied the category of congruous merit, writing that Paul &quot;wanted it to be understood that everything we are and do by our nature merits wrath and not at all grace.&quot;

In his 1532 &quot;Commentary on the Sermon of the Mount&quot;, he noted that while the reward one gains from condign merit is much greater than that of congruent merit, the sort of good works said to attain each type of merit is similar. Luther thought it did not make sense that the two types of merit could be gained by similar actions when the benefit of condign merit is so much greater than the benefit of congruent merit.

=== Reformed ===
According to the doctrine of Calvin (Instit., III, ii, 4) good works are &quot;impurities and defilement&quot; (inquinamenta et sordes), but God covers their innate hideousness with the cloak of the merits of Christ, and imputes them to the predestined as good works in order that he may requite them not with life eternal, but at most with a temporal reward.

<text>Lucas Tomás Muñiz Ramírez (4 February 1922 – 15 January 2009), better known as Tommy Muñiz, was a Puerto Rican comedy and drama actor, media producer, businessman and network owner. He is considered to be one of the pioneering figures of the television business in Puerto Rico. Although Muñíz was born in Ponce, he was raised in the capital city of San Juan where he studied. Muñíz developed an interest in the entertainment business thanks to his father Tomas and to his uncle and godfather Félix Muñíz, who also produced radio programs. Muñiz was a successful radio producer in Puerto Rico during the mid- to late 1940s. Five of his radio programs -comedies for which he was often the scriptwriter, sometimes with the assistance of Sylvia Rexach- would consistently earn a strong following, as judged by the attendance to personal presentations of the artists featured in them. He was responsible for introducing more than a dozen new artists to the media. He bought Radio Luz 1600 (WLUZ-AM) a radio station in Bayamón, Puerto Rico During the first years of commercial television in Puerto Rico, and after a brief period during which revenues from his radio productions trickled down, Muñiz opted to start producing television programs as well. During the 1940s, when radios where ubiquitous in Puerto Rican households, Muñiz&#x27;s radio scripts then became increasingly successful, beginning with &quot;El colegio de la alegría&quot;, in which he performed along José Miguel Agrelot. This was followed by &quot;La familia Pérez&quot;, &quot;Adelita, la secretaria&quot;, &quot;Gloria y Miguel&quot; and &quot;¡Qué sirvienta!&quot;, all of which featured him in some function. He was producer or executive producer for dozens of television programs and specials between 1955 and 1995. At one time in the early 1960s, five programs produced by Muñiz were in the top five television rankings in local audience surveys. One of the programs even spawned a 1967 film, &quot;La Criada Malcriada&quot;, starring Velda González, Shorty Castro and Muñiz, among others. He is credited for producing most of José Miguel Agrelot&#x27;s television programs during his career. He is also credited with discovering and promoting other television artists as well, particularly Otilio Warrington. In the 1970s he was the owner of WRIK-TV Channel 7 in Ponce.

In the late 1970s, Muñiz revived a comedy format that he had successfully used in three previous radio and television productions, the family sitcom. He produced and acted in a comedy series named &quot;Los García&quot; together with his real-life son Rafo Muñiz, and with longtime friend Gladys Rodríguez. Also starring were William Gracia as Pepín, Gina Beveraggi as Gini, Edgardo Rubio as Junito, Manela Bustamante as Doña Tony, Emma Rosa Vincenty as Doňa Cayetana, and a number of additional actors in various roles. The show became the most successful television show in Puerto Rican history, having a mostly successful six-year run and staying for three of those years at the top of local television ratings. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Muñiz was the owner of a radio station (Radio Luz WLUZ) and a television channel (Teleluz). Both were named after his wife, Luz María. In 1988, he became one of the largest minority owners of another channel, TeleOnce. In 1989, he and Rodríguez reunited to act in the movie &quot;Lo que le Pasó a Santiago&quot;, directed by Jacobo Morales, a longtime friend of Muñíz. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film becoming the first and only Puerto Rican film so far to do so. As a consequence of his part in &quot;Lo que le Pasó a Santiago&quot;, Muñiz was selected to act in the 1991 television comedy film &quot;Crazy From The Heart&quot;, directed by Thomas Schlamme and featuring Christine Lahti and Rubén Blades. In the movie, Muñiz played Blades&#x27; father, a Mexican peasant with a proclivity for setting billboards on fire as a protest. The movie was eventually broadcast by Turner Network Television (TNT).

==Early years==
Muñiz Ramírez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico on 4 February 1922, to Don Tomás Muñíz Souffront and Monserrate &quot;Nena&quot; Ramírez. His father, Don Tomás, was a marketing executive who later became the administrator (and eventual owner) of various radio stations, as well as a radio producer. Muñiz was born during the 1920s, the same decade when radio first arrived to Puerto Rico, to a household of several siblings including Carmen, Marjorie, Nellie, Andy, Néstor and Nilza. Early in his life, Muñiz suffered from rickets. Despite this, he gained interest in eventually becoming a race jockey. His father Tómas Muñiz, Sr. had pursued several venues of substainance including real estate sales, while his mother Nena was sickly. He was an insecure child, which was reflected in issues at schools and a number of expulsions. Witnessing this, his uncle Félix Muñiz decided to take him to the West Indies Advertising Company (WIAC) where he worked. The institution would become a radio station in 1942, and when his uncle died, His father Tómas was selected to fill the vacancy. Since the age of 12, Muñiz would be the tasked with several functions within WIAC. Under José A. Torres Martinó, he learned to write scripts and wrote &quot;Francisquito Rosales y Miel de Aveja&quot; along his mentor. In this, he performed as the effeminate titular character. In 1939, Muñiz met Luz María García de la Noceda while coursing high school. During the following five years he approached her, eventually convincing her after appearing at her house with a gift. They married in 1944, living in poverty for some time. Afterwards, Muñiz,Sr. loaned a large house from the owners of WIAC which became known as &quot;La Casona&quot;.

He started by being the messenger of the marketing firm where his father and uncle used to work, and eventually became a radio scriptwriter. Muñiz sold his car, a 1932 red Ford, and acquired an Underwood typewriter in which he wrote his scripts. Meanwhile, he survived by raising chickens for his parents in law which served to produce eggs to sell and would also be sold themselves. The couple moved to Santa Rita in Río Piedras and had three children, Tómad Gerardo, Félix Antonio and Mario Andrés. Muñiz loaned a building at Santurce, which would serve as his workplace, the first local independent production entity known as Producciones Tommy Muñiz. The services provided grew to include representation and the hosting of activities by his artists, but focused on his radio productions. Among them was Sylvia Rexach, who also collaborated in writing scripts. Jacobo Morales would be among the public at WAPA Radio where &quot;La familia Pérez&quot; was recorded, since he knew a member of the cast. The live performance of the radio scripts was popular and depending the nature of the work, required selective the public. However, his shows would be concurrent with Diplo, usually falling second to them. Muñoz would recruit Paquito Cordero to serve as Andy Tenorio in &quot;Las adventuras de Andy Tenorio&quot;, a show that was a parody of the Archie comics and included a Diplo impersonator. The show would give birth to the Yoyo Boing character that defined the career of his interpreter, Luis Antonio Rivera. At the moment, Puerto Rican society was being forced to adapt to an industrial movement that replaced the agrarian economy that prevailed during the early years of American colonialism. It was, however, also a time of political unrest caused by the Cold War, the Korean War and the adoption of the Commonwealth and the reaction that the Nationalist Party had to it. This led to a focus in the local middle class, from which Muñiz drew inspiration in his scripts. He created characters based on the average working class and placed them in every day settings. The first example was Violeta Flores, a representation of the jíbaros that were leaving the rural areas to settle in urban zones amidst the change and which was featured in a radio show in which he played a man named Tadeo.

==Television producer==
===Variety shows and sitcoms===
Muñiz was concerned with the arrival of the new medium, assuming it would seriously hit radio and not expecting to have a role in it. The medium was received with some skepticism fueled by reports of losses abroad, but had a positive reception which eventually convinced most of its doubters. Radio suffered an economic decline when most of its established figures left to work television and the sponsors followed them. His work soon lost its audience, with &quot;La familia Pérez&quot; at risk of disappearing and the radio stations in turmoil over the loss of advertisement. The family had moved to Floral Park near his parents, while he was increasingly considering how to deal with his future in other ways. While radio stations loaned their facilities for other purposes to survive, Muñiz decided to open a pet shop named Zoo Pet Shop. On April 19, 1955, the couple had its fifth child, Manuel Alberto. That same day, Muñiz received a call from WKAQ. Having practiced for the call in case that it came, he took the offer. His father had advised him to avoid appearing overly enthusiastic in his response in order to avoid appearing desperate. Producciones Tommy Muñiz was struggling Cordero and Agrelot were already involved in television shows &quot;Mímicas del Monte&quot;, &quot;Mapy y Papi&quot; and &quot;Capitán Colgate&quot;. Muñiz began working as a script writer for &quot;Casino Tropical&quot;, a comedy segment of the half-hour &quot;El show de shows&quot;. Despite the family still living in poverty and he still selling animals for a living, Producciones Tommy Muñiz moved to Miramar in the large property that had been loaned by his parents years before, La Casona. While attending the pet shop, he received a call from WKAQ-TV to replace Agrelot at &quot;Capitán Colgate&quot;, leaving the business in charge of his sister. Wondering what to create, Muñiz examined WKAQ&#x27;s programming, consulted his father and summoned his co-workers to La Casona. Two shows where then created, a television adaptation of &quot;El colegio de la alegría&quot; and &quot;A reirse con Ola&quot;, which aired in a prime time slot on Wednesdays and was hosted by Yoyo Boing and Cordero. WAPA-TV responded by creating &quot;Una hora conmigo&quot; hosted by Myrta Silva.
Conducted by Mario Pabón, &quot;A reirse con Ola&quot; peaked in the rating charts, which earned Muñiz personal congratulations from Ángel Ramos. It also won the recognition for &quot;Best Comedy Show&quot; and Yoyo Boing won &quot;Best Comedian&quot;, while also serving to propel figures such as Helga Avilés and Eddie Miró, while its music interludes served as the debut of Cortijo y su combo.

===Adapting radio IPs===
Agrelot returned to Puerto Rico during their peak and became the centerpiece of &quot;El colegio de la alegría&quot;, which had been recreated with him in mind. Muñiz had made several changes to &quot;El profesor Colgate&quot; to focus it on Agrelot&#x27;s forte, giving rise to this adaptation. Producciones Tommy Muñiz also traveled Puerto Rico and made live presentations in a number of places and fiestas patronales for additional revenue. During these tours, the group became acquainted with several food establishments and where involved in several mishaps during the weekends, eventually adopting the name of &quot;Caravana del Monte&quot; gaining patronage from the Del Monte brand. &quot;A reírse con Ola&quot; changed names several times, twice due to branding in the cases of &quot;A reírse con Fab&quot; and Diviértase con Fab and once to highlight its characters in &quot;A reírse con Yoyo&quot;. Muñiz, however, was annoyed by the involvement of the advertisers in his shows.
On August 1, 1955, Muñiz took over &quot;La taberna India&quot; after Rivero left the show. Américo Castellanos suggested to play the female character of Floripondia, a move that was considered in poor taste by the administration of WKAQ, but went ahead due to the producer&#x27;s insistence. With the cast completed by regulars from other Producciones Tommy Muñiz performers, the show became a hit.
A reimagined &quot;La familia Pérez&quot; named &quot;Hogar, dulce hogar&quot; replaced &quot;Mímicas del Monte&quot;, featuring the comedian debut of Shorty Castro and headlined by Muñiz and Luz María Font, who was recruited after casually stumbling upon the producer. The show climbed to the first spot in the ratings, remaining there for some time. During its peak, the script was modified to accommodate the pregnancy of Font, with the public responding strongly to the situation. Parallel to this, the couple had their first daughter, Luz Consuelo on October 18, 1957. However, two weeks later his mother died suddenly. Afterwards, the couple had its second daughter, Hilda María.
Despite local television introducing more foreign programming, Producciones Tommy Muñiz continued unabated producing &quot;Lotus lo divierte&quot; (his first for WAPA-TV), &quot;Garata deportiva&quot;, &quot;El chiste Camel&quot;, &quot;Telefiesta de la tarde&quot; and &quot;Reina por un día&quot; between 1956 and 1959. Initially supported by three advertisers, &quot;Telefiesta de la tarde&quot; included the participation of Rivera, Agrelot, Cordero, Castro and Miró among others. He produced programs for both major stations at once, which benefited programs like the latter two, which were able to dominate in ratings despite moving. During this time, Muñiz kept his programs relevant by pitching them to the other channel, as was the case with &quot;Hogar, dulce hogar&quot; which returned to WKAQ-TV. Ultimately, &quot;Telefiesta&quot; was the only program to survive this period. He also briefly produced &quot;Desafiando a los genios&quot; for the nascent WKBM. Despite the introduction of taping during the 1960s, Muñiz continued producing his shows live.

Shorty Castro was part of the entertainment in this business with Googie Santana and others. By 1963, Muñiz dominated the daytime ratings, but &quot;Desafiando a los genios&quot; remained his only show in the nighttime block, hosted by Agrelot, Castro and Osvaldo Seda as the titular &quot;geniuses&quot;. Muñiz then debuted a 15-minute segment known as &quot;La criada malcriada&quot; in &quot;Telefiesta de la tarde&quot; (with the help of his father on character design) with Velda González as the titular character Azucena, a rude maid, and Jacobo Morales and Agrelot in supporting roles. Aimed at the middle class and originally conceived as a nighttime show, a pilot was filmed at WKAQ but problems with the station&#x27;s protocol led to it being pitched to WAPA from its own studio. There, however, it was repurposed to avoid competing with the imported shows. During this time, his father also died, leaving him without his closest advisor in the business and personal confidant. Afterwards, Muñiz decided to leave La Casona behind and moved to Férnandez Juncos Avenue. With &quot;La criada malcriada&quot; becoming popular and Agrelot also hosting the comedy news segment &quot;Encabuya y vuelve y tira&quot;, &quot;Telefiesta en la tarde&quot; became the first daytime show to become a leader in ratings. The segment brought an increase in advertisers and despite Norma Candal taking over the role of maid as Petunia, its success continued and it lasted for 17 years. It also led to a spinoff, &quot;Criada a la orden&quot;, produced by González herself and which became the first comedy aired in color. Eventually, the show was renamed &quot;El show del mediodía&quot;.
In 1966, Efraín López Neris suggested a candid camera segment to Muñiz and Modestti. After being ignored, he filmed a pilot for the concept titled &quot;La cámara cómica&quot;. Muñiz was convinced and the show would become his latest to succeed at the ratings chart.
WAPA-TV&#x27;s &quot;Panchito Menéndez y su gran show del mediodía&quot; was the first hour-long noon show in local television. Tommy Muñiz produced the second and exploiting the lack of exclusivity, exported &quot;Telefiesta&quot; to WAPA-TV (while dominating the ratings with several shows based at WKAQ-TV) on December 29, 1958, to replace Menéndez. &quot;Hogar, dulce hogar&quot;, &quot;El colegio de la alegría&quot; and &quot;La taberna India&quot;, also completed similar moves.

===Telenovelas and strike, WRIK-TV===
Producciones Tommy Muñiz also began producing telenovelas, with &quot;Las almas no tienen color&quot; as its maiden project. This was followed by &quot;Historia de dos mujeres&quot;, &quot;Cuando los hijos condenan&quot;, &quot;Los Juanes&quot;, &quot;María del Mar&quot;, &quot;El silencio nos condena&quot;, &quot;Mami santa&quot;, &quot;Claudia y Virginia&quot; and &quot;Llanto para una mujer&quot;. Despite the latter facing issues with the increasingly successful telenovelas of WKAQ-TV, Muñiz went on to also produce &quot;Marta&quot; for WAPA-TV in 1973.
However, this production actor José Reymundí began a strike against Producciones Tommy Muñiz and in particular against its administrator Hérnan Nigaglioni, claiming that he had been left out of a local production to favor foreigners. Soon afterwards, he was joined by more people as APATE joined and people like Castro decided not to cross the protest lines, while others like Candal actively joined the protests. Morales in turn decided to quit on the air. Only Alida Arizmendi challenged the protests. WAPA-TV decided not to intervene and distanced itself from the issue. In the end, Muñiz granted the demands of the protestors, such as health coverage or six month contracts, but Reymundí was unable to benefit due to the cancellation of the production due to the strike. Producciones Tommy Muñiz was affected by it, with only productions like &quot;Esto no tiene nombre&quot; or &quot;Ja-ja, ji-ji, jo-jo con Agrelot&quot; surviving. Candal, Morales, Warrington, Carbia, Molina and García left to create Producciones Astra and joined Channel 7. This would only last for some years, since the company gained a reputation as supporting work syndicates and were avoided.
On September 21, 1976, Producciones Tommy Muñiz debuted &quot;Los García&quot;, a sitcom reflecting the increasingly changing dynamic of Puerto Rican families during the ongoing industrial surge. This marked the first time since the strike that a new production was rolled by the producer and also marked his return to the screen as an actor. It also featured his son, Rafo Muñiz, in a supporting role. Within months, the show reached the top place in the ratings.

When another foreign group purchased WAPA-TV, the new owners began implanting different moral standards that led to censoring some characters and modified the time slots. Unsatisfied with this, Producciones Tommy Muñiz moved his productions to Telecadena Pérez Perry. Muñiz then bought WRIK-TV, a small station but with good coverage, from United Artists on a $1.8 million offer. In order to establish the newly named Teleluz, he intended to dedicate it to sports and pursued the rights of transmission for the 1979 Pan American Games. However, governor Carlos Romero Barceló requested voiding the auction where WRIK-TV acquired the rights so that the event could air through WIPR-TV, noting that otherwise they would be cancelled. Muñiz was unsatisfied with the request and filed an injunction and lawsuit, which was won three years after the Games had been held. Considering it a bad investment, Nigaglioni refused to join Muñiz in the purchase of Rikavisión and both grew apart.
With the death of a Ralph Pérez Perry, the channel began experiencing administrative and economic issues culminating the move after seven months. Eventually, these combined with the inability of WAPA-TV&#x27;s new programming to compete with WKAQ-TV and led to a deal that was favorable for Muñiz&#x27;s return. However, as the owner of a channel he was not allowed to work as a broker in both places and Producciones Tommy Muñiz sold material that was already filmed to the station. In this space, Muñiz aired &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Encabuya... y vuelve y tira&quot; and &quot;El colegio de la alegría&quot;. The original plan for WRIK-TV was abandoned and a variety of genres were seen in its first shows, &quot;La cámara cómica&quot;, &quot;Esto sí tiene nombre&quot;, Cocina con Henry Corona&quot;, &#x27; &#x27;Parece increible&quot;, &quot;Festivalito&quot;, &quot;Musicalísimo&quot;, &quot;El show de Carlos Busquets&quot;, &quot;Con Sandra&quot; and &quot;El show de Walter Mercado&quot;. &quot;Parece increible&quot; later known as &quot;Haciendo historia&quot;, a novelty show first hosted by Muñiz and later by Agrelot and María Falcón, was a hit. A commentary show hosted by José Antonio &quot;El Profe&quot; Ortiz, was originally co-hosted by Mariano Artau and Carmen Jovet. Later, Jovet was moved to the news segment &quot;Cámara Siete&quot;. A morning segment, &quot;Despierta Puerto Rico&quot;, would later complete the news programming. &quot;Cámara Siete&quot; would gather a number of exclusives, including special programming surrounding the Falklands War and the arrival of Deborah Carthy-Deu after winning Miss Universe. His son, Pedro Muñiz, was in charge of administrative duties. Rafo Muñiz was in charge of promotions for the station and produced two shows, &quot;Los pupilos&quot; and &quot;Latino&quot;, later &quot;Son del Caribe&quot;, which introduced Héctor Marcano and Roberto Vigoreaux to television. After Channel 11 went bankrupt, Los Rayos Gamma moved to WRIK-TV, signaling the end of an estrangement with Morales. The group debuted on November 1, 1981.
The arrangement with WAPA-TV was ended in February 1981, when all of the productions were relocated to reinforce WRIK-TV, which had become the only local channel in Puerto Rican hands with the bankruptcy of Channel 11. A new noon show named &quot;Mediodía en el Siete&quot; was complemented by the arriving comedy &quot;Encabuya... y vuelve y tira&quot;, and introduced others such as &quot;El derecho de lavar&quot; which debuted the character of Epifanio. &quot;El show de Lourdes y Carlos&quot; was responsible for popularizing Lourdes Robles as a singer. Agrelot was placed in charge of the comedy &quot;Cosas del alcalde&quot;. Children&#x27;s programming was first in charge of Sandra Seiter, but later introduced &quot;Tamborito y Colorina&quot; and &quot;Chiquimundo&quot;, the latter of which marked the debut of José Vega as in shows directed towards that audience. With a loose concept &quot;Los siete del Siete&quot; would take over the prime time slot Thursdays, and be host by a number of local talents including Agrelot, Morales, Olivo, Avellanet, Jovet and Logroño. Later, this space would be taken by the trova-centered &quot;La feria del Siete&quot;. The channel also acquired exclusivity of the investigation that the Senate of Puerto Rico held on the Cerro Maravilla murders, which established a ratings record for the channel. The case took place in the mountain housing antennas that transmitted WKRIK&#x27;s programming and one of the technicians was a witness, in the ensuing coverage the image of Romero Barceló was linked to the controversy. All foreign programming was suspended, while the channel&#x27;s programming revolved around the event. The process extended for months and it brought political tension against those involved in the transmission leading to several bomb warnings being issued against the channel, while the Muñiz family was directly threatened along &quot;Profe&quot;.
In 1982, Muñiz sued MediaFax, the company responsible for registering television ratings, citing manipulation of the numbers. This eventually gained interest of the Senate, which launched its own investigation. However, the relation with advertisers was affected and Muñiz opted to sell the station in 1985 to avoid bankruptcy in exchange for the continuation of the original employees as part of an arrangement made by Pedro. The move ended the lawsuit, WKRIK-TV then became WSTE-TV and its commercial name became Súper Siete. The arrangement, however, limited Producciones Tommy Muñiz to the station until 1989.

===Later years===
Disappointed at the status of the industry and the proliferation of what he regarded as lowbrow comedy, Muñiz entered a semi-retirement and spent most of his days at Culebra. Eventually, Rafo approached him about a return to theatre with a play named &quot;Los muchachos de la alegría&quot;, which was accepted and Morales was brought in to direct and as part of the cast. Agrelot was initially considered to lead the cast, but his issues with scripted work led to the reconciliation of Muñiz and Cordero after two decades of estrangement. The play was a hit and moved from Bellas Artes to Teatro Tapia and then left San Juan to be shown at Mayagüez and Ponce, totaling over 30 shows. Following the last show, Morales approached Muñiz about entering the film industry as the titular character in &quot;Lo que le pasó a Santiago&quot;. Pedro Muñiz was brought aboard as producer. Muñiz also made his return to Puerto Rican television in August 1989, producing family sitcom &quot;El papá de mi papá&quot; and the comedy music show &quot;Carcajadas y algo más&quot; (along Rafo) for WAPA-TV, remaining invested in these projects for over a year. On February 14, 1990, the film became the first local project to be nominated to the Academy Awards, competing in the &quot;Best Foreign Film&quot; category. During the director&#x27;s dinner, his work as an actor was complimented by Gregory Peck. His performance in &quot;Lo que le pasó a Santiago&quot; led to the interest of TNT, which contracted him for the role of Tomás Ontiveros in &quot;Crazy from the Heart&quot; along Rubén Blades. During the filming of the film, the improvisation of a court scene gathered the favor of director Thomas Schlamme. The film debuted on August 19, 1991.

During the early 1990s, Muñiz was publicly critical of comedy shows that used war as a topic.
In February 1991, Muñiz returned to WAPA-TV and produced &quot;Los primeros&quot;, a compendium of his old shows with additional commentary that lasted for some months. He followed this with his first miniseries, &quot;Nadie lo va a saber&quot;, which aired during the second week of May 1991. With Expo 92 being held in Spain, he and Rafo produced a special called &quot;De tal palo tal astilla, Rafo y don Tommy en Sevilla&quot;. Two other specials, &quot;Puerto Rico y sus islas&quot; (about local culture and geography) and the compendium on popular culture &quot;Latitud 18.5&quot;, were also produced this year. A sequel to the first titled &quot;Las otras islas de Puerto Rico&quot;, a piece on the houses of historical Puerto Rican figures (&quot;La casa feliz&quot;) and a Christmas special (&quot;La Navidad con don Tommy&quot;) were aired the following year. Pedro became responsible for Producciones Tommy Muñiz.
When Malrite Communications sold channel 7, Muñiz (who still owned 20% of the stocks) filed a lawsuit due to not being informed of the move, winning it and ending his relationship with the station. On May 20, 1993, Muñiz returned to theatre in Rafo&#x27;s play &quot;En un beso la vida&quot;, performing along his son and Giselle Blondet.
In 1994, TeleOnce aired a special titled &quot;40 Kilates de Televisión&quot;, produced by Rafo Muñiz to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the medium, where he performed along his son. The following month, he hosted another special, &quot;¿A quién no le falta un tornillo?&quot;. A series of special revivals of &quot;Los García&quot; followed, with the first airing on August 28, 1994, and the last on May 4, 1995. WIPR-TV displayed interest in reviving the series, but Muñiz declined.

On July 1, 1995, Manuel Muñiz died, causing an emotional crisis in his father. It wasn&#x27;t until September 3 that he made a return to the media in a special edition of &quot;El colegío de la alegría&quot; titled &quot;Cuarenta años no son na&quot;&#x27; reprising his role. On October 19, another revival took place, this time &quot;Esto sigue sin nombre&quot;, based on &quot;Esto no tiene nombre&quot;. Despite resuming his work, Muñiz did not abandon this depression, selling his Culebra house and walked away of television for years. Eventually, Rafo Muñiz convinced his father to participate in another special, this one dedicated to him, titled &quot;Los 75 años de don Tommy&quot; filmed for WAPA-TV on February 3, 1997, before a live audience that filled the venue. In it, both his family and former employees and colleagues played homage to his career. On September 7, 1998, WIPR-TV began airing &quot;Noches de ayer&quot;, where Muñiz introduced episodes of his past work. The show would later be renamed &quot;Imagines&quot; and be hosted by Agrelot as well. On November 19, 1998, Muñiz sold Radio Luz. After suffering a heart attack on March 31, 1999, Muñiz underwent surgery. In May 1999, the Premios Quijote were dedicated to him and Agrelot. Three months later, Muñiz published a cautionary article about the misuse of television programming, his posture on the impact that this had on newer generations and how the overall quality had declined. Afterwards, he opted to retire and spend time with his family and friends. Almost three decades after their conflict, Muñiz and Nigaglioni put their differences aside.

==Personal life==
Muñíz was married to Luz María García de la Noceda and they had eight children: Rafael (aka Rafo), Ruby, Hilda, Mario, Luzie, Tomito, Manolo, Pedro and Félix Antonio (Toño). The birth of Rafael Emilio on September 13, 1956, served as comic relief for Muñiz, whose wife had been wanting a daughter for years. In their house, the couple also welcomed Ruby, the daughter of one of Muñiz cousins. Meanwhile, his children took several of their pets to create a small zoo from which they gained some income and entertainment and which is said to have been a precursor of sorts to the Monoloro park. Other activities to distract them included leading the local Girl Scouts. Muñiz himself acquired a house at Cayey, where he would relax and host parties. Rafo and Pedro are both well-known actors and producers and Toño currently is Production Manager for various promoters in Puerto Rico. In the 80s and 90s Toño was the producer of the yearly top Salsa event in the Caribbean, &quot;Festival de Salsa Winston&quot; ; Pedro directed a dramatic film, &quot;Cayo&quot;. Manolo was a businessman before his untimely death in July 1995. Muñiz was an aficionado of baseball and swimming.

Tommy Muñíz died 15 January 2009 in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico. Luz María García de la Noceda died a day after her 87th birthday, on 21 October 2011. ommy Muñiz&#x27;s life is described in two books: an autobiography named &quot;Así he vivido&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s the way I&#x27;ve lived&quot;) and &quot;¡Juan, Juan, Juan! Crónicas de la televisión en tiempos de don Tommy&quot; by Puerto Rican author Beba García.

=== Other enterprises ===
At one time or another, Muñiz also owned a restaurant (&quot;La Campana&quot;) in Cayey), a pet shop in San Juan, a zoo (&quot;Monoloro&quot;) in Carolina, a thoroughbred stable, and a summer camp for children (&quot;Camp Gualí&quot;). He later delegated many of the administrative functions of his production company as to concentrate in scriptwriting and acting. Following the success of his shows, Muñiz incorporated Hernán Nigaglioni as the administrator of Producciones Tommy Muñiz. He joined Flavia García, who was serving as executive assistant. On July 10, 1968, Producciones Tommy Muñiz debuted the first local talk show, &quot;El Show de Tommy&quot;, with Muñiz as its host. García and López Neris completed the crew. Hosting a number of artists, politicians and civilians, the show traveled throughout the Puerto Rican archipelago, from which it was transmitted. The show was also responsible for filming the first surgeries to air in local television. A visit by the Guyanese prime minister was also hosted after the nation acquired its independence.
Muñiz also became interested in developing several acres that he had inherited from his brother. By the summer of 1970, he had adapted a number of ideas and his ecological interests into a zoo known as &quot;El Monoloro&quot;. The facility housed lions, tigers, gazelles, zebras, kangaroos, an hippopotamus, an elephant, bears, a number of large reptiles and exotic birds acquired with the collaboration of the Guyanese authorities, but was headlined by the male chimpanzee named &quot;Yuyo&quot;. The ape, however, managed to escape his cage and was eventually captured and sent to the Parque de las Ciencias in Bayamón, where he lived until his death several decades later. In 1972, Muñiz shifted its focus to raising race horses, a venture that gave him a Clásico del Caribe winner in Guaybanex. The zoo was open for six years, with several of the animals eventually being transferred to the Mayagüez Zoo. Muñiz also acquired a beach house in Culebra. In June 1995, Muñiz and his sons inaugurated the theme park Camp Patricio.

==Legacy==
There is a statue of Muñiz at the Parque a los Caballeros de la Television (Park of the TV Gentlemen) in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Several homages were held in 2022 to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of Muñiz&#x27;s birthday.

<doc id="177079" wikidata="Q6804478" url="?curid=177079" title="Mechanical (character)">
<text>The mechanicals are six characters in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; who perform the play-within-a-play &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;. They are a group of amateur and mostly incompetent actors from around Athens, looking to make names for themselves by having their production chosen among several acts as the courtly entertainment for the royal wedding party of Theseus and Hippolyta. The servant-spirit Puck describes them as &quot;rude mechanicals&quot; in Act III, Scene 2 of the play, in reference to their occupations as skilled manual laborers.

The biggest ham among them, Nick Bottom, becomes the unlikely object of interest for the fairy queen Titania after she is charmed by a love potion and he is turned into a monster with the head of an ass by Puck.

The characters&#x27; names are Peter Quince, Snug, Nick Bottom, Francis Flute, Tom Snout, and Robin Starveling.

==Peter Quince==

Peter Quince&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;quines&quot; or &quot;quoins&quot;, which are the strengthening blocks that form the outer corners of stone or brickwork in a building.

===Playwriting===
Quince&#x27;s amateurish playwriting is usually taken to be a parody of the popular mystery plays of the pre-Elizabethan era, plays that were also produced by craftspeople. His metrical preferences are references to vernacular ballads.

Despite Quince&#x27;s obvious shortcomings as a writer, Stanley Wells argues that he partly resembles Shakespeare himself. Both are from a craftsmanly background, both work quickly and both take secondary roles in their own plays. Robert Leach makes the same point.

In performing the play, Quince recites the prologue but struggles to fit his lines into the meter and make the rhymes. The noble audience makes jocular comments, while the rest of the mechanicals struggle (all except Bottom, who rather confidently improvises).

===Characterization===
Traditionally, Peter Quince is portrayed as a bookish character, caught up in the minute details of his play, but as a theatrical organizer. However, in the 1999 film version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, he is portrayed by Roger Rees as a strong character extremely capable of being a director. It is he who leads the search party looking for Nick Bottom in the middle of the play.

===Cultural references===
The character is named in the title of a Wallace Stevens poem, &quot;Peter Quince at the Clavier&quot;, which is written in the first person as if spoken by Quince.

==Snug==
Snug is a minor character in the play. He is a joiner from Athens who is assigned by Peter Quince to play the part of the lion in Pyramus and Thisbe. When he is first assigned the part, he is afraid it may take him a while to finally remember his lines (even though the lion&#x27;s role was nothing but roaring originally). Bottom offers to play the part of the lion (as he offers to play all other parts), but he is rejected by Quince, who worries (as do the other characters) that his loud and ferocious roar in the play will frighten the ladies of power in the audience and get Quince and all his actors hanged. In the end, the lion&#x27;s part is revised to explain that he is in fact not a lion and means the audience no harm.

Snug is often played as a stupid man, a manner describing almost all of the Mechanicals.

Snug is the only Mechanical to whom the playwright did not assign a first name.

In Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle&#x27;s French adaptation, &quot;Le Songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; (1959), Snug is renamed to , where Georges Neveux&#x27;s 1945 adaptation used the English names.

On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Snug and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania&#x27;s four fairy escorts: Moth, Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.

==Nick Bottom==
Nick Bottom provides comic relief throughout the play. A weaver by trade, he is famously known for getting his head transformed into that of a donkey by the elusive Puck. Bottom and Puck are the only two characters who converse with and progress the three central stories in the whole play. Puck is first introduced in the fairies&#x27; story and creates the drama of the lovers&#x27; story by messing up who loves whom, and places the donkey head on Bottom&#x27;s in his story. Similarly, Bottom is performing in a play in his story intending it to be presented in the lovers&#x27; story, as well as interacting with Titania in the fairies&#x27; story.

==Francis Flute==

Francis Flute&#x27;s occupation is a bellows-mender. He is forced to play the female role of Thisbe in &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, a play-within-the-play which is performed for Theseus&#x27; marriage celebration.

In the play, Flute (Thisbe) speaks through the wall (played by Tom Snout) to Pyramus (Nick Bottom).

Flute is a young, excited actor who is disappointed when he finds he is meant to play a woman (Thisbe) in their interlude before the duke and the duchess.

Flute&#x27;s name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: &quot;Flute&quot; references a church organ, an instrument prominently featuring the bellows a bellows-mender might be called upon to repair.

In Jean-Louis and Jules Supervielle&#x27;s French adaptation, &quot;Le Songe d&#x27;une nuit d&#x27;été&quot; (1959), Flute is renamed to , where Georges Neveux&#x27;s 1945 adaptation used the English names.

On the Elizabethan stage, the role of Flute and the other Mechanicals was intended to be doubled with Titania&#x27;s four fairy escorts: Moth (also spelled Mote), Mustardseed, Cobweb, and Peaseblossom.

==Tom Snout==
Tom Snout is a tinker, and one of the Mechanicals of Athens.

In the play-within-a-play, Tom Snout plays the wall which separates Pyramus&#x27; and Thisbe&#x27;s gardens. In &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, the two lovers whisper to each other through Snout&#x27;s fingers (representing a chink in the wall). Snout has eight lines under the name of Tom Snout, and two lines as &quot;The Wall&quot;. He is the Wall for Act V-Scene 1.

Tom Snout was originally set to play Pyramus&#x27;s father, but the need for a wall was greater, so he discharged &quot;The Wall&quot;. Snout is often portrayed as a reluctant actor and very frightened, but the other mechanicals (except Bottom and Quince) are usually much more frightened than Tom Snout.

Snout&#x27;s name, like that of the other mechanicals, is metonymical and derives from his craft: &quot;Snout&quot; means a nozzle or a spout, a feature of the kettles a tinker often mends.

==Robin Starveling==

Robin Starveling plays the part of Moonshine in their performance of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;. His part is often considered one of the more humorous in the play, as he uses a lantern in a failed attempt to portray Moonshine and is wittily derided by his audience. His real job is as a tailor.

<doc id="177081" wikidata="Q731224" url="?curid=177081" title="Discourse on the Method">
<text>Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One&#x27;s Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences () is a philosophical and autobiographical treatise published by René Descartes in 1637. It is best known as the source of the famous quotation &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, or &quot;I am thinking, therefore I exist&quot;), which occurs in Part IV of the work. A similar argument, without this precise wording, is found in &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; (1641), and a Latin version of the same statement &quot;Cogito, ergo sum&quot; is found in &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644).

&quot;Discourse on the Method&quot; is one of the most influential works in the history of modern philosophy, and important to the development of natural sciences. In this work, Descartes tackles the problem of skepticism, which had previously been studied by other philosophers. While addressing some of his predecessors and contemporaries, Descartes modified their approach to account for a truth he found to be incontrovertible; he started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.

The book was originally published in Leiden, in the Netherlands. Later, it was translated into Latin and published in 1656 in Amsterdam. The book was intended as an introduction to three works: &quot;Dioptrique&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Géométrie&quot;. &quot;Géométrie&quot; contains Descartes&#x27;s initial concepts that later developed into the Cartesian coordinate system. The text was written and published in French so as to reach a wider audience than Latin, the language in which most philosophical and scientific texts were written and published at that time, would have allowed. Most of Descartes&#x27; other works were written in Latin.

Together with &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; and &quot;Rules for the Direction of the Mind&quot;, it forms the base of the epistemology known as Cartesianism.

==Organization==

The book is divided into six parts, described in the author&#x27;s preface as:

# Various considerations touching the Sciences
# The principal rules of the Method which the Author has discovered
# Certain of the rules of Morals which he has deduced from this Method
# The reasonings by which he establishes the existence of God and of the Human Soul
# The order of the Physical questions which he has investigated, and, in particular, the explication of the motion of the heart and of some other difficulties pertaining to Medicine, as also the difference between the soul of man and that of the brutes
# What the Author believes to be required in order to greater advancement in the investigation of Nature than has yet been made, with the reasons that have induced him to write

=== Part I: Various scientific considerations ===

Descartes begins by allowing himself some wit:

A similar observation can be found in Hobbes, when he writes about human abilities, specifically wisdom and &quot;their own wit&quot;: &quot;But this proveth rather that men are in that point equal, than unequal. For there is not ordinarily a greater sign of the equal distribution of anything than that every man is contented with his share,&quot; but also in Montaigne, whose formulation indicates that it was a commonplace at the time: &quot;Tis commonly said that the justest portion Nature has given us of her favors is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with his share.&quot; Descartes continues with a warning:

Descartes describes his disappointment with his education: &quot;[A]s soon as I had finished the entire course of study…I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther…than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance.&quot; He notes his special delight with mathematics, and contrasts its strong foundations to &quot;the disquisitions of the ancient moralists [which are] towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud.&quot;

=== Part II: Principal rules of the Method ===

Descartes was in Germany, attracted thither by the wars in that country, and describes his intent by a &quot;building metaphor&quot; (see also: Neurath&#x27;s boat). He observes that buildings, cities or nations that have been planned by a single hand are more elegant and commodious than those that have grown organically. He resolves not to build on old foundations, nor to lean upon principles which he had taken on faith in his youth. Descartes seeks to ascertain the true method by which to arrive at the knowledge of whatever lies within the compass of his powers. He presents four precepts:

=== Part III: Morals and Maxims of conducting the Method ===
Descartes uses the analogy of rebuilding a house from secure foundations, and extends the analogy to the idea of needing a temporary abode while his own house is being rebuilt. Descartes adopts the following &quot;three or four&quot; maxims in order to remain effective in the &quot;real world&quot; while experimenting with his method of radical doubt. They form a rudimentary belief system from which to act before his new system is fully developed:

Finally, Descartes states his resolute belief that there is no better use of his time than to cultivate his reason and to advance his knowledge of the truth according to his method.

=== Part IV: Proof of God and the Soul===
Applying the method to itself, Descartes challenges his own reasoning and reason itself. But Descartes believes three things are not susceptible to doubt and the three support each other to form a stable foundation for the method. He cannot doubt that something has to be there to do the doubting: &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. The method of doubt cannot doubt reason as it is based on reason itself. By reason there exists a God, and God is the guarantor that reason is not misguided. Descartes supplies three different proofs for the existence of God, including what is now referred to as the ontological proof of the existence of God.

=== Part V: Physics, the heart, and the soul of man and animals ===
Descartes briefly sketches how in an unpublished treatise (published posthumously as &quot;Le Monde&quot;) he had laid out his ideas regarding the laws of nature, the sun and stars, the moon as the cause of &quot;ebb and flow&quot; (meaning the tides), gravitation, light, and heat. Describing his work on light, he states:

His work on such physico-mechanical laws is, however, framed as applying not to our world but to a theoretical &quot;new world&quot; created by God

Descartes does this &quot;to express my judgment regarding ... [his subjects] with greater freedom, without being necessitated to adopt or refute the opinions of the learned.&quot; (Descartes&#x27; hypothetical world would be a deistic universe.)

He goes on to say that he &quot;was not, however, disposed, from these circumstances, to conclude that this world had been created in the manner I described; for it is much more likely that God made it at the first such as it was to be.&quot; Despite this admission, it seems that Descartes&#x27; project for understanding the world was that of re-creating creation—a cosmological project which aimed, through Descartes&#x27; particular brand of experimental method, to show not merely the possibility of such a system, but to suggest that this way of looking at the world—one with (as Descartes saw it) no assumptions about God or nature—provided the only basis upon which he could see knowledge progressing (as he states in Book II).

Thus, in Descartes&#x27; work, we can see some of the fundamental assumptions of modern cosmology in evidence—the project of examining the historical construction of the universe through a set of quantitative laws describing interactions which would allow the ordered present to be constructed from a chaotic past.

He goes on to the motion of the blood in the heart and arteries, endorsing the findings of &quot;a physician of England&quot; about the circulation of blood, referring to William Harvey and his work &quot;De motu cordis&quot; in a marginal note. But then he disagrees strongly about the function of the heart as a pump, ascribing the motive power of the circulation to heat rather than muscular contraction. He describes that these motions seem to be totally independent of what we think, and concludes that our bodies are separate from our souls.

He does not seem to distinguish between mind, spirit, and soul, all of which he identifies with our faculty for rational thinking. Hence the term &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot; All three of these words (particularly &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;soul&quot;) can be signified by the single French term &quot;âme&quot;.

=== Part VI: Prerequisites for advancing the investigation of Nature ===
Descartes begins by obliquely referring to the recent trial of Galileo for heresy and the Church&#x27;s condemnation of heliocentrism; he explains that for these reasons he has held back his own treatise from publication. However, he says, because people have begun to hear of his work, he is compelled to publish these small parts of it (that is, the &quot;Discourse&quot;, &quot;Dioptrique&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Géométrie&quot;) in order that people &quot;not&quot; wonder why he &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; publish.

The discourse ends with some discussion of scientific experimentation: Descartes believes that experimentation is indispensable, time-consuming, and yet not easily delegated to others. He exhorts the reader to investigate the claims laid out in &quot;Dioptrique&quot;, &quot;Météores&quot;, and &quot;Géométrie&quot; and communicate their findings or criticisms to his publisher; he commits to publishing any such queries he receives along with his answers.

==Influencing future science==
Skepticism had previously been discussed by philosophers such as Sextus Empiricus, Al-Kindi, Al-Ghazali, Francisco Sánchez and Michel de Montaigne. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions or influences.
This is summarized in the book&#x27;s first precept to &quot;never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such&quot;. This method of pro-foundational skepticism is considered to be the start of modern philosophy.

==Quotations==

* &quot;The most widely shared thing in the world is good sense, for everyone thinks he is so well provided with it that even those who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else do not usually desire to have more good sense than they have. It is not likely that everyone is mistaken in this…&quot; (part I, AT p. 1 sq.)
* &quot;I know how very liable we are to delusion in what relates to ourselves; and also how much the judgments of our friends are to be suspected when given in our favor.&quot; (part I, AT p. 3)
* &quot;… I believed that I had already given sufficient time to languages, and likewise to the reading of the writings of the ancients, to their histories and fables. For to hold converse with those of other ages and to travel, are almost the same thing.&quot; (part I, AT p. 6)
* &quot;Of philosophy I will say nothing, except that when I saw that it had been cultivated for so many ages by the most distinguished men; and that yet there is not a single matter within its sphere which is still not in dispute and nothing, therefore, which is above doubt, I did not presume to anticipate that my success would be greater in it than that of others.&quot; (part I, AT p. 8)
* &quot;… I entirely abandoned the study of letters, and resolved no longer to seek any other science than the knowledge of myself, or of the great book of the world.…&quot; (part I, AT p. 9)
* &quot;The first was to include nothing in my judgments than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it.&quot; (part II, AT p. 18)
* &quot;… In what regards manners, everyone is so full of his own wisdom, that there might be as many reformers as heads.…&quot; (part VI, AT p. 61)
* &quot;… And although my speculations greatly please myself, I believe that others have theirs, which perhaps please them still more.&quot; (part VI, AT p. 61)

<text>Atomic energy or energy of atoms is energy carried by atoms. The term originated in 1903 when Ernest Rutherford began to speak of the possibility of atomic energy. H. G. Wells popularized the phrase &quot;splitting the atom&quot;, before discovery of the atomic nucleus. 

Atomic energy includes:

*Nuclear binding energy, the energy required to split a nucleus of an atom.
*Nuclear potential energy, the potential energy of the particles inside an atomic nucleus.
*Nuclear reaction, a process in which nuclei or nuclear particles interact, resulting in products different from the initial ones; see also nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.
*Radioactive decay, the set of various processes by which unstable atomic nuclei (nuclides) emit subatomic particles.

Atomic energy is the source of nuclear power, which uses sustained nuclear fission to generate heat and electricity. It is also the source of the explosive force of an atomic bomb.

<text>An active galactic nucleus (AGN) is a compact region at the center of a galaxy that emits a significant amount of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum, with characteristics indicating that this luminosity is not produced by the stars. Such excess, non-stellar emissions have been observed in the radio, microwave, infrared, optical, ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma ray wavebands. A galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy. The non-stellar radiation from an AGN is theorized to result from the accretion of matter by a supermassive black hole at the center of its host galaxy.

Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe and, as such, can be used as a means of discovering distant objects; their evolution as a function of cosmic time also puts constraints on models of the cosmos.

The observed characteristics of an AGN depend on several properties such as the mass of the central black hole, the rate of gas accretion onto the black hole, the orientation of the accretion disk, the degree of obscuration of the nucleus by dust, and presence or absence of jets.

Numerous subclasses of AGN have been defined on the basis of their observed characteristics; the most powerful AGN are classified as quasars. A blazar is an AGN with a jet pointed toward the Earth, in which radiation from the jet is enhanced by relativistic beaming.

== History ==

During the first half of the 20th century, photographic observations of nearby galaxies detected some characteristic signatures of AGN emission, although there was not yet a physical understanding of the nature of the AGN phenomenon. Some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of emission lines from the nuclei of NGC 1068 and Messier 81 by Edward Fath (published in 1909), and the discovery of the jet in Messier 87 by Heber Curtis (published in 1918). Further spectroscopic studies by astronomers including Vesto Slipher, Milton Humason, and Nicholas Mayall noted the presence of unusual emission lines in some galaxy nuclei. In 1943, Carl Seyfert published a paper in which he described observations of nearby galaxies having bright nuclei that were sources of unusually broad emission lines. Galaxies observed as part of this study included NGC 1068, NGC 4151, NGC 3516, and NGC 7469. Active galaxies such as these are known as Seyfert galaxies in honor of Seyfert&#x27;s pioneering work.

The development of radio astronomy was a major catalyst to understanding AGN. Some of the earliest detected radio sources are nearby active elliptical galaxies such as Messier 87 and Centaurus A. Another radio source, Cygnus A, was identified by Walter Baade and Rudolph Minkowski as a tidally distorted galaxy with an unusual emission-line spectrum, having a recessional velocity of 16,700 kilometers per second. The 3C radio survey led to further progress in discovery of new radio sources as well as identifying the visible-light sources associated with the radio emission. In photographic images, some of these objects were nearly point-like or quasi-stellar in appearance, and were classified as quasi-stellar radio sources (later abbreviated as &quot;quasars&quot;).

Soviet Armenian astrophysicist Viktor Ambartsumian introduced Active Galactic Nuclei in the early 1950s. At the Solvay Conference on Physics in 1958, Ambartsumian presented a report arguing that &quot;explosions in galactic nuclei cause large amounts of mass to be expelled. For these explosions to occur, galactic nuclei must contain bodies of huge mass and unknown nature. From this point forward Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) became a key component in theories of galactic evolution.&quot; His idea was initially accepted skeptically.

A major breakthrough was the measurement of the redshift of the quasar 3C 273 by Maarten Schmidt, published in 1963. Schmidt noted that if this object was extragalactic (outside the Milky Way, at a cosmological distance) then its large redshift of 0.158 implied that it was the nuclear region of a galaxy about 100 times more powerful than other radio galaxies that had been identified. Shortly afterward, optical spectra were used to measure the redshifts of a growing number of quasars including 3C 48, even more distant at redshift 0.37.

The enormous luminosities of these quasars as well as their unusual spectral properties indicated that their power source could not be ordinary stars. Accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was suggested as the source of quasars&#x27; power in papers by Edwin Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich in 1964. In 1969 Donald Lynden-Bell proposed that nearby galaxies contain supermassive black holes at their centers as relics of &quot;dead&quot; quasars, and that black hole accretion was the power source for the non-stellar emission in nearby Seyfert galaxies. In the 1960s and 1970s, early X-ray astronomy observations demonstrated that Seyfert galaxies and quasars are powerful sources of X-ray emission, which originates from the inner regions of black hole accretion disks.

Today, AGN are a major topic of astrophysical research, both observational and theoretical. AGN research encompasses observational surveys to find AGN over broad ranges of luminosity and redshift, examination of the cosmic evolution and growth of black holes, studies of the physics of black hole accretion and the emission of electromagnetic radiation from AGN, examination of the properties of jets and outflows of matter from AGN, and the impact of black hole accretion and quasar activity on galaxy evolution.

== Models ==
Since the late 1960s it has been argued that an AGN must be powered by accretion of mass onto massive black holes (106 to 1010 times the Solar mass). AGN are both compact and persistently extremely luminous. Accretion can potentially give very efficient conversion of potential and kinetic energy to radiation, and a massive black hole has a high Eddington luminosity, and as a result, it can provide the observed high persistent luminosity. Supermassive black holes are now believed to exist in the centres of most if not all massive galaxies since the mass of the black hole correlates well with the velocity dispersion of the galactic bulge (the M–sigma relation) or with bulge luminosity. Thus, AGN-like characteristics are expected whenever a supply of material for accretion comes within the sphere of influence of the central black hole.

=== Accretion disc ===
In the standard model of AGN, cold material close to a black hole forms an accretion disc. Dissipative processes in the accretion disc transport matter inwards and angular momentum outwards, while causing the accretion disc to heat up. The expected spectrum of an accretion disc peaks in the optical-ultraviolet waveband; in addition, a corona of hot material forms above the accretion disc and can inverse-Compton scatter photons up to X-ray energies. The radiation from the accretion disc excites cold atomic material close to the black hole and this in turn radiates at particular emission lines. A large fraction of the AGN&#x27;s radiation may be obscured by interstellar gas and dust close to the accretion disc, but (in a steady-state situation) this will be re-radiated at some other waveband, most likely the infrared.

=== Relativistic jets ===


Some accretion discs produce jets of twin, highly collimated, and fast outflows that emerge in opposite directions from close to the disc. The direction of the jet ejection is determined either by the angular momentum axis of the accretion disc or the spin axis of the black hole. The jet production mechanism and indeed the jet composition on very small scales are not understood at present due to the resolution of astronomical instruments being too low. The jets have their most obvious observational effects in the radio waveband, where very-long-baseline interferometry can be used to study the synchrotron radiation they emit at resolutions of sub-parsec scales. However, they radiate in all wavebands from the radio through to the gamma-ray range via the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton scattering process, and so AGN jets are a second potential source of any observed continuum radiation.

=== Radiatively inefficient AGN ===
There exists a class of &quot;radiatively inefficient&quot; solutions to the equations that govern accretion. Several theories exist, but the most widely known of these is the Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the Eddington limit, the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, where otherwise we might expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities. Radiatively inefficient AGN would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard AGN with an accretion disc.

== Particle acceleration ==
AGN are a candidate source of high and ultra-high energy cosmic rays &quot;(see also Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration)&quot;.

== Observational characteristics ==
Among the many interesting characteristics of AGNs:
* very high luminosity, visible out to very high red shifts,
* small emitting regions, milli-parsecs in diameter,
* strong evolution of luminosity functions,
* detectable emission across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

== Types of active galaxy ==
It is convenient to divide AGN into two classes, conventionally called radio-quiet and radio-loud. Radio-loud objects have emission contributions from both the jet(s) and the lobes that the jets inflate. These emission contributions dominate the luminosity of the AGN at radio wavelengths and possibly at some or all other wavelengths. Radio-quiet objects are simpler since jet and any jet-related emission can be neglected at all wavelengths.

AGN terminology is often confusing, since the distinctions between different types of AGN sometimes reflect historical differences in how the objects were discovered or initially classified, rather than real physical differences.

=== Radio-quiet AGN ===
* Low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). As the name suggests, these systems show only weak nuclear emission-line regions, and no other signatures of AGN emission. It is debatable whether all such systems are true AGN (powered by accretion on to a supermassive black hole). If they are, they constitute the lowest-luminosity class of radio-quiet AGN. Some may be radio-quiet analogues of the low-excitation radio galaxies (see below).
* Seyfert galaxies. Seyferts were the earliest distinct class of AGN to be identified. They show optical range nuclear continuum emission, narrow and occasionally broad emission lines, occasionally strong nuclear X-ray emission and sometimes a weak small-scale radio jet. Originally they were divided into two types known as Seyfert 1 and 2: Seyfert 1s show strong broad emission lines while Seyfert 2s do not, and Seyfert 1s are more likely to show strong low-energy X-ray emission. Various forms of elaboration on this scheme exist: for example, Seyfert 1s with relatively narrow broad lines are sometimes referred to as narrow-line Seyfert 1s. The host galaxies of Seyferts are usually spiral or irregular galaxies.
* Radio-quiet quasars/QSOs. These are essentially more luminous versions of Seyfert 1s: the distinction is arbitrary and is usually expressed in terms of a limiting optical magnitude. Quasars were originally &#x27;quasi-stellar&#x27; in optical images as they had optical luminosities that were greater than that of their host galaxy. They always show strong optical continuum emission, X-ray continuum emission, and broad and narrow optical emission lines. Some astronomers use the term QSO (Quasi-Stellar Object) for this class of AGN, reserving &#x27;quasar&#x27; for radio-loud objects, while others talk about radio-quiet and radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of quasars can be spirals, irregulars or ellipticals. There is a correlation between the quasar&#x27;s luminosity and the mass of its host galaxy, in that the most luminous quasars inhabit the most massive galaxies (ellipticals).
* &#x27;Quasar 2s&#x27;. By analogy with Seyfert 2s, these are objects with quasar-like luminosities but without strong optical nuclear continuum emission or broad line emission. They are scarce in surveys, though a number of possible candidate quasar 2s have been identified.

=== Radio-loud AGN ===
There are several subtypes of radio-loud active galactic nuclei.

* Radio-loud quasars behave exactly like radio-quiet quasars with the addition of emission from a jet. Thus they show strong optical continuum emission, broad and narrow emission lines, and strong X-ray emission, together with nuclear and often extended radio emission.
* &quot;Blazars&quot; (BL Lac objects and OVV quasars) classes are distinguished by rapidly variable, polarized optical, radio and X-ray emission. BL Lac objects show no optical emission lines, broad or narrow, so that their redshifts can only be determined from features in the spectra of their host galaxies. The emission-line features may be intrinsically absent or simply swamped by the additional variable component. In the latter case, emission lines may become visible when the variable component is at a low level. OVV quasars behave more like standard radio-loud quasars with the addition of a rapidly variable component. In both classes of source, the variable emission is believed to originate in a relativistic jet oriented close to the line of sight. Relativistic effects amplify both the luminosity of the jet and the amplitude of variability.
* Radio galaxies. These objects show nuclear and extended radio emission. Their other AGN properties are heterogeneous. They can broadly be divided into low-excitation and high-excitation classes. Low-excitation objects show no strong narrow or broad emission lines, and the emission lines they do have may be excited by a different mechanism. Their optical and X-ray nuclear emission is consistent with originating purely in a jet. They may be the best current candidates for AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion. By contrast, high-excitation objects (narrow-line radio galaxies) have emission-line spectra similar to those of Seyfert 2s. The small class of broad-line radio galaxies, which show relatively strong nuclear optical continuum emission probably includes some objects that are simply low-luminosity radio-loud quasars. The host galaxies of radio galaxies, whatever their emission-line type, are essentially always ellipticals.


== Unification of AGN species ==

Unified models propose that different observational classes of AGN are a single type of physical object observed under different conditions. The currently favoured unified models are &#x27;orientation-based unified models&#x27; meaning that they propose that the apparent differences between different types of objects arise simply because of their different orientations to the observer. However, they are debated (see below).

=== Radio-quiet unification ===
At low luminosities, the objects to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The unification models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer has a direct view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models is that the two types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a torus of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight, allowing us to see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.

At higher luminosities, quasars take the place of Seyfert 1s, but, as already mentioned, the corresponding &#x27;quasar 2s&#x27; are elusive at present. If they do not have the scattering component of Seyfert 2s they would be hard to detect except through their luminous narrow-line and hard X-ray emission.

=== Radio-loud unification ===
Historically, work on radio-loud unification has concentrated on high-luminosity radio-loud quasars. These can be unified with narrow-line radio galaxies in a manner directly analogous to the Seyfert 1/2 unification (but without the complication of much in the way of a reflection component: narrow-line radio galaxies show no nuclear optical continuum or reflected X-ray component, although they do occasionally show polarized broad-line emission). The large-scale radio structures of these objects provide compelling evidence that the orientation-based unified models really are true. X-ray evidence, where available, supports the unified picture: radio galaxies show evidence of obscuration from a torus, while quasars do not, although care must be taken since radio-loud objects also have a soft unabsorbed jet-related component, and high resolution is necessary to separate out thermal emission from the sources&#x27; large-scale hot-gas environment. At very small angles to the line of sight, relativistic beaming dominates, and we see a blazar of some variety.

However, the population of radio galaxies is completely dominated by low-luminosity, low-excitation objects. These do not show strong nuclear emission lines—broad or narrow—they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related, and their X-ray emission is also consistent with coming purely from a jet, with no heavily absorbed nuclear component in general. These objects cannot be unified with quasars, even though they include some high-luminosity objects when looking at radio emission, since the torus can never hide the narrow-line region to the required extent, and since infrared studies show that they have no hidden nuclear component: in fact there is no evidence for a torus in these objects at all. Most likely, they form a separate class in which only jet-related emission is important. At small angles to the line of sight, they will appear as BL Lac objects.

=== Criticism of the radio-quiet unification ===
In the recent literature on AGN, being subject to an intense debate, an increasing set of observations appear to be in conflict with some of the key predictions of the Unified Model, e.g. that each Seyfert 2 has an obscured Seyfert 1 nucleus (a hidden broad-line region).

Therefore, one cannot know whether the gas in all Seyfert 2 galaxies is ionized due to photoionization from a single, non-stellar continuum source in the center or due to shock-ionization from e.g. intense, nuclear starbursts. Spectropolarimetric studies reveal that only 50% of Seyfert 2s show a hidden broad-line region and thus split Seyfert 2 galaxies into two populations. The two classes of populations appear to differ by their luminosity, where the Seyfert 2s without a hidden broad-line region are generally less luminous. This suggests absence of broad-line region is connected to low Eddington ratio, and not to obscuration.

The covering factor of the torus might play an important role. Some torus models predict how Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s can obtain different covering factors from a luminosity and accretion rate dependence of the torus covering factor, something supported by studies in the x-ray of AGN. The models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in Seyfert 1s to more &quot;dead&quot; Seyfert 2s and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities and the evolution of the broad-line region.

While studies of single AGN show important deviations from the expectations of the unified model, results from statistical tests have been contradictory. The most important short-coming of statistical tests by direct comparisons of statistical samples of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s is the introduction of selection biases due to anisotropic selection criteria.

Studying neighbour galaxies rather than the AGN themselves first suggested the numbers of neighbours were larger for Seyfert 2s than for Seyfert 1s, in contradiction with the Unified Model. Today, having overcome the previous limitations of small sample sizes and anisotropic selection, studies of neighbours of hundreds to thousands of AGN have shown that the neighbours of Seyfert 2s are intrinsically dustier and more star-forming than Seyfert 1s and a connection between AGN type, host galaxy morphology and collision history. Moreover, angular clustering studies of the two AGN types confirm that they reside in different environments and show that they reside within dark matter halos of different masses. The AGN environment studies are in line with evolution-based unification models where Seyfert 2s transform into Seyfert 1s during merger, supporting earlier models of merger-driven activation of Seyfert 1 nuclei.

While controversy about the soundness of each individual study still prevails, they all agree on that the simplest viewing-angle based models of AGN Unification are incomplete. Seyfert-1 and Seyfert-2 seem to differ in star formation and AGN engine power.

While it still might be valid that an obscured Seyfert 1 can appear as a Seyfert 2, not all Seyfert 2s must host an obscured Seyfert 1. Understanding whether it is the same engine driving all Seyfert 2s, the connection to radio-loud AGN, the mechanisms of the variability of some AGN that vary between the two types at very short time scales, and the connection of the AGN type to small and large-scale environment remain important issues to incorporate into any unified model of active galactic nuclei.

A study of Swift/BAT AGN published in July 2022 adds support to the &quot;radiation-regulated unification model&quot; outlined in 2017. In this model, the relative accretion rate (termed the &quot;Eddington ratio&quot;) of the black hole has a significant impact on the observed features of the AGN. Black Holes with higher Eddington ratios appear to be more likely to be unobscured, having cleared away locally obscuring material in a very short timescale.

== Cosmological uses and evolution ==
For a long time, active galaxies held all the records for the highest-redshift objects known either in the optical or the radio spectrum, because of their high luminosity. They still have a role to play in studies of the early universe, but it is now recognised that an AGN gives a highly biased picture of the &quot;typical&quot; high-redshift galaxy.

Most luminous classes of AGN (radio-loud and radio-quiet) seem to have been much more numerous in the early universe. This suggests that massive black holes formed early on and that the conditions for the formation of luminous AGN were more common in the early universe, such as a much higher availability of cold gas near the centre of galaxies than at present. It also implies that many objects that were once luminous quasars are now much less luminous, or entirely quiescent. The evolution of the low-luminosity AGN population is much less well understood due to the difficulty of observing these objects at high redshifts.

<doc id="177094" wikidata="Q690362" url="?curid=177094" title="The Fall (Camus novel)">
<text>The Fall () is a philosophical novel by Albert Camus. First published in 1956, it is his last complete work of fiction. Set in Amsterdam, &quot;The Fall&quot; consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed &quot;judge-penitent&quot; Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues. His crisis, and his ultimate &quot;fall&quot; from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, the fall of man from the Garden of Eden. &quot;The Fall&quot; explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth. In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described the novel as &quot;perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood&quot; of Camus&#x27; books.

== Setting ==
Clamence often speaks of his love for high, open places — everything from mountain peaks to the top decks of boats. &quot;I have never felt comfortable,&quot; he explains, &quot;except in lofty surroundings. Even in the details of daily life, I need to feel &quot;above&quot;&quot;. Then it is paradoxical that Clamence leads his &quot;cher ami&quot; away from the human symmetries of a picturesque town to sit on a level, seaside expanse. The location of Amsterdam, as a city below sea-level, therefore assumes particular significance in relation to the narrator. Moreover, Amsterdam is generally described in &quot;The Fall&quot; as a cold, wet place where a thick blanket of fog constantly hangs over the crowded, neon-light-lined streets. Beside the atmosphere (which could be established almost anywhere else) the city also was chosen by Camus for a more peculiar reason. In the opening pages Clamence casually remarks,

The &quot;last circle of hell&quot; is the site of Amsterdam&#x27;s red-light district and the location of a bar named &quot;Mexico City&quot;, which Clamence frequents nightly, and where the bulk of his narrative gradually unfolds. (The bar, &quot;Mexico City&quot;, did exist in Amsterdam.) The setting thus serves to illustrate, literally and metaphorically, Clamence&#x27;s fall from the heights of high-class Paris society to the dark, dreary, Dantesque underworld of Amsterdam, where tortured souls wander aimlessly among each other. Indeed, critics have explored at length the parallels between Clamence&#x27;s fall and Dante&#x27;s descent through Hell in the &quot;Inferno&quot; (see Galpin, King).

It is also significant, particularly as Camus develops his philosophical ideas, that the story develops against the backdrop of the Second World War and the Holocaust. Clamence tells us that he lives only a short distance from &quot;Mexico City&quot;, in what was — formerly — the Jewish Quarter, &quot;until our Hitlerian brethren spaced it out a bit. ... I am living on the site of one of the greatest crimes in history&quot; (Camus 281). The naming of the bar also recalls the destruction of the Aztec civilization whose ruined capital has been supplanted by modern Mexico City.

Among other things, &quot;The Fall&quot; is an attempt to explain how humankind could be capable of perpetrating such evils.

== Synopsis ==

=== Life in Paris ===
The novel opens with Clamence sitting in the bar &quot;Mexico City&quot; casually talking to a stranger (potentially meant as a stand in for the reader) about the proper way to order a drink; for here, despite the cosmopolitan nature of Amsterdam, the bartender refuses to respond to anything other than Dutch. Thus, Clamence serves as interpreter and he and the stranger, having discovered that they are fellow compatriots who, moreover, both hail from Paris, begin discussing more substantive matters.

Clamence tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in Paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer. The vast majority of his work centred around &quot;widow and orphan&quot; cases, that is, the poor and disenfranchised who otherwise would be unable to provide themselves with a proper defence before the law. He also relates anecdotes about how he always enjoyed giving friendly directions to strangers on the streets, yielding to others his seat on the bus, giving alms to the poor, and, above all, helping the blind to cross the street. In short, Clamence conceived of himself as living purely for the sake of others and &quot;achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that &quot;supreme summit&quot; where virtue is its own reward&quot; (Camus 288).

Late one night when crossing the Pont Royal on his way home from his &quot;mistress&quot;, however, Clamence comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge. He hesitates for a moment, thinking the sight strange at such an hour and given the barrenness of the streets, but continues on his way nevertheless. He had only walked a short distance when he heard the distinct sound of a body hitting the water. Clamence stops walking, knowing exactly what has happened, but does nothing — in fact, he doesn&#x27;t even turn around. The sound of screaming was

Despite Clamence&#x27;s view of himself as a selfless advocate for the weak and unfortunate, he simply ignores the incident and continues on his way. He later elaborates that his failure to do anything was most probably because doing so would have required him to put his own personal safety in jeopardy.

Several years after the apparent suicide of the woman off the Pont Royal — and an evidently successful effort to purge the entire event from his memory — Clamence is on his way home one autumn evening after a particularly pleasing day of work. He pauses on the empty Pont des Arts and reflects:

Clamence turns around to discover that the laughter, of course, was not directed at him, but probably originated from a far-off conversation between friends — such is the rational course of his thought. Nevertheless, he tells us that &quot;I could still hear it distinctly behind me, coming from nowhere unless from the water.&quot; The laughter is thus alarming because it immediately reminds him of his obvious failure to do anything whatsoever about the woman who had presumably drowned years before. The unlucky coincidence for Clamence here is that he is reminded of this precisely at the moment when he is congratulating himself for being such a selfless individual. Furthermore, the laughter is described as a &quot;good, hearty, almost friendly laugh,&quot; whereas, mere moments later, he describes himself as possessing a &quot;good, hearty badger&quot; (Camus 297). This implies that the laughter originated within himself, adding another dimension to the inner meaning of the scene. That evening on the Pont des Arts represents, for Clamence, the collision of his true self with his inflated self-image, and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious.

A third and final incident initiates Clamence&#x27;s downward spiral. One day while waiting at a stoplight, Clamence finds that he is trapped behind a motorcycle which has stalled ahead of him and is unable to proceed once the light changes to green as a result. Other cars behind him start honking their horns, and Clamence politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off the road so that others can drive around him; however, with each repetition of the request, the motorcyclist becomes increasingly agitated and threatens Clamence with physical violence.

Angry, Clamence exits his vehicle in order to confront the man when someone else intervenes and &quot;informed me that I was the scum of the earth and that he would not allow me to strike a man who had a motor-cycle between his legs and hence was at a disadvantage&quot; (Camus 303-4). Clamence turns to respond to his interlocutor when suddenly the motorcyclist punches him in the side of the head and then speeds off. Without retaliating against his interlocutor, Clamence, utterly humiliated, merely returns to his car and drives away. Later, he runs through his mind &quot;a hundred times&quot; what he thinks he should have done — namely strike his interlocutor, then chase after the motorcyclist and run him off the road. The feeling of resentment gnaws away at him, and Clamence explains that

Clamence thus arrives at the conclusion that his whole life has in fact been lived in search of honour, recognition, and power over others. Having realized this, he can no longer live the way he once did.

=== Crisis ===
Clamence initially attempts to resist the sense that he has lived hypocritically and selfishly. He argues with himself over his prior acts of kindness, but quickly discovers that this is an argument he cannot win. He reflects, for example, that whenever he had helped a blind man across the street — something he especially enjoyed doing — he would doff his hat to the man. Since the blind man obviously cannot see this acknowledgement, Clamence asks, &quot;To whom was it addressed? To the public. After playing my part, I would take my bow&quot; (Camus 301). As a result, he comes to see himself as duplicitous and hypocritical.

This realization precipitates an emotional and intellectual crisis for Clamence which, moreover, he is unable to avoid, having now discovered it; the sound of laughter that first struck him on the Pont des Arts slowly begins to permeate his entire existence. In fact, Clamence even begins laughing at himself as he defends matters of justice and fairness in court. Unable to ignore it, Clamence attempts to silence the laughter by throwing off his hypocrisy and ruining the reputation he acquired therefrom.

Clamence proceeds to &quot;destroy that flattering reputation&quot; (Camus 326) primarily by making public comments that he knows will be received as objectionable: telling beggars that they are &quot;embarrassing people,&quot; declaring his regret at not being able to hold serfs and beat them at his whim, and announcing the publication of a &quot;manifesto exposing the oppression that the oppressed inflict on decent people.&quot; In fact, Clamence even goes so far as to consider

To Clamence&#x27;s frustration and dismay, however, his efforts in this regard are ineffective, generally because many of the people around him refuse to take him seriously; they find it inconceivable that a man of his reputation could ever say such things and not be joking. Clamence eventually realizes that his attempts at self-derision can only fail, and the laughter continues to gnaw at him. This is because his actions are just as dishonest: &quot;In order to forestall the laughter, I dreamed of hurling myself into the general derision. In fact, it was still a question of dodging judgment. I wanted to put the laughers on my side, or at least to put myself on their side&quot; (Camus 325).

Ultimately, Clamence responds to his emotional-intellectual crisis by withdrawing from the world on precisely those terms. He closes his law practice, avoids his former colleagues in particular and people in general, and throws himself completely into uncompromising debauchery; while humankind may be grossly hypocritical in the areas from which he has withdrawn, &quot;no man is a hypocrite in his pleasures&quot; (Camus 311 – a quotation from Samuel Johnson). Debauchery (women and alcohol) does prove a temporarily effective means of silencing the laughter—the biting sense of his own hypocrisy—because, as he explains, it thoroughly dulls his wits. Unfortunately, he finds himself unable to maintain this lifestyle due to personal failings that he describes as follows: &quot;...my liver and an exhaustion so terrible that it still has not left me (?)&quot;

=== Life in Amsterdam ===

The last of Clamence&#x27;s monologues takes place in his apartment in the (former) Jewish Quarter, and recounts more specifically the events which shaped his current outlook; in this regard his experiences during the Second World War are crucial. With the outbreak of war and the fall of France, Clamence considers joining the French Resistance, but decides that doing so would ultimately be futile. He explains,

Instead, Clamence decides to flee Paris for London, and takes an indirect route there, moving through North Africa; however, he meets a friend while in Africa and decides to stay and find work, eventually settling in Tunis. But after the Allies land in Africa, Clamence is arrested by the Germans and thrown into a concentration camp — &quot;chiefly [as] a security measure,&quot; he assures himself (Camus 343).

While interned, Clamence meets a comrade, introduced to the reader only as &quot;Du Guesclin&quot;, who had fought in the Spanish Civil War, was captured by &quot;the Catholic general&quot;, and now found himself in the hands of the Germans in Africa. These experiences subsequently caused the man to lose his faith in the Catholic Church (and perhaps in God as well); as a form of protest Du Guesclin announces the need for a new Pope — one who will &quot;agree to keep alive, in himself and in others, the community of our sufferings&quot; — to be chosen from among the prisoners in the camp. As the man with &quot;the most failings,&quot; Clamence jokingly volunteers himself, but finds that the other prisoners agree with his appointment. As a result of being selected to lead a group of prisoners as &quot;Pope,&quot; Clamence is afforded certain powers over them, such as how to distribute food and water and deciding who will do what kind of work. &quot;Let&#x27;s just say that I closed the circle,&quot; he confesses, &quot;the day I drank the water of a dying comrade. No, no, it wasn&#x27;t Du Guesclin; he was already dead, I believe, for he stinted himself too much&quot; (Camus 343-4).

Clamence then relates the story of how a famous fifteenth-century painting, a panel from the Ghent Altarpiece known as &quot;The Just Judges&quot;, came into his possession. One evening a regular patron of &quot;Mexico City&quot; entered the bar with the priceless painting and sold it for a bottle of jenever to the bartender who, for a time, displayed the piece prominently on the wall of his bar. (Both the man who sold the painting and the now-vacant place on the wall where it hung are cryptically pointed out at the beginning of the novel.) However, Clamence eventually informs the bartender that the painting is in fact stolen, that police from several countries are searching for it, and offers to keep it for him; the bartender immediately agrees to the proposal. Clamence attempts to justify his possession of the stolen painting in a number of ways, primarily &quot;because those judges are on their way to meet the Lamb, because there is no lamb or innocence any longer, and because the clever rascal who stole the panel was an instrument of the unknown justice that one ought not to thwart&quot; (Camus 346).

Finally, Clamence employs the imagery of the Ghent Altarpiece and &quot;The Just Judges&quot; to explain his self-identification as a &quot;judge-penitent&quot;. This essentially espouses a doctrine of relinquished freedom as a method of enduring the suffering imposed on us by virtue of living in a world without objective truth and one that is therefore, ultimately meaningless. With the death of God, one must also accept by extension the idea of universal guilt and the impossibility of innocence. Clamence&#x27;s argument posits, somewhat paradoxically, that freedom from suffering is attained only through submission to something greater than oneself. Clamence, through his confession, sits in permanent judgment of himself and others, spending his time persuading those around him of their own unconditional guilt. The novel ends on a sinister note: &quot;Pronounce to yourself the words that years later haven&#x27;t ceased to resound through my nights, and which I will speak at last through your mouth: &quot;O young girl, throw yourself again into the water so that I might have a second time the chance to save the two of us!&quot; A second time, eh, what imprudence! Suppose, dear sir, someone actually took our word for it? It would have to be fulfilled. Brr...! the water is so cold! But let&#x27;s reassure ourselves. It&#x27;s too late now, it will always be too late. Fortunately!&quot;

<text>Lord Invader (Rupert Westmore Grant; 13 December 1914 – 15 October 1961) was a prominent calypsonian with a very distinctive, gravelly voice.

He was born in San Fernando, Trinidad. He became active in calypso in the mid-1930s, and was considered a country bumpkin by his contemporaries, because of his humble beginning. It was Grant&#x27;s tailor who gave him his moniker by commenting, &quot;I tell you, Rupert, you should call yourself Lord Invader so when you go up to the city you be invadin&#x27; the capital.&quot; With a new name, in 1937 he went to the capital city of Port of Spain and began his career in earnest.

He competed in many calypso competitions (including the very first Calypso King competition) and recorded for RCA Bluebird. Lured by Decca Records, he travelled to New York City in 1941 with other calypsonians such as Roaring Lion and Atilla the Hun to make records and promote calypso music. He wrote many calypsos; his most famous lyrics, &quot;Rum and Coca-Cola&quot;, were plagiarised by Morey Amsterdam and became a hit for the Andrews Sisters. Invader travelled to New York and sued, eventually winning compensation, although the final settlement allowed Amsterdam to retain his copyright. In the early 1940s, radio stations in the USA refused to play his own version on the grounds of its using the trademarked name, Coca-Cola, and its references to prostitution and alcohol. He stayed in New York for a few years because of the lengthy court case. During his tenure in New York City, he became a fixture in the local calypso scene and recorded many tracks for Moses Asch. Eventually, he won his court case, but did not receive his settlement check for seven years, so he returned to Trinidad in the meantime. He opened a calypso club there and penned and recorded many original songs.

He is often credited with writing &quot;Zombie Jamboree&quot;, although the song was actually written by Lord Intruder (Winston O&#x27;Conner), who released it on the B-side of his 1953 single &quot;Disaster with Police&quot;. It was covered by Conrad Eugene Mauge Jr, who recorded it in 1959 and was also often credited for writing it. The confusion probably stems from the introduction of the version by the Kingston Trio, which mentions &quot;Lord Invader and his Twelve Penetrators&quot;.
At long last, Invader collected his money from his court case, and began to tour the U.S., later expanding to Britain and Europe. In the last half of 1958, he returned to New York City and continued recording for Moses Asch. He continued to return to his homeland for business and pleasure, although he had, with Wilmoth Houdini, made himself one of America&#x27;s most successful calypsonians. On 15 October 1961, Lord Invader died at a Brooklyn, New York hospital. 

The following discs give a good idea of his work:

* &quot;Calypso in New York&quot; (Smithsonian Folkways 40454), released in 2000, is a collection of Invader&#x27;s recordings across his whole career.
* &quot;Calypso at Midnight&quot; and &quot;Calypso After Midnight&quot; come from a live recording organized by Alan Lomax in New York in 1946.
* &quot;Calypso War&quot;, &quot;Kings of Calypso&quot;, and &quot;Trojan Calypso&quot; boxed set all feature the same set of songs recorded in the United Kingdom in the 1950s.
* Folkways Records also have a number of CDs that Invader recorded in the late 1950s in New York, including, &quot;Calypso&quot; (1955), &quot;Calypso Travels,&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Brown Boy in the Ring and Other Children&#x27;s Calypso Songs&quot; (1959).

In 1961, Invader released an atypical LP, &quot;West Indian Folk Songs for Children&quot; (Caedmon Records).

<text>Luxor is a city in Upper Egypt, which includes the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Thebes. Luxor had a population of 263,109 in 2020, with an area of approximately and is the capital of the Luxor Governorate. It is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world.

Luxor has frequently been characterized as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest open-air museum&quot;, as the ruins of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples and tombs of the West Bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. Thousands of tourists from all around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor&#x27;s monuments, contributing greatly to the economy of the modern city. Yusuf Abu al-Haggag is the prominent Muslim historical figure of Luxor.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Luxor&quot; derives from the Arabic , meaning &quot;castle&quot; or &quot;palace&quot;, in the plural form &quot;al-quṣūr&quot; (“the palaces&quot;). It may be equivalent to the Greek and Coptic toponym τὰ Τρία Κάστρα &quot;ta tria kastra&quot; and ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛ̀ⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ &quot;pshomt enkastron&quot; respectively, which both mean &quot;three castles&quot;.

The Sahidic Coptic name &quot;Pape&quot; comes from Demotic &quot;Ỉp.t&quot; meaning &#x27;the adyton,&#x27; which, in turn, is derived from the Egyptian. The Greek forms &quot;Ἀπις&quot; and &quot;Ὠφιεῖον&quot; come from the same source. The Egyptian village of Aba al-Waqf shares the same etymology.

The Greek name is Thebes () or Diospolis. The Egyptian name of the city is &quot;Waset&quot;, also known as &quot;Nut&quot; (), written as i-pA-t:pr and i-p:t-O45-M24-t:N21-Z1.

== History ==

Luxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom, and the city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the ancient Egyptian texts as &quot;wAs.t&quot; (approximate pronunciation: &quot;Waset&quot;), which meant &quot;city of the sceptre&quot;, and later in Demotic Egyptian as &quot;ta jpt&quot; (conventionally pronounced as &quot;tA ipt&quot; and meaning &quot;the shrine/temple&quot;, referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name Karnak, meaning &quot;fortified village&quot;), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them as Thebae. Thebes was also known as &quot;the city of the 100 gates&quot;, sometimes being called &quot;southern Heliopolis&quot; (&#x27;Iunu-shemaa&#x27; in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as &quot;niw.t,&quot; which simply means &quot;city&quot;, and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called &quot;niw.t rst,&quot; &quot;southern city&quot;, as the southernmost of them.

The importance of Luxor started as early as the 11th Dynasty, when the community grew into a thriving city. Montuhotep II, who united Egypt after the troubles of the First Intermediate Period, brought stability to the lands as the city grew in stature. The Pharaohs of the New Kingdom in their expeditions to Kush, in today&#x27;s northern Sudan, and to the lands of Canaan, Phoenicia and Syria saw the city accumulate great wealth and rose to prominence, even on a world scale. Thebes played a major role in expelling the invading forces of the Hyksos from Upper Egypt, and from the time of the 18th Dynasty to the 20th Dynasty, the city had risen as the political, religious and military capital of Ancient Egypt.

The city attracted peoples such as the Babylonians, the Mitanni, the Hittites of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), the Canaanites of Ugarit, the Phoenicians of Byblos and Tyre, and the Minoans from the island of Crete. A Hittite prince from Anatolia even came to marry with the widow of Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun. The political and military importance of the city, however, faded during the Late Period, with Thebes being replaced as political capital by several cities in Northern Egypt, such as Bubastis, Sais and finally Alexandria.

However, as the city of the god Amun-Ra, Thebes remained the religious capital of Egypt until the Greek period. The main god of the city was Amun, who was worshipped together with his wife, the Goddess Mut, and their son Khonsu, the God of the moon. With the rise of Thebes as the foremost city of Egypt, the local god Amun rose in importance as well and became linked to the sun god Ra, thus creating the new &#x27;king of gods&#x27; Amun-Ra. His great temple at Karnak, just north of Thebes, was the most important temple of Egypt right until the end of antiquity.

Later, the city was attacked by Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal who installed a new prince on the throne, Psamtik I. The city of Thebes was in ruins and fell in significance. However, Alexander the Great did arrive at the temple of Amun, where the statue of the god was transferred from Karnak during the Opet Festival, the great religious feast. Thebes remained a site of spirituality up to the Christian era, and attracted numerous Christian monks of the Roman Empire who established monasteries amidst several ancient monuments including the temple of Hatshepsut, now called Deir el-Bahri (&quot;the northern monastery&quot;).

Following the Muslim conquest of Egypt, part of the Luxor Temple was converted from a church to a mosque. This mosque is currently known as the Abu Haggag Mosque today.

The 18th century saw an increase of Europeans visiting Luxor, with some publishing their travels and documenting its surroundings, such as Claude Sicard, Granger, Frederick Louis Norden, Richard Pococke, Vivant Denon and others. By the 20th century, Luxor had become a major tourist destination.

=== Archaeology ===

In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of god Osiris: Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak. According to archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.

On the same day in November 2018, two different discoveries were announced. One was by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities that had found a 13th-century tomb on the West Bank belonging to Thaw-Irkhet-If, the overseer of the mummification shrine at the temple of Mut, and his wife. Five months of excavation work until this point had revealed colorful scenes of the family and 1,000 funerary statues or ushabti. The other discovery was of 1000 ushabti and two sarcophagi each containing a mummy in the TT33 complex by a joint team from the IFAO (French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, Cairo, Egypt) and the University of Strasbourg. One of the sarcophagi was opened in private by Egyptian antiquities officials, while the other, of a female 18th Dynasty woman named Thuya, was opened in front of international media.

In October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists headed by Zahi Hawass revealed an ancient &quot;industrial area&quot; used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts and others still to churn out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, such as inlaid beads, silver rings and gold foil were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity Horus.

In October 2019, the Egyptian archaeological mission unearthed thirty well-preserved wooden coffins (3,000 years old) in front of the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut in El-Assasif Cemetery. The coffins contained mummies of twenty-three adult males, five adult females and two children, who are believed to be from the middle class. According to Hawass, mummies were decorated with mixed carvings and designs, including scenes from Egyptian gods, hieroglyphs, and the Book of the Dead, a series of spells that allowed the soul to navigate in the afterlife. Some of the coffins had the names of the dead engraved on them.

On 8 April 2021, Egyptian archaeologists led by Zahi Hawass found Aten, a 3,400-year-old &quot;lost golden city&quot; near Luxor. It is the largest known city from Ancient Egypt to be unearthed to date. The site was said by Betsy Bryan, professor of Egyptology at Johns Hopkins University to be &quot;the second most important archaeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun&quot;. The site is celebrated by the unearthing crew for showing a glimpse into the ordinary lives of living ancient Egyptians whereas past archaeological discoveries were from tombs and other burial sites. Many artefacts are found alongside the buildings such as pottery dated back to the reign of Amenhotep III, rings and everyday working tools. The site is not completely unearthed as of the 10th of April 2021.

== Geography ==
Approximately 4,000 years ago, a significant alteration in the geography of the Nile River occurred, particularly in the region near modern-day Luxor. This transformation involved the expansion of the floodplain, which increased the availability of arable land. This geographic and environmental shift likely played a crucial role in supporting the agricultural productivity that underpinned the prosperity and stability of ancient Egyptian civilization during that period and over the years.

=== Climate ===
Luxor has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh) like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have the hottest summer days of any other city in Egypt. Aswan and Luxor have nearly the same climate. Luxor is one of the sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are above during summer (June, July, August). During the coolest month of the year, average high temperatures remain above while average low temperatures remain above .

The climate of Luxor has precipitation levels lower than even most other places in the Sahara, with less than of average annual precipitation. The desert city is one of the driest ones in the world, and rainfall does not occur every year. The air in Luxor is more humid than Aswan but still very dry. There is an average relative humidity of 39.9%, with a maximum mean of 57% during winter and a minimum mean of 27% during summer.

The climate of Luxor is extremely clear, bright and sunny year-round, in all seasons, with a low seasonal variation, with about some 4,000 hours of annual sunshine, very close to the maximum theoretical sunshine duration.

In addition, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Qena and Asyut have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in Egypt, with almost difference.

The hottest temperature recorded was on May 15, 1991, which was and the coldest temperature was on February 6, 1989, which was .

== Coptic Catholic Eparchy ==

The Coptic Catholic (Alexandrian Rite) minority established on November 26, 1895 an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Luqsor (Luxor) alias Thebes, on territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt. Its episcopal see is a St. George cathedral in Luxor.

In turn, it lost territory on August 10, 1947 to establish the Eparchy of Assiut and again on 14 September 1981 to establish Sohag.

== Economy ==


The economy of Luxor, like that of many other Egyptian cities, is heavily dependent on tourism. Since 1988, Luxor is the only city that offers hot air balloon rides in Egypt, which is a common activity for tourists. Large numbers of people also work in agriculture, particularly sugarcane. There are also many industries, such as the pottery industry used in eating and many other uses.

The local economy was hit by the Luxor massacre in 1997, in which a total of 64 people (including 59 visiting tourists) were killed, at the time the worst terrorist attack in Egypt (before the Sharm el-Sheikh terrorist attacks). The massacre reduced tourist numbers for several years. Following the 2011 Arab Spring, tourism to Egypt dropped significantly, again affecting local tourist markets. Nineteen Asian and European tourists died when a hot air balloon crashed early on Tuesday, February 26, 2013 near Luxor following a mid-air gas explosion. It was one of the worst accidents involving tourists in Egypt. The casualties included French, British, Hungarian, Japanese nationals and nine tourists from Hong Kong.

To make up for shortfalls of income, many cultivate their own food. Goat&#x27;s cheese, pigeons, subsidized and home-baked bread and homegrown tomatoes are commonplace among the majority of its residents.

== Tourism development ==
A controversial tourism development plan aims to transform Luxor into the biggest vast open-air museum. The master plan envisions new roads, five-star hotels, glitzy shops, and an IMAX theatre. The main attraction is an 11 million dollar project to unearth and restore the long Avenue of Sphinxes that once linked Luxor and Karnak temples. The ancient processional road was built by the pharaoh Amenhotep III and took its final form under Nectanebo I in 400 BCE. Over a thousand sphinx statues lined the road now being excavated which was covered by silt, homes, mosques and churches. Excavation started around 2004.

On 18 April 2019, the Egyptian Government announced the discovery of a previously unopened coffin in Luxor, dated back to 18th dynasty of Upper and Lower Egypt. According to the Minister of Antiquities Khaled al-Anani, it is the biggest rock-cut tomb to be unearthed in the ancient city of Thebes. It is one of the largest, well-preserved tombs ever found near the ancient city of Luxor. On 24 November 2018, this discovery was preceded by the finding of a well-preserved mummy of a woman inside a previously unopened coffin dating back more than 3,000 years.

== Infrastructure ==
===Transport===
Luxor is served by Luxor International Airport.

A bridge was opened in 1998, a few kilometres upstream of the main town of Luxor, allowing ready land access from the east bank to the west bank. Traditionally river crossings have been the domain of several ferry services. The so-called &#x27;local ferry&#x27; (also known as the &#x27;National Ferry&#x27;) continues to operate from a landing opposite the Temple of Luxor.

Transport to sites on the west bank are serviced by taxi drivers who often approach ferry passengers. There are also local cars that reach some of the monuments for 2 L.E., although tourists rarely use them. Alternatively, motorboats line both banks of the Nile all day providing a quicker, but more expensive (50 L.E.), crossing to the other side.

The city of Luxor on the east bank has several bus routes used mainly by locals. Tourists often rely on horse carriages, called &quot;calèches&quot;, for transport or tours around the city. Taxis are plentiful, and reasonably priced, and since the government has decreed that taxis older than 20 years will not be relicensed, there are many modern air-conditioned cabs. Recently, new roads have been built in the city to cope with the growth in traffic.

For domestic travel along the route of the Nile, a rail service operates several times a day. A morning train and sleeping train can be taken from the railway station situated around from Luxor Temple. The line runs between several major destinations, including Cairo to the north and Aswan to the south.

== Luxor University ==

Luxor University, founded in 2019, is a non-profit governmental university that provides programs and courses for students.

<text>The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is the science operations center for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), science operations and mission operations center for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and science operations center for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. STScI was established in 1981 as a community-based science center that is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA). STScI&#x27;s offices are located on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus and in the Rotunda building in Baltimore, Maryland.

In addition to performing continuing science operations of HST and preparing for scientific exploration with JWST and Roman, STScI manages and operates the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), which holds data from numerous active and legacy missions, including HST, JWST, Kepler, TESS, Gaia, and Pan-STARRS.

Most of the funding for STScI activities comes from contracts with NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center but there are smaller activities funded by NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the European Space Agency (ESA).

The staff at STScI consists of scientists (mostly astronomers and astrophysicists), spacecraft engineers, software engineers, data management personnel, education and public outreach experts, and administrative and business support personnel. There are approximately 200 Ph.D. scientists working at STScI, 15 of whom are ESA staff who are on assignment to the HST and JWST project. The total STScI staff consists of about 850 people as of 2021.

STScI operates its missions on behalf of NASA, the worldwide astronomy community, and to the benefit of the public. The science operations activities directly serve the astronomy community, primarily in the form of and (and eventually Roman) observations and grants, but also include distributing data from other NASA and ground-based missions via MAST. The ground system development activities create and maintain the software systems that are needed to provide these services to the astronomy community. STScI&#x27;s public outreach activities provide a wide range of resources for media, informal education venues such as planetariums and science museums, and the general public. STScI also serves as a source of guidance to NASA on a range of optical and UV space astrophysics issues.

The STScI staff interacts and communicates with the professional astronomy community through a number of channels, including participation at the bi-annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society, publication of regular STScI newsletters and the STScI website, hosting user committees and science working groups, and holding several scientific and technical symposia and workshops each year. These activities enable STScI to disseminate information to the telescope user community as well as enabling the STScI staff to maximize the scientific productivity of the facilities they operate by responding to the needs of the community and of NASA.

The STScI conducts all activities required to select, schedule, and implement the science programs of the Hubble Space Telescope. The first step in this process is to support the annual community-led selection of the scientific programs that will be performed with HST. This begins with publishing of the annual Call for Proposals, which specifies the currently supported science instrument capabilities, proposal requirements and the submission deadline. Anyone is eligible to submit a proposal. All proposals are critically peer-reviewed by the Time Allocation Committee (TAC). The TAC consists of about 100 members of the U.S. and international astronomical community, selected to represent a broad range of research expertise needed to evaluate the proposals. Each proposal cycle typically involves reviewing 700 to 1100 proposals. Only 15 - 20% of these proposals will eventually be selected for implementation. The TAC reviews several categories of observing time, as well as proposals for archival, theoretical, and combined research projects between HST and other space-based or ground-based observatories (e.g., Chandra X-ray Observatory and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories). STScI provides all technical and logistical support for these activities. The annual cycle of proposal calls was occasionally altered in duration in years when a HST servicing mission was scheduled.

Proposers fortunate enough to be awarded telescope time, referred to as General Observers (GOs), must then provide detailed requirements needed to schedule and implement their observing programs. This information is provided to STScI on what is called a Phase II proposal. The Phase II proposal specifies instrument operation modes, exposure times, telescope orientations, and so on. The STScI staff provide the web-based software called Exposure Time Calculators (ETCs) that allow GOs to estimate how much observing time any of the onboard detectors will need to accumulate the amount of light required to accomplish their scientific objectives. In addition, the STScI staff carries out all the steps necessary to implement each specific program, as well as plan the entire ensemble of programs for the year. For HST, this includes finding guide stars, checking on bright object constraints, implementing specific scheduling requirements, and working with observers to understand and factor in specific or any non-standard requirements they may have.

=== Observation scheduling ===
Once the Phase II information is gathered, a long-range observing plan is developed that covers the entire year, finding appropriate times to schedule individual observations, and at the same time ensuring effective and efficient use of the telescope through the year. Detailed observing schedules are created each week, including, in the case of HST operations, scheduling the data communication paths via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and generating the binary command loads for uplink to the spacecraft. Adjustments can be made to both long-range and weekly plans in response to Targets of Opportunity (e.g., for transient events like supernovae or coordination with one-of-a-kind events such as comet impact spacecraft). The STScI uses the Min-conflicts algorithm to schedule observation time on the telescope. The STScI is currently developing similar processes for JWST, although the operational details will be very different due to its different instrumentation and spacecraft constraints, and its location at the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrange point (~1.5 million km from Earth) rather than the low Earth orbit (~565 km) used by HST.

=== Flight operations ===
Flight Operations consists of the direct support and monitoring of HST functions in real-time. Real-time daily flight operations for HST include about 4 command load uplinks, about 10 data downlinks, and near continuous health and safety monitoring of the observatory. Real-time operations are staffed around the clock. Flight operations activities for HST are done at NASA&#x27;s GSFC in Greenbelt, Maryland.

=== Science data processing ===
Science data from HST arrive at the STScI a few hours after being downlinked from TDRSS and subsequently passing through a data capture facility at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center. Once at STScI, the data are processed by a series of computer algorithms that convert its format into an internationally accepted standard (known as FITS: Flexible Image Transport System), correct for missing data, and perform final calibration of the data by removing instrumental artifacts. The calibration steps are different for each HST instrument, but as a general rule they include cosmic ray removal, correction for instrument/detector non-uniformities, flux calibration, and application of world coordinate system information (which tells the user precisely where on the sky the detector was pointed). The calibrations applied are the best available at the time the data passes through the pipeline. The STScI is working with instrument developers to define similar processes for Kepler and JWST data.

=== Science data archiving and distribution ===
All HST science data are permanently archived after passing through the calibration pipeline. NASA policy mandates a one-year proprietary period on all data, which means that only the initial proposal team can access the data for the first year after it has been obtained. Subsequent to that year, the data become available to anyone who wishes to access it. Data sets retrieved from the archive are automatically re-calibrated to ensure that the most up-to-date calibration factors and software are applied. The STScI serves as the archive center for all of NASA&#x27;s optical/UV space missions. In addition to archiving and storing HST science data, STScI holds data from 13 other missions including the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). Kepler and JWST science data will be archived and retrieved in similar fashions. The internet serves as the primary user interface to the data archives at STScI (http://archive.stsci.edu). The archive currently holds over 30 terabytes of data. Each day about 11 gigabytes of new data are ingested and about 85 gigabytes of data are distributed to users. The Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA; http://hla.stsci.edu/), currently in development, will act as a more integrated and user-friendly archive. It will provide raw Hubble data as well as higher-level science products (color images, mosaics, etc.).

=== Science instrument calibration and characterization ===
STScI is responsible for in-flight calibration of the science instruments on HST and JWST. For HST, a calibration plan for the observatory is developed each year. This plan is designed to support the selected GO observation programs for that cycle, as well as to provide a basic calibration that spans the lifetime of each instrument. The calibration program includes measurements that are made relative to on-board calibration sources or to assess internal detector noise levels as well as observations of astronomical standard stars and fields, needed to determine absolute flux conversions and astrometric transformations. The external calibrations on HST typically total 5-10% of the GO observing program, with more time required when an instrument is still relatively new. HST has had a total of 12 science instruments to date, 6 of which are currently active. Two new instruments were installed during the May 2009 HST servicing mission STS-125. Electronic failures in STIS (in 2001) and in the ACS Wide-Field Channel (in 2007) were also repaired on-orbit in May 2009, bringing these instruments back to active status. All 12 HST instruments plus the 4 planned for JWST are summarized in the table below. HST instruments can detect light with wavelengths from the ultraviolet through the near infrared. JWST instruments will operate from the red-end of optical wavelengths (~6000 Angstroms) to the mid-infrared (5 to 27 micrometres). Instruments listed as decommissioned are no longer on board.

STScI staff develops the calibration proposals, shepherd them through the scheduling process, and analyze the data they produce. These programs provide updated calibration and reference files to be used in the data processing pipeline. The calibration files are also archived so users can retrieve them if they need to manually recalibrate their data. All calibration activity and results are documented, usually in the form of Instrument Science Reports posted to the public website, and occasionally in the form of published papers. Results are also incorporated into the Data Handbooks and Instrument Handbooks.

In addition to calibration of the instruments, STScI staff characterizes and documents the performance of the instrument, so users can better understand how to interpret their data. These are generally effects that are not automatically corrected for in the pipeline (because they vary with time or depend on the brightness of the source). They include global effects, such as charge transfer efficiency in the charge-coupled devices, as well as effects specific to modes and filters, such as filter &quot;ghosts&quot; (caused by subtle scattering of light within an instrument). Awareness of these effects can come from STScI staff as they analyze calibration programs, or from observers who find oddities in their data and provide feedback to STScI.

The STScI staff also performs the characterization and calibration of the telescope itself. In the case of HST, this has evolved to primarily be a matter of monitoring and adjusting focus, and monitoring and measuring point spread functions. (In the early 1990s, the STScI was responsible for accurate measurement of the spherical aberration, necessary for the corrective optics of all subsequent instruments). In the case of JWST, the STScI will be responsible for using the wavefront sensor system developed by JPL and Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST, the NASA contractor building the observatory) to monitor and adjust the segmented telescope.

=== Post observation support ===
The post observation support includes a HelpDesk that users can contact to answer their questions about any aspect of observing – from how to submit a proposal to how to analyze the data.

=== Science community service ===
The STScI performs large HST science programs on behalf of the community. These are programs with broad scientific applications. To date, these programs include the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), the Hubble Deep Field South (HDFS), and the Ultra Deep Field (UDF). The raw and processed data for these observations are made available to the astronomy community nearly immediately. These products have then been used by many astronomers in pursuit of their own research topics, and have motivated a great deal of follow-up work (see, for example, http://www.stsci.edu/ftp/science/hdf/clearinghouse/clearinghouse.html and http://www.stsci.edu/hst/udf/index_html).

=== Ground systems ===
STScI is responsible for developing, enhancing, and maintaining most of the ground systems used to carry out our Hubble science operations described above. These systems originally (1980s, early 1990s) came from several sources, including in-house STScI developments and work done under NASA contracts with various vendors. Over HST&#x27;s lifetime substantial work has been done on these systems - even while they were supporting daily operations of Hubble. They have been integrated into a more effective and easier to operate end-to-end system. They have been through major technology upgrades (e.g., improved operating systems and computer hardware, higher capacity archive storage media). They have also been modified to support the succession of instruments installed in the telescope. In the last several years, they have been modified to support WFC3 and COS, the two new instruments that will be installed during the next HST servicing mission, and to support the 2-Gyroscope mode of HST operations. STScI also provides subsets of ground system services to other astronomy missions, including FUSE, Kepler, and JWST. STScI&#x27;s software engineers maintain about 7,900,000 source lines of code.

=== Mission development and operations support ===
STScI routinely participates with NASA and industry system engineers and scientists in developing the overall mission architecture. For HST, this includes helping to determine and prioritize servicing mission activities and development of the servicing strategy. For JWST, this includes participating in the definition of high-level science requirements and the overall architecture for the mission. In both cases, the STScI focuses on the scientific capabilities of the mission, and also the requirements for smooth and efficient operations of the observatory.

=== Scientific research activities ===
STScI manages the selection of the Hubble Fellowship Program. Since 1990, Hubble Fellowships support outstanding postdoctoral scientists whose research is broadly related to the scientific mission of the Hubble Space Telescope. In 2009, it was combined with the Spitzer Fellowship that since 2002 had been associated with the Spitzer Space Telescope and science program. It now supports fellows undertaking research associated with all missions within the Cosmic Origins theme: the Herschel Space Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The research may be theoretical, observational, or instrumental. Each year, since HST&#x27;s launch in 1990, 8 to 12 fellowships are awarded; from 2009 it hovers about 16. STScI also sponsors a summer student intern program that allows talented undergraduate students from around the world to work with the institute&#x27;s scientific staff, providing these students with hands-on experience in state-of-the-art astronomical research. STScI&#x27;s full-time scientific staff conducts original research spanning a broad range of astrophysics including investigations of the Solar System, exoplanet detection and characterization, star formation, galaxy evolution, and physical cosmology. STScI hosts an annual scientific symposium held each spring as well as several smaller scientific workshops. The employment of an active scientific staff at STScI helps to ensure that HST, and eventually JWST, perform at peak capability.

=== Public outreach ===
STScI&#x27;s Office of Public Outreach (OPO) provides a wide array of products and services designed to share and communicate the science and discoveries of HST, JWST, Roman, and astronomy in general with the general public. OPO&#x27;s efforts focus on meeting the needs of the media, the informal science education community, and the general public.

OPO produces approximately 40 new press releases each year featuring HST discoveries and science results. These media packages include news stories, Hubble images, explanatory artwork, animations, and supplementary information for use by print, broadcast, and online media. OPO also participates in press conferences for particularly newsworthy discoveries, and conducts science writers&#x27; workshops for in-depth sessions with scientists working on current astrophysical research problems.

In addition to news releases, OPO develops a variety of astronomy-related products and features for use by the general public and informal education venues including museums, science centers, planetariums, and libraries. These include background articles, telescope imagery, illustrations, diagrams, infographics, videos, scientific visualizations, virtual reality, and interactives. Most of these resources are distributed via websites developed and managed by STScI, including Hubblesite, Webbtelescope, ViewSpace, and Illuminated Universe. Content is also distributed via social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

OPO also conducts outreach via live events in person and online. These include a regular Public Lecture Series as well as attendance at various local and national STEM events. OPO also provides support to informal education venues in the form of print materials, program/event resources, and professional development.

OPO&#x27;s outreach efforts are conducted in partnership with the Hubble, Webb, and Roman mission offices and with other institutions under NASA&#x27;s Universe of Learning.

<text>David Fraser Nolan (; November 23, 1943 – November 21, 2010) was an American activist and politician. He was one of the founders of the Libertarian Party of the United States, having hosted the meeting in 1971 at which the Party was founded. Nolan subsequently served the party in a number of roles including National Committee Chair, editor of the party newsletter, Chair of the By-laws Committee, Chair of the Judicial Committee, and Chair of the Platform Committee.

He is also known as the inventor of the Nolan Chart, an attempt to improve on the left versus right political taxonomy by separating the issues of economic freedom and social freedom and presenting them on a two-dimensional plane instead of the traditional line. Decades after its introduction, it continues to be popular, with millions of copies having been distributed, including by the group Advocates for Self-Government as the &quot;World&#x27;s Smallest Political Quiz&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Nolan was born on November 23, 1943, in Washington, D.C., and grew up in Maryland. During high school, he was influenced by Ayn Rand and Robert A. Heinlein and their libertarianism. He enrolled at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating with a BS in political science in 1965. While at MIT, he helped in founding M.I.T. Students for Goldwater in 1964, promoting the Republican presidential candidacy of Senator Barry Goldwater.

== Career ==
Nolan was a member of Young Americans for Freedom in 1969 when more than 300 libertarians organized to take control of the organization from conservatives. Many walked out after a physical confrontation sparked by the burning of a draft card in protest to a conservative proposal against draft resistance. While sympathizing with the radicals, Nolan remained with the organization.
Nolan believed that in August 1971, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s imposition of wage and price controls and closing the foreign gold window along with his belief that the Vietnam War was both ill-considered and illegal, were three of the final straws for Nolan and his group of initial founders of the Libertarian Party. Nolan and his group had initiated a Committee the previous July, Committee to Form a Libertarian Party, and joined forces with a previous demonstration Libertarian Party project and non-partisan political efforts of the now Liberty International. The group organized among a number of libertarians, including the International Society for Individual Liberty, which had been formed by dissident members of Young Americans for Freedom and European libertarians. They officially founded the Libertarian Party on December 11, 1971.

He ran unsuccessfully as a Libertarian for the United States House of Representatives in the 2006 Arizona&#x27;s 8th congressional district election and received 1.9% of the vote. He also ran as the Libertarian candidate in the 2010 United States Senate election in Arizona, and received 63,000 votes, 4.7% of the total.

In the last few years of his life, especially after much of the Libertarian Party&#x27;s platform was deleted in an organized &quot;no confidence&quot; effort by &quot;reformers&quot; in 2006, Nolan was sharply critical of the direction the party had taken, accusing party leaders of abandoning its radical roots and being &quot;absorbed with minutia&quot; and too focused on winning elections. &quot;They&#x27;re afraid to say anything that might scare people, because that might keep people from voting for them,&quot; he told Lew Rockwell in a December 2008 radio interview. &quot;It&#x27;s become a very timid organization in the last six or eight years.&quot;

In 2009, Nolan publicly endorsed the Free State Project, an attempt to move 20,000 Libertarians to New Hampshire to experience &quot;Liberty in their Lifetimes&quot;.

Nolan died of a stroke in Tucson, Arizona, on November 21, 2010.

<text>Patient rights consist of enforceable duties that healthcare professionals and healthcare business persons owe to patients to provide them with certain services or benefits. When such services or benefits become rights instead of simply privileges, then a patient can expect to receive them and can expect the support of people who enforce organization policies or legal codes to intervene on the patient&#x27;s behalf if the patient does not receive them. A patient&#x27;s bill of rights is a list of guarantees for those receiving medical care. It may take the form of a law or a non-binding declaration. Typically a patient&#x27;s bill of rights guarantees patients information, fair treatment, and autonomy over medical decisions, among other rights.

== India ==
Under the direction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), India&#x27;s National Human Rights Commission drafted a Charter of Patients&#x27; Rights in 2018. Following a recommendation by the National Council of Clinical Establishments, MOHFW submitted the draft in the public domain for comments and suggestions in August 2018.

The Charter draws upon different provisions relevant to patients&#x27; rights that were previously scattered across the Constitution of India, the Drugs and Cosmetic Act of 1940, the Clinical Establishment Act of 2010, and various judgments by the Supreme Court of India, among other sources. The Charter aims to:

# provide a reference for State Governments to enact or modify existing regulation.
# provide a framework of healthcare standards for service providers.
# And, raise awareness among patients about their rights.

=== Recognized patients&#x27; rights ===
The Charter of Patients&#x27; Rights lists seventeen rights that patients are entitled to:

* Right to information: Every patient has the right to know what is the illness that they are suffering, its causes, the status of the diagnosis (provisional or confirmed), expected costs of treatment. Furthermore, service providers should communicate this in a manner that is understandable for the patient.
* Right to records and reports: The patient has the right to access his/her medical records and investigation reports. Service providers should make these available upon the patients&#x27; payment of any photocopy fees as applicable.
* Right to emergency care: Public and private hospitals have an obligation to provide emergency medical care regardless of the patients&#x27; capacity to pay for the services.
* Right to informed consent: Patients have the right to be asked for their informed consent before submitting to potentially hazardous treatment. Physicians should clearly explain the risks from receiving the treatment and only administer the treatment after getting explicit written consent from the patient.
* Right to confidentiality, human dignity and privacy: Doctors should observe strict confidentiality of a patient&#x27;s condition, with the only exception of potential threats to public health. In case of a physical inspection by a male doctor on a female patient, the latter has the right to have a female person present throughout the procedure. Hospitals also have an obligation to secure patient information from any external threats.
* Right to second opinion: Patients are entitled to seek a second opinion and hospitals should facilitate any information or records that the patient requires to do so.
* Right to transparency in rates, and care according to prescribed rates wherever relevant: Hospitals should display the rates that they charge in a visible manner and patients should receive an itemized bill when payment is required. Essential medicines, devices and implants should comply with rates established by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA).
* Right to non-discrimination: Service providers cannot deny treatment on the basis of gender, caste, religion, age, sexual orientation or social origins. Additionally, it is against the Charter to deny treatment on the basis of a patients&#x27; health condition, including HIV status.
* Right to safety and quality care according to standards: Hospitals must ensure a hygienic and sanitized environment to provide their services.
* Right to choose alternative treatment options if available: Patients have the right to consider treatment alternatives and even refuse treatment.
* Right to choose source for obtaining medicines or tests: Any registered pharmacy and laboratory is eligible to provide patients with goods and services they require.
* Right to proper referral and transfer, which is free from perverse commercial influences: In case of transfers or referrals, the patient has the right to an explanation that justifies the transfer, as well as confirmation from the hospital receiving the patient about their acceptance of the transfer.
* Right to protection for patients involved in clinical trials: Clinical trials should comply with all the standards and protocols under the Directorate General of Health Services.
* Right to protection of participants involved in biomedical and health research: Studies involving patients should follow the National Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical and Health Research Involving Human Participants.
* Right to take discharge of patient, or receive body of deceased from hospital: Patients have the right to be discharged and may not be detained at a health service provider facility because of procedural reasons such as payment disputes.
* Right to Patient Education: In addition to information about their condition, patients have the right to know about public health services such as insurance schemes and charitable hospitals.
* Right to be heard and seek redressal: feedback and comments to their health service providers and file complaints as required. They additionally have the right to redressal in cases where any of their rights are violated.

== Morocco ==
Morocco has expressed its interest in recognizing the right to health for the entire population, a right rooted in the Islamic religion.

==United Kingdom==
In the UK, the Patient&#x27;s Charter was introduced and revised in the 1990s. It was replaced by the NHS Constitution for England in 2013.

==United States==
In the United States there have been a number of attempts to enshrine a patient&#x27;s bill of rights in law, including a bill rejected by Congress in 2001.

===Bill of 2001===

The United States Congress considered a bill designed to safeguard patients&#x27; rights in 2001. The &quot;Bipartisan Patient Protection Act&quot; (S.1052), sponsored by Senators Edward Kennedy and John McCain, contained new rules for what health maintenance organizations had to cover and granted new rights for patients to sue in state or federal courts, if they are denied needed care.

The House of Representatives and Senate passed differing versions of the proposed law. Although both bills would have provided patients key rights, such as prompt access to emergency care and medical specialists, only the Senate-passed measure would provide patients with adequate means to enforce their rights. The Senate&#x27;s proposal would have conferred a broad array of rights on patients. It would have ensured that patients with health care plans had the right to:
*have their medical decisions made by a doctor;
*see a medical specialist;
*go to the closest emergency room;

The bill was passed by the US Senate by a vote of 59–36 in 2001, it was then amended by the House of Representatives and returned to the Senate. Reportedly, president Bush threatened to veto the bill if it included the Senate&#x27;s provision to allow patients to sue managed care organizations in the state and federal courts.

===Industry resistance===

Wendell Potter, former senior executive at Cigna-turned-whistleblower, has written that the insurance industry worked to kill &quot;any reform that might interfere with insurers&#x27; ability to increase profits&quot; by engaging in extensive and well-funded anti-reform campaigns. The industry, he says, &quot;goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view,&quot; including the use of &quot;front groups&quot;.

== The ethical responsibility of health professionals to respect patients&#x27; rights ==
By highlighting the ethical responsibility of health care professionals towards their patients, basic principles are mentioned, such as self-esteem, prevention of harm, promotion of well-being and justice. These principles play an essential role in guiding medical decisions, helping healthcare providers care for the well-being of patients while maintaining their decision-making capacity, thus achieving a fundamental balance between medical ethics and the commitment of health professionals to patients

<doc id="177102" wikidata="Q13417770" url="?curid=177102" title="Marx's theory of alienation">
<text>Karl Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation describes the separation and estrangement of people from their work, their wider world, their human nature, and their selves. Alienation is a consequence of the division of labour in a capitalist society, wherein a human being&#x27;s life is lived as a mechanistic part of a social class.

The theoretical basis of alienation is that a worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of these actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realised human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the bourgeoisie—who own the means of production—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of surplus value in the course of business competition among industrialists.

The theory, while found throughout Marx&#x27;s writings, is explored most extensively in his early works, particularly the &quot;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844&quot;, and in his later working notes for &quot;Capital&quot;, the &quot;Grundrisse&quot;. Marx&#x27;s theory draws heavily from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and from &quot;The Essence of Christianity&quot; (1841) by Ludwig Feuerbach. Max Stirner extended Feuerbach&#x27;s analysis in &quot;The Ego and its Own&quot; (1845), claiming that even the idea of &#x27;humanity&#x27; is itself an alienating concept. Marx and Friedrich Engels responded to these philosophical propositions in &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1845).

==Two forms of alienation==
In his writings from the early 1840s, Karl Marx uses the German words &quot;Entfremdung&quot; (&quot;alienation&quot; or &quot;estrangement&quot;, derived from &#x27;fremd&#x27;, which means &quot;alien&quot;) and &quot;Entäusserung&quot; (&quot;externalisation&quot; or &quot;alienation&quot;, which alludes to the idea of relinquishment or surrender) to suggest an unharmonious or hostile separation between entities that naturally belong together.

The concept of alienation has two forms: &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot;. Alienation is &quot;subjective&quot; when human individuals feel &quot;estranged&quot; or do not feel at home in the modern social world. By this account, alienation consists in an individuals&#x27; experience of his or her life as meaningless, or his/herself as worthless. &quot;Objective&quot; alienation, by contrast, makes no reference to the beliefs or feelings of human beings. Rather, human beings are objectively alienated when they are hindered from developing their essential human capacities.

For Marx, objective alienation is the cause of subjective alienation: individuals experience their lives as lacking meaning or fulfilment because modern society does not promote the deployment of their human capacities. 

Marx derives this concept from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whom he credits with significant insight into the basic structure of the modern social world, and how it is disfigured by alienation. Hegel&#x27;s view is that, in the modern social world, objective alienation has already been vanquished, as the institutions of the rational or modern state enable individuals to fulfill themselves. Hegel believes that the family, civil society, and the political state facilitate people&#x27;s actualization, both as individuals and members of a community. Nonetheless, there still exists widespread subjective alienation, where people feel estranged from the modern social world, or do not recognize modern society as a home. Hegel&#x27;s project is not to reform or change the institutions of the modern social world, but to change the way in which society is understood by its members.

Marx shares Hegel&#x27;s belief that subjective alienation is widespread, but denies that the modern state enables individuals to actualize themselves. Marx instead takes widespread subjective alienation to indicate that objective alienation has not yet been overcome.

== Dimensions of alienated labour ==
Marx stated that in a capitalist society, workers are alienated from their labour - they cannot decide on their own productive activities, nor can they use or own the value of what they produce. In the &quot;Notes on James Mill&quot; (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings . . . In my &quot;production&quot; I would have objectified my &quot;individuality&quot;, its &quot;specific character&quot;, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an &quot;individual manifestation of my life&quot; during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to &quot;be objective, visible to the senses&quot;, and, hence, a power &quot;beyond all doubt&quot;. ... Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.

In the first manuscript of the &quot;Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844,&quot; Marx identifies four interrelated dimensions of alienated labour: alienated labour alienates the worker, first, from the product of his labour; second, from his own activity; third, from what Marx, following Feuerbach, calls species-being; and fourth, from other human beings.

=== From a worker&#x27;s product ===
Marx begins with an account of man&#x27;s alienation from the products of his labour. In work, a worker &quot;objectifies&quot; his labour in the object that he produces. The objectification of a worker&#x27;s labour is simultaneously its alienation. The worker loses control of the product to the owner of the means of production, the capitalist. The product&#x27;s sale by the capitalist further reinforces the capitalist&#x27;s power of wealth over the worker. The worker thus relates to the product as an alien object, which dominates and enslaves him. The products of his labour constitute a separate world of objects, which is alien to him. The worker creates an object, which appears to be his property. However, he now becomes its property. Where in earlier historical epochs, one person ruled over another, now the thing rules over the person, the product over the producer.

The design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the capitalist class who besides accommodating the worker&#x27;s manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the engineer and the industrial designer who create the product in order to shape the taste of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal profit. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol, alienation (&quot;Entfremdung&quot;) broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a use value (the product), into a commodity, which—like products—can be assigned an exchange value. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts this labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also reifies labour into the &quot;concrete&quot; concept of &quot;work&quot; (a job), for which the worker is paid wages— at the lowest-possible rate— that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist&#x27;s investment capital; this is an aspect of exploitation. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the rentier capitalist, who owns the means of production.

=== From a worker&#x27;s productive activity ===

In the capitalist mode of production, the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for &quot;a job well done.&quot; By means of commodification, the labor power of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (&quot;Entfremdung&quot;) of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labour and the wages paid to him for the labour. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms: wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not &quot;voluntary but coerced&quot; (forced labour). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of private property in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labour. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist.

The worker &quot;[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself;&quot; &quot;[l]abor is external to the worker,&quot; it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work &quot;mortifies his body and ruins his mind.&quot; The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, &quot;labour is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being. A person&#x27;s mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, &quot;the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else&#x27;s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another.&quot; This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labour&#x27;s form and direction belong to someone else.

=== From a worker&#x27;s &quot;Gattungswesen&quot; (species-being) ===
The &quot;Gattungswesen&quot; (&#x27;species-being&#x27; or &#x27;human nature&#x27;), of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person.

Conceptually, in the term &quot;species-essence&quot;, the word &quot;species&quot; describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterised by a &quot;plurality of interests&quot; and &quot;psychological dynamism,&quot; whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realise a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as &quot;the subject&quot; and an idea of the thing that they produce, &quot;the object.&quot; Conversely, unlike a human being, an animal does not objectify itself as &quot;the subject&quot; nor its products as ideas, &quot;the object,&quot; because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a conscious intention. Whereas a person&#x27;s &quot;Gattungswesen&quot; does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualised when an individual— within their given historical circumstance— is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.

==== Relations of production ====
Whatever the character of a person&#x27;s consciousness (will and imagination), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon cooperation with others, thus, a person&#x27;s consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organised themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the means of production. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the relations of production of that &quot;status quo&quot; the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian feudalism superseded by mercantilism, in turn superseded by the Industrial Revolution—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favoured the social class who controlled the technologies (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (&quot;Gattungswesen&quot;) and the system of values of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged &quot;status quo&quot; of production-relations.

Despite the ideological promise of industrialisation—that the mechanisation of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honourable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (&quot;Gattungswesen&quot;) of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialised system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanisation and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant bourgeois capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. As a result of this exploitation, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the relations of production to the means of production—from a capitalist mode of production to a communist mode of production. In the resultant communist society, the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker&#x27;s labour; the worker&#x27;s humanity (&quot;Gattungswesen&quot;) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated.

In the communist socio-economic organisation, the relations of production would operate the mode of production and employ each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, minimum-wage &quot;job&quot; meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the objectified productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker&#x27;s abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the collective ownership of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfil the interests of the working class—and thus to an individual&#x27;s own interest and benefit— will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.

=== From other workers ===
Capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial commodity that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the means of production establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of capital. The capitalist economy&#x27;s arrangement of the relations of production provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for &quot;higher wages&quot;, thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a false consciousness, which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist bourgeoisie through its cultural hegemony. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of religion in justifying the relations of production facilitates the realisation and then worsens the alienation (&quot;Entfremdung&quot;) of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being &quot;the opiate of the masses&quot;.

The concept of alienation does not originate with Marx. Marx&#x27;s two main influences in his use of the term are Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach.

=== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ===
For Hegel, alienation consists in an &quot;unhappy consciousness&quot;. By this term, Hegel means a misunderstood form of Christianity, or a Christianity that hasn&#x27;t been interpreted according to Hegel&#x27;s own pantheism.
In &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human &quot;Geist&quot; (&#x27;spirit&#x27;), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel&#x27;s human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of idealism— &quot;spiritual ignorance&quot; and &quot;self-understanding&quot;— are replaced with material categories, whereby &quot;spiritual ignorance&quot; becomes &quot;alienation&quot; and &quot;self-understanding&quot; becomes man&#x27;s realisation of his &quot;Gattungswesen&quot; (species-essence).
=== Ludwig Feuerbach ===

The middle-period writings of Ludwig Feuerbach, where he critiques Christianity and philosophy, are pre-occupied with the problem of alienation. In these works, Feuerbach argues that an inappropriate separation of individuals from their essential human nature is at the heart of Christianity. 

Feuerbach believes the alienation of modern individuals consists in their holding false beliefs about God. God is not an objective being, but is instead a projection of man&#x27;s own essential predicates. Christian belief entails the sacrifice, the practical denial or repression, of essential human characteristics. Feuerbach characterises his own work as having a therapeutic goal – healing the painful separation at the heart of alienation.

===&quot;Entfremdung&quot; and the theory of history ===

In Part I: &quot;Feuerbach – Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook&quot; of &quot;The German Ideology&quot; (1846), Karl Marx said the following:Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence.

That humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their self-actualisation as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the capitalist mode of production eventually will exploit and impoverish the proletariat until compelling them to social revolution for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of Marxist humanism. In &quot;The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism&quot; (1992), Raya Dunayevskaya discusses and describes the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.

===&quot;Entfremdung&quot; and social class ===

In Chapter 4 of &quot;The Holy Family&quot; (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each social class experiences alienation in a different form: The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in this self-estrangement, it recognises estrangement as its own power, and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.

== Criticism ==
In discussion of &quot;aleatory materialism&quot; (&quot;matérialisme aléatoire&quot;) or &quot;materialism of the encounter,&quot; French philosopher Louis Althusser criticised a teleological (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx&#x27;s theory of alienation because it rendered the proletariat as the subject of history; an interpretation tainted with the absolute idealism of the &quot;philosophy of the subject,&quot; which he criticised as the &quot;bourgeois ideology of philosophy&quot;.

<text>Macromedia, Inc. was an American graphics, multimedia, and web development software company headquartered in San Francisco, California, that made products such as Flash and Dreamweaver. It was purchased by its rival Adobe Systems on December 3, 2005.

==History==
Macromedia was formed from the April 1992 merger of Authorware Inc. (makers of Authorware) and MacroMind–Paracomp (makers of MacroMind Director). At the time, analysts estimated the multimedia software industry to be worth $200 million, and the combined company would control 20% of the market. Tim Mott of MacroMind was named chairman and chief executive officer and Bud Colligan of Authorware became president and CEO of the new company. 

Director, an interactive multimedia-authoring tool used to make presentations, animations, CD-ROMs and information kiosks, served as the company&#x27;s flagship product. Director was used in the creation of many multimedia projects, training programs and presentations for American Airlines, AT&amp;T, and Kellogg&#x27;s, and even Hollywood films like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;The Firm&quot;. Authorware was Macromedia&#x27;s principal product in the interactive learning market.

By 1993, Macromedia was considered the largest supplier of multimedia development tools. The increased demand in CD-ROM players and multimedia experiences helped Macromedia turn a profit. Analysts estimated that Macromedia had 1992 revenues of about $30 million. 

As the Internet moved from a university research medium to a commercial network, Macromedia began working to web-enable its existing tools and develop new products. In 1995, it introduced Shockwave Player, a free Director plugin for Netscape Navigator to display interactive content on the web. Macromedia licensed Sun&#x27;s Java Programming Language in October 1995. 

===Acquisition of FreeHand===
In January 1995, Macromedia acquired Altsys Corporation, developer of the vector-drawing program FreeHand and font editor Fontographer. Adobe Systems had acquired Aldus Corporation, which held the marketing rights to FreeHand. Because of the program&#x27;s similarities with Adobe Illustrator, Altsys protested the sale and the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint in October 1994, ordering the divestiture of FreeHand back to Altsys. The company then sold itself to Macromedia. 

With Macromedia&#x27;s acquisition of Altsys, it received FreeHand thus expanding its product line of multimedia graphics software to include illustration and design graphics software. FreeHand&#x27;s vector graphics rendering engine and other software components within the program would prove useful to Macromedia in the development of Fireworks. 

Despite early success, Macromedia&#x27;s stock ultimately plateaued at $63.75 per share in December 1995. By 1997, shares fell as low as $7.13 per share. Rob Burgess was brought on as president in 1996. He laid off 10% of the company&#x27;s staff, discontinued many products, and put a larger focus on web development. 

===Dreamweaver===
In March 1996, Macromedia acquired iBand Inc., developer of the Backstage family of dynamic web development tools, for $32 million. Macromedia developed a new HTML-authoring tool, Dreamweaver, around portions of the Backstage codebase and released the first version in December 1997. 

At the time, most professional web authors preferred to code HTML by hand using text editors because they wanted full control over the source. Dreamweaver addressed this with its &quot;Roundtrip HTML&quot; feature, which attempted to preserve the fidelity of hand-edited source code during visual edits, allowing users to work back and forth between visual and code editing. 

Over the next few years Dreamweaver became widely adopted among professional web authors, though many still preferred to hand-code, and Microsoft FrontPage remained a strong competitor among amateur and business users. By October 1999, Nearly 66% of professional web site developers used Dreamweaver.

===Flash===
Macromedia acquired FutureWave Software, makers of FutureSplash Animator, in January 1997. FutureSplash Animator was an animation tool originally developed for pen-based computing devices. Because of the small size of the FutureSplash Viewer application, it was particularly suited for download over the Internet, where most users, at the time, had low-bandwidth connections. Macromedia renamed Splash to Macromedia Flash and distributed the Flash Player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share. 

By April 1998, the company released the technical specifications for its Flash format so other programs could view and edit its files. Burgess took over as CEO in July 1998, after founder Bud Colligan stepped down. By December, Macromedia was stable again.

Hoping to remain a major player in the increasingly interactive web, Flash Player 6.0 shipped in March 2002 and featured enhanced audio, video, and user interface capabilities. Macromedia also released a bundle of its internet applications in June.

By 2005, more computers worldwide had the Flash Player installed than any other Web media format, including Java, QuickTime, RealNetworks, and Windows Media Player. 

As Flash matured, Macromedia&#x27;s focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a Web application platform, adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint.

===Other acquisitions===

In July 1999, Macromedia acquired Elemental Software, gaining control of Drumbeat 2000 and eStore Builder. The company also bought web site monitoring and personalization software developer Andromedia for $245 million that December to expand into e-commerce. It further inked alliances with web consulting and marketing services firm USWeb/CKS and e-commerce platform developer Broadvision.

Web development company Allaire was acquired in 2001 and Macromedia added several popular servers and Web developments tools to its portfolio, including ColdFusion, a web application server based on the CFML language, JRun, a Java EE application server, and HomeSite, an HTML code editor that was also bundled with Dreamweaver. By 2002, Macromedia had produced more than 20 products and had 30 offices in 13 countries.

In 2003, Macromedia acquired the web conferencing company Presedia and continued to develop and enhance their Flash-based online collaboration and presentation product offering under the brand Breeze. Later that year, Macromedia also acquired help authoring software company eHelp Corporation, whose products included RoboHelp and RoboDemo (now Adobe Captivate).

===Purchase by Adobe===
On April 18, 2005, Adobe Systems announced an agreement to acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at approximately $3.4 billion on the last trading day before the announcement. The acquisition took place on December 3, 2005, and Adobe integrated the company&#x27;s operations, networks, and customer care organizations shortly thereafter.

===Lawsuits===
On August 22, 1997, stockholders filed a class-action lawsuit in the California Superior Court in San Francisco, accusing Macromedia of misleading stockholders on the company&#x27;s product success and financial health. A similar suit had been filed a month earlier. The class-action suit was dismissed by a federal judge on May 19, 1998.

On August 10, 2000, Adobe claimed that Macromedia violated two of its patents on tabbed palettes. Macromedia countered with a claim that Adobe infringed on Macromedia&#x27;s patents for a draw-based editor for Web pages and a hierarchical structure editor for Web sites. In July 2002, Adobe and Macromedia reached an agreement that settled all claims in this series of patent suits. Eventually, Adobe acquired Macromedia 3 years later.

== Shockwave.com ==
Hoping to push into entertainment, Macromedia launched the ShockRave website in February 1998, in partnership with MTV. The website featured interactive music videos, puzzles, games, and animated cartoons. In May 1999, Macromedia launched Shockwave.com to promote the capabilities of Flash and Shockwave. It featured music, comics, and games, supported offline downloads, and even offered a premium version called Shockmachine. South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were contracted to create an original animated series for the website in exchange for equity in the company.

In December 1999, the company managed to secure $44 million in funding from Sequoia Capital to support its six million users. By this point, it was estimated that 100 million people had installed the company&#x27;s Shockwave and Flash players. In October 1999, Macromedia announced it would spinoff Shockwave as an independent company. CEO Rob Burgess initially stayed on with both companies. Macromedia maintained a majority stake in Shockwave.com until December 2000, when it merged with AtomFilms.

<doc id="177111" wikidata="Q579262" url="?curid=177111" title="Error function">
<text>In mathematics, the error function (also called the Gauss error function), often denoted by , is a function formula_1 defined as:
formula_2
{\sqrt\pi} + C&lt;/math&gt;
| taylor_series = formula_3

The integral here is a complex contour integral which is path-independent because formula_4 is holomorphic on the whole complex plane formula_5. In many applications, the function argument is a real number, in which case the function value is also real.

In some old texts,
the error function is defined without the factor of formula_6.
This nonelementary integral is a sigmoid function that occurs often in probability, statistics, and partial differential equations. 

In statistics, for non-negative real values of , the error function has the following interpretation: for a real random variable that is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation formula_7, is the probability that falls in the range .

Two closely related functions are the complementary error function formula_8 is defined as

formula_9

and the imaginary error function formula_10 is defined as

formula_11

where is the imaginary unit.

==Name==
The name &quot;error function&quot; and its abbreviation were proposed by J. W. L. Glaisher in 1871 on account of its connection with &quot;the theory of Probability, and notably the theory of Errors.&quot; The error function complement was also discussed by Glaisher in a separate publication in the same year.
For the &quot;law of facility&quot; of errors whose density is given by
formula_12
(the normal distribution), Glaisher calculates the probability of an error lying between and as:
formula_13
==Applications==
When the results of a series of measurements are described by a normal distribution with standard deviation and expected value 0, then formula_14 is the probability that the error of a single measurement lies between and , for positive . This is useful, for example, in determining the bit error rate of a digital communication system.

The error and complementary error functions occur, for example, in solutions of the heat equation when boundary conditions are given by the Heaviside step function.

The error function and its approximations can be used to estimate results that hold with high probability or with low probability. Given a random variable (a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation ) and a constant , it can be shown via integration by substitution:
formula_15

where and are certain numeric constants. If is sufficiently far from the mean, specifically , then:

formula_16

so the probability goes to 0 as .

The probability for being in the interval can be derived as
formula_17

The property means that the error function is an odd function. This directly results from the fact that the integrand is an even function (the antiderivative of an even function which is zero at the origin is an odd function and vice versa).

Since the error function is an entire function which takes real numbers to real numbers, for any complex number :
formula_18
where is the complex conjugate of &quot;z&quot;.

The integrand formula_19 and are shown in the complex -plane in the figures at right with domain coloring.

The error function at is exactly 1 (see Gaussian integral). At the real axis, approaches unity at and −1 at . At the imaginary axis, it tends to .
===Taylor series===
The error function is an entire function; it has no singularities (except that at infinity) and its Taylor expansion always converges. For , however, cancellation of leading terms makes the Taylor expansion unpractical.

The defining integral cannot be evaluated in closed form in terms of elementary functions (see Liouville&#x27;s theorem), but by expanding the integrand into its Maclaurin series and integrating term by term, one obtains the error function&#x27;s Maclaurin series as:
formula_20
which holds for every complex number . The denominator terms are sequence in the OEIS.

For iterative calculation of the above series, the following alternative formulation may be useful:
formula_21
because expresses the multiplier to turn the th term into the th term (considering as the first term).

The imaginary error function has a very similar Maclaurin series, which is:
formula_22
which holds for every complex number .

===Derivative and integral===
The derivative of the error function follows immediately from its definition:
formula_23
From this, the derivative of the imaginary error function is also immediate:
formula_24
An antiderivative of the error function, obtainable by integration by parts, is
formula_25
An antiderivative of the imaginary error function, also obtainable by integration by parts, is
formula_26
Higher order derivatives are given by
formula_27
where are the physicists&#x27; Hermite polynomials.

===Bürmann series===

An expansion, which converges more rapidly for all real values of than a Taylor expansion, is obtained by using Hans Heinrich Bürmann&#x27;s theorem:
formula_28
where is the sign function. By keeping only the first two coefficients and choosing and , the resulting approximation shows its largest relative error at , where it is less than 0.0034361:
formula_29

===Inverse functions===
Given a complex number , there is not a &quot;unique&quot; complex number satisfying , so a true inverse function would be multivalued. However, for , there is a unique &quot;real&quot; number denoted satisfying
formula_30

The inverse error function is usually defined with domain , and it is restricted to this domain in many computer algebra systems. However, it can be extended to the disk of the complex plane, using the Maclaurin series
formula_31
where and
formula_32

So we have the series expansion (common factors have been canceled from numerators and denominators):
formula_33
(After cancellation the numerator and denominator values in and respectively; without cancellation the numerator terms are values in .) The error function&#x27;s value at  is equal to .

For , we have formula_34.

The inverse complementary error function is defined as
formula_35
For real , there is a unique &quot;real&quot; number satisfying formula_36. The inverse imaginary error function is defined as .

For any real &quot;x&quot;, Newton&#x27;s method can be used to compute , and for , the following Maclaurin series converges:
formula_37
where is defined as above.

===Asymptotic expansion===
A useful asymptotic expansion of the complementary error function (and therefore also of the error function) for large real is
formula_38
where is the double factorial of , which is the product of all odd numbers up to . This series diverges for every finite , and its meaning as asymptotic expansion is that for any integer one has
formula_39
where the remainder is
formula_40
which follows easily by induction, writing
formula_41
and integrating by parts.

The asymptotic behavior of the remainder term, in Landau notation, is
formula_42
as . This can be found by 
formula_43
For large enough values of , only the first few terms of this asymptotic expansion are needed to obtain a good approximation of (while for not too large values of , the above Taylor expansion at 0 provides a very fast convergence).

===Continued fraction expansion===
A continued fraction expansion of the complementary error function was found by Laplace:
formula_44

===Factorial series===
The inverse factorial series:
formula_45
converges for formula_46. Here
formula_47
 denotes the rising factorial, and denotes a signed Stirling number of the first kind.
There also exists a representation by an infinite sum containing the double factorial:

formula_49
which also defines , the scaled complementary error function (which can be used instead of to avoid arithmetic underflow). Another form of for is known as Craig&#x27;s formula, after its discoverer:
formula_50
This expression is valid only for positive values of , but it can be used in conjunction with to obtain for negative values. This form is advantageous in that the range of integration is fixed and finite. An extension of this expression for the of the sum of two non-negative variables is as follows:

Consequently, the error function is also closely related to the Q-function, which is the tail probability of the standard normal distribution. The Q-function can be expressed in terms of the error function as
formula_56

The inverse of is known as the normal quantile function, or probit function and may be expressed in terms of the inverse error function as
formula_57

The standard normal cdf is used more often in probability and statistics, and the error function is used more often in other branches of mathematics.

The error function is a special case of the Mittag-Leffler function, and can also be expressed as a confluent hypergeometric function (Kummer&#x27;s function):

<text>A memory management unit (MMU), sometimes called paged memory management unit (PMMU), is a computer hardware unit that examines all memory references on the memory bus, translating these requests, known as virtual memory addresses, into physical addresses in main memory.

In modern systems, programs generally have addresses that access the theoretical maximum memory of the computer architecture, 32 or 64 bits. The MMU maps the addresses from each program into separate areas in physical memory, which is generally much smaller than the theoretical maximum. This is possible because programs rarely use large amounts of memory at any one time.

Most modern operating systems (OS) work in concert with an MMU to provide virtual memory (VM) support. The MMU tracks memory use in fixed-size blocks known as &quot;pages&quot;, and if a program refers to a location in a page that is not in physical memory, the MMU will cause an interrupt to the operating system. The OS will then select a lesser-used block in memory, write it to backing storage such as a hard drive if it has been modified since it was read in, read the page from backing storage into that block, and set up the MMU to map the block to the originally requested page so the program can use it. This is known as demand paging. Some simpler real-time operating systems do not support virtual memory and do not need an MMU, but still need a hardware memory protection unit.

Modern MMUs generally perform additional memory-related tasks as well. Memory protection blocks attempts by a program to access memory it has not previously requested, which prevents a misbehaving program from using up all memory or malicious code from reading data from another program. They also often manage a processor cache, which stores recently accessed data in a very fast memory and thus reduces the need to talk to the slower main memory. In some implementations, they are also responsible for bus arbitration, controlling access to the memory bus among the many parts of the computer that desire access.

Prior to VM systems becoming widespread in the 1990s, earlier MMU designs were more varied. Common among these was paged translation, which was similar to modern demand paging in that it used fixed-size blocks, but had a fixed-size list of pages that divided up memory; this meant that the block size was a function of the number of pages and the installed memory. Another common technique, found mostly on larger machines, was segmented translation, which allowed for variable-size blocks of memory that better mapped onto program requests. This was efficient but did not map as well onto virtual memory. Some early systems, especially 8-bit systems, used very simple MMUs to perform bank switching.

== Overview ==
Modern MMUs typically divide the virtual address space (the range of addresses used by the processor) into pages, each having a size which is a power of 2, usually a few kilobytes, but they may be much larger. Programs reference memory using the natural address size of the machine, typically 32 or 64-bits in modern systems. The bottom bits of the address (the offset within a page) are left unchanged. The upper address bits are the virtual page numbers.

Most MMUs use an in-memory table of items called a page table, containing one page table entry (PTE) per virtual page, to map virtual page numbers to physical page numbers in main memory. Multi-level page tables are often used to reduce the size of the page table. An associative cache of PTEs is called a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main memory every time a virtual address is mapped.

Other MMUs may have a private array of memory, registers, or static RAM that holds a set of mapping information.

The virtual page number may be directly used as an index into the page table or other mapping information, or it may be further divided, with bits at a given level used as an index into a table of lower-level tables into which bits at the next level down are used as an index, with two or more levels of indexing.

The physical page number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address.

A page table entry or other per-page information may also include information about whether the page has been written to (the &quot;dirty bit&quot;), when it was last used (the &quot;accessed bit&quot;, for a least recently used (LRU) page replacement algorithm), what kind of processes (user mode or supervisor mode) may read and write it, and whether it should be cached.

Sometimes, a page table entry or other per-page information prohibits access to a particular virtual page, perhaps because no physical random-access memory (RAM) has been allocated to that virtual page. In this case, the MMU signals a page fault to the CPU. The operating system (OS) then handles the situation, perhaps by trying to find a spare frame of RAM and set up the page map to map it to the requested virtual address. If no RAM is free, it may be necessary to choose an existing page (known as a &quot;victim&quot;), using some replacement algorithm, and save it to disk (a process called &quot;paging&quot;). With some MMUs, there can also be a shortage of PTEs, in which case the OS will have to free one for the new mapping.

The MMU may also generate illegal access error conditions or invalid page faults upon illegal or non-existing memory accesses, respectively, leading to segmentation fault or bus error conditions when handled by the operating system.

=== Benefits ===
In some cases, a page fault may indicate a software bug, which can be prevented by using memory protection as one of key benefits of an MMU: an operating system can use it to protect against errant programs by disallowing access to memory that a particular program should not have access to. Typically, an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space.

A paged MMU also mitigates the problem of &quot;external fragmentation&quot; of memory. After blocks of memory have been allocated and freed, the free memory may become fragmented (discontinuous) so that the largest contiguous block of free memory may be much smaller than the total amount. With virtual memory, a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory; this non-contiguous allocation is one of the benefits of paging.

However, paged mapping causes another problem, &quot;internal fragmentation&quot;. This occurs when a program requests a block of memory that does not cleanly map into a page, for instance, if a program requests a 1 KB buffer to perform file work. In this case, the request results in an entire page being set aside even though only 1 KB of the page will ever be used; if pages are larger than 1 KB, the remainder of the page is wasted. If many small allocations of this sort are made, memory can be used up even though much of it remains empty.

In some early microprocessor designs, memory management was performed by a separate integrated circuit such as the VLSI Technology VI475 (1986), the Motorola 68851 (1984) used with the Motorola 68020 CPU in the Macintosh II, or the Z8010 and Z8015 (1985) used with the Zilog Z8000 family of processors. Later microprocessors (such as the Motorola 68030 and the Zilog Z280) placed the MMU together with the CPU on the same integrated circuit, as did the Intel 80286 and later x86 microprocessors.

===Older concepts===
While this article concentrates on modern MMUs, commonly based on demand paging, early systems used base and bounds addressing that further developed into segmentation, or used a fixed set of blocks instead of loading them on demand. The difference between these two approaches is the size of the contiguous block of memory; paged systems break up main memory into a series of equal sized blocks, while segmented systems generally allow for variable sizes.

====Segmented translation====
Early memory management systems, often implemented in software, set aside a portion of memory to hold a series of mappings. These consisted of pairs of values, the &quot;base&quot; and &quot;limit&quot;, although many other terms have been used. When the operating system requested memory to load a program, or a program requested more memory to hold data from a file for instance, it would call the memory handling library. This examined the mappings to look for an area in main memory large enough to hold the request. If such a block was found, a new entry was entered into the table. From then on, when that program accessed memory, all of its addresses were offset by the base value. When the program is done with the memory it requested and releases, or the program exits, the entries associated with it are released.

This style of access, over time, became common in the mainframe market and was known as &quot;segmented translation&quot;, although a variety of terms are used here as well. This style has the advantage of simplicity; the memory blocks are continuous and thus only the two values, base and limit, need to be stored. Each entry corresponds to a block of memory used by a single program, and the translation is invisible to the program, which sees main memory starting at address zero and extending to some fixed value.

The disadvantage of this approach is that it leads to an effect known as &quot;external fragmentation&quot;. This occurs when memory allocations are released but are non-contiguous. In this case, enough memory may be available to handle a request, but this is spread out and cannot be allocated. On systems where programs start and stop over time, this can eventually lead to memory being highly fragmented and no large blocks remaining. A number of algorithms were developed to address this problem.

Segmenting was widely used on microcomputer platforms of the 1980s. Among the MMUs that used this concept were the Motorola 68451 and Signetics 68905, but many other examples exist. It was also supported in software implementations; one example is Apple&#x27;s MultiFinder, released in 1987 for the Macintosh platform. Each program was allocated an amount of memory that was pre-selected in the Finder and translation from virtual to physical was accomplished within the programs using handles.

A more common example is the Intel 8088 used in the IBM PC. This implemented a very simple MMU inside the CPU, with four processor registers holding base values accessed directly by the program. These mapped only the upper 4 bits of the 20-bit address, and there was no equivalent of a limit, which was simply the lower 16-bits of the address and thus a fixed 64 kB. Later entries in the x86 architecture series used different approaches.

====Segmentation plus paging====
Some systems, such as the GE 645 and its successors, used both segmentation and paging. The table of segments, instead of containing per-segment entries giving the physical base address and length of the segment, contains entries giving the physical base address of a page table for the segment, in addition to the length of the segment. Physical memory is divided into fixed-size pages, and the same techniques used for purely page-based demand paging are used for segment-and-page-based demand paging.

====Paged translation====
Another approach to memory handling is to break up main memory into a contiguous series of fixed-sized blocks. This is similar to the modern demand paging system in that the result is a series of pages, but in these earlier systems the list of pages is fixed in size and normally stored in some form of fast memory like static RAM to improve performance. In this case, the two parts of the address stored by the MMU are known as the &quot;segment number&quot; and &quot;page index&quot;.

Consider a processor design with 24-bit addressing, like the original Motorola 68000. In such a system, the MMU splits the virtual address into parts, for instance, the 13 least significant bits for the page index and the remaining 11 most significant bits as the segment number. This results a list of 2048 pages of 8 kB each. In this approach, memory requests result in one or more pages being granted to that program, which may not be contiguous in main memory. The MMU maintains a list of page number originally expressed by the program and the actual page number in main memory. When it attempts to access memory, the MMU reads the segment number from the processor&#x27;s memory bus, finds the corresponding entry for that program in its internal memory, and expresses the mapped version of the value on the memory&#x27;s bus while the lower bits of the original address are passed through unchanged. Like the segmented case, programs see its memory as a single contiguous block.

There are two disadvantages to this approach. The first is that as the virtual address space expands, the amount of memory needed to hold the mapping increases as well. For instance, in the 68020 the addresses are 32-bits wide, meaning the segment number for the same 8 kB page size is now the upper 19 bits and the mapping table expands to 512 kB in size, far beyond what could be implemented in hardware for reasonable cost in the 1980s. This problem can be reduced by making the pages larger, say 64 kB instead of 8. Now the page index uses 16 bits and the resulting page table is 64 kB, which is more tractable. Moving to a larger page size leads to the second problem, increased internal fragmentation. A program that generates a series of requests for small block will be assigned large blocks and thereby waste large amounts of memory.

The paged translation approach was widely used by microprocessor MMUs in the 1970s and early 80s, including the Signetics 68905 (which could operate in either mode). Both Signetics and Philips produced a version of the 68000 that combined the 68905 on the same physical chip, the 68070. 

Another use of this technique is to expand the size of the physical address when the virtual address is too small. For instance, the PDP-11 originally had a 16-bit address that made it too small as memory sizes increased in the 1970s. This was addressed by expanding the physical memory bus to 18-bits, and using an MMU to add two more bits based on other pins on the processor bus to indicate which program was accessing memory.

Another use of this same technique, although not referred to as paging but bank switching, was widely used by early 8-bit microprocessors like the MOS 6502. For instance, the Atari MMU would express additional bits on the address bus to select among several &quot;banks&quot; of DRAM memory based on which of the chips was currently active, normally the CPU or ANTIC. This was used to expand the available memory on the Atari 130XE to 128 kB. The Commodore 128 used a similar approach.

==Examples==
Most modern systems divide memory into pages that are in size, often with the capability to use so-called huge pages of or in size (often both variants are possible). Page translations are cached in a translation lookaside buffer (TLB). Some systems, mainly older RISC designs, trap into the OS when a page translation is not found in the TLB. Most systems use a hardware-based tree walker. Most systems allow the MMU to be disabled, but some disable the MMU when trapping into OS code.

=== IBM System/360 Model 67, IBM System/370, and successors ===
The IBM System/360 Model 67, which was introduced August, 1965, included an MMU called a dynamic address translation (DAT) box. It has the unusual feature of storing accessed and dirty bits outside of the page table (along with the four bit protection key for all S/360 processors). They refer to physical memory rather than virtual memory, and are accessed by special-purpose instructions. This reduces overhead for the OS, which would otherwise need to propagate accessed and dirty bits from the page tables to a more physically oriented data structure. This makes OS-level virtualization, later called paravirtualization, easier.

Starting in August, 1972, the IBM System/370 has a similar MMU, although it initially supported only a 24-bit virtual address space rather than the 32-bit virtual address space of the System/360 Model 67. It also stores the accessed and dirty bits outside the page table. In early 1983, the System/370-XA architecture expanded the virtual address space to 31 bits, and in 2000, the 64-bit z/Architecture was introduced, with the address space expanded to 64 bits; those continue to store the accessed and dirty bits outside the page table.

=== VAX ===
VAX pages are 512 bytes, which is very small. An OS may treat multiple pages as if they were a single larger page. For example, Linux on VAX groups eight pages together. Thus, the system is viewed as having pages. The VAX divides memory into four fixed-purpose regions, each in size. They are:
;P0 space: Used for general-purpose per-process memory such as heaps.
;P1 space: (Or control space) which is also per-process and is typically used for supervisor, executive, kernel, user stacks and other per-process control structures managed by the operating system.
;S0 space: (Or system space) which is global to all processes and stores operating system code and data, whether paged or not, including pagetables.
;S1 space: Which is unused and &quot;Reserved to Digital&quot;.

Page tables are big linear arrays. Normally, this would be very wasteful when addresses are used at both ends of the possible range, but the page tables for P0 and P1 space are stored in the paged S0 space. Thus, there is effectively a two-level tree, allowing applications to have sparse memory layout without wasting a lot of space on unused page table entries. Unlike page table entries in most MMUs, page table entries in the VAX MMU lack an accessed bit. OSes which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently. Typically, the OS will periodically unmap pages so that page-not-present faults can be used to let the OS set an accessed bit.

=== ARM ===
ARM architecture-based application processors implement an MMU defined by ARM&#x27;s virtual memory system architecture. The current architecture defines PTEs for describing and pages, sections and super-sections; legacy versions also defined a tiny page. ARM uses a two-level page table if using and pages, or just a one-level page table for sections and sections.

TLB updates are performed automatically by page table walking hardware. PTEs include read/write access permission based on privilege, cacheability information, an NX bit, and a non-secure bit.

=== DEC Alpha ===
DEC Alpha processors divide memory into , , , or ; the page size is dependent on the processor. pages. After a TLB miss, low-level firmware machine code (here called PALcode) walks a page table.

The OpenVMS AXP PALcode and DEC OSF/1 PALcode walk a three-level tree-structured page table. Addresses are broken down into an unused set of bits (containing the same value as the uppermost bit of the index into the root level of the tree), a set of bits to index the root level of the tree, a set of bits to index the middle level of the tree, a set of bits to index the leaf level of the tree, and remaining bits that pass through to the physical address without modification, indexing a byte within the page. The sizes of the fields are dependent on the page size; all three tree index fields are the same size. The OpenVMS AXP PALcode supports full read and write permission bits for user, supervisor, executive, and kernel modes, and also supports fault on read/write/execute bits are also supported. The DEC OSF/1 PALcode supports full read and write permission bits for user and kernel modes, and also supports fault on read/write/execute bits are also supported.

The Windows NT AXP PALcode can either walk a single-level page table in a virtual address space or a two-level page table in physical address space. The upper 32 bits of an address are ignored. For a single-level page table, addresses are broken down into a set of bits to index the page table and remaining bits that pass through to the physical address without modification, indexing a byte within the page. For a two-level page table, addresses are borken down into a set of bits to index the root level of the tree, a set of bits to index the top level of the tree, a set of bits to index the leaf level of the tree, and remaining bits that pass through to the physical address without modification, indexing a byte within the page. The sizes of the fields are dependent on the page size. The Windows NT AXP PALcode supports a page being accessible only from kernel mode or being accessible from user and kernel mode, and also supports a fault on write bit.

===MIPS===

The MIPS architecture supports one to 64 entries in the TLB. The number of TLB entries is configurable at CPU configuration before synthesis. TLB entries are dual. Each TLB entry maps a virtual page number (VPN2) to either one of two page frame numbers (PFN0 or PFN1), depending on the least significant bit of the virtual address that is not part of the page mask. This bit and the page mask bits are not stored in the VPN2. Each TLB entry has its own page size, which can be any value from to in multiples of four. Each PFN in a TLB entry has a caching attribute, a dirty and a valid status bit. A VPN2 has a global status bit and an OS assigned ID which participates in the virtual address TLB entry match, if the global status bit is set to zero. A PFN stores the physical address without the page mask bits.

A TLB refill exception is generated when there are no entries in the TLB that match the mapped virtual address. A TLB invalid exception is generated when there is a match but the entry is marked invalid. A TLB modified exception is generated when a store instruction references a mapped address and the matching entry&#x27;s dirty status is not set. If a TLB exception occurs when processing a TLB exception, a double fault TLB exception, it is dispatched to its own exception handler.

MIPS32 and MIPS32r2 support 32 bits of virtual address space and up to 36 bits of physical address space. MIPS64 supports up to 64 bits of virtual address space and up to 59 bits of physical address space.

===Sun MMU===
The original Sun-1 is a single-board computer built around the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and introduced in 1982. It includes the original Sun 1 memory management unit that provides address translation, memory protection, memory sharing and memory allocation for multiple processes running on the CPU. All access of the CPU to private on-board RAM, external Multibus memory, on-board I/O and the Multibus I/O runs through the MMU, where address translation and protection are done in a uniform fashion. The MMU is implemented in hardware on the CPU board.

The MMU consists of a context register, a segment map and a page map. Virtual addresses from the CPU are translated into intermediate addresses by the segment map, which in turn are translated into physical addresses by the page map. The page size is and the segment size is which gives 16 pages per segment. Up to 16 contexts can be mapped concurrently. The maximum logical address space for a context is or The maximum physical address that can be mapped simultaneously is also 

The context register is important in a multitasking operating system because it allows the CPU to switch between processes without reloading all the translation state information. The 4-bit context register can switch between 16 sections of the segment map under supervisor control, which allows 16 contexts to be mapped concurrently. Each context has its own virtual address space. Sharing of virtual address space and inter-context communications can be provided by writing the same values in to the segment or page maps of different contexts. Additional contexts can be handled by treating the segment map as a context cache and replacing out-of-date contexts on a least-recently used basis.

The context register makes no distinction between user and supervisor states. Interrupts and traps do not switch contexts, which requires that all valid interrupt vectors always be mapped in page 0 of context, as well as the valid supervisor stack.

The Sun-2 workstations are similar; they are built around the Motorola 68010 microprocessor and have a similar memory management unit, with pages and segments. The context register has a 3-bit system context used in supervisor state and a 3-bit user context used in user state.

The Sun-3 workstations, except for the Sun-3/80, Sun-3/460, Sun-3/470, and Sun-3/480, are built around the Motorola 68020, and have a similar memory management unit. The page size is increased to . (The later models are built around the Motorola 68030 and use the 68030&#x27;s on-chip MMU.)

The Sun-4 workstations are built around various SPARC microprocessors, and have a memory management unit similar to that of the Sun-3 workstations.

=== PowerPC ===

In PowerPC G1, G2, G3, and G4 pages are normally After a TLB miss, the standard PowerPC MMU begins two simultaneous lookups. One lookup attempts to match the address with one of four or eight data block address translation (DBAT) registers, or four or eight instruction block address translation registers (IBAT), as appropriate. The BAT registers can map linear chunks of memory as large as and are normally used by an OS to map large portions of the address space for the OS kernel&#x27;s own use. If the BAT lookup succeeds, the other lookup is halted and ignored.

The other lookup, not directly supported by all processors in this family, is via a so-called inverted page table, which acts as a hashed off-chip extension of the TLB. First, the top four bits of the address are used to select one of 16 segment registers. Then 24 bits from the segment register replace those four bits, producing a 52-bit address. The use of segment registers allows multiple processes to share the same hash table.

The 52-bit address is hashed, then used as an index into the off-chip table. There, a group of eight-page table entries is scanned for one that matches. If none match due to excessive hash collisions, the processor tries again with a slightly different hash function. If this, too, fails, the CPU traps into OS (with MMU disabled) so that the problem may be resolved. The OS needs to discard an entry from the hash table to make space for a new entry. The OS may generate the new entry from a more normal tree-like page table or from per-mapping data structures which are likely to be slower and more space-efficient. Support for no-execute control is in the segment registers, leading to granularity.

A major problem with this design is poor cache locality caused by the hash function. Tree-based designs avoid this by placing the page table entries for adjacent pages in adjacent locations. An operating system running on the PowerPC may minimize the size of the hash table to reduce this problem.

It is also somewhat slow to remove the page table entries of a process. The OS may avoid reusing segment values to delay facing this, or it may elect to suffer the waste of memory associated with per-process hash tables. G1 chips do not search for page table entries, but they do generate the hash, with the expectation that an OS will search the standard hash table via software. The OS can write to the TLB. G2, G3, and early G4 chips use hardware to search the hash table. The latest chips allow the OS to choose either method. On chips that make this optional or do not support it at all, the OS may choose to use a tree-based page table exclusively.

=== x86 ===
The x86 architecture has evolved over a very long time while maintaining full software compatibility, even for OS code. Thus, the MMU is extremely complex, with many different possible operating modes.

The 8086/8088 and 80186/80188 have no memory management unit; they support segmentation, but only to support more physical memory than a 16-bit address can support, as the segment number, in a segment register, is multiplied by 16 and added to the segment offset to generate a physical address.

The 80286 added an MMU that supports segmentation, but not paging. When segmentation is enabled by turning on protected mode, the segment number acts as an index into a table of segment descriptors; a segment descriptor contains a base physical address, a segment length, a presence bit to indicate whether the segment is currently in memory, permission bits, and control bits, If the offset in the segment is within the bounds specified by the segment descriptor, that offset is added to the base physical address to generate a physical address.

The 80386, which introduced the 32-bit IA-32 version of x86, and subsequent x86 CPUs, support segmentation and paging. If paging is enabled, the base address in a segment descriptor is an address in a linear paged address space divided into pages, so when that is added to the offset in the segment, the resulting address is a linear address in that address space; in IA-32, that address is then masked to be no larger than 32 bits. The result may be looked up via a tree-structured page table, with the bits of the address being split as follows: 10 bits for the branch of the tree, 10 bits for the leaves of the branch, and the 12 lowest bits being directly copied to the result. 

Segment registers, used in pre-80386 CPUs to extend the address space, are not used in modern OSes, with one major exception: access to thread-specific data for applications or CPU-specific data for OS kernels, which is done with explicit use of the FS and GS segment registers. All memory access involves a segment register, chosen according to the code being executed. Except when using FS or GS, the OS ensures that the offset will be zero. Some operating systems, such as OpenBSD with its W^X feature, and Linux with the Exec Shield or PaX patches, may also limit the length of the code segment, as specified by the CS register, to disallow execution of code in modifiable regions of the address space.

Minor revisions of the MMU introduced with the Pentium have allowed very large pages by skipping the bottom level of the tree (this leaves 10 bits for indexing the first level of page hierarchy with the remaining 10+12 bits being directly copied to the result). Minor revisions of the MMU introduced with the Pentium Pro introduced the physical address extension (PAE) feature, enabling 36-bit physical addresses with 2+9+9 bits for three-level page tables and 12 lowest bits being directly copied to the result. Large pages () are also available by skipping the bottom level of the tree (resulting in 2+9 bits for two-level table hierarchy and the remaining 9+12 lowest bits copied directly). In addition, the page attribute table allowed specification of cacheability by looking up a few high bits in a small on-CPU table.

No-execute support was originally only provided on a per-segment basis, making it very awkward to use. More recent x86 chips provide a per-page NX bit (no-execute bit) in the PAE mode. The W^X, Exec Shield, and PaX mechanisms described above emulate per-page non-execute support on machines x86 processors lacking the NX bit by setting the length of the code segment, with a performance loss and a reduction in the available address space.

x86-64, the 64-bit version of the x86 architecture, almost entirely removes segmentation in favor of the flat memory model used by almost all operating systems for the 386 or newer processors. In long mode, all segment offsets are ignored, except for the FS and GS segments; linear addresses are 64-bit rather than 32-bit, with the lowest 48 bits of the address being significant. When used with pages, the page table tree has four levels instead of three, to handle the larger linear addresses; in some newer x86-64 processors, a fifth page table level can be enabled, to support 57-bit linear addresses. In all levels of the page table, the page table entry includes an NX bit.

48-bit linear addresses are divided as follows: 16 bits unused, nine bits each for four tree levels (for a total of 36 bits), and the 12 lowest bits directly copied to the result. With pages, there are only three levels of page table, for a total of 27 bits used in paging and 21 bits of offset. Some newer CPUs also support a page with two levels of paging and of offset. CPUID can be used to determine if pages are supported.

In all three cases, the bits are required to be equal to the 48th bit, or in other words, the low are sign extended to the higher bits. This is done to allow further expansion of the addressable range, without compromising backwards compatibility.

57-bit linear addresses are divided as follows: 7 bits unused, nine bits each for five tree levels (for a total of 45 bits), and the 12 lowest bits directly copied to the result. The low are sign extended.

==Alternatives==

===Burroughs B5000 series, B6x00/B7x00/B5900/A-series/Unisys MCP systems===

The Burroughs B5000 from 1961 was the first commercial system to support virtual memory (after the Atlas), has no need for an external MMU. The B5000 and its successors up to current Unisys ClearPath MCP (Libra) systems provide the two functions of an MMU — virtual memory addresses and memory protection — with a different architectural approach. Rather than add virtual memory onto a processor not designed for virtual memory, it is integrated in the core design of the processor/system so there is no requirement for an external unit to add functionality of address translation or bounds checking, resulting in unprecedented memory safety and security.

First, in the mapping of virtual memory addresses, instead of needing an MMU, the machines are descriptor-based. The uppermost bit of a 48-bit memory word in the Burroughs B5000 series systems indicate whether the word is an user data or a descriptor/control word; descriptors were read-only to user processes and could only be updated by the system (hardware or operating system). Memory words in the B6x00/B7x00/B5900/A-series/Unisys MCP systems have 48 data bits and 3 tag bits (and later systems to current have 4 tag bits) words whose tag is an odd number are read-only to user processes – descriptors have a tag of 5 and code words have a tag of 3.

Each allocated memory block is given a master descriptor with the properties of the block — physical address, size, and whether it is present in main memory or not, in which case on first access the block must be allocated, or if there is an address, it is an address on secondary storage and must be loaded to main memory. All references to code and data are made using a descriptor. When a request is made to access the block for reading or writing, the hardware checks its presence via the presence bit (pbit) in the descriptor.

A pbit of 1 indicates the presence of the block. In this case, the block can be accessed via the physical main-memory address in the descriptor. If the pbit is zero, a pbit interrupt is generated for the MCP (operating system) to make the block present. If the address field is zero, this is the first access to this block, and it is allocated (an init (initial) pbit). If the address field is non-zero, it is a disk address of the block, which has previously been rolled out — the block is fetched from disk, the pbit is set to one and the physical memory address updated to point to the block in memory. This makes descriptors equivalent to a page-table entry in an MMU system, but descriptors are free of a table.

System performance can be monitored through the number of pbit interrupts, which is the count of accesses to descriptors with a zero bit. &#x27;Init&#x27; pbits indicate initial allocations or new memory blocks, but a high level of &#x27;other&#x27; pbits indicate that the system had to load a block from virtual memory secondary storage. In normal operation this will not occur very much. If there are above average number of other pbits occurring the system might be thrashing, indicating system overload. In production systems, the machine load will be more constant and thus the system configured or tuned to avoid thrashing.

All memory allocation is therefore completely automatic (one of the features of modern systems) and there is no way to allocate blocks other than this mechanism. There are no such calls as malloc or dealloc, since memory blocks are also automatically allocated on pbit interrupt or discarded. The scheme is also lazy, since a block will not be allocated until it is actually referenced. When memory is nearly full, the MCP examines the working set, trying compaction (since the system is segmented, not paged), deallocating read-only segments (such as code-segments which can be restored from their original copy) and, as a last resort, rolling dirty (that is updated) data segments out to disk.

Another way these systems provide a function of a MMU is in protection. Since all accesses are via the descriptor, the hardware can check that all accesses are within bounds and, in the case of a write, that the process has write permission. The MCP system is inherently secure and thus has no need of an MMU to provide this level of memory protection.

Blocks can be shared between processes via copy descriptors in process stacks (a stack is a special system structure representing the execution state of a process). Thus, some processes may have write permission, whereas others do not. Code segments are read-only, thus reentrant and shared between processes. Copy descriptors contain a 20-bit address field giving index of the master descriptor in the master descriptor array. This also implements a very efficient and secure Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanism. Blocks can easily be relocated, since only the master descriptor needs update when a block&#x27;s status changes.

Another aspect is performance do MMU-based or non-MMU-based systems provide better performance? MCP systems may be implemented on top of standard hardware that does have an MMU (for example, a standard PC). Even if the system implementation uses the MMU in some way, this will not be at all visible at the MCP level.

<text>The Macintosh II is a personal computer designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from March 1987 to January 1990. Based on the Motorola 68020 32-bit CPU, it is the first Macintosh supporting color graphics. When introduced, a basic system with monitor and 20 MB hard drive cost . With a 13-inch color monitor and 8-bit display card, the price was about . This placed it in competition with workstations from Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard.

The Macintosh II was the first computer in the Macintosh line without a built-in display; a monitor rested on top of the case like the IBM Personal Computer and Amiga 1000. It was designed by hardware engineers Michael Dhuey (computer) and Brian Berkeley (monitor) and industrial designer Hartmut Esslinger (case).

Eighteen months after its introduction, the Macintosh II was updated with a more powerful CPU and sold as the Macintosh IIx. In early 1989, the more compact Macintosh IIcx was introduced at a price similar to the original Macintosh II, and by the beginning of 1990 sales stopped altogether. Motherboard upgrades to turn a Macintosh II into a IIx or Macintosh IIfx were offered by Apple.

== Development ==
Two common criticisms of the original Macintosh, starting from its introduction in 1984, were the closed architecture and lack of color; rumors of a potential color Macintosh began almost immediately.

The Macintosh II project was begun by Dhuey and Berkeley during 1985 without the knowledge of Apple co-founder and Macintosh division head Steve Jobs, who opposed expansion slots and color, on the basis that expansion slots complicated the user experience and that color did not conform to WYSIWYG, as color printers were not common. Jobs instead wanted higher-resolution monochrome displays such as the ones chosen for his own &quot;BigMac&quot; project begun in 1984 to develop a Macintosh successor.

Initially referred to as &quot;Little Big Mac&quot;, the Macintosh II was codenamed &quot;Milwaukee&quot; after Dhuey&#x27;s hometown, and it later went through a series of new names. After Jobs was ousted by Apple in September 1985, the Milwaukee project could proceed openly (while Jobs&#x27; own BigMac project was cancelled).

The Macintosh II was introduced at the AppleWorld 1987 conference in Los Angeles, with low-volume initial shipments starting two months later. Retailing for US $5,498, the Macintosh II was the first modular Macintosh model, so called because it came in a horizontal desktop case like many IBM PC compatibles of the time. Previous Macintosh computers use an all-in-one design with a built-in black-and-white CRT.

The Macintosh II has drive bays for an internal hard disk (originally 40 MB or 80 MB) and an optional second floppy disk drive. It, along with the Macintosh SE, was the first Macintosh to use the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) introduced with the Apple IIGS for keyboard and mouse interface.

The primary improvement in the Macintosh II was Color QuickDraw in ROM, a color version of the Macintosh graphics routines. Color QuickDraw can handle any display size, up to 8-bit color depth, and multiple monitors. Because Color QuickDraw is included in the Macintosh II&#x27;s ROM and relies on 68020 instructions, earlier systems could not be upgraded to display color.

In September 1988, shortly before the introduction of the Macintosh IIx, Apple increased the list price of the Macintosh II by roughly 20%. AnimEigo notably used the Macintosh II for subtitling their earliest releases, including &quot;MADOX-01&quot;, &quot;Riding Bean&quot;, and &quot;Vampire Princess Miyu&quot;, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic used the Macintosh II for image processing on films such as &quot;The Abyss&quot;.

== Hardware ==

CPU: The Macintosh II is built around the Motorola 68020 processor operating at 16 MHz, teamed with a Motorola 68881 floating-point unit. The machine shipped with a socket for an optional Motorola 68851 MMU, but an &quot;Apple HMMU Chip&quot; (VLSI VI475 chip) was installed by default and could not implement virtual memory (instead, it translated 24-bit addresses to 32-bit addresses for the Mac OS, which would not be 32-bit clean until System 7).

Memory: The standard memory was 1 megabyte, expandable to 8 MB. The Mac II had eight 30-pin SIMMs, and memory was installed in groups of four (called &quot;Bank A&quot; and &quot;Bank B&quot;).

The Macintosh II does not have a PMMU installed by default. Instead, it relies on the memory controller hardware to map the installed memory into a contiguous address space. This hardware has the restriction that the address space dedicated to Bank A must be larger than that of Bank B. Though this memory controller was designed to support 16 Megabyte, 30-pin SIMMs in each available slot (for a total of up to 128 MB of RAM), the original Macintosh II ROMs have problems that limit the amount of RAM that can be installed into each slot to just 8 MB SIMMs. Although the later Macintosh IIx ROMs that shipped with the Macintosh II FDHD upgrade fixes this initial problem, these newer ROMs still do not have a 32-bit memory manager and cannot boot into 32-bit address mode, at least, not without software assistance in the form of &quot;MODE32&quot;, thus limiting the &quot;total&quot; amount of RAM to a mere 8MB. MODE32 (originally published by Connectix, and later licensed by Apple) contains a workaround that allows for larger SIMMs to be installed in Bank B if a PMMU is also installed. With this configuration, the Macintosh II boot ROMs will believe that the computer has 8 MB or less of RAM installed. Meanwhile, MODE32 then reprograms the memory controller on the fly to dedicate more address space to Bank A, thus allowing access to the additional memory installed in Bank B. Since this makes the physical address space discontiguous, the PMMU is then used to remap the address space into a contiguous block.

Graphics: The Macintosh II includes a graphics card that supports a true-color 16.7-million-color palette and was available in two configurations: 4-bit and 8-bit. The 4-bit model supports 16 colors on a 640×480 display and 256 colors (8-bit video) on a 512×384 display, which means that VRAM was 256 KB. The 8-bit model supports 256-color video on a 640×480 display, which means that VRAM was 512 KB in size. With an optional RAM upgrade (requiring 120 ns DIP chips), the 4-bit version supports 640×480 in 8-bit color. The video card does not include hardware acceleration of drawing operations.

Display: Apple offered a choice of two displays, a 12&quot; black and white unit, and a more expensive 13&quot; high-resolution color display based on Sony&#x27;s Trinitron technology. More than one display could be attached to the computer, and objects could be easily dragged from one screen to the next. Third-party displays quickly became available. The Los Angeles Times reviewer called the color &quot;spectacular.&quot; The operating system user interface remained black and white even on color monitors with the exception of the Apple logo, which appeared in rainbow color.

Storage: A 5.25-inch 40 MB internal SCSI hard disk was optional, as was a second internal 800 kilobyte 3.5-inch floppy disk drive.

Expansion: Six NuBus slots were available for expansion (at least one of which had to be used for a graphics card, as the Mac II had no onboard graphics chipset and the OS didn&#x27;t support headless booting). It is possible to connect as many as six displays to a Macintosh II by filling all of the NuBus slots with graphics cards. Another option for expansion included the Mac286, which included an Intel 80286 chip and could be used for MS-DOS compatibility.

The original ROMs in the Macintosh II contained a bug that prevented the system from recognizing more than one megabyte of memory address space on a Nubus card. Every Macintosh II manufactured until approximately November 1987 had this defect. This happened because Slot Manager was not 32-bit clean. Apple offered a well-publicized recall of the faulty ROMs and released a program to test whether a particular Macintosh II had the defect.

Accessories: The Macintosh II and Macintosh SE were the first Apple computers since the Apple I to be sold without a keyboard. Instead the customer was offered a choice of the new ADB Apple Keyboard or the Apple Extended Keyboard as a separate purchase. Dealers could bundle a third-party keyboard or attempt to upsell a customer to the more expensive (and higher-profit) Extended Keyboard.

Audio: The Macintosh II was the first Macintosh to have the Chimes of Death accompany the Sad Mac logo whenever a serious hardware error occurred.

The new extensions featured for the Macintosh II at the time were A/ROSE and Sound Manager.

== Models ==
The Macintosh II was offered in three configurations. All systems included a mouse and a single 800 KB 3.5-inch floppy disk drive; a Motorola 68851 PMMU was available as an option and required for running A/UX.

<text>A dolly zoom (also known as a Hitchcock shot, Vertigo&quot; shot, Jaws&quot; effect,
or Zolly shot) is an in-camera effect that appears to undermine normal visual perception.

The effect is achieved by zooming a zoom lens to adjust the angle of view (often referred to as field of view, or FOV) while the camera dollies (moves) toward or away from the subject in such a way as to keep the subject the same size in the frame throughout. The zoom shifts from a wide-angle view into a more tightly packed angle. In its classic form, the camera angle is pulled away from a subject while the lens zooms in, or vice versa. The dolly zoom&#x27;s switch in lenses can help audiences identify the visual difference between wide-angle lenses and telephoto lenses. Thus, during the zoom, there is a continuous perspective distortion, the most directly noticeable feature being that the background appears to change size relative to the subject. Hence, the dolly zoom effect can be broken down into three main components: the moving direction of the camera, the dolly speed, and the camera lens&#x27; focal length.

The visual appearance for the viewer is that either the background suddenly grows in size and detail and overwhelms the foreground, or the foreground becomes immense and dominates its previous setting, depending on which way the dolly zoom is executed. As the human visual system uses both size and perspective cues to judge the relative sizes of objects, seeing a perspective change without a size change is a highly unsettling effect, often with strong emotional impact.

==History==
The effect was first conceived by Alfred Hitchcock during the filming of 1940&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;, but he was unable to achieve the desired results. Some 18 years later, success came through Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, who devised the proper method for Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. It is thought that Alfred Hitchcock specifically asked Roberts to assist him in creating a shot that exemplifies being in a drunk state after fainting at a party. At the time, Roberts had already designed a special camera capable of fast focal lens changes that allowed short-range projections. His expertise in focal lenses most likely prompted his innovation of the dolly zoom, which was more popularly recognized as the &quot;trombone shot&quot; or &quot;contra zoom&quot;. Despite this step forward for cinematography, Roberts was not properly credited at the end of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. However, this shot has since been used in many other films, including &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, and the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films. Rainer Werner Fassbinder uses the effect twice in one shot in &quot;Chinese Roulette&quot; (1976). Director Joe Dante referred to it as the &quot;Jaws Shot&quot; since the scene in Jaws, when Roy Scheider sees the shark attack of the little boy Alex, is the most famous use of this shot.

=== Uses ===

Among the many creative uses the dolly zoom can provide to cinematographers, the shot can be divided into two types: the dolly-in/zoom-out and the dolly-out/zoom-in. The dolly-in/zoom-out shot is usually centered on a subject, where the background is pushed away from the character to create a profuse amount of uneasiness. For example, &quot;Poltergeist&quot;&#x27;s famous dolly zoom stretches the background to make it seem as if the door is much farther away from the character than it actually is. In contrast, the dolly-out/zoom-in shot shrinks the background to seem much closer than it really is.

The dolly zoom is commonly used by filmmakers to represent the sensation of vertigo, a &quot;falling-away-from-oneself feeling&quot; or a feeling of unreality, or to suggest that a character is undergoing a realization that causes them to reassess everything they had previously believed. In general, the dolly zoom&#x27;s amplification of emotion is a special effect that compliments a director&#x27;s arsenal of creativity. For example, in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot;, a dolly zoom, coupled with a Dutch angle shot, exemplifies drama between an intense shootout. An uneasy feeling of suspense can also be signified through a dolly zoom, most notably used in the movie &quot;Split&quot; in 2016, where Casey Cooke peers off into the distance in unwanted curiosity. Other uses include demonstrating overwhelming fear or important epiphanies for a character. The dolly zoom can also be utilized for the purposes of tonal shifts within the film. This was most exemplified in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, where Peter Jackson chained events together with more flare as opposed to a regular transition. Directors may also decide to use the dolly zoom as an alternative to the generic wide shot in order to give sufficient exposition on the upcoming scene.

The technique does not necessarily need to be used for aesthetic or narrative
reasons; it can serve as a way to seamlessly transition between two focal
lengths to take advantage of the different perspective distortion of each angle
of view. In the 12th episode of the first season of The Sopranos, a dolly
zoom is used during a twenty-second shot that displays the character Mikey
Palmice talking to two hitmen on a street corner at its start and ends with the camera
looking into the interior of a car to capture his discussion with his boss
Junior Soprano, who is parked close by.
The shot follows Mikey&#x27;s short walk between the two settings, and the camera
pans to the side and tracks backwards away from Junior&#x27;s car,
causing the background to &quot;grow&quot; in size as the cinematographer zooms the lens
in and the camera moves backwards. Here, the effect is used to avoid a
compromise that would otherwise be necessary: a longer focal length throughout
the shot would show less of the surrounding streetscape, and a wider one would
introduce distortion that would make Mikey appear smaller than Junior. The
technique allows the cinematographers to achieve the framing and perspective
they want at both ends of an extended take without needing to introduce an additional
cut into the scene or disturbing the viewer&#x27;s immersion by making the movements of the camera more apparent.

=== Notable examples ===
In &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), the famous &quot;Get Out Of The Water&quot; scene contains a dolly zoom that focuses on Martin Brody&#x27;s shocking realization of a shark on the beach.

In &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), Martin Scorsese uses dolly zoom shot to disorient the audience and put them in Jake LaMotta&#x27;s shoes, and thus creating a vertigo effect.

In &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990), Scorsese uses dolly zooms to convey tensions between characters. This shot is most famously employed in Henry&#x27;s dive into paranoia, where he eats at a diner with Jimmy while tracking a window to see if anybody has been following him.

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), Frodo stands by as a dolly zoom signifies an entrance of an enemy from the woods.

In &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), a dolly zoom places comedic emphasis on Shaun&#x27;s bravery, which ultimately fails when his shotgun jams.

In &quot;Ratatouille&quot; (2007), the food critic Anton Ego has an intense flashback, signified through a dolly zoom, towards his childhood days after eating Remy&#x27;s ratatouille. Throughout the film, dolly zooms are used extensively to highlight the bonding between two characters, such as when Remy feels a personal connection with Chef Gusteau on television.

The AppleTV+ series &quot;Severance&quot; uses the dolly zoom to represent when an employee transitions between their &quot;innie&quot; company persona at work and their &quot;outie&quot; real world self.

== Optics ==
For most purposes, it can be assumed that the image space and the object space are in the same medium. Thus, for an object in focus, the distance between the lens and image plane formula_1, the distance between lens and the object formula_2, and the focal length formula_3 are related by

:formula_4

Then the transverse magnification is

:formula_5

The &quot;axial magnification&quot; formula_6 of an object at formula_2 is the rate of change of the lens–image distance formula_1 as the lens–object distance formula_2 changes. For an object of finite depth, one can conceive of the &quot;average&quot; axial magnification as the ratio of the depth of the image and the depth of the object:

:formula_10

One can see that if magnification remains constant, a longer focal length results in a smaller axial magnification, and a smaller focal length in a larger axial magnification. That is, when using a longer focal length while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification &quot;M&quot;, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter. The opposite—increased axial magnification—happens with shorter focal lengths while moving the camera/lens towards the object.

===Calculating distances===

To achieve the effect, the camera needs to be positioned at a certain distance from the object that is supposed to remain still during the dolly zoom. The distance depends on how wide the scene is to be filmed and on the field of view (FOV) of the camera lens. Before calculating the distances needed at the different fields of view, the constant width of the scene has to be calculated:

:formula_11

For example, a FOV of 90° and a distance of 2 meters yield a constant width of 4 meters, allowing a 4-meter-wide object to remain still inside the frame during the effect.

<text>The Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges, formerly and still collectively referred to as the Gateway Bridge, are a pair of twin road bridges that carry the Gateway Motorway (M1) over the Brisbane River, skirting the eastern suburbs of the city of Brisbane. The western bridge carries traffic to the north and the eastern bridge carries traffic to the south. They are the most eastern crossings of the Brisbane River and the closest to Moreton Bay, crossing at the Quarries Reach and linking the suburbs of Eagle Farm and Murarrie. The original western bridge (formerly named the Gateway Bridge) was opened on 11 January 1986 and cost A$92 million to build. The duplicate bridge was opened in May 2010, and cost $350 million.

In February 2010, the Queensland Government renamed the Gateway Bridge and its duplicate the Sir Leo Hielscher Bridges. Following the announcement, an opinion poll conducted by Brisbane&#x27;s Channel Nine News showed that 97% of people were against the decision to rename the bridge and that most would continue to call it the Gateway Bridge.

A public open day for the duplicate bridge was held on 16 May 2010 and the new bridge was opened to traffic on 22 May 2010, six months ahead of schedule. Following the opening, the old bridge was refurbished, three vehicle lanes at a time. From November 2010 the two bridges carry 12 lanes of vehicle traffic (six in each direction). The associated upgrade of the Gateway Motorway south of the bridge was completed in May 2010 to coincide with the new bridge opening.

To pay for the duplication of the bridge, a toll was imposed on the original bridge in 2005, and on the new bridge when the latter opened. The bridges are tolled using the Linkt (formerly &quot;go via&quot;) electronic system and will remain so until 2051. The toll booths were removed and free flow tolling began in July 2009. The booth removal saw an immediate drop in road crashes due to the reduction in queuing and weaving at the toll booths on the southern approach.

==History==

Construction on the Gateway Bridge commenced on 5 June 1980. The construction of the bridge started before the design was completed, to fast track its construction. It was officially commissioned on 11 January 1986. On this day 200,000 people crossed the bridge by foot as part of the opening activities.

In 1986 the bridge carried an average of 12,500 vehicles per day. In 2001 the bridge was crossed by 27 million vehicles (approximately 73,975 vehicles per day). In early 2010 the single bridge was carrying an average of 100,000 vehicles per day.

The annual Bridge to Brisbane fun run has begun from the southern entrance to the bridge from its first year until 2015, when it was moved, and again since 2021, after being moved back.

==Design==
In 1979, a tender was called by the Queensland Main Roads Department for a new bridge crossing of the Brisbane River.
The conforming design main span was designed as a balanced cantilever with two raised post tensioned concrete compression stays located on the median and over each of the two main piers to support the 260-metre span. Due to the proximity of the Brisbane Airport, an overall structural height constraint was provided due to aircraft flight path and clearances. This constraint ruled out the possibility of a conventional cable-stayed bridge due to the height of the pylons that would be required.
Due to cost considerations, an alternative design concept was proposed by Bruce Ramsay (Manager Engineering) of VSL. This alternative design required a world record main span of 260 m for a free cantilever, concrete box girder bridge. The concept was adopted by one of the tenderers – Transfield Queensland Pty.Ltd. who was subsequently awarded the project on the basis of this alternative. It held the record span of 260 m for over 15 years. The box girder is still the largest prestressed concrete, single box in the world, measuring 15 m deep at the pier, with a box width of 12 m and an overall deck width for the six lanes of 22 m.

As stated above the bridge owes its distinctive shape to air traffic requirements restricting its height to under above sea level (all features of the bridge including light poles) coupled with shipping needs requiring a navigational clearance of .

The bridge has six lanes (originally three lanes in each direction, which were subsequently reconfigured to six lanes of northbound traffic after opening of the duplicate bridge).

The bridge was financed by funds borrowed by the Queensland Government, and as a result, users of the bridge pay a toll when crossing the bridge in either direction. The bridge is operated and maintained by Transurban Queensland.

The total length is . This is divided into a southern approach of , a northern approach of and the three central spans of . 
The record main span is long by high, which is equivalent to a 20-storey building. A total of 150,000 tonnes (165,000 short tons) of concrete was used to construct the bridge.

The original design did not include a safety fence to prevent suicide attempts and base jumping. Three-metre high safety fences attached to the top of the concrete traffic barrier were later installed to prevent these incidents occurring. Anti-climbing screens are part of the second bridge&#x27;s security features.

==Duplication==

In 2005, a major upgrade of the Gateway Motorway was announced. Leighton Contractors and joint venture partner Abigroup won the contract to upgrade the motorway. The A$1.88 billion Gateway Upgrade Project includes the duplication of the Gateway Bridge and upgrades to of the Gateway Motorway from Mt Gravatt-Capalaba Road in the south to Nudgee Road in the north. The bridge duplication was the largest bridge and road development in Queensland&#x27;s history. The duplicate bridge was specified to have a design life of 300 years.

To the south, the upgrade included widening of the Gateway Motorway from 4 to 6 lanes. To the north, it involved the construction of the Gateway Motorway deviation, an entirely new six-lane motorway between the Gateway Bridge and Nudgee Road. The deviation runs east of the original motorway through Brisbane Airport Corporation land and provides an alternative means of access to Brisbane Airport (the only effective access from the south). The new bridge provides a bicycle path unlike the first crossing.

The Wynnum Road upgrade was completed on 13 July 2007 and 2 additional southbound lanes between the Port of Brisbane Motorway and Wynnum Road completed in late 2007. Four of six lanes of the new Gateway Motorway deviation were opened in July 2009. All works south of the river were complete by the end of 2009 after 10 years of constant roadwork and traffic disruption. The final concrete pour linking the sides of the new bridge was made in late October 2009. A total of 748 concrete segments, which are supported by 17 piers, were placed for the new bridge.

The duplicate bridge was completed in May 2010 along with the remaining lanes of the Gateway Motorway deviation.

In October 2010, then Minister for Main Roads, Craig Wallace, announced that the original course of the Gateway Motorway via Eagle Farm would be renamed to Southern Cross Way, after Sir Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s aircraft, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, which landed at Eagle Farm in 1928, and so as to avoid confusion with the newly opened Gateway Motorway deviation. The new Gateway Motorway deviation was given the name Gateway Motorway. However, like the renaming of the bridges themselves, the change to Southern Cross Way was not without controversy, attracting criticism from the then Shadow Minister for Main Roads and Transport, Fiona Simpson.

Refurbishment of the existing bridge was completed in November 2010.

== Awards ==
In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Gateway Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

<text>The Story Bridge is a heritage-listed steel cantilever bridge spanning the Brisbane River that carries vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic between the northern and the southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is the longest cantilever bridge in Australia.

The road across the bridge is named Bradfield Highway. The bridge connects Fortitude Valley to Kangaroo Point. The Story Bridge opened in 1940 and was tolled until 1947. It is named after prominent public servant John Douglas Story.

==History==

Given the early settlement of Kangaroo Point, there is a long history of residents wanting a bridge between the Brisbane CBD and Kangaroo Point. Even while the first Victoria Bridge was being constructed between North Brisbane and South Brisbane in 1865, several hundred people were petitioning for a second bridge to be built from the Customs House to Kangaroo Point. In 1888, a meeting was held in the Brisbane Town Hall to demand a bridge connecting either George Street, Albert Street or Edward Street via the City Botanic Gardens with any loss of the land from the gardens to be potentially compensated by removing Government House.
===Planning===
A bridge downstream of the Victoria Bridge was part of a larger plan, devised by Professor Roger Hawken of the University of Queensland in the 1920s, for a series of bridges over the Brisbane River to alleviate congestion on Victoria Bridge and to divert traffic away from the Brisbane central business district. The William Jolly Bridge was the first of the Hawken Plan bridges to be constructed. Lack of funds precluded the construction of the downstream bridge at that time. Initially plans called for a transporter bridge further downstream near New Farm.

In 1926 Kangaroo Point was recommended by the Brisbane City Council&#x27;s Cross River Commission. Subsequently, the bridge was constructed as a public works program during the Great Depression. The cost was to be no more than £1.6 million.
===Construction===

Before the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 the Government of Queensland asked John Bradfield to design a new bridge in Brisbane.

The Queensland Government appointed John Bradfield on 15 December 1933 as consulting engineer to the Bureau of Industry who were in charge of the construction of the bridge. In June 1934 Bradfield&#x27;s recommendation of a steel cantilever bridge was approved. The design for the bridge was based heavily on that of the Jacques Cartier Bridge in Montreal, completed in 1930. On 30 April 1935 a consortium of two Queensland companies, Evans Deakin and Hornibrook Constructions, won the tender with a bid of £1,150,000.
Construction on the bridge began on 24 May 1935, with the first sod being turned by the then Premier of Queensland, William Forgan Smith. Components for the bridge were fabricated in a purpose-built factory at Rocklea. There are 1.25 million rivets (metal pins or bolts) in the Story Bridge. During its construction, work sometimes continued 24 hours per day. The bridge has only one pier on the northern bank but two piers on the lower southern bank, one to bear the weight (the main pier) and, further to the south, one to prevent the bridge from twisting (the anchor pier). There was no need for an anchor pier on the northern bank as the bridge was anchored into schist cliff face. The primary challenge in constructing the bridge was the southern foundations that went below ground level. It was not possible to excavate to that level as water from the river would rapidly seep in. So a pneumatic caisson technique had to be used. As men were working under pressures of up to 4 times normal air pressure, a decompression period of almost 2 hours was needed at the end of each shift to avoid the bends. An on-site air lock hospital successfully treated the 65 cases of the bends that occurred. On 28 October 1939 the gap between the two sides was closed. A concrete decking was then laid, covered by a Trinidad pitch topping. The bridge was painted and sodium lighting was installed. The bridge approaches were also prepared.

Three men died during the construction of the bridge. On 22 November 1937, Hans James Zimmerman slipped and fell to the ground. On 7 February 1939, Alfred William Jackson fell from the bridge into the river. Although pulled from the water alive, he died 4 hours later in hospital without regaining consciousness. On 6 December 1939, Arthur McKay (Max) Wharton was hit by a piece of equipment on a nerve that made him faint, falling from the bridge to the water; 18 months earlier Wharton saved another worker from falling from the bridge.

Construction of a new underpass was begun on the southside in 2023 to facilitate access to the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge. 

=== Naming ===

Until it was completed, the bridge was known as the Jubilee Bridge in honour of King George V. It was opened on 6 July 1940 by Sir Leslie Orme Wilson, Governor of Queensland and named after John Douglas Story, a senior and influential public servant who had advocated strongly for the bridge&#x27;s construction.

==Operations==

The bridge carries an average of 97,000 vehicles each day. The Story Bridge carries three lanes of traffic in either direction as well as a shared pedestrian and cycle way flanking each side. The road on the bridge is called the Bradfield Highway. It is not to be confused with the Bradfield Highway that spans the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

Initially a toll of sixpence (5 cents) was charged to use the bridge, with toll booths constructed at the southern end of the Bradfield Highway. The toll was removed in 1947. Between 1952 and 1969 trolley-buses operated by the Brisbane City Council used the bridge.

Following completion of the bridge, an expressway was constructed on the southern side of the bridge (opened 18 May 1970), and a tunnel/loop was constructed at Kemp Place on the northern side (completed 10 July 1972).

==Maintenance==

Resurfacing works were undertaken in 1994.

The Story Bridge was closed to traffic from midnight of Friday 3 January 2014 until 5.30 a.m. Monday, 6 January 2014, for essential maintenance work of resurfacing all six lanes.

Closure for maintenance occurred again from 9 p.m. Friday 27 April 2018 until 5 a.m. Monday 30 April 2018.

==Role in contemporary Brisbane==
The Story Bridge features prominently in the annual Riverfire fireworks display and is illuminated at night. In 1990, road traffic was halted so pedestrians could celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bridge&#x27;s construction. The bridge was again closed to road traffic on 5 July 2015 to celebrate the 75th anniversary. The celebration attracted almost 75,000 visitors to the bridge who enjoyed food, drink and entertainment as they walked across lanes usually reserved for vehicles.

Bridge climbs began in 2005 and have become a popular tourist attraction.

A picture of the bridge featured on Brisbane Bitter.

==Suicides==
Similar to many large bridges such as the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, Brisbane&#x27;s Story Bridge has become notorious as a suicide hotspot. Following two high-profile murder-suicides from the bridge in 2011 and 2012, Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk announced plans to install free telephones linked to suicide prevention hotlines. On 6 February 2013, Quirk announced plans to install a three-metre-high safety barrier. Overall the plan cost about $8.4 million and was completed in December 2015.

==Heritage listing==
The bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

In 1988, the bridge received a Historic Engineering Marker from Engineers Australia.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Story Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;structure and engineering feat&quot;.

<text>Microsoft FrontPage (full name Microsoft Office FrontPage) is a discontinued WYSIWYG HTML editor and website administration tool from Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems. It was branded as part of the Microsoft Office suite from 1997 to 2003. Microsoft FrontPage has since been replaced by Microsoft Expression Web and SharePoint Designer, which were first released in December 2006 alongside Microsoft Office 2007, but these two products were also discontinued in favor of a web-based version of SharePoint Designer, as those three HTML editors were desktop applications.

==History ==
FrontPage was initially created by Cambridge, Massachusetts company Vermeer Technologies, Incorporated, evidence of which can be easily spotted in file names and directories prefixed _vti_ in web sites created using FrontPage. Vermeer was acquired by Microsoft in January 1996 specifically so that Microsoft could add FrontPage to its product line-up, allowing them to gain an advantage in the browser wars, as FrontPage was designed to create web pages for their own browser, Internet Explorer.

As a &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; (What You See Is What You Get) editor, FrontPage is designed to hide the details of pages&#x27; HTML code from the user, making it possible for novices to create web pages and web sites easily.

FrontPage&#x27;s initial outing under the Microsoft name came in 1996 with the release of Windows NT 4.0 Server and its constituent Web server Internet Information Services 2.0. Bundled on CD with the NT 4.0 Server release, FrontPage 1.1 would run under NT 4.0 (Server or Workstation) or Windows 95. Up to FrontPage 98, the &quot;FrontPage Editor&quot;, which was used for designing pages, was a separate application from the &quot;FrontPage Explorer&quot; which was used to manage web site folders. With FrontPage 2000, both programs were merged into the &quot;Editor&quot;.

FrontPage used to require a set of server-side plugins originally known as IIS Extensions. The extension set was significantly enhanced for Microsoft inclusion of FrontPage into the Microsoft Office line-up with Office 97 and subsequently renamed FrontPage Server Extensions (FPSE). Both sets of extensions needed to be installed on the target web server for its content and publishing features to work. Microsoft offered both Windows and Unix-based versions of FPSE. FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions worked with earlier versions of FrontPage as well. FPSE 2002 was the last released version which also works with FrontPage 2003 and was later updated for IIS 6.0 as well. However, with FrontPage 2003, Microsoft began moving away from proprietary Server Extensions to standard protocols like FTP and WebDAV for remote web publishing and authoring. FrontPage 2003 can also be used with Windows SharePoint Services.

A version for the classic Mac OS was released in 1998; however, it had fewer features than the Windows product and Microsoft has never updated it.

In 2006, Microsoft announced that FrontPage would eventually be superseded by two products. Microsoft SharePoint Designer would allow business professionals to design SharePoint-based applications. Microsoft Expression Web is targeted at the web design professional for the creation of feature-rich web sites. Microsoft discontinued Microsoft FrontPage in December 2006. Functional equivalent would be found in Microsoft Expression Web.

==Features==
Some of the features in the last version of FrontPage include:

*FrontPage 2003 consists of a Split View option to allow the user to code in Code View and preview in Design View without the hassle of switching from the Design and Code View tabs for each review.
*Dynamic Web Templates (DWT) were included for the first time in FrontPage 2003, allowing users to create a single template that could be used across multiple pages and even the whole Web site.
*Interactive Buttons give users a new easy way to create Web graphics for navigation and links, eliminating the need for a complicated image-editing package such as Adobe Photoshop which Microsoft does not sell.
*The accessibility checker gives the user the ability to check if their code is standards-compliant and that their Web site is easily accessible for people with disabilities. An HTML optimizer is included to aid in optimizing code to make it legible and quicker to process.
*Intellisense, which is a form of autocompletion, is a key feature in FrontPage 2003 that assists the user while typing in Code View. When working in Code View, Intellisense will suggest tags and/or properties for the code that the user is entering which was intended to significantly reduce the time to write code. The Quick Tag Editor shows the user the tag they are currently in when editing in Design View. This also includes the option to edit the specific tag/property from within the Tag Editor.
*Code Snippets give users the advantage of creating snippets of their commonly used pieces of code, allowing them to store it for easy access whenever it is next needed.
*FrontPage 2003 includes support for programming in ASP.NET a server-side scripting language that adds interactivity to Web sites and Web pages.
*FrontPage 2003 includes support for macros in VBA.

==Versions==
*1995 — Vermeer FrontPage 1.0
*1996 — Microsoft FrontPage 1.1
*1996 — Microsoft FrontPage 97 (version 2)
*1997 — Microsoft FrontPage Express 2.0 (free simple web page editor came with Internet Explorer 4 and 5, and could be found online from numerous shareware Web sites)
*1997 — Microsoft FrontPage for Macintosh 1.0
*1997 — Microsoft FrontPage 98 (version 3)
*1999 — Microsoft FrontPage 2000 (version 4): Also included in Office 2000 Premium and Developer editions
*2001 — Microsoft FrontPage 2002 (version 10): Included in Office XP Professional with FrontPage (volume license only), Office XP Professional Special Edition and Office XP Developer edition. Starting with this version, the version number jumps to 10.0 to tally Microsoft Office versions.
*2003 — Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003 (version 11): Not included in any of the Office 2003 editions, sold separately. It was included with Windows Small Business Server 2003 Premium Edition.

&quot;Note&quot;: There is no official version 5 to 9, because after FrontPage was included in some Office editions, the version numbers followed their Office version numbers. Nonetheless, version numbers may appear in the meta tags of HTML code generated by these versions of FrontPage.

==Server Extensions==
&quot;FrontPage Server Extensions&quot; are a software technology that allows FrontPage clients to communicate with web servers, and provide additional functionality intended for websites. Frequent security problems have marred the history of this Microsoft proprietary technology. It relies on HTTP protocol for communication, and CGI/POST for server-side processing.

Software IDE Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 uses this technology for file synchronization purposes, and strongly depends on this technology for file management. Most .NET Microsoft products obsoleted this in favor of WebDAV, but Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 still publishes ClickOnce applications to websites with FrontPage Server Extensions.

<doc id="177126" wikidata="Q830038" url="?curid=177126" title="Ferengi">
<text>The Ferengi () are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the American science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They were devised in 1987 for the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, played a prominent role in the following series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and have made brief appearances in subsequent series such as &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

When launching &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 1987, Gene Roddenberry and the show&#x27;s writers decided to introduce a new alien species to serve as antagonists for the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. The Ferengi first appeared in &quot;The Last Outpost&quot;, the show&#x27;s fourth episode, which was set in the year 2364. The writers decided that the Ferengi ultimately failed to appear sufficiently menacing, instead replacing them with the Romulans and Borg as primary antagonists. Throughout the rest of the series, Ferengi characters were primarily used for comedic effect.

When creating &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the show&#x27;s writers decided to introduce the Ferengi bartender Quark (Armin Shimerman) as a major character, and subsequently his brother Rom (Max Grodénchik) and nephew Nog (Aron Eisenberg) as recurring characters, again frequently using them for comedic purposes.

Ferengi culture, especially as portrayed on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, is depicted as hyper-capitalistic, focused on the acquisition of profit as the highest goal. &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; writers have described how they saw the Ferengi as a satirical presentation of 20th century humans. The Ferengi have repeatedly drawn comparisons to stereotypes of Jews.

==Name==

The name &quot;Ferengi&quot; was coined based on the originally Persian &quot;Ferenghi&quot; (compare older &quot;&quot;), a term used in various languages throughout Asia and Ethiopia meaning &quot;foreigners&quot; or &quot;Europeans&quot;, itself descending from the word &quot;farang&quot; which referred specifically to Franks and gradually expanded in meaning. The variant &quot;&quot; has entered English through Hindi

==History==
===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===

While preparing scripts for the first season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the idea of the Ferengi was devised by Gene Roddenberry and Herbert Wright. The new alien species initially appeared in the first season&#x27;s fourth episode, &quot;The Last Outpost&quot;, which was based on a story by Richard Krzemien and a teleplay by Wright. In this story, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D—whose crew are the main protagonists of the series—makes first contact with the Ferengi while pursuing one of their vessels, which has stolen a T-9 energy converter. Both ships are immobilized over an unknown planet, leading both to send away parties to investigate, where they encounter each other. One of the actors who played a Ferengi in &quot;The Last Outpost&quot;, Armin Shimerman, would go on to play a Ferengi again in the later episode &quot;Peak Performance&quot; before being cast as the Ferengi bartender Quark in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

The Ferengi outfits designed for &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; featured fur wrap-arounds. As weapons, they were given blue whips that fired energy bolts when cracked; these were subsequently dropped from the series and not used in later depictions of the species. Mike Okuda designed the Ferengi insignia to present the idea of &quot;&quot;. It was colored green because of that color&#x27;s associations with greed, envy, and money. The Ferengi ship featured in the episode was designed by Andy Probert, who used a horseshoe crab on Wright&#x27;s desk as inspiration, with the model then being constructed by Greg Jein.

The Ferengi were reused for the season&#x27;s ninth episode, &quot;The Battle&quot;, based on a story by Larry Forrester that Wright converted into a teleplay. This episode was first aired in November 1987. In it, a Ferengi called DaiMon Bok gives the &quot;Enterprise&quot; Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) the derelict ship that the latter once captained, the &quot;Stargazer&quot;. Over the course of the episode, it is revealed that this is part of Bok&#x27;s plan for vengeance, for he holds Picard responsible for the death of his son many years before. Forrester&#x27;s first plot outline had featured various scenes aboard the Ferengi spaceship, but these did not make it into the episode. Series writer Rick Berman later noted that because of their &quot;silliness quotient&quot;, the Ferengi became &quot;a disappointment as a major adversary&quot;.

For the second-season episode &quot;Peak Performance&quot;, written by David Kemper and directed by Robert Scheerer, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is depicted encountering a hostile Ferengi ship while engaging in a practice exercise. The Ferengi uniform was revised for this episode, and new collar pips were added to designate their differing ranks. The season three episode &quot;The Price&quot;, which was written by Hannah Louise Shearer, directed by Robert Scheerer, and first aired in November 1989, also included Ferengi characters. In it, two Ferengi delegates compete against their Federation counterparts to gain access to a newly discovered stable wormhole; later in the episode, it is revealed that the wormhole was not really stable and the Ferengi get stuck on the other side of it, in a distant part of the galaxy. &quot;The Price&quot; is the first episode in which a Ferengi starship was referred to as a &quot;marauder&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;===

When the writers were putting together the premise of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, they decided to introduce a recurring Ferengi character who would inhabit the space station Deep Space Nine that was the main setting for the show. The show&#x27;s co-creator, Michael Piller, later noted that: &quot;It was clear to me that having a Ferengi aboard Deep Space 9 would provide the show with instant humor and built-in conflict with the Federation guy in charge of the station&quot;. The show&#x27;s creators developed the character of Quark, a Ferengi bartender who would, according to Piller, be &quot;a constant thorn in the side of law and order, but who has a sense of humor about it. He&#x27;d be someone who could obviously throw lots of story dynamics into play.&quot; Piller and the others consciously wanted to play the Quark character off against the station constable, Odo (René Auberjonois); according to Piller, &quot;the idea of Odo and Quark being at loggerheads was there from day one&quot;.

Through the character of Quark and his family, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; developed the culture and politics of the Ferengi in some detail. Episodes of the series portray the Ferengi&#x27;s hyper-capitalistic emphasis on profit and sexist social norms (at the beginning of the series, Ferengi females are not permitted to earn profit or even wear clothing), and the society&#x27;s gradual evolution away from those norms as, for example, Quark&#x27;s mother becomes a respected businesswoman and Quark comes to tolerate his employees forming a union.

In the third season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, Quark&#x27;s nephew Nog becomes the first Ferengi to join Starfleet, the military and exploration arm of the United Federation of Planets. This development prompted discussions on electronic mailing lists devoted to &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Various commentators suggested that, given how Nog had behaved in previous episodes, it was surprising that Starfleet would take him on. They suggested that this might indicate that Starfleet had some form of affirmative action policy to benefit species not presently represented in Starfleet. Other online commentators argued that this viewpoint was racist, and that Nog would have been accepted as a Starfleet cadet because he was qualified, not because of his racial identity.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
While trapped in the Delta Quadrant, the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; encounters the two Ferengi from &quot;The Price&quot; who have been conning a primitive culture that they encountered. When &quot;Voyager&quot; attempts to use the Barzan wormhole to return home, the Ferengi escape, but accidentally destabilize the wormhole on both ends in the process. The Ferengi shuttle is sucked in and becomes lost in space again while &quot;Voyager&quot; remains trapped in the Delta Quadrant.

===&quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;===
By 2381, the progressive reforms of Grand Nagus Rom and his wife First Clerk Leeta had taken root in Ferengi society with the arms trade being discouraged with the greater longer-term economic benefits of more benign industries, such as hospitality, being encouraged. As such, Ferenginar is in the process of joining the United Federation of Planets.

===&quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;===
Dal R&#x27;El was raised by a Ferengi named Nandi who used the young alien in her cons before selling him off. Nandi cons the &quot;Protostar&quot; crew into helping her steal a valuable crystal, although they manage to get it back, and she steals their chimerium in order to power her cloaking device.

The Ferengi are amongst those who come to Starfleet&#x27;s aid during the living construct crisis. This event takes place in 2384, and the Ferengi have not yet fully joined the Federation despite having begun the process as they are still described as only non-Federation allies.

===&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;===
The Ferengi are amongst the races serving in Starfleet in the 32nd century. In addition, the USS &quot;Nog&quot; is named after the young Ferengi officer Nog from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

== Attributes ==

=== Culture ===
Ferengi culture is depicted, especially on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, as focused on the acquisition of profit as the highest goal. Many episodes portray this as taken to a comical extreme, as, for example, Ferengi prayer involves paying bribes to the gods, and Ferengi funeral rites involve auctioning off the deceased&#x27;s remains. Ferengi characters frequently quote the &quot;Rules of Acquisition&quot;, a collection of proverbs that are said to govern Ferengi business practices (such as &quot;Never place friendship above profit&quot;); a compilation of these Rules was published by &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; showrunner Ira Steven Behr. Violations of economic norms such as abrogating contracts between fellow Ferengi or fraudulently taking advantage of business discounts are considered serious offences and subject to harsh punishments.

The extreme sexism of Ferengi society is shown in early seasons of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; where Ferengi females are not permitted to earn profit, travel, or even wear clothing. A long-running plot thread on &quot;DS9&quot; features Ferengi society&#x27;s gradual evolution away from these practices, especially as Quark&#x27;s mother Ishka establishes herself as a respected businesswoman and financial advisor. Evidently, the fact that granting full societal and economic rights to females would mean a dramatic expansion of business and investment opportunities proved persuasive to the Ferengi government. By 2380, Grand Nagus&#x27; reforms had taken effect, as seen in the acceptance of clothing for females.

Despite their greed and sexism, in their own way the Ferengi are actually quite a peaceful and tolerant race. Ferengi history contains nothing comparable to the racism and world wars found in human history. Given that one customer&#x27;s money is as valuable as the next&#x27;s, it makes no sense to Ferengi to refuse to interact with those different from them: even Quark of all people feels the discrimination Odo faces for being a changeling is repugnant. While they have hired mercenaries for private contracts, the Ferengi Alliance as a whole has never fought a major interstellar war - instead preferring to apply economic pressure on their rivals until they&#x27;re willing to negotiate.

===Biology and appearance===
The Ferengi were first designed by Andrew Probert and later refined and produced by Michael Westmore.

The most prominent feature in Ferengi design is their large ear lobes. Ferengi experience sexual stimulation when their lobes are rubbed – an act called &quot;oo-mox&quot;. Ferengi females allegedly have smaller lobes, but the only female Ferengi characters shown in the series were Pel and Ishka. Betazoids are incapable of reading Ferengi emotions. The focus on ears extends to figures of speech (i.e. &quot;not having the lobes&quot; to indicate a lack of courage) and to health problems (i.e. an ear infection proving fatal).

=== Homeworld ===
The Ferengi home planet, Ferenginar, is introduced in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Family Business&quot;. Ferenginar experiences near-constant torrential rain; consequently, the Ferengi language has 178 different words for rain (and none for &quot;crisp&quot;).

=== Spacecraft ===
A Ferengi shuttlecraft was introduced in the episode &quot;The Price&quot;. It was also seen in &quot;Little Green Men&quot; as a spacecraft used by Quark. The studio model for VFX was auctioned by Christie&#x27;s for over US$8,000 in 2006. There is a larger Ferengi spaceship called the Marauder. The Marauder was designed by Andrew Probert, and the model was built by Greg Jein; the studio model was constructed of resin, fiberglass, and aluminum.

== Reception ==
In 2017, &quot;Syfy&quot; rated the Ferengi one of the top eleven most bizarre aliens of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked the Ferengi the eighth best aliens of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, in between Andorians and Romulans.

Examples of well-received Ferengi-focused episodes in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; include &quot;Little Green Men&quot;, in which Ferengi characters travel back in time to the 1940s and become the alien invaders in the Roswell UFO incident, and &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi&quot;, in which a group of Ferengi characters team up to rescue Quark&#x27;s mother when she is captured by an enemy empire.

===Comparisons with anti-Semitic stereotypes===
Various critics have argued that the depiction of the Ferengi and their culture mirrors anti-Semitic stereotypes of Jews, namely the love of profit and the oversized facial features – in the case of the Ferengi, the ears. During the 1990s, this issue was discussed on electronic mailing lists devoted to the franchise, with some commentators arguing that there were parallels and others objecting to the comparison. In his 2007 critique of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; for the &quot;National Review&quot;, the commentator Jonah Goldberg described the Ferengi as &quot;runaway capitalists with bullwhips who looked like a mix between Nazi caricatures of Jews and the original Nosferatu.&quot;
The scholar of religion Ross S. Kraemer wrote that &quot;Ferengi religion seems almost a parody, perhaps of traditional Judaism.&quot; He wrote that the 285 Rules of Acquisition bore similarities with the Torah&#x27;s 613 Commandments, and that the Ferengi social restrictions on women mirrored Orthodox Judaism&#x27;s restrictions on women studying the Torah. Historian Paul Sturtevant wrote in 2018 that not only are the Ferengi &quot;extremely legalistic&quot; and &quot;defined by their greed&quot;, echoing common stereotypes of Jews, but the major Ferengi characters on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; were all played by Jewish actors.

Shimerman addressed the issue when asked at a question-and-answer session at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention. He stated that:

Robert Hewitt Wolfe, writer for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, has stated that the creative team (several of whom were Jewish) were aware at the time that many already saw the Ferengi as Jewish stereotypes, but that they attempted to mitigate this, both through characterization of Ferengi characters as individuals, and through incorporating aspects of multiple human cultures into Ferengi culture.

<doc id="177127" wikidata="Q3540864" url="?curid=177127" title="Balance disorder">
<text>A balance disorder is a disturbance that causes an individual to feel unsteady, for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, or having a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance is the result of several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and proprioception (the body&#x27;s sense of where it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits.

==Signs and symptoms==
Cognitive dysfunction (disorientation) may occur with vestibular disorders. Cognitive deficits are not just spatial in nature, but also include non-spatial functions such as object recognition memory. Vestibular dysfunction has been shown to adversely affect processes of attention and increased demands of attention can worsen the postural sway associated with vestibular disorders. Recent MRI studies also show that humans with bilateral vestibular damage (damage to both inner ears) undergo atrophy of the hippocampus which correlates with their degree of impairment on spatial memory tasks.

==Causes==
Problems with balance can occur when there is a disruption in any of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. Abnormalities in balance function may indicate a wide range of pathologies from causes like inner ear disorders, low blood pressure, brain tumors, and brain injury including stroke.

===Related to the ear===

Causes of dizziness related to the ear are often characterized by vertigo (spinning) and nausea. Nystagmus (flickering of the eye, related to the Vestibulo-ocular reflex [VOR]) is often seen in patients with an acute peripheral cause of dizziness.
* Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) – The most common cause of vertigo. It is typically described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out of bed in the morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.

=== Migraine ===
Migraine headaches are a common neurological disease. Although typical migraines are characterized by moderate to severe throbbing headaches, vestibular migraines may be accompanied by symptoms of vestibular disorders such as dizziness, disequilibrium, nausea, and vomiting.

===Presyncope===

Presyncope is a feeling of lightheadedness or simply feeling faint. Syncope, by contrast, is actually fainting. A circulatory system deficiency, such as low blood pressure, can contribute to a feeling of dizziness when one suddenly stands up.

==Diagnosis==
The difficulty of making the right vestibular diagnosis is reflected in the fact that in some populations, more than one-third of the patients with a vestibular disease consult more than one physician – in some cases up to more than fifteen.

==Treatment==
There are various options for treating balance disorders. One option includes treatment for a disease or disorder that may be contributing to the balance problem, such as ear infection, stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinson&#x27;s, neuromuscular conditions, acquired brain injury, cerebellar dysfunctions and/or ataxia, or some tumors, such as acoustic neuroma. Individual treatment will vary and will be based upon assessment results including symptoms, medical history, general health, and the results of medical tests. Additionally, tai chi may be a cost-effective method to prevent falls in the elderly.

=== Vestibular rehabilitation ===
Many types of balance disorders will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures as part of their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient&#x27;s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or outcome measures include but are not limited to the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, fall prevention and sensory function.

===Bilateral vestibular loss===
Dysequilibrium arising from bilateral loss of vestibular function – such as can occur from ototoxic drugs such as gentamicin – can also be treated with balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation) although the improvement is not likely to be full recovery.

==Research==
Scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are working to understand the various balance disorders and the complex interactions between the labyrinth, other balance-sensing organs, and the brain. NIDCD scientists are studying eye movement to understand the changes that occur in aging, disease, and injury, as well as collecting data about eye movement and posture to improve diagnosis and treatment of balance disorders. They are also studying the effectiveness of certain exercises as a treatment option. Recently, a study published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery found that balance problems are an indicator of mortality potentially due to altered metabolism of vestibular system.

<doc id="177128" wikidata="Q467621" url="?curid=177128" title="Siobhan Fahey">
<text>Siobhan Maire Deirdre Fahey (; born 10 September 1958) is an Irish singer whose vocal range is a light contralto. She was a founding member of the British girl group Bananarama, who have had ten top-10 hits including the US number one hit single &quot;Venus&quot;. She later formed the musical act Shakespears Sister, who had a UK number one hit with the 1992 single &quot;Stay&quot;. Fahey joined the other original members of Bananarama for a 2017 UK tour, and, in 2018, a North America and Europe tour.

She is the first Irish-born woman to have written two number one singles on the Irish charts.

==Early life==
Siobhan Maire Fahey was born on 10 September 1958 in County Meath, Ireland. She has two younger sisters, Maire (who played Eileen in the video of the 1982 song &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, a hit for Dexys Midnight Runners) and Niamh, a producer and editor. Her parents, Helen and Joseph Fahey, both came from County Tipperary, Ireland. Fahey lived in Ireland for several years before her father joined the British Army and the family moved to England, then to Germany for several years, and back to England when Siobhan was nine years old. When she was 14, she and her family moved to Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and, two years later, she left home for London and became involved in the punk scene of the late 1970s.

==Career==
===Bananarama (1981–1988, 2017–2018)===

Fahey took a course in fashion journalism at the London College of Fashion, where she met Sara Dallin in 1980. Along with Keren Woodward, they founded Bananarama and recorded their first demo &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot; in 1981. Bananarama then worked with the male vocal trio Fun Boy Three, releasing two top-five singles with them in early 1982 before having their own top-five hit with &quot;Shy Boy&quot; later that year. Fahey, with Dallin and Woodward, co-wrote many of the group&#x27;s hits, including &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, &quot;Robert De Niro&#x27;s Waiting...&quot;, &quot;I Heard a Rumour&quot;, and &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot;.

===Shakespears Sister (1988–1996)===
In 1988, frustrated with the direction she felt Bananarama was heading, Fahey left the group and formed Shakespears Sister. Initially, Fahey effectively was Shakespears Sister, though American singer/songwriter Marcella Detroit later became an official member, making the outfit a duo. Their 1992 single &quot;Stay&quot; spent eight weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart and won the 1993 Brit Award for Best British Video. At the 1993 Ivor Novello Awards, Fahey, Detroit, and Dave Stewart received the award for Outstanding Contemporary Song Collection. Fahey often appeared in the band&#x27;s music videos and on-stage as a vampish glam figure. After two successful albums, tensions began to rise between Fahey and Detroit and they split up in 1993. That year, Fahey admitted herself into a psychiatric unit with severe depression.

In 1996, Fahey continued as Shakespears Sister by herself and released the single &quot;I Can Drive&quot;. Intended as the first single from Shakespears Sister&#x27;s third album and her first record since her split with Marcella Detroit, the single performed disappointingly (UK number 30), which prompted London Records not to release the album. Following this, Fahey left the label and, after a lengthy battle, she finally obtained the rights to release the album (entitled &quot;#3&quot;) independently through her own website in 2004.

===Since 1997===
Fahey briefly re-joined Bananarama in 1998 to record a cover version of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; for the Channel 4 Eurovision special &quot;A Song for Eurotrash&quot;. Fahey reteamed with Bananarama again in 2002 for a &quot;last ever&quot; reunion at the band&#x27;s 20th-anniversary concert at G-A-Y in London. The trio performed &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Waterloo&quot;.

Fahey continued to make music into the new millennium. In 2005, Fahey independently released &quot;The MGA Sessions&quot;, an album recorded with frequent collaborator Sophie Muller in the mid-1990s. Fahey&#x27;s most recent single (under her own name), &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, was released on 17 October 2005.

Fahey&#x27;s track &quot;Bitter Pill&quot; was partially covered by the pop band The Pussycat Dolls on their 2005 debut album &quot;PCD&quot;. The verses (which were slightly altered) and the overall sound of the song are from &quot;Bitter Pill&quot;, but added in was the chorus of Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;. The song was renamed &quot;Hot Stuff (I Want You Back)&quot; and a remix was included as a B-side to their hit single &quot;Beep&quot;.

In 2008, Fahey appeared in the Chris Ward-written and directed short film &quot;What Shall We Do with the Drunken Sailor&quot; (based on the life of artist/model Nina Hamnett, self-styled &quot;Queen of Bohemia&quot;), with Fahey playing the role of Hamnett opposite actor Clive Arrindel, Donny Tourette (frontman with punk band Towers of London) and Honey Bane (former vocalist of the punk band Fatal Microbes).

In 2009, Fahey decided to resurrect the Shakespears Sister name and released a new album. Entitled &quot;Songs from the Red Room&quot;, it was released on her own record label, SF Records and included various singles she had released under her own name in recent years. Fahey performed her first live show in almost 15 years as Shakespears Sister in Hoxton, London on 20 November 2009. In 2014 she joined the line-up of Dexys Midnight Runners for some shows, including at Glastonbury Festival.

In 2017, it was announced that Fahey had joined her former Bananarama bandmates for an upcoming UK tour. This was the first live tour Fahey has done as a member of Bananarama.

In 2019, Fahey reunited with Marcella Detroit for Shakespears Sister dates, commencing with an appearance on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 10 May 2019.

==Personal life==
Fahey married Dave Stewart of Eurythmics in 1987; the couple divorced in 1996. They have two sons, Samuel (born 26 November 1987) and Django James (born 1991). The two brothers formed a musical band called Nightmare and the Cat. As an infant, Samuel Stewart appeared in early Shakespears Sister videos for &quot;Heroine&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re History&quot;. Django Stewart is also an actor. Samuel is currently the guitarist for the American indie rock band Lo Moon.

Prior to her marriage to Stewart, Fahey was romantically involved with Jim Reilly, the drummer for the Northern Irish punk rock band Stiff Little Fingers and Scottish singer Bobby Bluebell of the Bluebells, with whom she co-wrote the UK No. 1 &quot;Young at Heart&quot;.

==Notes==
 a Since their inclusion on &quot;Songs from the Red Room&quot;, an album by Fahey&#x27;s solo project Shakespears Sister, these songs are now usually credited as &#x27;Shakespears Sister&#x27; rather than &#x27;Siobhan Fahey&#x27;.

<text>The Captain Cook Bridge is a road bridge that carries the Pacific Motorway across the Brisbane River in Brisbane, in the state of Queensland, Australia. It was built exclusively for vehicular traffic and was completed in late 1972. The bridge had its naming ceremony on 13 December 1972, with it opening in January/February 1973. Shortly before it was opened to vehicular traffic, a once only pedestrian walk event across the bridge was held on 21 January 1973, organised by the Rotary Club of Stones Corner. The bridge crosses at the South Brisbane Reach of the river, linking Gardens Point in the Brisbane central business district on the north side to Kangaroo Point and South Brisbane on the southside.

==Location and features==

Captain Cook Bridge is constructed as a multispan, precast prestressed concrete free-cantilever bridge with drop-in mid-spans. Comprising a dual carriageway that creates two separate bridges, one for each direction of traffic, heading north–south over the Brisbane River. Each bridge carries four lanes of traffic in one direction and links the M3 Pacific Motorway to the M3 Riverside Expressway. It is the main route from the city&#x27;s south into the Brisbane central business district.

At the time of completion, the main span of held the world record for this type of structure for a period of three months, when it was superseded by the Harada Bridge in Japan with a span of .

The structure is Queensland&#x27;s busiest traffic bridge with more than one million vehicles crossing it weekly in 2007.

Downstream from the Captain Cook Bridge is the Story Bridge, while the Goodwill Bridge is the next crossing upstream.

Concerns were raised in 2007 about the structure&#x27;s integrity after it was revealed that contractors who attached a gantry to the bridge had drilled numerous holes which had damaged steel reinforcement bars. After investigations were completed it was concluded that the damage was insignificant as only 57 vertical steel bars out of had been cut.

==Upgrades==
A maintenance project, started in late 2019, and estimated to cost $26 million, was still ongoing in July 2022.

<text>The Goodwill Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist bridge which spans the Brisbane River in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The bridge connects the South Bank Parklands in South Brisbane to Gardens Point in the Brisbane CBD.

The Goodwill Bridge was opened on 21 October 2001 and takes its name from the Goodwill Games, which were held in Brisbane that year. The bridge does not carry any motorised traffic — it is shared by pedestrians, cyclists and inline skaters.

==Structure==
Two main components of The Goodwill Bridge are the pavilion and the arch. The pavilion is located in the middle of the Brisbane River between the arch and the city approach. It is a fundamental component of the pedestrian and cycle bridge and supports one end of the arch. The arch is
 in length, wide and high and weighs .

=== Specifications ===
* Width: 
* Height: Clearance for River Vessels from high water level to the bridge deck (same height as Victoria and Captain Cook bridges)
* Arch: in length, wide and high
* Bridge Deck: The bridge deck wearing surface is concrete with a broom finish to provide a safe foothold. It incorporates coloured concrete and applied finish bandings which signify areas where caution is required.
* Security: Six closed circuit TV cameras are spread across the bridge and are monitored from the South Bank Security Control Room.
* Architects: Cox Rayner
* Design Engineer: Ove Arup and Partners
* Principal Contractor: John Holland Group
*Superintendent: Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads
* Officially Opened: The Premier of Queensland, The Honourable Peter Beattie, officially opened The Goodwill Bridge on 21 October 2001.
* Total length: 
* Bridge Foundations: The bridge&#x27;s 45 foundation piles range in diameter from and are reinforced with 350-grade steel and of concrete.
* Central Arch span: 

==History==
The structure was built downstream at Hemmant and took three months to construct. On completion barges floated the arch upstream at low tide it was floated under the Captain Cook Bridge and then lifted as a single structure into its final resting position by two heavy lift towers. Four strategically positioned platforms and the pavilion-viewing platform provide rest points for pedestrians and cyclists. With exception of cables, all materials utilised in the construction of the arch and the pavilions were sourced from local suppliers.

Controversy arose during the construction of the bridge over its growing cost, and a subsequent budgetary blow-out which resulted in the use of $20.3 million in government funds. The bridge was scheduled to be opened by Queen Elizabeth II during her visit for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting summit to be held in Brisbane, but after the postponement of that meeting and change of venue to Coolum on the Sunshine Coast in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the bridge was instead opened by Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie.

==Usage==
Over 40,000 people walk or cycle across the bridge each week and it is clearly established as a major access point between South Bank and the city. Spanning the Brisbane River between the southern end of South Bank Parklands and the CBD via the Queensland University of Technology campus, the bridge provides a vital link for pedestrians and cyclists, especially since the closest train station to QUT is in South Bank.

The bridge is also popular amongst those who like to maintain fitness, providing a link for a continuous run. Traceurs also use the bridge not only to cross, but in strength training as a distance to travel in the Quadrupedel movement (which provides an arm and leg workout), and also refines coordination skills.

The bridge innovatively includes several outspanning seating bays which allow for contemplation of the river and relaxation.

The architectural design has received mixed reviews; many people see it as a work of art, while others consider it a monstrosity. This is likely due to its unconventional form; for instance, the bridge is entirely asymmetrical, and does not appear to follow any particular scheme with regards to placement of features.

Between 2013 and 2022, a coffee cart was in operation. This cafe received a high level of through flow traffic .

<text>The Focke-Wulf Ta 154 &quot;Moskito&quot; was a fast twin-engined night fighter aircraft designed by the German aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank and produced by the aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf. It was unofficially named &quot;Moskito&quot; due to its similarities with the de Havilland Mosquito (which was also largely made of wood) that were already in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF).

The Ta 154 commenced development in 1942 and was worked on during much of the latter half of the Second World War. It was designed to replace variants of the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88 and function as a specialised night fighter. As per a stipulation issued by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM), wood comprised over half of the material needed to build the Ta 154. A special phenolic resin adhesive called Tego film was used to bond sections together. It was originally designated &quot;Ta 211&quot; in reference to the intended Jumo 211R engine, although it was subsequently decided to adopt the more powerful Jumo 213 powerplant instead. Following a review of Focke-Wulf&#x27;s submission, a development contract was issued to the company during late 1942.

On 1 July 1943, the prototype &quot;Ta 154 V1&quot; performed its maiden flight; it was piloted by Kurt Tank. One of the early prototypes undertook competitive flight testing against both the Heinkel He 219 and the Junkers Ju 388, besting both of these rival aircraft. During March 1944, even though the first eight pre-production aircraft were yet to be completed, the &quot;Jägerstab&quot; decreed that 37 Ta 154s ought to be completed by May 1944 and that 250 aircraft were to be produced each month by November 1944. This schedule proved highly unrealistic in light of various technical and logistical issues, with key parts (such as engines) not being available in sufficient quantity. Perhaps most crucially, the only factory that produced Tego-Film, in Wuppertal, was bombed by the RAF while replacement bonding agents proved to be inferior and a source of catastrophic mid-flight structural failures.

During September 1944, amid a complete production stoppage, the RLM opted to terminate the Ta 154 programme. Only a few production standard aircraft were completed, and these proved to possess less impressive performance than the prototypes. Several pre-production aircraft were also converted for operational use. Several Ta 154s were flown by &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 3&quot; (Night Fighter Wing 3) while a handful are believed to have been also used as training aircraft for jet pilots. Furthermore, at least three &quot;Pulkzerstörer&quot; (Formation Destroyer) and &quot;Mistel&quot; parasite fighter schemes were mooted for the type.

==Development==
===Background===
The origins of the Ta 154 &quot;Moskito&quot; is closely linked to the wartime demands of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. In 1942, it had become increasing clear that, amid increasingly intense Allied bombardment of Germany, a new type of night fighter was desirable to replace both the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88. One such aircraft, the Heinkel He 219, was already in development, however, during September 1942, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) issued a fresh requirement that called for a specialised night fighter that, unlike the He 219, would be primarily constructed out of wood. The intended benefit of this decision was not only as an economic measure to minimise the use of metal but also to take advantage of Germany&#x27;s available labour pool, which had numerous skilled woodworkers that had not effectively transitioned to metalworking.

This requirement was received by the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf, who quickly decided to undertake work towards fulfilling it. A Bremen-based design team at the firm, headed by Kurt Tank, set about studying a fast attack-bomber aircraft that had been initially designated Ta 211 (due to its planned use of an uprated Jumo 211R engine). The envisioned &quot;Ta 21&quot; bomber was a high-wing twin-engined design, built primarily of plywood and bonded with a special phenolic resin adhesive called Tego film. The material composition of the basic design included approximately 57 per cent wood, 30 per cent steel, and 13 per cent duralumin. Both single-seat and twin-seat variants were proposed at a relatively early stage.

Due to the scarcity of steel tubing, both the primary and auxiliary spars made use of wood box construction while extensive use of wood bonding was made across the whole airframe. A retractable nose-wheel undercarriage was selected, the main gear of which retracted rearwards into recesses within the engine nacelles while the nose gear pivoted backwards into the fuselage. Furthermore, it was fitted with broad diameter tyres as to permit the aircraft to use grass airstrips. It had a stepped cockpit canopy, the windscreen of which was composed of armoured glass; an additional 150 kg of armour was strategically distributed around the cockpit to protect its occupant(s). Dependent upon the variant, the cockpit contained a single pilot and a radio/radar operator, the latter just aft of the former. Fuel was housed in a pair of fuselage tanks, one was located directly aft of the primary wing spar while the other was just behind the auxiliary spar.

By 14 October 1942, the basic calculations were complete; layout drawings were completed five days later. The RLM warmly received Focke-Wulf&#x27;s proposal and promptly issued a general development contract. It was at this stage that the &quot;Ta 154&quot; designation was applied to the aircraft; unofficially, it was named &quot;Moskito&quot; in reference to its similarity to the de Havilland Mosquito fast bombers (which was also largely made of wood) already in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Around this time, the de Havilland Mosquito, was conducting missions upon Germany itself and was quickly building up an impressive record; in its first 600 bombing missions, only one was shot down, compared to an average of five per cent for the RAF&#x27;s medium and heavy bombers. Erhard Milch personally requested a purpose-built German answer, and selected the Ta 154. Infighting within German circles started almost immediately, because the RLM and night fighter units — as well as Ernst Heinkel himself — still wanted the Heinkel He 219. Milch took this personally, and spent the better part of the next two years trying to have the He 219 program terminated, partly against Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s wishes.

During the aircraft&#x27;s development, it became apparent that the most suitable engine to power the Ta 154 was the more powerful Jumo 213, and that Junkers could not deliver the originally-desired Jumo 211R engine on schedule due to technical and production difficulties.

===Into flight and production issues===
On 1 July 1943, the prototype &quot;Ta 154 V1&quot;, which was outfitted with Jumo 211F engines and bore the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; identification code &quot;TE+FE&quot;, performed its maiden flight in the hands of Kurt Tank. It was followed by &quot;V2&quot; with Jumo 211N engines, which was kept at the factory for handling trials. V1 was later dispatched to Rechlin-Lärz Airfield to conduct fly-off testing against the competing He 219A as well as the new Junkers Ju 388. Reportedly, the aircraft reached almost 700 km/h (440 mph) and easily outflew the other two aircraft, but those were both fully armed and equipped with radar apparatus. In comparison, neither V1 or V2 were fitted with radar at this stage.

On 23 November 1943, the &quot;V3&quot; prototype, which was also the first to be powered by the Jumo 211R engines and carry radar apparatus, made its first flight. The added weight of the guns and drag of the 32-dipole element &quot;Matratze&quot; radar antennas used on its UHF-band FuG 212 C-1 Lichtenstein radar unit slowed the aircraft by a full 75 km/h, although it was still somewhat faster than the He 219. The rest of the 15 prototypes were then delivered as &quot;A-0&quot; models, identical to the V3. Some of these also included a raised canopy for better vision to the rear.

During March 1944, the &quot;Jägerstab&quot; decreed that Focke-Wulf should produce 37 Ta 154s by May 1944; in combination with other manufacturing assets, the production rate was somewhat unrealistically expected to reach 250 aircraft per month by November 1944. This schedule came in advance of the completion of the first eight pre-production aircraft, designated &quot;Ta 154A-0&quot;, which occurred in August of that year. These were briefly trialled by the service test unit before returning to development work. Transportation issues, which prevented subcontractors from delivering components, were highly damaging to the company&#x27;s efforts to ramp up production; at one point, each airframe was reportedly taking 12,000 man-hours to produce. By June 1944, the Jumo 213 was finally arriving in some numbers, permitting the completion of several &quot;Ta 154 A-1s&quot; with these engines.

However, the Ta 154 received a fatal blow when the only factory that produced Tego-Film, in Wuppertal, was bombed out by the RAF, and the plywood glue had to be replaced by an alternative. While determined efforts were made towards this end, the new bonding agents proved to be neither as strong and even weakened the wood due to it containing too much acid and thus being corrosive. In July 1944, several Ta 154 A-1s reportedly disintegrated during high speed flight, allegedly due to the delamination and failure of the plywood wing. This same problem also critically affected the Heinkel He 162 &quot;Spatz&quot;, Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s &quot;Volksjäger&quot; jet fighter program entry; the issue with the bonding agent was eventually resolved on this programme however.

Accordingly, production came to a halt in August 1944. One month later, the RLM officially cancelled the Ta 154, by which point Milch had been removed from his position and thus could no longer protect the programme. It is believed that about 50 production aircraft had been completed, and a number of the A-0 preproduction aircraft were later modified to production standard. An unknown number of the aircraft served with &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 3&quot; (Night Fighter Wing 3), and a few were later used as training aircraft for jet pilots.

==&quot;Mistel/Pulkzerstörer&quot; variants==
The designation Ta 154A-2/U3 was given to six unfinished 154A-1 airframes completed and converted into &quot;Pulkzerstörer&quot; (Formation Destroyer) aircraft. At least three &quot;Pulkzerstörer&quot; and &quot;Mistel&quot; parasite fighter schemes were mooted for the Ta 154. The only one of the three that was actually brought to operational readiness (Ta 154A-2/U3) was a system whereby the entire forward fuselage ahead of the fuel tanks was filled with Amatol high explosive. A new and extremely small cockpit for the pilot was added to the airframe directly ahead of the tailfin. From this cramped cabin, the pilot would fly the &#x27;Bomb &quot;Moskito&quot; &#x27; into an Allied bomber formation, arm the onboard charges and quickly bail out. A timer would then detonate the explosives a few seconds later. Fragmentation charges in the warhead would maximize the effective area of destruction.

It was hoped that this flying bomb system would tear large holes in the Anglo-American bomber streams at little cost to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in terms of pilot casualties. The six Ta 154A-2/U3 &#x27;Bomb &quot;Moskitos&quot; were completed at the Focke-Wulf plant near Poznań shortly before the occupation of the area by the Red Army, but were not used in combat. Their ultimate fate is unknown, though it is likely they were destroyed by the plant&#x27;s staff to prevent them being captured. One Ta 154 &quot;Mistel&quot; scheme, reportedly designated &quot;Mistel 7&quot;, envisaged a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 &#x27;mother aircraft&#x27; mounted on struts above an unmanned Bomb &quot;Moskito&quot;. Takeoff would be effected via a sturdy three-wheeled trolley of the same type designed for the abandoned A-series of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance bomber. The trolley would be jettisoned after takeoff, leaving the &quot;Mistel&quot; &quot;Moskito&quot; to fly to its target with all three engines running. The combination would formate above an Allied bomber stream before the 190 pilot released the Bomb &quot;Moskito&quot;, which would then hopefully crash straight into a bomber with massively destructive effect. A related scheme would see a standard Ta 154 towing a Bomb &quot;Moskito&quot; behind it into the middle of a bomber stream, whereupon release and detonation would be initiated by the manned Ta 154&#x27;s pilot.

<text>Risk-aware consensual kink (RACK, also risk-accepted consensual kink) is an acronym used by some of the BDSM community to describe a philosophical view that is generally permissive of certain risky sexual behaviors, as long as the participants are fully aware of the risks. This is often viewed in contrast to [[Safe, sane and consensual|safe, sane, and consensual]] which generally holds that only activities that are considered safe, sane, and consensual are permitted.

== Philosophy ==
The philosophy for RACK consists of the following components:
* Risk-aware: The partners involved are well-informed of the risks involved in the proposed activity.
* Consensual: In light of those risks, both or all partners have, of sound mind, offered preliminary consent to engage in said activity.
* Kink: Said activity can be classified as alternative sex.

While &quot;Safe, sane and consensual&quot; (SSC) attempts to describe and differentiate BDSM from abuse in ways that are easy for the non-BDSM public to comprehend, RACK differs from it in that it acknowledges that nothing is ever 100% inherently safe. By acknowledging that what may be safe or sane to one person may not be considered the same to another, the RACK philosophy tends to be more inclusive of activities that others may consider as edgeplay. There is no &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;not safe&quot; within RACK, only &quot;safer&quot; and &quot;less safe.&quot;

== History ==

RACK was coined in reaction to dissatisfaction within the BDSM community regarding SSC. According to David Stein, the man who coined &quot;Safe, Sane, and Consensual S/M&quot; for New York&#x27;s Gay Male S/M Activists organization, SSC was only intended to be put forward as a minimum standard for ethically defensible S/M play, to establish a distinction between play between loving S/M partners and the public perception of sadomasochism which would be more accurately described as abusive behavior. Over time, as the phrase started spreading through the larger community and appeared on bumper stickers and T-shirts, people started to associate &quot;safe&quot; with &quot;risk-free,&quot; diluting the message. &quot;Instead of asking people to think about what it means to do S/M ethically, and to make the hard choices that are sometimes necessary (if only between what&#x27;s right and what&#x27;s right now), many organizations today act as if these issues have all been settled, assuring us that sadistic or masochistic behavior not deemed SSC isn&#x27;t S/M at all but something else — abuse, usually, or domestic violence or poor self-esteem.&quot;

In 1999, Gary Switch posted to The Eulenspiegel Society&#x27;s USENET list &quot;TES-Friends&quot; proposing the term RACK out of a desire to form a more accurate portrayal of the type of play that many engage in. Noting that nothing is truly 100% safe, not even crossing the street, Switch compared BDSM to the sport of mountain climbing. In both, risk is an essential part of the thrill, and that risk is minimized through study, training, technique, and practice.

== Variations ==
Not all members of the BDSM community adhere to one principle to the exclusion of the other.

* Some people subscribe to both mottos, using SSC as a description of the activities to any member of the general public, while using RACK as a description of the activities within members of a community.

* Still others define their own terms, the term PRICK (Personal Responsibility, Informed Consensual Kink) in particular emphasizes the concept of taking personal responsibility for your actions, as well as an informed analysis of the risks.

* In some &quot;old-guard&quot; circles the term &quot;Committed Compassionate Consensual&quot; is circulated.

<text>The Heinkel He 219 &quot;Uhu&quot; (&quot;Eagle-Owl&quot;) is a night fighter designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Heinkel. It primarily served with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the later stages of the Second World War.

Work on the He 219 begun in mid 1940 as a multi-purpose aircraft designated &quot;P.1055&quot;. It was a relatively sophisticated design that possessed a variety of innovations, including a pressurized cockpit, twin ejection seats and remotely controlled defensive gun turrets. The P.1055 was initially rejected by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM – the German Aviation Ministry), but Heinkel promptly reconfigured it as a night fighter, designated &quot;P.1060&quot;. In this capacity, it was equipped with a Lichtenstein SN-2 advanced VHF-band intercept radar (also used on the Ju 88G and Bf 110G night fighters). The He 219 was also the first operational military aircraft to be equipped with ejection seats and the first operational German aircraft to be equipped with tricycle landing gear. The prototype performed its maiden flight on 6 November 1942.

Both the development and production of the He 219 were protracted due to various factors, including political rivalries between Josef Kammhuber, commander of the German night fighter forces, Ernst Heinkel, the manufacturer and Erhard Milch, responsible for aircraft construction in the RLM. Other aircraft programmes, such as the Junkers Ju 188, Dornier Do 335 and Focke-Wulf Ta 154 Moskito, competed for attention and resources; Milch advocated for these programmes over the He 219. Furthermore, the aircraft was relatively complicated and expensive to build, as were the powerful DB 610 V-12 inline engines that powered it. Nevertheless, the He 219 made its combat debut on June 1943 and was quickly recognised for its value as a night fighter, even being allegedly effective against the Royal Air Force&#x27;s de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers.

In addition to its limited use as a night fighter, Heinkel worked on numerous different models of the He 219, including as a reconnaissance-bomber, high-altitude interceptor, and more advanced fighter. On 25 May 1944, production of the He 219 was officially terminated. Had the He 219 ever become available to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in large quantities, it is plausible that it could have had a significant effect against the strategic night bombing offensive conducted against Germany by the Royal Air Force (RAF); however, only 268 aircraft across all models were ever completed and thus the type only saw limited service between 1943 and 1945. Ernst-Wilhelm Modrow was the leading night fighter ace on the He 219, having been credited with 33 of his 34 night air victories on the type.

==Design and development==
===Background===
During the summer of 1940, Robert Lusser returned to Heinkel from Messerschmitt and immediately began work on a new high-speed bomber project designated &quot;P.1055&quot;. This was a shoulder-wing cantilever monoplane; the tailplane, which had considerable dihedral, had twin fins and rudders. The glazed canopy of the cockpit was faired into the nose of the aircraft and provided excellent external visibility for its two occupants, who were seated in an atypical back-to-back configuration. Many parts of the airframe, including its single-spar wing, rectangular-section fuselage and tail surfaces, were made of metal and had a stressed-skin covering.

The P.1055 was originally intended to be a multi-purpose aircraft, and was a relatively advanced design for the era, with a pressurized cockpit, twin ejection seats (the first to be planned for use in any combat aircraft), tricycle landing gear and remotely controlled, side-mounted FDSL 131 defensive gun turrets. Power was to be provided by a pair of DB 610 &quot;power system&quot; engines producing (2,950 PS/2,910 hp) each, delivering a performance with a top speed of approximately 750 km/h (470 mph) and a 4,000 km (2,500 mi) range with a 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) bomb load.

In August 1940, an initial review by the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; rejected the P.1055 considering it to be too complex and risky. Lusser quickly offered four versions of the fighter with various wingspans and engine choices in order to balance performance and risk. He also offered the &quot;P.1056&quot;, a night fighter with four 20 mm cannon in the wings and fuselage. The RLM rejected all of these proposals on the same grounds in 1941. Heinkel was furious and fired Lusser on the spot.

About the same time as Lusser was designing the P.1055, Kammhuber had started looking for an aircraft for his rapidly growing night fighter force. Heinkel quickly re-designed the P.1055 for this role as the &quot;P.1060&quot;. This was similar in layout but somewhat smaller and powered by two DB 603 inverted V12 engines. As designed by Heinkel, these engines&#x27; nacelles had annular radiators. The early DB 603 subtypes had poor altitude performance, which was a problem for Heinkel&#x27;s short-winged design, but Daimler had a new &quot;G&quot; subtype of the DB 603 powerplant meant to produce 1,400 kW (1,900 PS) take-off power apiece under development to remedy the problem. Heinkel was sure he had a winner and sent the design off to the RLM in January 1942, while he funded the first prototype himself. The RLM again rejected the He 219, in favour of new Ju 88- and Me 210-based designs.

===Prototypes===
Construction of the prototype was started in February 1942; however, one month later, work was set back when Daimler reported that the intended DB 603G engine would not be ready in time and an alternative engine arrangement was necessary. Even still, DB 603 engines did not arrive until August 1942, and the prototype made its maiden flight until 6 November 1942. When Kammhuber saw the prototype on 19 November, he was so impressed that he immediately ordered it into production over Milch&#x27;s objections. Milch, who had rejected the He 219 in January, was enraged.

During early January 1943, a series of competitive trials were flown between the second prototype of the He 219 and the Junkers Ju 188; these were inconclusive. One problem was that the He 219 possessed less stability than desired; to overcome this, Heinkel offered a cash prize to engineers to develop corrective measures. In March 1943, a more comprehensive series of tests were conducted in which the He 219 proved to be superior to both the Ju 188 and the Dornier Do 217. The same month, the He 219 programme was dealt a major blow when Heinkel&#x27;s works at Rostock were struck by an RAF bombing raid which, amongst other things, destroyed three-quarters of the drawings; soon afterwards, the design office was transferred to Vienna.

During the development process several changes were made to the armament. The dorsal rear defensive guns mounted on top of the fuselage and firing directly rearward were removed due to their tendency to become detached from the fuselage when fired. The forward-firing armament was increased to two Mauser MG 151/20 20 mm autocannon in the wing roots, inboard of the propeller arcs and four more MG 151/20 autocannon mounted in the ventral fuselage tray. The A-0 model had a bulletproof shield which could be raised in the front cockpit, protecting the bottom portion of the windscreen. Production prototypes were then ordered as the &quot;He 219 A-0&quot; and quickly progressed to the point where &quot;V7&quot;, &quot;V8&quot; and &quot;V9&quot; were handed over to operational units in June 1943 for testing.

The earlier prototypes, with four-blade propellers had blunt, compound-curvature noses, as used for production-series aircraft. The early examples of these had cutouts for the forward-projecting masts of the &quot;Matratze&quot; radar antennae of at least the first five prototypes, used with the early UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C or C-1 radar installation. These early He 219V-series prototypes also had cockpit canopies that did not smoothly taper on their upper surface, as on the later production aircraft, but instead ended in a nearly hemispherical enclosure. 
In December 1943, Milch pushed for the He 219 programme to be cancelled in favour of the Junkers Ju 88G on the basis that the performance of the Ju 88G was sufficient to handle Allied bombers and that increasing production of the He 219 would disrupt manufacturing efforts. Milch also proposed that the Dornier Do 335 be favoured over the He 219. Milch repeatedly sought to have the programme cancelled; these efforts reportedly led to Kammhuber being removed from office. On 25 May 1944, production of the He 219 was officially ended after Milch persuaded RLM officials to redirect resources to the Junkers Ju 388 and Focke-Wulf Ta 154 Moskito programmes. Despite the programme being officially terminated, Heinkel continued low-rate production of the He 219.

==Operational history==
The He 219 had an auspicious combat debut. On the night of 11–12 June 1943, Werner Streib flew the V9 and shot down five bombers between 01:05 and 02:22 hours, before crashing on landing. Claims have been made that, &quot;In the next ten days the three Heinkel He 219A-0 pre-production aircraft [shot] down a total of 20 RAF aircraft, including six of the previously &quot;untouchable&quot; de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers. Greatly encouraged, Kammhuber continued to press for immediate production.&quot; No record of corresponding Mosquito losses or any documentary evidence exists that He 219 pilots claimed six Mosquitos. In the opinion of the accomplished test pilot Capt. Eric Brown - who flew several He 219 A-2s after the conflict - the He 219 was &quot;decidedly &quot;underpowered&quot;&quot; (his italics) and the &quot;rate of climb was certainly unimpressive&quot; and found it to be &quot;short on performance to deal with the Mosquito&quot;.

The first model to be produced in quantity was the &quot;He 219 A-0&quot;, although initially the pre-production series, it matured into a long running production series, due to numerous changes incorporated into the design, along with the cancellation of several planned variants. As a result of production difficulties, the &quot;A-0&quot; did not reach &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; units until October 1943. The A-0 was typically armed with a pair of 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots and up to four 20 mm or 30 mm cannon in a ventral weapons bay. The first 10–15 aircraft were delivered with the 490 MHz UHF-band &quot;FuG&quot; 212 &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; C-1 radar with a 4 × 8-dipole element &quot;Matratze&quot; antenna array. In total, 104 He 219 A-0s were built until the summer of 1944, the majority of them at EHW (&quot;Ernst Heinkel Wien&quot;) or &quot;Heinkel-Süd&quot; in Wien-Schwechat.

The first planned version to reach production was the &quot;He 219 A-2&quot; model, which had longer engine nacelles containing extra fuel tanks, unitized 1670 PS DB 603AA engines with higher critical altitude and often also two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon, as an offensive &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; upward-firing system completely contained within the rear fuselage, with the cannons&#x27; muzzles even with the dorsal fuselage surface. With Schräge Musik, the ventral weapons bay held two cannon due to space limitations. The A-2 featured an updated, 90 MHz VHF-band Telefunken FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 radar system, complete with its larger, high-drag 4 × 2-dipole element &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; aerials. It initially had a longer minimum range than the C-1 radar, but had improved accuracy and resolution and was also less vulnerable to chaff jamming. Through the late summer of 1944, a total of 85 He 219 A-2s were built until November 1944, most at EHR (&quot;Ernst Heinkel Rostock&quot;) or &quot;Heinkel-Nord&quot; in Rostock-Marienehe (now Rostock-Schmarl).

The He 219 was a capable fighter aircraft and the pilots were free to hunt down any detected Allied bombers. Typically, ground control would dispatch aircraft into the right area, at which point the pilots took over and guided themselves towards the bombers using information from their onboard &quot;Lichtenstein&quot; VHF radar. The SN-2 radar&#x27;s 4 km (3 mi) maximum detection range was greater than the distance between the bombers. While the performance of the A-2 was not extraordinary—approximately 580 km/h (360 mph) speed—it was enough of an advance over the Messerschmitt Bf 110Gs and Dornier Do 217Ns for the crew to chase several bombers in a single sortie. The He 219 was typically well received by personnel; ground crews benefited from its high level of accessibility for maintenance work. Furthermore, the inclusion of an ejector seat was credited with saving the lives of numerous air crew. Pilots also favoured its weapons placement.

In order to improve its ability to intercept the Mosquito, one model of the He 219 was intentionally stripped to minimise its weight. Following the removal of some armaments and radio apparatus, the aircraft was able to attain a speed of 650 km/h (404 mph); this version was given the designation &quot;A-6&quot;. None of these were produced, but similar weight saving measures could be undertaken at the unit level. The He 219 was the only piston-engined night fighter capable of combat with the Mosquito on equal terms, given its speed, manoeuvrability and firepower, however, it was never able to play a significant role in the conflict because Germany&#x27;s industrial base failing to produce it in sufficient numbers.

The last major production version was the &quot;A-7&quot; with improved, unitized DB 603E engines. The A-7 typically had two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots (inboard of the propeller arcs), two 20 mm MG 151/20 in the ventral weapons bay and two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108s as rear-fuselage dorsal mount, upwards-firing &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; offensive ordnance. Production of 210 aircraft was to start November/December 1944, but the number produced is not known as original documents have been lost or contained no sub-version number.

===Further developments===
The follow-on series to the He 219As in service was to be the &quot;He 219B&quot; fitted with the new 1,864 kW (2,500 hp) Junkers Jumo 222A/B 24-cylinder engines which would have allowed the He 219 to reach 700 km/h (440 mph). The He 219B was also to have had an increased span of 22.06 m (72.38 ft), for better high altitude performance. The Jumo 222 did not reach production status, with just under 300 examples built in at least three differing displacement sizes. Only a few test machines were ever fitted with the engines; some additional airframes were built with the enlarged wing. These examples were intended to fly with high-altitude versions of the standard DB 603 powerplants in place of the Jumo 222 multibank powerplants, but only one or two test machines ever flew with them.

A further adaptation would have been the He 219C, also intended to use the B-series design&#x27;s big wing and Jumo 222 powerplants as well as an all-new fuselage of 17.15 m (56.27 ft), with a complete three-man Ju 388J cockpit section forward, converted to accept the He 219A&#x27;s standard nose gear layout the Borsig-designed &quot;Hecklafette&quot; HL 131V &quot;quadmount&quot;, hydraulic-powered four-gun manned tail turret intended for later He 177A versions and the He 177B-5, as well as more than one &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; strategic bomber design competitor. Day bomber and night fighter versions were proposed and metal was cut for the project but since the 1,500-kW Jumo 222 engines remained experimental they never flew.

Paper projects include the very-high-altitude He 219E with a vastly increased wingspan of 28.5 m (93.5 ft) and 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) output rated DB 614 engines, which were apparently a further-uprated version of the never-produced DB 603G inverted V12, capable of the desired 1,491 kW (2,000 hp) power output level that Germany were unable to develop into a reliable powerplant.

A more reasonable project was the Hütter Hü 211, a design by Wolfgang Hütter that took a standard He 219 fuselage and tail and added a long-span, high aspect ratio wing of 24.55 m (80.54 ft) to create a fast, high altitude interceptor. Since this design was also meant to be powered by the ill-fated Jumo 222 it never flew, although work continued on two sets of wings until they were destroyed by Allied bombing.

When the war had ended in Europe, the U.S. Army Air Forces Intelligence Service, as part of &quot;Operation LUSTY&quot; (Luftwaffe Secret Technology), took control of three He 219s at the Grove base of the 1st Night Fighter Wing (&quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 1&quot;) in Jutland, Denmark starting on 16 June 1945. These aircraft were made flight-worthy by &quot;Watson&#x27;s Whizzers&quot; and flown to Cherbourg, France. He 219 A-2 &quot;Werknummer&quot; 290202 was shipped to the United States with 21 other captured German aircraft on board the British escort carrier , and was reassembled at Newark Army Air Field, Newark, New Jersey.

By August 2014, the wing structure (without control surfaces fitted) had been essentially restored, and was ready for the trip to the NASM&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center shops within its integral Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, to join the fuselage and engine nacelles there, with replacement &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; VHF-band radar antenna components to be fabricated, based on a preserved example located in Europe and loaned to the NASM for replication, as part of the ongoing restoration process. The repainted wings were displayed during the 30 January 2016 open house in the restoration hangar paint shack.

He 219 A-2 &quot;Werknummer&quot; 290202 is currently restored and on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center by Dulles Airport. Previously only the fuselage, empennage, and engines were on display, while the wings were stored at the Paul Garber Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. As of 2021 the restored and assembled aircraft, including its wings, nacelles (possibly as Heinkel-designed specific, &quot;Kraftei&quot; unitized powerplant installations), and partially restored DB 603 engines (missing propellers) can be seen displayed next the museum&#x27;s Arado Ar 234 and Dornier Do 335, the only surviving examples of those aircraft, both of which accompanied WkNr. 290202 across the Atlantic over 60 years ago.

In April 2012, a previously unknown He 219 was salvaged from the sea bed, 100 meters from the beach, north of Hirtshals, Denmark. The remains are in several pieces, but will undergo restoration and eventually be displayed at Aalborg, Denmark. Although severely damaged and missing many parts, the remains of this aircraft was preserved and then put on display at the Forsvars- og Garnisonsmuseum in Aalborg, Denmark. In August 2015 it was announced that the wreckage had been sold to an Austrian enthusiast for further restoration.

<doc id="177153" wikidata="Q207375" url="?curid=177153" title="ER (TV series)">
<text>ER is an American medical drama television series created by Michael Crichton that aired on NBC from September 19, 1994, to April 2, 2009, with a total of 331 episodes spanning 15 seasons. It was produced by Constant c Productions and Amblin Television, in association with Warner Bros. Television. &quot;ER&quot; follows the inner life of the emergency room (ER) of Cook County General Hospital, a fictionalized version of the real Cook County Hospital, in Chicago, and the various critical professional, ethical, and personal issues faced by the department&#x27;s physicians, nurses, and staff.

The show is the second longest-running primetime medical drama in American television history behind &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. The highest awarded medical drama, &quot;ER&quot; won 128 industry awards from 442 nominations, including the Peabody Award in 1995, TCA Award for Program of the Year in 1995, and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1996. As of 2014, &quot;ER&quot; had grossed over in television revenue. It is considered one of the best medical dramas of all time, pioneering the field of medical fiction and setting a model for other contemporary medical dramas to follow.

==Production==

In 1974, author Michael Crichton wrote a screenplay then titled &quot;EW&quot; (for &quot;Emergency Ward&quot;) based on his own experiences as a medical student in a busy hospital emergency room. Producers were not interested in the screenplay, and Crichton turned to other topics. In 1990, he published the novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, and in 1993 began a collaboration with director Steven Spielberg on the film adaptation of the book.

After its release, Crichton and Spielberg then turned to what was now known as &quot;ER&quot;, but Spielberg decided to film the story as a two-hour pilot for a television series rather than as a feature film after considering the potential for various stories to be told in the setting. He passed the script on to a team at his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Anthony Thomopoulos, then head of Amblin&#x27;s television division, got in touch with then CEO of Warner Bros. Television, Les Moonves, about the idea for the series and to send the script. Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Television provided John Wells as the show&#x27;s executive producer.

Warner Bros. Television pitched &quot;ER&quot; to NBC, alongside Crichton, Spielberg and Wells. Warren Littlefield, head of NBC Entertainment at the time, liked the project, but there was much debate and controversy among other executives at NBC, who were dubious about the nature of the series. NBC offered a chance to make a two-hour made-for-TV movie from the script, which was rejected. They then tried to get the show greenlit at rival networks before returning to NBC, who this time around ordered a pilot.

The script used to shoot the pilot was virtually unchanged from what Crichton had written in 1974. The only substantive changes made by the producers in 1994 were that a male character was changed to a female character (Susan Lewis) and the Peter Benton character&#x27;s race was changed to African-American. The running time was shortened by about 20 minutes in order for the pilot to air in a two-hour block on network TV. Because of a lack of time and money necessary to build a set, the pilot episode of &quot;ER&quot; was filmed in the former Linda Vista Hospital in Los Angeles, an old facility that had ceased operating in 1990. A set modeled after Los Angeles County General Hospital&#x27;s emergency room was built soon afterward at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, although the show makes extensive use of location shoots in Chicago, most notably the city&#x27;s famous &quot;L&quot; train platforms.

Littlefield was impressed by the series: &quot;We were intrigued, but we were admittedly a bit spooked in attempting to go back into that territory a few years after &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;.&quot; With Spielberg attached behind the scenes, NBC ordered six episodes. &quot;&quot;ER&quot; premiered opposite a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game on ABC and did surprisingly well. Then we moved it to Thursday and it just took off,&quot; commented Littlefield. &quot;ER&quot;″s success surprised the networks and critics alike, as David E. Kelley&#x27;s new medical drama &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; was expected to crush the new series, airing directly opposite &quot;ER&quot; in the Thursday 10:00 pm time slot over on CBS.

Crichton was credited as an executive producer until his death in November 2008, although he was still credited as one throughout that entire final season. Wells, the series&#x27; other initial executive producer, served as showrunner for the first four seasons. He was the show&#x27;s most prolific writer and became a regular director in later years. Lydia Woodward was a part of the first season production team and became an executive producer for the third season. She took over as showrunner for the fifth season while Wells focused on the development of other series, including &quot;Trinity&quot;, &quot;Third Watch&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. John Wells continued to serve as the primary Executive Producer for the remainder of the series. Lydia Woodward left her executive producer position at the end of the sixth season but continued to write episodes throughout the series run.

Joe Sachs, who was a writer and producer of the series, believed keeping a commitment to medical accuracy was extremely important: &quot;We&#x27;d bend the rules but never break them. A medication that would take 10 minutes to work might take 30 seconds instead. We compressed time. A 12- to 24-hour shift gets pushed into 48 minutes. But we learned that being accurate was important for more reasons than just making real and responsible drama.&quot;

Woodward was replaced as showrunner by Jack Orman. Orman was recruited as a writer-producer for the series in its fourth season after a successful stint working on CBS&#x27;s &quot;JAG&quot;. He was quickly promoted and became an executive producer and showrunner for the series&#x27; seventh season. He held these roles for three seasons before leaving the series at the end of the ninth season. Orman was also a frequent writer and directed three episodes of the show.

David Zabel served as the series&#x27; head writer and executive producer in its later seasons. He initially joined the crew for the eighth season and became an executive producer and showrunner for the twelfth season onward. Zabel was the series&#x27; most frequent writer, contributing to 41 episodes. He also made his directing debut on the series. Christopher Chulack was the series&#x27; most frequent director and worked as a producer on all 15 seasons. He became an executive producer in the fourth season but occasionally scaled back his involvement in later years to focus on other projects.

Other executive producers include writers Carol Flint, Neal Baer, R. Scott Gemmill, Joe Sachs, Dee Johnson, Lisa Zwerling, and Janine Sherman Barrois. Several of these writers and producers had background in healthcare: Joe Sachs was an emergency physician, while Lisa Zwerling and Neal Baer were both pediatricians. The series&#x27; crew was recognized with awards for writing, directing, producing, film editing, sound editing, casting, and music.

==Broadcast==
Following the broadcast of its two-hour pilot on September 19, 1994, &quot;ER&quot; premiered Thursday, September 22 at 10pm. It remained in the same Thursday time slot for its entire run, capping the Must See TV primetime block. &quot;ER&quot; is NBC&#x27;s third longest-running drama, after &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and the second longest-running American primetime medical drama of all time, behind ABC&#x27;s &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Starting with season seven, &quot;ER&quot; was broadcast in the 1080i HD format, appearing in letterbox format when presented in standard definition. On April 2, 2008, NBC announced that the series would return for its fifteenth season. The fifteenth season was originally scheduled to run for 19 episodes before retiring with a two-hour series finale to be broadcast on March 12, 2009, but NBC announced in January 2009 that it would extend the show by an additional three episodes to a full 22-episode order as part of a deal to launch a new series by John Wells titled &quot;Police&quot;, later retitled &quot;Southland&quot;. &quot;ER&quot;″s final episode aired on April 2, 2009; the two-hour episode was preceded by a one-hour retrospective special. The series finale charged $425,000 per 30-second ad spot, more than three times the season&#x27;s rate of $135,000. From season 4 to season 6 &quot;ER&quot; cost a record-breaking $13 million per episode. TNT also paid a record price of $1 million an episode for four years of repeats of the series during that time. The cost of the first three seasons was $2 million per episode and seasons 7 to 9 cost $8 million per episode.

==Cast and characters==

The original starring cast consisted of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Noah Wyle as medical student John Carter, and Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton. As the series continued, some key changes were made: Nurse Carol Hathaway, played by Julianna Margulies, who attempts suicide in the original pilot script, was made into a regular cast member. Ming-Na debuted in the middle of the first season as medical student Jing-Mei &quot;Deb&quot; Chen, but did not return for the second season; she returns in season 6 episode 10. Gloria Reuben and Laura Innes would join the series as Physician Assistant Jeanie Boulet and Dr. Kerry Weaver, respectively, by the second season.

In the third season, a series of cast additions and departures began that would see the entire original cast leave over time. Stringfield was the first to exit the series, reportedly upsetting producers who believed she wanted to negotiate for more money, but the actress did not particularly care for &quot;fame.&quot;
 She would return to the series from 2001 until 2005. Clooney departed the series in 1999 to pursue a film career, and Margulies exited the following year. Season eight saw the departure of La Salle and Edwards when Benton left County General and Greene died from a brain tumor. Wyle left the series after season 11 in order to spend more time with his family, but would return for two multiple-episode appearances in the show&#x27;s twelfth and final seasons. Maria Bello as Dr. Anna Del Amico, Alex Kingston as Dr. Elizabeth Corday, Paul McCrane as Dr. Robert Romano, Kellie Martin as medical student Lucy Knight, Goran Višnjić as Dr. Luka Kovač, Michael Michele as Dr. Cleo Finch, Erik Palladino as Dr. Dave Malucci, Maura Tierney as Nurse Abby Lockhart, Sharif Atkins as medical student Michael Gallant and Mekhi Phifer as Dr. Greg Pratt all joined the cast as the seasons went on. In the much later seasons, the show would see the additions of Parminder Nagra as medical student Neela Rasgotra, Scott Grimes as Dr. Archie Morris, Linda Cardellini as Nurse Sam Taggart, Shane West as Dr. Ray Barnett, John Stamos as Paramedic Tony Gates, David Lyons as Dr. Simon Brenner, and Angela Bassett as Dr. Cate Banfield.

In addition to the main cast, &quot;ER&quot; featured a large number of frequently seen recurring cast members who played key roles such as paramedics, hospital support staff, nurses, and doctors. &quot;ER&quot; also featured a sizable roster of well-known guest stars, some making rare television appearances, who typically played patients in single episode appearances or multi-episode arcs.

==Episodes==


A typical episode centered on the ER, with most scenes set in the hospital or surrounding streets. In addition, most seasons included at least one storyline located completely outside of the ER, often outside of Chicago. Over the span of the series, stories took place in the Congo, Iraq, France, and Sudan. One early storyline involved a road trip taken by Dr. Ross and Dr. Greene to California and a season eight episode included a storyline in Hawaii featuring Dr. Greene and Dr. Corday. Beginning in season nine, storylines started to include the Congo, featuring Dr. Kovač, Dr. Carter, and Dr. Pratt. &quot;We turned some attention on the Congo and on Darfur when nobody else was. We had a bigger audience than a nightly newscast will ever see, making 25 to 30 million people aware of what was going on in Africa,&quot; &quot;ER&quot; producer John Wells said. &quot;The show is not about telling people to eat their vegetables, but if we can do that in an entertaining context, then there&#x27;s nothing better.&quot; The series also focused on sociopolitical issues such as HIV and AIDS, organ transplants, mental illness, racism, human trafficking, euthanasia, poverty and gay rights.

Some episodes used creative formats, such as the 1997 &quot;Ambush,&quot; which was broadcast live twice, once for the east coast and again three hours later for the west coast, and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Hindsight,&quot; which ran in reverse time as it followed one character, Dr. Kovač, through the events of a Christmas Eve shift and the Christmas party that preceded it.

===Crossover with &quot;Third Watch&quot;===

The episode &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; (first broadcast on April 25, 2002) begins a crossover that concludes on the &quot;Third Watch&quot; episode &quot;Unleashed&quot; in which Dr. Lewis enlists the help of Officers Maurice Boscorelli and Faith Yokas to find her sister and niece.

==Ratings==
U.S. seasonal rankings based on average total viewers per episode of &quot;ER&quot; on NBC are tabulated below. Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps. All times mentioned in this section were in the Eastern and Pacific time zones. Ratings for seasons 1–2 are listed in households (the percentage of households watching the program), while ratings for seasons 3–15 are listed in viewers.

In its first year, &quot;ER&quot; attracted an average of 19 million viewers per episode, becoming the year&#x27;s second most watched television show, just behind &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In the following two seasons (1995–1997), &quot;ER&quot; was the most watched show in North America. For almost five years, &quot;ER&quot; battled for the top spot against &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, but in 1998, &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ended and then &quot;ER&quot; became number one again. The series finale attracted 16.4 million viewers. The show&#x27;s highest rating came during the episode &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; with 48 million viewers and a 45% market share. It was the highest for a regularly scheduled drama since a May 1985 installment of &quot;Dallas&quot; received a 46. The share represents the percentage of TVs in use tuned in to that show.

==Critical reception==
Throughout the series &quot;ER&quot; received positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Marvin Kitman from &quot;Newsday&quot; said: &quot;It&#x27;s like &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; with just the helicopters showing up and no laughs. &quot;E.R.&quot; is all trauma; you never get to know enough about the patients or get involved with them. It&#x27;s just treat, release and move on.&quot; Richard Zoglin from &quot;TIME&quot; stated that it&#x27;s &quot;probably the most realistic fictional treatment of the medical profession TV has ever presented.&quot;

NBC launched the show at the same time that CBS launched its own medical drama &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;; many critics drew comparisons between the two. Eric Mink, writing for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, concluded that &quot;ER&quot; may rate more highly in the Nielsens but &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; told better stories, while Alan Rich, writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, felt both shows were &quot;riveting, superior TV fare.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in 1996: &quot;Not being able to follow what on earth is going on remains one of the peculiar charms of the breakneck American hospital drama, &quot;ER&quot;.&quot;

In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;ER&quot; No. 22 on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 50 Shows,&quot; making it the second highest ranked medical drama on the list (after &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; at No. 20). Also, the episode &quot;Love&#x27;s Labor Lost&quot; was ranked No. 6 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time list having earlier been ranked No. 3. The show placed No. 19 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it No. 29 in their list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot; and said the best episode was &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; where &quot;Doug Ross (George Clooney) saves a young boy from drowning during a flood.&quot; In 2012, &quot;ER&quot; was voted Best TV Drama on ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; special episode &quot;Best in TV: The Greatest TV Shows of Our Time.&quot; In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it No. 9 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and No. 29 in its list of the 60 Best Series. In the same year, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;ER&quot; No. 28 in its list of the 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time.

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;ER&quot; has won 128 industry awards from 442 nominations, including the Peabody Award in 1995, TCA Award for Program of the Year in 1995, and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1996. It was also nominated for 124 Primetime Emmy Awards (with 23 wins), 25 Golden Globe Awards (with one win), 18 Screen Actors Guild Awards (with eight wins), 12 Directors Guild of America Awards (with four wins), 8 TCA Awards (with two wins), 5 Writers Guild of America Awards (with one win), and 3 Producers Guild of America Awards (with two wins).

==Distribution==

===Home media===
Warner Home Video has released all 15 seasons in Region 1, Region 2, and Region 4.

In the United Kingdom (Region 2), The Complete Series boxset was released on October 26, 2009. On September 12, 2016, the series was re-released in three box sets, Seasons 1–5, Seasons 6–10, and Seasons 11–15.

The DVD box sets of &quot;ER&quot; are unusual in the fact that they are all in anamorphic widescreen even though the first six seasons of the show were broadcast in a standard 4:3 format. &quot;ER&quot; was shot protecting for widescreen presentation, allowing the show to be presented in 16:9 open matte (leaving only the title sequence in the 4:3 format). However, as the production of the show was generally conceived with 4:3 presentation in mind, some episodes feature vignetting or unintended objects towards the sides of the frame that would not be visible when presented in the 4:3 format. These episodes also appear in the widescreen format when rerun on TNT HD, Pop and streaming services.

In 2018, Hulu struck a deal with Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution to stream all 15 seasons of the show. The show arrived on Max in January 2022.

===Soundtrack===
In 1996, Atlantic Records released an album of music from the first two seasons, featuring James Newton Howard&#x27;s theme from the series in its on-air and full versions, selections from the weekly scores composed by Martin Davich (Howard scored the two-hour pilot, Davich scored all the subsequent episodes and wrote a new theme used from 2006–2009 until the final episode, when Howard&#x27;s original theme returned) and songs used on the series.

==Reboot==
Original cast member Noah Wyle revealed that in 2020 there were talks to revive the show.

That August, the Crichton estate brought a lawsuit against Warner Bros., Wells, and Wyle, alleging that &quot;The Pitt&quot; was in fact an unauthorized remake of &quot;ER&quot; which could not be produced without the estate&#x27;s approval; Warner Bros. has denied the allegation, calling &quot;The Pitt&quot; &quot;a new and original show.&quot;

<doc id="177157" wikidata="Q1751732" url="?curid=177157" title="New National Party (South Africa)">
<text>The New National Party (NNP) was a South African political party formed in 1997 as the successor to the National Party, which ruled the country from 1948 to 1994. The name change was an attempt to distance itself from its apartheid past, and reinvent itself as a moderate, mainstream conservative and non-racist federal party. The attempt was largely unsuccessful, and in 2005 the New National Party voted to disband itself.

== Foundation and political platform ==
The NP entered the democratic era led by former president of South Africa F. W. de Klerk, the winner with Nelson Mandela of the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in dismantling apartheid. He was succeeded by Marthinus van Schalkwyk until the eventual disbanding and merger of the party with the African National Congress (ANC). Van Schalkwyk renamed the party towards the end of 1997. In February 1996, the party had announced that it would become a nonracial, Christian-Democratic political organization, and Van Schalkwyk sought to build on this in his efforts to rebrand the NNP as a nonracial, value driven party.

But the New National Party had some difficulty carving out a political base in post-apartheid South Africa. On the one hand, it still had the legacy of its role under apartheid. On the other hand, it seemed uncertain about its relationship with the government led by the ANC and seemed unable to decide whether it was in a political alliance with the ANC or in opposition. These two issues led to defections to the Democratic Party (DP), which had a historical legacy of being anti-apartheid and was clearly an opposition party to the ANC. It also lost support to other parties.

== Election results and alliances ==
The NNP fared poorly in the general election of 1999. With 6.87% of the vote, the party lost votes both to the DP and ANC as well as its status as the official opposition nationally and in most provinces. But it remained influential in the Western Cape province, where it was the party of government, despite being pushed into second place there by the ANC. The party faced comparatively smaller losses in the province in large part due to the retention of most of its coloured support, but it also fared better with white voters than in most other provinces. 50% of its voter base now came from this one province, and despite retaining representation in all nine provincial legislatures, it was seemingly becoming a regional political force.

The party remained in power in the Western Cape through a coalition with the Democratic Party. The two then began to plan a merger in 2000, under the name Democratic Alliance (DA). By 2001 the party had broken away from the DA before the merger could be completed, and instead entered close co-operation with the ANC. In December 2001, the NNP formed a new provincial coalition with the ANC in the Western Cape, and members of the NNP were appointed to the national cabinet.

During the general election of 2004, the NNP was almost eliminated from parliament. Much of its support deserted the party, due to unhappiness with its alliance with the ANC, and its share of the national vote dropped from 6.87% in 1999 to 1.65%, having been 20.4% under the National Party name in 1994. The party was all but wiped out in most provinces and retained only limited pockets of large support in the Western Cape, where it was pushed into a distant third place behind the DA in its former stronghold.

==Dissolution and merger with the ANC==

With the former governing party now only the sixth-largest in the country, questions were asked about its long-term future, and the leadership of Van Schalkwyk. Despite his party&#x27;s poor performance in the polls, Van Schalkwyk was given the cabinet post of Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, seen as a reward for aligning the NNP with the ANC.

At its assembly on 9 April 2005, the NNP&#x27;s Federal Council voted by 88 to 2 to disband. It also settled its outstanding debt of R5.2 million to the Absa Group Limited, in preparation for dissolution.

With effect 5 August 2005, all NNP members of parliament became members of the ANC, in accordance with the system of crossing the floor in South Africa, which allowed politicians, elected on one party ticket, to defect to other parties or becoming independents. This system was repealed in 2009.

<doc id="177158" wikidata="Q831240" url="?curid=177158" title="Free Zone (Scientology)">
<text>Free Zone, Freezone, and Independent Scientology are umbrella terms for the groups, organizations, and individuals who practice Scientology beliefs and practices independently of the Church of Scientology (COS). Such practitioners range from those who closely adhere to the original teachings of Scientology&#x27;s founder L. Ron Hubbard, to those who have adapted practices far from COS beliefs and practices.

The International Freezone Association, the group whose name became adopted as a generic term for independent Scientology, was not the first independent Scientologist group; the California Association of Dianetic Auditors, the oldest breakaway group still in existence, claims a founding date of December 1950, predating the Church of Scientology itself.

&quot;Skeptic Magazine&quot; described the Free Zone as: &quot;a group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s ideas independent of the Church of Scientology&quot;. A &quot;Miami Herald&quot; article wrote that ex-Scientologists joined the Free Zone because they felt that Church of Scientology leadership had &quot;strayed from Hubbard&#x27;s original teachings&quot;.

== Introduction ==

The term &quot;Free Zone&quot; or &quot;Freezone&quot; is used for the loose grouping of Scientologists who are not members of the Church of Scientology. Often called &quot;freezoners&quot;, some prefer to describe their practices as &quot;Independent Scientology&quot; because of the associations that the term &quot;Free Zone&quot; has with Ron&#x27;s Org;

Key to the Free Zone is what scholar of religion Aled Thomas called its &quot;largely unregulated and non-hierarchical environment&quot;. Within the Free Zone there are many different interpretations of Scientology; Thomas suggested Free Zone Scientologists were divided between &quot;purists&quot; who emphasize loyalty to Hubbard&#x27;s teachings and those more open to innovation. Free Zoners typically stress that Scientology as a religion is different from the Church of Scientology as an organization, criticizing the latter&#x27;s actions rather than their beliefs. They often claim to be the true inheritors of Hubbard&#x27;s teachings, maintaining that Scientology&#x27;s primary focus is on individual development and that that does not require a leader or membership of an organization. Some Free Zoners argue that auditing should be more affordable than it is as performed by the Church, and criticise the Church&#x27;s lavish expenditure on buildings.

The Church has remained hostile to the Free Zone, regarding it as heretical. It refers to non-members who either practice Scientology or simply adopt elements of its technology as &quot;squirrels&quot;, and their activities as &quot;squirreling&quot;. The term &quot;squirrels&quot; was coined by Hubbard and originally referred only to non-Scientologists using its technology. The Church also maintains that any use of its technology by non-Church members is dangerous as they may not be used correctly. Free Zoners have also accused the Church of &quot;squirrelling&quot;, maintaining that it has changed Hubbard&#x27;s words in various posthumous publications. Lewis has suggested that the Free Zone has been fueled by some of the Church&#x27;s policies, including Hubbard&#x27;s tendency to eject senior members who he thought could rival him and the Church&#x27;s &quot;suppressive persons&quot; policy which discouraged rapprochement with ex-members.

After interviewing 16 Free Zoners in Denmark, Elizabeth Tuxen Rubin noted that they had not renounced the belief system of Scientology despite distancing themselves from the Church of Scientology. James R. Lewis suggests that these &quot;sincerely-held beliefs of Free Zone Scientologists [...] offer the best evidence that Scientology is a religion in the legal sense of that contested term&quot;.

== Free Zone groups ==

=== Ron&#x27;s Org ===

Bill Robertson had been a Sea Org member with the Church of Scientology on the flag ship &quot;Apollo&quot;. In the early 1980s, Robertson left the Church and founded Ron&#x27;s Org, a loose federation of Scientology groups operating outside the Church. Headquartered in Switzerland, Ron&#x27;s Org included affiliated centers in Germany, Russia, and other former parts of the Soviet Union. Robertson claimed that he was channeling messages from Hubbard after the latter&#x27;s death, through which he discovered OT levels above the eight being offered by the Church. Although Ron&#x27;s Org founding members were formerly part of the Church, many later Ron&#x27;s Org members never had any prior involvement with the Church.

=== Advanced Ability Center ===
David Mayo founded Advanced Ability Center in the Santa Barbara, California area. Mayo had been the highest-ranking technical officer in Scientology, but was removed in the early 1980s by David Miscavige. Several years of harassment and litigation followed. In 1985, the Church of Scientology succeeded in getting an injunction against Mayo selling Scientology services, and in 1986 the center went bankrupt and closed.

=== Marty Rathbun ===
Marty Rathbun rose in the Church of Scientology to the post of Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center, He defected in 2004 and disappeared for several years before reappearing and offering to provide Scientology auditing services. Reitman called Rathbun&#x27;s activities a &quot;virtual church&quot; because of the sermonizing on his website. He audited people in his home in Texas, and coined the term &quot;Independent Scientology&quot;. But then years of fair game harassment followed. In 2013, Rathbun stated he was &quot;no longer a Scientologist, independent or otherwise&quot;, and Rathbun&#x27;s wife filed a suit against the Church of Scientology in 2013. After winning several legal bouts, the case was dropped in 2016. Rathbun then started to criticize other prominent former Scientologists, including making videos against them which appeared in Church of Scientology advertisements, leading strongly to the conclusion that Rathbun had made some agreement with the Church.

=== Haifa, Israel ===

In 2012, a Scientology center in Haifa, Israel, defected from the Church.

=== Others ===

As well as these organizations, there are also small groups of Scientologists outside the Church who meet informally. Some avoid establishing public centers and communities for fear of legal retribution from the Church. There are also Free Zone practitioners who practice what Thomas calls a &quot;very individualized form of Scientology&quot;, encouraging innovation with Hubbard&#x27;s technology.

==Perception by German government authorities==

Scientology Commissioner Ursula Caberta in Hamburg said that the Free Zone is a type of &quot;methadone program for Scientologists&quot;, and, in any case, &quot;the lesser evil&quot;. According to the Free Zone conglomerate, Ron&#x27;s Org, the Verfassungsschutz Baden-Württemberg (State Office for the Protection of the Constitution) has stated that there is no need to keep Ron&#x27;s Org under observation &quot;as the Ron&#x27;s Org has no anti-constitutional goals&quot;. There is some cooperation between members of the Ron&#x27;s Org and state authorities who observe the Church of Scientology and investigate their activities.

==The Church of Scientology and the Free Zone==

The COS labels all practitioners of and believers in Scientology without its sanction &quot;squirrels&quot;—a term Hubbard coined to describe those who alter Scientology technology or practice it in a nonstandard fashion. Among Scientologists, the term is pejorative, and comparable in meaning to &quot;heretic&quot;. In practice, the hierarchy of the Church of Scientology uses it to describe all of those who practice Scientology outside the Church.

As of 2016, many of the major courses and publications in the Church have been altered or deleted altogether. This is a main protest and action point for Free Zone Scientologists. Major courses, such as the Class VI and Class VIII auditor training courses, which had very high enrollment in the 1970s, have been shut down. Additionally, Scientology critics in the Free Zone movement have claimed that alterations have been made to Hubbard&#x27;s original writings in Church policies and even more so in technical bulletins, with parishioners never made aware of the changes to these writings.

The Church of Scientology has used copyright and trademark laws against various Free Zone groups. Accordingly, most of the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including the word &quot;Scientology&quot;. In 2000, the Religious Technology Center unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Internet domain name scientologie.org in a legal action against the Free Zone.

The &quot;Ron&#x27;s Org Committee&quot; (ROC) and the &quot;True Source Scientology Foundation&quot; (STSS, &quot;Stichting True Source Scientology&quot;) have documented the argument that Scientology materials written by L. Ron Hubbard are in the public domain if certain assumptions are made. In addition the ROC has documented a legal battle over the trademark &quot;Ron&#x27;s Org&quot;.

One Free Zone Scientologist, identified as &quot;Safe&quot;, was quoted in &quot;Salon&quot; as saying: &quot;The Church of Scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it doesn&#x27;t want its members to know that they can get Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology&quot;.

== Portrayal in media ==

A 2006 Channel 4 documentary presented by Sikh comedian Hardeep Singh Kohli, &quot;The Beginner&#x27;s Guide to L. Ron Hubbard&quot;, explored Scientology with the &quot;Ron&#x27;s Org&quot; Free Zone group after the Church of Scientology declined to take part.

A 2017 episode of the docuseries &quot;Believer&quot; hosted by religious scholar Reza Aslan focused on Scientology; however, Aslan was unable to get in contact with any Church of Scientology officials so instead the episode featured an array of independent scientologists. Aslan has compared the Free Zone to other schisms in religious history, such as the Protestant Reformation.

==Alternative auditing practices==

Several alternatives to Dianetics were developed in the early years of the Free Zone.

Synergetics is a self-help system developed by Art Coulter in 1954. American businessman, Don A. Purcell, Jr., joined Synergetics in 1954 after he had financially bailed out Hubbard and his Dianetics foundations and was later sued by Hubbard. In 1976, Coulter published &quot;Synergetics: An Adventure in Human Development&quot;; he later founded the Synergetic Society, which published a journal through 1996.

Idenics is a personal counseling method not affiliated with any religion, that was developed by John Galusha beginning in 1987. Galusha researched for Hubbard during the 1950s, and was one of the founders of the first Church of Scientology in 1953. Galusha claimed that all personal issues can be addressed by thoroughly looking over the problem at hand, without judgment. The counselor asks a series of questions until the solution is considered found, by the client. Mike Goldstein, the owner of Idenics methodology and author of the book, &quot;Idenics: An Alternative to Therapy&quot;, claims that the method is as effective over the telephone as in person.

==The word &quot;Scientology&quot;==

Disagreement over the origins of the word &quot;Scientology&quot; has been used by Free Zone groups to contest Scientology&#x27;s trademarks. A German book entitled &quot;Scientologie, Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens&quot; was published in 1934 by Anastasius Nordenholz. The groups have argued that because &quot;Scientologie&quot; was not written by L. Ron Hubbard, the Church is unfairly monopolizing control over its practice. The trademark rights to the use of Dianetics and the E-meter (invented and created by Volney Mathison) was allowed to lapse into the public domain in 1976 by Hubbard.

<text>The Messerschmitt Me 210 was a German heavy fighter and ground-attack aircraft of World War II. Design started before the war, as a replacement for the Bf 110. The first examples were ready in 1939, but they proved to have unacceptably poor flight characteristics due to serious wing planform and fuselage design flaws. A large-scale operational testing program throughout 1941 and early 1942 did not cure the type&#x27;s problems. The design entered limited service in 1942, but was soon replaced by the Messerschmitt Me 410 Hornisse, a further development of the Me 210. The failure of the Me 210&#x27;s development program meant the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was forced to continue operating the Bf 110 after it had become outdated, despite mounting losses.

==Design and development==
Messerschmitt designers had started working on an upgrade of the Bf 110 in 1937, before the production version of the Bf 110 had even flown. In late 1938, the Bf 110 was just entering service, and the RLM started looking ahead to its eventual replacement. Messerschmitt sent in their modified Bf 110 design as the Me 210, and Arado responded with their all-new Ar 240. 

The Me 210 was a considerable departure from the 110, but used many of the same parts. The main differences were a modified nose area that was much shorter and located over the center of gravity, an internal bomb bay, an all-new wing designed for higher cruise speeds and a highly advanced remote-control defensive armament system that gave the gunner a far wider field of fire. On paper, the Me 210&#x27;s performance was impressive: It could reach 620 km/h (390 mph) on two 1,350 PS (1,330 hp, 990 kW) Daimler-Benz DB 601F engines, making it about 80 km/h (50 mph) faster than the Bf 110, and nearly as fast as single-engine fighters of that era.

The Me 210&#x27;s main landing gear followed some of the design philosophies that had resulted from the main change in the earlier Ju 88&#x27;s main landing gear design, where each main gear had a single gear strut that twisted through 90° during retraction, to bring the main gear wheel resting atop the lower end of the main strut when retracted rearwards into the wing. Unlike the Ju 88, however, the Me 210&#x27;s main gear wheels were inboard of the main gear struts when fully extended, whereas the Ju 88&#x27;s were outboard of the struts.


The Bf 110 carried its ordnance externally beneath the wings and fuselage, but this created drag; the Me 210 avoided this problem by housing the bombs in an enclosed bomb bay, in the nose of the aircraft. The Me 210 could carry up to two 500 kg (1,100 lb) bombs. The Me 210 had dive brakes fitted on the tops of the wings, and a Stuvi 5B bombsight (&quot;Stuvi&quot;-&quot;Sturzkampfvisier&quot;, dive-bombing sight) in the nose, for shallow-angle dive bombing. In the fighter role, the bomb bay was fitted with four 20 mm cannon.
For defence, the Me 210&#x27;s rear gunner was armed with two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns. Each of these was fitted into half-teardrop-shaped &quot;Ferngerichtete Drehringseitenlafette&quot; FDSL 131/1B turrets mounted on each side of the aircraft, and was remote-controlled from the gunner&#x27;s position in the rear of the glazed cockpit area with a unique gun-aiming setup. This unit had a pivoting handgun-style grip, trigger and gunsight at its center, to aim the guns vertically—with both turrets elevating and depressing together when operated - and horizontally, in pivoting each gun separately, outward away from the fuselage side when aimed to one side or the other. The rear of the cockpit canopy&#x27;s lower side glazing panels were bulged out to allow the gunner to see in almost any rearward-facing direction. The guns were electrically fired, and an electrical contact breaker acted as a form of &quot;interrupter&quot; as used on many forms of multi-engined, turret-armed WW II aircraft, preventing the gunner from shooting off the Me 210&#x27;s tailplane.

An order for 1,000 Me 210s was placed before the prototype had flown. In time, this would prove to be a major error. The first prototype flew with DB 601B engines in September 1939, and was considered unsafe by test pilots. Stability was bad in turns, and it tended to oscillate, even while flying level. At first, the designers concentrated on the twin-rudder arrangement that had been taken from the 110, and replaced it with a new and much larger single vertical stabilizer. This had almost no effect, and the plane continued to &quot;snake&quot;. The Me 210 also suffered from terrible stalls. With the nose up or in a turn, the stalls whipped into spins when the automatic leading-edge slats opened. The second prototype, Me 210 V2, was lost this way in September 1940, when the pilot could not get out of the resulting spin and had to abandon the aircraft. The chief test pilot commented that the Me 210 had &quot;all the least desirable attributes an aeroplane could possess.&quot; It took 16 prototypes and 94 preproduction examples to try to resolve the many problems. Nevertheless, the RLM was desperate to replace the Bf 110s currently in service, and ordered full production in early 1941. The type exhibited grossly inadequate handling characteristics, and as a result, several elements of the airframe were redesigned, including lengthening the rear section of the fuselage by 92 cm (36-1/4 inches), designated as &quot;lang&quot; (&quot;long&quot;). The Me 210C was built with DB 605 engines, as well as incorporating the changes to the airframe. The Hungarian authorities were satisfied with the Me 210C in its current state, and purchased a production license for the type, to fill the role of the Varga RMI-1 X/H, designated Me 210Ca (a = &quot;ausländisch&quot; or &#x27;foreign&#x27;) as well as for its DB 605 engines. Several airframes were also purchased, to be completed in Hungarian factories for practice while the assembly lines were set up. Production started in the &quot;Dunai Repülőgépgyár Rt.&quot; (Danubian Aircraft Plant) as the Me 210Ca with the DB 605B engine, under an agreement where the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; received two of every three produced.

The Me 210 was eventually developed into the Messerschmitt Me 410, with DB 603 engines.

==Operational history==

Deliveries to frontline units started in April 1942 and the plane proved to be even less popular with pilots. Production was stopped at the month&#x27;s end by which time only 90 had been delivered. Another 320 partially completed airframes were placed in storage. In its place, the Bf 110 was put back into production. Although the Bf 110 was now equipped with the newer DB 605B engines and greater firepower, it was still an outdated design.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; started receiving their Hungarian-built planes in April 1943, and the Hungarians in 1944; when they entered service they were more than satisfied with them. Production ended in March 1944, when the factory switched over to produce the Bf 109G. By that time, a total of 267 Me 210C had been built, 108 of which had been given to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The Me 210s of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operated mostly in Tunisia and Sardinia and were quickly replaced by the Me 410.

<text>The Golden Hour is a children&#x27;s novel by Maiya Williams. It was first published in 2004 and is the first of the Golden Hour time travel series. It tells the story of Rowan Popplewell and his sister, Nina, who, while emotionally disturbed by the death of their mother, travel back in time to the French Revolution.

==Plot summary==

&quot;The Golden Hour&quot; tells the story of Rowan and Nina&#x27;s adventures the summer after their mother&#x27;s death. Thirteen-year-old Rowan&#x27;s life is at an all-time low: his father has turned to drinking, the family business is becoming a financial disaster, they have had to move from their house to a small apartment, and his musically talented ten-year-old sister Nina has become withdrawn. When his two great aunts invite Rowan and Nina to spend the summer with them in Owatannauk, Maine, a small (fictional) town on the tip of the state, Rowan anticipates a very boring summer with the two elderly women. But when he arrives he finds strange things starting to happen: the aunts run a shop stocking some items so curious they even compel Nina to start speaking again.

Rowan and Nina meet two twins, Xanthe and Xavier Alexander, who tell them about an old abandoned resort that appears to be haunted. Instead, the resort turns out to be an elaborate time machine. Nina seems interested in using the machine to escape her troubled life, especially when Rowan tells her about the Enlightenment, a period of European history when superstition and church dogma began giving way to logic and reason, art and science made tremendous strides, and truth and beauty were celebrated. When Nina disappears the next morning, the older kids rush to the resort: as they suspect, she has used the time machine. But Rowan discovers that he has told his sister the wrong dates for the Enlightenment, and instead of directing her to Enlightenment France he has sent her into the middle of the violent French Revolution. Rowan, Xanthe and Xavier time-travel to the French Revolution to save Nina, meeting various historical characters along the way, and Nina ends up in New York at their bakery visiting their mom.

==Characters==

;Rowan Popplewell: Rowan is a young man dealing with a great amount of stress. Because of his mother&#x27;s death he has had to move with his father and sister to a small apartment where he has no room of his own. Before his mother died Rowan had many friends and a decent social life, but he now loses himself in video games to forget his problems. He describes himself as having a chest like a barrel, and being the kind of boy girls do not notice.

;Nina Popplewell: Nina is Rowan&#x27;s younger sister and, according to Rowan, &quot;was a firecracker, always jumping with ideas.&quot; She has wild, uncontrollable black hair which tumbles over her shoulders and face. Nina is also a musical prodigy, able since the age of three to play tunes she had heard from the radio on the piano. After her mother&#x27;s death, Nina &quot;shut down&quot;. She stopped speaking and became dormant to the point of Rowan claiming that &quot;I have no sister&quot;. It is also indicated from the text that she is highly intelligent.

;Xanthe Alexander: Xanthe is described as having many shoulder-length braids and almond-shaped eyes. It is indicated that she is highly attractive. She is intrigued by native cultures, living close to the land, but also things that are mystical, symbolic and mysterious. She is homeschooled, because she and her brother are too intellectually gifted to be accommodated with the public school system. She is described as highly logical.

;Xavier Alexander: Xavier is also described as attractive, and is a born liar. He remakes himself to suit whatever purpose is at hand, he loves to embellish the truth and he has an ego the size of a barn. Xavier also seeks freedom, independence and adventure, themes resonant with the spirit of the Gold Rush. He, like his sister, is homeschooled due to his advanced intelligence. He and Xanthe are fraternal twins, and he is the comedian of the two.

;Agatha Drake: Agatha is a very short and plump woman who Rowan thinks resembles a pumpkin. She has light brown hair that is always messy, likes to dress in bright colors, and it is implied that she can read minds. Agatha lives with her friend Gertrude Pembroke in Owatannauk, Maine, where she uses The Owatannauk&#x27;s alleviators (time machines) to travel through time collecting various items for her and Gertrude&#x27;s curio shop. It is noted in the book that she enjoys word games like Scrabble. She is a nun.

;Gertrude Pembroke: Gertrude is a tall and gaunt woman with a deep, melodic voice. She lives with her friend Agatha Drake in Owatannauk, Maine. She is not as outgoing as her friend Agatha Drake, and often described as humorless. She dresses in more somber colors than Agatha does. It is noted that she enjoys the game of chess.

; Otto: Otto is the robot from the Owatannauk&#x27;s alleviators (time machines)

<text>An emergency department (ED), also known as an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E), emergency room (ER), emergency ward (EW) or casualty department, is a medical treatment facility specializing in emergency medicine, the acute care of patients who present without prior appointment; either by their own means or by that of an ambulance. The emergency department is usually found in a hospital or other primary care center.

Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the department must provide initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. In some countries, emergency departments have become important entry points for those without other means of access to medical care.

The emergency departments of most hospitals operate 24 hours a day, although staffing levels may be varied in an attempt to reflect patient volume.

==History==
Accident services were provided by workmen&#x27;s compensation plans, railway companies, and municipalities in Europe and the United States by the late mid-nineteenth century, but the world&#x27;s first specialized trauma care center was opened in 1911 in the United States at the University of Louisville Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. It was further developed in the 1930s by surgeon Arnold Griswold, who also equipped police and fire vehicles with medical supplies and trained officers to give emergency care while en route to the hospital.

Today, a typical hospital has its emergency department in its own section of the ground floor of the grounds, with its own dedicated entrance. As patients can arrive at any time and with any complaint, a key part of the operation of an emergency department is the prioritization of cases based on clinical need. This process is called triage.

Triage is normally the first stage the patient passes through, and consists of a brief assessment, including a set of vital signs, and the assignment of a &quot;chief complaint&quot; (e.g. chest pain, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, etc.). Most emergency departments have a dedicated area for this process to take place and may have staff dedicated to performing nothing but a triage role. In most departments, this role is fulfilled by a triage nurse, although dependent on training levels in the country and area, other health care professionals may perform the triage sorting, including paramedics and physicians. Triage is typically conducted face-to-face when the patient presents, or a form of triage may be conducted via radio with an ambulance crew; in this method, the paramedics will call the hospital&#x27;s triage center with a short update about an incoming patient, who will then be triaged to the appropriate level of care.

Most patients will be initially assessed at triage and then passed to another area of the department, or another area of the hospital, with their waiting time determined by their clinical need. However, some patients may complete their treatment at the triage stage, for instance, if the condition is very minor and can be treated quickly, if only advice is required, or if the emergency department is not a suitable point of care for the patient. Conversely, patients with evidently serious conditions, such as cardiac arrest, will bypass triage altogether and move straight to the appropriate part of the department.

The resuscitation area, commonly referred to as &quot;Trauma&quot; or &quot;Resus&quot;, is a key area in most departments. The most seriously ill or injured patients will be dealt with in this area, as it contains the equipment and staff required for dealing with immediately life-threatening illnesses and injuries. In such situations, the time in which the patient is treated is crucial. Typical resuscitation staffing involves at least one attending physician, and at least one and usually two nurses with trauma and Advanced Cardiac Life Support training. These personnel may be assigned to the resuscitation area for the entirety of the shift or may be &quot;on call&quot; for resuscitation coverage (i.e. if a critical case presents via walk-in triage or ambulance, the team will be paged to the resuscitation area to deal with the case immediately). Resuscitation cases may also be attended by residents, radiographers, ambulance personnel, respiratory therapists, hospital pharmacists and students of any of these professions depending upon the skill mix needed for any given case and whether or not the hospital provides teaching services.

Patients who exhibit signs of being seriously ill but are not in immediate danger of life or limb will be triaged to &quot;acute care&quot; or &quot;majors&quot;, where they will be seen by a physician and receive a more thorough assessment and treatment. Examples of &quot;majors&quot; include chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain and neurological complaints. Advanced diagnostic testing may be conducted at this stage, including laboratory testing of blood and/or urine, ultrasonography, CT or MRI scanning. Medications appropriate to manage the patient&#x27;s condition will also be given. Depending on underlying causes of the patient&#x27;s chief complaint, he or she may be discharged home from this area or admitted to the hospital for further treatment.

Patients whose condition is not immediately life-threatening will be sent to an area suitable to deal with them, and these areas might typically be termed as a &quot;prompt care&quot; or &quot;minors&quot; area. Such patients may still have been found to have significant problems, including fractures, dislocations, and lacerations requiring suturing.

Children can present particular challenges in treatment. Some departments have dedicated pediatrics areas, and some departments employ a play therapist whose job is to put children at ease to reduce the anxiety caused by visiting the emergency department, as well as provide distraction therapy for simple procedures.

Many hospitals have a separate area for evaluation of psychiatric problems. These are often staffed by psychiatrists and mental health nurses and social workers. There is typically at least one room for people who are actively a risk to themselves or others (e.g. suicidal).

Fast decisions on life-and-death cases are critical in hospital emergency departments. As a result, doctors face great pressures to overtest and overtreat. The fear of missing something often leads to extra blood tests and imaging scans for what may be harmless chest pains, run-of-the-mill head bumps, and non-threatening stomach aches, with a high cost on the health care system.

==Nomenclature in English==
&quot;Emergency department&quot; became commonly used when emergency medicine was recognized as a medical specialty, and hospitals and medical centres developed departments of emergency medicine to provide services. Other common variations include &#x27;emergency ward&#x27;, &#x27;emergency centre&#x27; or &#x27;emergency unit&#x27;.

&quot;Accident and emergency (A&amp;E)&quot; is deprecated in the United Kingdom but still in common parlance. It is also still in use in Hong Kong. Earlier terms such as &#x27;casualty&#x27; or &#x27;casualty department&#x27; were previously used officially and continue to be used informally. The same applies to &#x27;emergency room&#x27;, &#x27;emerg&#x27;, or &#x27;ER&#x27; in North America, originating when emergency facilities were provided in a single room of the hospital by the department of surgery.

==Signage==
Regardless of naming convention, there is a widespread usage of directional signage in white text on a red background across the world, which indicates the location of the emergency department, or a hospital with such facilities.

Signs on emergency departments may contain additional information. In some American states, there is close regulation of the design and content of such signs. For example, California requires wording such as &quot;Comprehensive Emergency Medical Service&quot; and &quot;Physician On Duty&quot;, to prevent persons in need of critical care from presenting to facilities that are not fully equipped and staffed.

In some countries, including the United States and Canada, a smaller facility that may provide assistance in medical emergencies is known as a clinic. Larger communities often have walk-in clinics where people with medical problems that would not be considered serious enough to warrant an emergency department visit can be seen. These clinics often do not operate on a 24-hour basis. Very large clinics may operate as &quot;free-standing emergency centres&quot;, which are open 24 hours and can manage a very large number of conditions. However, if a patient presents to a free-standing clinic with a condition requiring hospital admission, he or she must be transferred to an actual hospital, as these facilities do not have the capability to provide inpatient care.
==United States==
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) classified emergency departments into two types: Type A, the majority, which are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year; and Type B, the rest, which are not. Many US emergency departments are exceedingly busy. A study found that in 2009, there were an estimated 128,885,040 ED encounters in US hospitals. Approximately one-fifth of ED visits in 2010 were for patients under the age of 18 years. In 2009–2010, a total of 19.6 million emergency department visits in the United States were made by persons aged 65 and over. Most encounters (82.8 percent) resulted in treatment and release; 17.2 percent were admitted to inpatient care.

The 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act is an act of the United States Congress, that requires emergency departments, if the associated hospital receives payments from Medicare, to provide appropriate medical examination and emergency treatment to all individuals seeking treatment for a medical condition, regardless of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. Like an unfunded mandate, there are no reimbursement provisions.

Rates of ED visits rose between 2006 and 2011 for almost every patient characteristic and location. The total rate of ED visits increased 4.5% in that time. However, the rate of visits for patients under one year of age declined 8.3%.

A survey of New York area doctors in February 2007 found that injuries and even deaths have been caused by excessive waits for hospital beds by ED patients. A 2005 patient survey found an average ED wait time from 2.3 hours in Iowa to 5.0 hours in Arizona.

One inspection of Los Angeles area hospitals by Congressional staff found the EDs operating at an average of 116% of capacity (meaning there were more patients than available treatment spaces) with insufficient beds to accommodate victims of a terrorist attack the size of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Three of the five Level I trauma centres were on &quot;diversion&quot;, meaning ambulances with all but the most severely injured patients were being directed elsewhere because the ED could not safely accommodate any more patients. This controversial practice was banned in Massachusetts (except for major incidents, such as a fire in the ED), effective 1 January 2009; in response, hospitals have devoted more staff to the ED at peak times and moved some elective procedures to non-peak times.

In 2009, there were 1,800 EDs in the country. In 2011, about 421 out of every 1,000 people in the United States visited the emergency department; five times as many were discharged as were admitted. Rural areas are the highest rate of ED visits (502 per 1,000 population) and large metro counties had the lowest (319 visits per 1,000 population). By region, the Midwest had the highest rate of ED visits (460 per 1,000 population) and Western States had the lowest (321 visits per 1,000 population).

=== Freestanding ===
In addition to the normal hospital based emergency departments a trend has developed in some states (including Texas and Colorado) of emergency departments not attached to hospitals. These new emergency departments are referred to as free standing emergency departments. The rationale for these operations is the ability to operate outside of hospital policies that may lead to increased wait times and reduced patient satisfaction.

These departments have attracted controversy due to consumer confusion around their prices and insurance coverage. In 2017, the largest operator, Adeptus Health, declared bankruptcy.

=== Overuse and utilization management ===
Patients may visit the emergency room for non-emergencies, which typically costs the patient and the managed care insurance company more, and therefore the insurance company may apply utilization management to deny coverage. In 2004, a study found that emergency room visits were the most common reason for appealing disputes over coverage after receiving service. In 2017, Anthem expanded this denial coverage more broadly, provoking public policy reactions.

==United Kingdom==


All accident and emergency (A&amp;E) departments throughout the United Kingdom are financed and managed publicly by the National Health Service (NHS of each constituent country: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). The term &quot;A&amp;E&quot; is widely recognised and used rather than the full name; it is used on road signs, official documentation, etc.

A&amp;E services are provided to all, without charge. Other NHS medical care, including hospital treatment following an emergency, is free of charge only to all who are &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; in Britain; residency rather than citizenship is the criterion (details on charges vary from country to country).

In England departments are divided into three categories:
* Type 1 department – major A&amp;E, providing a consultant-led 24 hour service with full resuscitation facilities
* Type 2 department – single specialty A&amp;E service (e.g. ophthalmology, dentistry)
* Type 3 department – other A&amp;E/minor injury unit/walk-in centre, treating minor injuries and illnesses

Historically, waits for assessment in A&amp;E were very long in some areas of the UK. In October 2002, the Department of Health introduced a four-hour target in emergency departments that required departments in England to assess and treat patients within four hours of arrival, with referral and assessment by other departments if deemed necessary. It was expected that the patients would have physically left the department within the four hours. Present policy is that 95% of all patient cases do not &quot;breach&quot; this four-hour wait. The busiest departments in the UK outside London include University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, The North Wales Regional Hospital in Wrexham, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth.

In July 2014, the QualityWatch research programme published in-depth analysis which tracked 41 million A&amp;E attendances from 2010 to 2013. This showed that the number of patients in a department at any one time was closely linked to waiting times, and that crowding in A&amp;E had increased as a result of a growing and ageing population, compounded by the freezing or reduction of A&amp;E capacity. Between 2010/11 and 2012/13 crowding increased by 8%, despite a rise of just 3% in A&amp;E visits, and this trend looks set to continue. Other influential factors identified by the report included temperature (with both hotter and colder weather pushing up A&amp;E visits), staffing and inpatient bed numbers.

A&amp;E services in the UK are often the focus of a great deal of media and political interest, and data on A&amp;E performance is published weekly. However, this is only one part of a complex urgent and emergency care system. Reducing A&amp;E waiting times therefore requires a comprehensive, coordinated strategy across a range of related services.

Many A&amp;E departments are crowded and confusing. Many of those attending are understandably anxious, and some are mentally ill, and especially at night are under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Pearson Lloyd&#x27;s redesign – &#x27;A Better A&amp;E&#x27; – is claimed to have reduced aggression against hospital staff in the departments by 50 per cent. A system of environmental signage provides location-specific information for patients. Screens provide live information about how many cases are being handled and the current status of the A&amp;E department. Waiting times for patients to be seen at A&amp;E were rising in the years leading up to 2020, and were hugely worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020.

In response to the year-on-year increasing pressure on A&amp;E units, followed by the unprecedented effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHS in late 2020 proposed a radical change to handling of urgent and emergency care, 
separating &quot;emergency&quot; and &quot;urgent&quot;. Emergencies are . Urgent requirements are for . As part of the response, walk-in Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC) were created. People potentially needing A&amp;E treatment are recommended to phone the NHS111 line, which will either book an arrival time for A&amp;E, or recommend a more appropriate procedure. (Information is for England; details may vary in different countries.)

==Critical conditions handled==

===[Sudden] Cardiac Arrest===
Cardiac arrest is a sudden (in most cases, unexpected) loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness. This emergency usually results from an electrical disturbance in the heart that disrupts its pumping action, stopping blood flow to the rest of the body. It is different from a heart attack, where blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. Cardiac arrest may occur in the ED/A&amp;E or a patient may be transported by ambulance to the emergency department already in this state. Treatment is basic life support, Automated External Defibrillator (AED), and advanced life support as taught in advanced life support and advanced cardiac life support courses. Cardiac arrest is not a condition that can be self-diagnosed. It requires immediate medical attention and diagnosis by a healthcare professional.

===Heart Attack===
Patients arriving at the emergency department with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) are likely to be triaged to the resuscitation area. They will receive oxygen and monitoring and have an early ECG; aspirin will be given if not contraindicated or not already administered by the ambulance team; morphine or diamorphine will be given for pain; sub lingual (under the tongue) or buccal (between cheek and upper gum) glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin) (GTN or NTG) will be given, unless contraindicated by the presence of other drugs.

An ECG that reveals ST segment elevation suggests complete blockage of one of the main coronary arteries. These patients require immediate reperfusion (re-opening) of the occluded vessel. This can be achieved in two ways: thrombolysis (clot-busting medication) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Both of these are effective in reducing significantly the mortality of myocardial infarction. Many centers are now moving to the use of PTCA as it is somewhat more effective than thrombolysis if it can be administered early. This may involve transfer to a nearby facility with facilities for angioplasty.

===Trauma===
Major trauma, the term for patients with multiple injuries, often from a motor vehicle crash or a major fall, is initially handled in the Emergency Department. However, trauma is a separate (surgical) specialty from emergency medicine (which is itself a medical specialty, and has certifications in the United States from the American Board of Emergency Medicine).

Trauma is treated by a trauma team who have been trained using the principles taught in the internationally recognized Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course of the American College of Surgeons. Some other international training bodies have started to run similar courses based on the same principles.

The services that are provided in an emergency department can range from x-rays and the setting of broken bones to those of a full-scale trauma centre. A patient&#x27;s chance of survival is greatly improved if the patient receives definitive treatment (i.e. surgery or reperfusion) within one hour of an accident (such as a car accident) or onset of acute illness (such as a heart attack). This critical time frame is commonly known as the &quot;golden hour&quot;.

Some emergency departments in smaller hospitals are located near a helipad which is used by helicopters to transport a patient to a trauma centre. This inter-hospital transfer is often done when a patient requires advanced medical care unavailable at the local facility. In such cases the emergency department can only stabilize the patient for transport.

===Mental Illness(es)===
Some patients arrive at an emergency department for a complaint of mental illness. In many jurisdictions (including many U.S. states), patients who appear to be mentally ill and to present a danger to themselves or others may be brought against their will to an emergency department by law enforcement officers for psychiatric examination. The emergency department conducts medical clearance rather than treats acute behavioral disorders. From the emergency department, patients with significant mental illness will be transferred to a psychiatric unit (in many cases involuntarily). In recent years, EmPATH units have been developed to relieve pressure on hospital emergency departments and improve the treatment of psychiatric emergencies.

Emergency departments are often the first point of contact with healthcare for people who self-harm. As such they are crucial in supporting them and can play a role in preventing suicide. At the same time, according to a study conducted in England, people who self-harm often experience that they do not receive meaningful care at the emergency department. Higher ambient temperature may also increase mental illness related emergency department presentations, particularly in females.

===Asthma and COPD===
Acute exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, mainly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are assessed as emergencies and treated with oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, steroids or theophylline, have an urgent chest X-ray and arterial blood gases and are referred for intensive care if necessary. Noninvasive ventilation in the ED has reduced the requirement for tracheal intubation in many cases of severe exacerbations of COPD.

==Special facilities, training, and equipment==

An ED requires different equipment and different approaches than most other hospital divisions. Patients frequently arrive with unstable conditions, and so must be treated quickly. They may be unconscious, and information such as their medical history, allergies, and blood type may be unavailable. ED staff are trained to work quickly and effectively even with minimal information.

ED staff must also interact efficiently with pre-hospital care providers such as EMTs, paramedics, and others who are occasionally based in an ED. The pre-hospital providers may use equipment unfamiliar to the average physician, but ED physicians must be expert in using (and safely removing) specialized equipment, since devices such as military anti-shock trousers (&quot;MAST&quot;) and traction splints require special procedures. Among other reasons, given that they must be able to handle specialized equipment, physicians can now specialize in emergency medicine, and EDs employ many such specialists.

ED staff have much in common with ambulance and fire crews, combat medics, search and rescue teams, and disaster response teams. Often, joint training and practice drills are organized to improve the coordination of this complex response system. Busy EDs exchange a great deal of equipment with ambulance crews, and both must provide for replacing, returning, or reimbursing for costly items.

Cardiac arrest and major trauma are relatively common in EDs, so defibrillators, automatic ventilation and CPR machines, and bleeding control dressings are used heavily. Survival in such cases is greatly enhanced by shortening the wait for key interventions, and in recent years some of this specialized equipment has spread to pre-hospital settings. The best-known example is defibrillators, which spread first to ambulances, then in an automatic version to police cars and fire apparatus, and most recently to public spaces such as airports, office buildings, hotels, and even shopping malls.

Because time is such an essential factor in emergency treatment, EDs typically have their own diagnostic equipment to avoid waiting for equipment installed elsewhere in the hospital. Nearly all have radiographic examination rooms staffed by dedicated radiographers, and many now have full radiology facilities including CT scanners and ultrasonography equipment. Laboratory services may be handled on a priority basis by the hospital lab, or the ED may have its own &quot;STAT Lab&quot; for basic labs (blood counts, blood typing, toxicology screens, etc.) that must be returned very rapidly.

==Non-emergency use==
Metrics applicable to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied, and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups, and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.

In all primary care trusts there are out of hours medical consultations provided by general practitioners or nurse practitioners.

In the United States, barriers to accessing care contribute to frequent emergency room use. The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey looked at the ten most common symptoms for which giving rise to emergency room visits (cough, sore throat, back pain, fever, headache, abdominal pain, chest pain, other pain, shortness of breath, vomiting) and made suggestions as to which would be the most cost-effective choice among virtual care, retail clinic, urgent care, or emergency room. Notably, certain complaints may also be addressed by a telephone call to a person&#x27;s primary care provider. However, subsequent studies have shown that identifying non-emergency visits based on discharge diagnoses is inaccurate because people commonly present for emergency care for other reasons and are assigned a diagnosis after testing and evaluation.

In the United States, and many other countries, hospitals are beginning to create areas in their emergency rooms for people with minor injuries. These are commonly referred as &quot;Fast Track&quot; or &quot;Minor Care&quot; units. These units are for people with non-life-threatening injuries. The use of these units within a department have been shown to significantly improve the flow of patients through a department and to reduce waiting times. Urgent care clinics are another alternative, where patients can go to receive immediate care for non-life-threatening conditions. To reduce the strain on limited ED resources, American Medical Response created a checklist that allows EMTs to identify intoxicated individuals who can be safely sent to detoxification facilities instead.

==Overcrowding==
Emergency department overcrowding is when function of a department is hindered by an inability to treat all patients in an adequate manner. This is a common occurrence in emergency departments worldwide. Overcrowding causes inadequate patient care which leads to poorer patient outcomes. To address this problem, escalation policies are used by emergency departments when responding to an increase in demand (e.g., a sudden inflow of patients) or a reduction in capacity (e.g., a lack of beds to admit patients). The policies aim to maintain the ability to deliver patient care, without compromising safety, by modifying &quot;normal&quot; processes.

In recent years, there has been a rise in ER overcrowding that often leads to patients being treated in unsafe conditions. ER overcrowding is a risk for patient care, rising health care costs, and several hour long waits for hospital beds that don&#x27;t exist.

===Emergency department waiting times===
Emergency department (ED) waiting times have a serious impact on patient mortality, morbidity with readmission in less than 30 days, length of stay, and patient satisfaction. The probability of death increases each 3 minutes for 1% in case of major injuries in the abdomen part. (Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery) Equipment in emergency departments follows the prompt treatment principle with the least possible patient transfers from admittance to X-ray diagnostics. A review of the literature bears out the logical premise that since the outcome of treatment for all diseases and injuries is time-sensitive, the sooner treatment is rendered, the better the outcome. Various studies reported significant associations between waiting times and higher mortality and morbidity among those who survived. It is clear from the literature that untimely hospital deaths and morbidity can be reduced by reductions in ED waiting times.

===Exit block===
A significant proportion of emergency patients are discharged after treatment, but many require admission for ongoing observation, treatment, or to ensure adequate social care before discharge. If patients requiring admission cannot be placed in inpatient beds swiftly, &quot;exit block&quot; or &quot;access block&quot; occurs. This often leads to crowding and can lead to delays in treatment for newly presenting cases (&quot;arrival access block&quot;). This is more common in densely populated areas and affects adult departments more than pediatric ones. Exit block can lead to delays for the patients awaiting inpatient beds (&quot;boarding&quot;) and also for new patients arriving at an exit-blocked department. Proposed solutions include changes in staffing or increasing inpatient capacity.

===Frequent users===
Frequent emergency service users are individuals who present themselves at a hospital much more often than non-frequent presenters. Many frequent users are homeless individuals seeking shelter and food at the hospital. Federal laws and regulations in the United States, like EMTALA and HIPAA, limit the options of hospital personnel when an individual presents to the ER with a fabricated problem. These individuals do not account for a significant number of visits but typically require a disproportionate amount of hospital resources. To help prevent inappropriate emergency department use and return visits some hospitals offer care coordination and support services such as at-home and in-shelter transitional primary care for frequent users and short-term housing for homeless patients recovering after discharge.

===Telemedicine===
A study found that telemedicine services in Saudi Arabia were effective in reducing emergency department overload by providing medical advice to patients with less urgent medical issues.

==In the military==
Emergency departments in the military benefit from the added support of enlisted personnel who are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks they have been trained for through specialized military schooling. For example, in United States Military Hospitals, Air Force Aerospace Medical Technicians and Navy Hospital Corpsmen perform tasks that fall under the scope of practice of both doctors (i.e. sutures, staples and incision and drainages) and nurses (i.e. medication administration, foley catheter insertion, and obtaining intravenous access) and also perform splinting of injured extremities, nasogastric tube insertion, intubation, wound cauterizing, eye irrigation, and much more. Often, some civilian education and/or certification will be required such as an EMT certification, in case of the need to provide care outside the base where the member is stationed. The presence of highly trained enlisted personnel in an Emergency Departments drastically reduces the workload on nurses and doctors.

==Violence against healthcare workers==
According to a survey at an urban inner-city tertiary care center in Vancouver, 57% of health care workers were physically assaulted in 1996. 73% were afraid of patients as a result of violence, 49% hid their identities from patients, and 74% had reduced job satisfaction. Over one-quarter of the respondents took days off because of violence. Of respondents no longer working in the emergency department, 67% reported that they had left the job at least partly owing to violence. Twenty-four-hour security and a workshop on violence prevention strategies were felt to be the most useful potential interventions. Physical exercise, sleep and the company of family and friends were the most frequent coping strategies cited by those surveyed.

==Medication errors==
Medication errors are issues that lead to incorrect medication distribution or potential for patient harm. As of 2014, around 3% of all hospital-related adverse effects were due to medication errors in the emergency department (ED); between 4% and 14% of medications given to patients in the ED were incorrect and children were particularly at risk.

Errors can arise if the doctor prescribes the wrong medication, if the prescription intended by the doctor is not the one actually communicated to the pharmacy due to an illegibly written prescription or misheard verbal order, if the pharmacy dispenses the wrong medication, or if the medication is then given to the wrong person.

The ED is a riskier environment than other areas of the hospital due to medical practitioners not knowing the patient as well as they know longer term hospital patients, due to time pressure caused by overcrowding, and due to the emergency-driven nature of the medicine that is practiced there.

<doc id="177164" wikidata="Q1234718" url="?curid=177164" title="Romsey">
<text>Romsey ( ) is a town in the Test Valley district of Hampshire, England. The town is situated northwest of Southampton, southwest of Winchester and southeast of Salisbury. It sits on the outskirts of the New Forest, just over northeast of its eastern edge. The population of Romsey was 14,768 at the 2011 census.

Romsey is one of the principal towns in the Test Valley Borough and lies on the River Test, which is known for fly fishing, predominantly trout. In 2019, the town centre underwent substantial remodelling, removing the roundabout around the statue of Lord Palmerston, and creating a pedestrianised area.

Romsey was home to the 17th-century philosopher and economist William Petty and the 19th-century British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, whose statue has stood in the town centre since 1857. The town was also home to the 20th-century naval officer and statesman Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, who lived at Broadlands. Romsey Abbey, the largest parish church in Hampshire, dominates the centre of the town. Other notable buildings include a 13th-century hunting lodge, an 18th-century coaching inn and the 19th-century corn exchange.

==History==
===Middle Ages to the Civil War===
Romsey&#x27;s name is believed to originate from the Old English &quot;Rūm&#x27;s eg&quot;, meaning &quot;Rūm&#x27;s island&quot;. &quot;Rūm&quot; is probably an abbreviation of a personal name like Rūmwald (meaning &quot;glorious leader&quot;), and &quot;eg&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;&quot;island&quot;) may have denoted a monastic retreat in the Early Middle Ages, since it is common among religious place names.

The first church in Romsey was founded by Edward the Elder in 907 AD for his daughter, Ælflæd, a nun who became the first abbess of Romsey. Edgar the Peaceful re-founded the abbey under the Rule of Benedict in 967 AD, appointing as abbess a noblewoman named Merewenna in 974 AD. Merewenna was given charge of Edgar&#x27;s stepdaughter, Æthelflæd, who later served as abbess herself. Both Merewenna and Æthelflæd are revered as saints.

The surrounding village prospered alongside the religious community. In 1003 the Danes sacked Romsey and destroyed the Anglo-Saxon church in retaliation for the St Brice&#x27;s Day Massacre. While there is no record of the abbey&#x27;s restoration, it is written that in 1012 Emma of Normandy gave lands to the abbey and that there were a total of 54 nuns in Romsey during the reign of Cnut the Great.

The Domesday Book of 1086 refers to a population of 127 households in Romsey, along with the earliest records of the watermills that would later establish it as an industrial town. Relative to other Domesday settlements, Romsey had a large population and paid a considerable amount of tax.

Along with Wilton Abbey nearby, Romsey Abbey became known as a place of learning in the High Middle Ages. In 1086, Matilda of Scotland was sent there to be educated by her aunt, Cristina, who was then the abbess. A number of hopeful suitors visited the princess in Romsey, including the later king William Rufus, whose advances were hindered by her aunt. William was killed in 1100 while hunting in the New Forest, after which his body was carried through Bell Street in Romsey on its way to Winchester Cathedral.

The existing abbey was built in the Norman style between 1120 and 1140 using Chilmark stone. It was likely designed by Henry of Blois, the brother of King Stephen and builder of the Hospital of St Cross in Winchester. The final three arches were added between 1230 and 1240, at which time more than 100 nuns belonged to the foundation. The north transept of the original Saxon church is still visible today.

Henry I granted Romsey its first charter, allowing it to hold a full market each Sunday and a four-day fair at the Feast of St Æthelflæd the Virgin. This was confirmed by Henry II in 1268 and extended to the Feast of St Philip and St James by Henry III in 1272. Given these charters, it can be assumed that Romsey was flourishing in the 13th century, perhaps supported by a lucrative woollen industry whereby wool was woven and then fulled or pounded before being dyed and exported from nearby Southampton. It is suggested that towns like Romsey and New Alresford prospered as a result of their location, which allowed them to exploit the downland sheep economy while retaining access to a major port to the south.

Romsey continued to grow and prosper until the Black Death struck the town in 1348–9, killing up to half its population of roughly 1,000 individuals. It is recorded that 90 nuns voted in the 1333 abbatial election but never more than 25 in elections held from 1350 onwards. Plague arrived again in 1526, with Henry VIII abandoning his plans to spend the eve of the Assumption in Romsey and instead heading to Winchester. Prosperity never returned to the abbey.

Romsey Abbey was finally suppressed by Henry VIII upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539, during which time many religious buildings were destroyed. The abbey itself was saved from demolition, ostensibly due to a section dedicated to St Lawrence that was used as the parish church. In 1544, the townspeople were allowed to purchase the abbey from the Crown for a sum of £100. The section that saved it was subsequently demolished, however, with the remainder being used as the parish church that exists today.

By the mid-16th century Romsey&#x27;s population was about 1,500, its woollen and tanning industries having fuelled growth. After his visit to Broadlands in 1607, James I granted the town a charter and made it a borough. This gave official status to an informal local government that had been running the town&#x27;s affairs since the Dissolution in 1539. Romsey could now have a corporation comprising a mayor, six aldermen, twelve chief burgesses and a town clerk. There was also to be a local law court under a Court Recorder assisted by two sergeants-at-mace and, over all, a High Steward, the first of whom was the Earl of Southampton.

Romsey changed hands several times during the English Civil War, with both Royalist and Parliamentary troops occupying and plundering the town. Most significant were the events of 1643 in which William Waller, having captured Winchester, marched southwest to Romsey where his soldiers defaced the abbey and destroyed its organ. A skirmish on Middle Bridge, downstream of Sadler&#x27;s Mill, may have preceded these events.

===18th to 20th centuries===
The town&#x27;s woollen industry struggled through the 18th century, with competition from the North effectively halving the wages of woollen workers in the southern and eastern parts of the country by the 1770s. As the townspeople looked for more stable work in burgeoning industries like brewing, papermaking and sackmaking, Romsey continued to grow as a modern market town. In 1794 a canal was dug from Redbridge to Andover, passing through Romsey and thus improving its access to nearby trade centres. The town&#x27;s population was 4,274 in the first census of 1801.

Lord Palmerston, the 19th-century British prime minister, lived at Broadlands in his autumn years. In the 1850s he delivered a number of political and religious lectures about the town, including one to the Labourers&#x27; Encouragement Society in 1859. Though he had hoped to be buried at Romsey Abbey, he was in 1865 given a state funeral and subsequently buried at Westminster Abbey. His statue, sculpted by Matthew Noble, has stood in Market Place since 1868. 

Despite the arrival of the railway in 1847, the town&#x27;s expansion slowed in the mid-19th century. Whilst its population had grown to 5,654 in 1851, it stagnated in subsequent decades and—by the time of the 1901 census—the population was just 5,597. The town also enjoyed a significant trade in corn: the Corn Exchange, which is a Grade II* listed building, was completed in 1864.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, Romsey became known for making Berthon Boats, a type of collapsible lifeboat invented by Edward Lyon Berthon in 1851. In 1873, having been the vicar of Romsey Abbey since 1860, Berthon erected a shed outside the nearby vicarage to meet the increasing demand for collapsible boats in the 1870s. In 1877 he appointed his son as manager and moved the enterprise to Lortemore Place. The boatyard continued to make boats until 1917, when it became Berthon Boat Co. and relocated to Lymington. The abbey installed a window commemorating Berthon in 1902.

With Romsey&#x27;s expansion as a brewing town in the mid-19th century, it became known for its extraordinary number of pubs and, more generally, its fashionable drinking culture. By 1911 it boasted more than 80 public houses, twice the national average and effectively one pub for every 151.5 residents. Based on the old Hampshire saying &quot;so drunk he must have been to Romsey&quot;, a book of the same name was published in 1974 as a comprehensive guide to the town&#x27;s drinking establishments. 
The Willis Fleming family of North Stoneham Park were major landowners at Romsey from the 17th until early 20th centuries, and were lords of the manors of Romsey Infra and Romsey Extra.

Broadlands later became the home of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, known locally as &#x27;Lord Louis&#x27;. In 1947 he was given his earldom and the lesser title of Baron Romsey, of Romsey in the County of Southampton. Mountbatten was buried in Romsey Abbey after being killed in an IRA bomb explosion in Ireland on 27 August 1979. After his death his titles passed to his elder daughter, Lady Brabourne, who thus became Countess Mountbatten of Burma. Her eldest son was styled by the courtesy title &#x27;Lord Romsey&#x27; until he inherited the title of Lord Brabourne in 2005, and then the earldom in 2017.

Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was Mountbatten&#x27;s nephew and, when he married Elizabeth II on 20 November 1947, the pair departed London by train and spent their honeymoon at Broadlands. They attended the service at Romsey Abbey the following Sunday. Like his parents, Charles, Prince of Wales and his first wife Diana, Princess of Wales spent the first part of their own honeymoon at Broadlands in 1981. In 2011, William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge broke tradition by spending their first night as a married couple at Buckingham Palace.

In 2007 Romsey celebrated the 400th anniversary of James I&#x27;s charter with a programme of events hosted from March through to September, including a visit on 8 June from Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. The cost of the visit created some local controversy, with particular attention being paid to the £5,000 spent on a new toilet for Her Majesty&#x27;s use, though in the event she did not make use of it.

===Present===
The town centre has had a large Waitrose supermarket since 1969, along with an independent department store named Bradbeers and a range of other independent shops and high street chains. Romsey was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &#x27;resoundingly, timelessly English&#x27; in 2014, with the newspaper remarking on the town&#x27;s representation of bourgeois provincial life. It is popular among retirees.

Three industrial and trading estates focus mainly on service industries and small-scale manufacturing. Three scientific and high technology employers—Roke Manor Research, Southampton Science Park and IBM—have establishments nearby.

==Governance==

Romsey is part of the Romsey and Southampton North parliamentary constituency. Its current MP is Caroline Nokes of the Conservative Party. Elected in the general election on 6 May 2010, after boundary changes, she defeated the Liberal Democrat MP Sandra Gidley with a 4.5% swing to Conservative from Liberal Democrat and a majority of 4,156 votes. Gidley had held the seat since a by-election in 2000 in the former Romsey seat.

The town is part of the Test Valley district council which is controlled by the Conservative Party. Norton Knatchbull, 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma, grandson of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, is the current High Steward, a position which dates from the 17th century (see above).

Romsey Town Council holds its meetings and has its offices at Romsey Town Hall.

==Places of interest==
===Romsey Abbey===

Romsey Abbey is a 12th-century abbey built in the Norman style, probably by Henry of Blois, upon an earlier Saxon church dating back to the 10th century. Elements of the old Saxon church remain, including an exposed north transept and a 10th-century rood. The current abbey is the largest parish church in Hampshire and is generally regarded as cathedral-like by architects and observers. It is open daily to visitors.

=== Broadlands ===

Broadlands is an 18th-century country house located just outside the town centre. It was designed in the Palladian style by the famous architect Capability Brown before being completed by Henry Holland in 1788. It has had a number of illustrious occupants, including Lord Palmerston and Louis Mountbatten. Broadlands has been the setting of two royal honeymoons, namely those of Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1947 and then Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1981. The house itself is a Grade I listed building and the surrounding gardens are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Both are open to visitors on weekday afternoons in summer.

===King John&#x27;s House===

King John&#x27;s House is a 13th-century building that allegedly served as a hunting lodge for King John when he hunted in the nearby New Forest. This is unlikely, however, since it was built in 1256 and therefore 40 years after the king&#x27;s death, though there is evidence that the beams were reused from an earlier structure. The original building and adjoining Tudor cottage have a number of unusual historical features, including 14th-century wall decorations and graffiti, a floor made from cattle metapodials, and a traditional monastic garden. Locals claim the house is haunted, with the Hampshire Ghost Society encountering a shrouded figure during their investigations between 2002 and 2008. The house is a Grade I listed building.

In February 2025 the building was damaged by fire.

=== Embley Park ===

Embley Park, a country estate located on the outskirts of Romsey, was the home of Florence Nightingale from 1825 to her death in 1910. Known as the founder of modern nursing and for her work in sanitary reform, Nightingale is said to have received her calling from God in 1837 whilst sitting beneath a large cedar tree on the grounds. While a manor in Embley belonged to Romsey Abbey as early as the 10th century, the current building is of 18th- and 19th-century origin. The site is now home to Embley, an independent school. It is a Grade II listed building.

===The White Horse Hotel===
The White Horse Hotel is a Grade II listed, 18th-century coaching inn whose timber frames date back to the 1450s. Its medieval stone cellars indicate that the site may have hosted guests to Romsey Abbey as early as the 12th century. The existing assembly rooms are said to be where Lord Palmerston first engaged in political debate in the early 1800s. The building housed a hotel and brasserie, which until 2019, was owned and operated by Silks Hotels.

===Sadler&#x27;s Mill===
The existence of Sadler&#x27;s Mill, the only mill to be developed on the main course of the River Test, is first recorded in the 16th century, when it functioned as a corn and grist mill. It was at one time owned by Lord Palmerston and later the Broadlands estate before passing to various private owners. Milling ceased in 1932 and the building was left derelict for many years until its restoration in 2005. Carbon dating during this restoration placed the earlier structure in the mid-17th century. It is a Grade II listed building.

===The Plaza===
The Plaza, in Winchester Road, is a fully equipped 230-seat art deco style theatre, originally built as a cinema in the 1930s. It became a bingo hall until the 1980s. It was converted in 1984 and is now home to local amateur dramatics group, Romsey Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society (RAODS), who stage between ten and fourteen productions each year and hire the venue out for other local productions, concerts, and functions.

===Memorial Park===
The town&#x27;s memorial park, which plays host to the annual Mayor&#x27;s Picnic, contains a Japanese Type 96 15 cm howitzer, one of two captured by the British and brought back to Romsey by Louis Mountbatten. One was donated to the town and the other retained on the grounds of his country estate, Broadlands.

===Romsey signal box===
Built in 1865, the signal box controlled the freight and passenger trains running on the railway lines passing through Romsey until 1982. Rescued from demolition by Romsey and District Buildings Preservation Trust, it is now a working museum.

==Events==

The Mayor&#x27;s Picnic takes place in early-mid summer and is held in Romsey&#x27;s Memorial Park. There is music performed by local schools, a variety of stalls, and the popular Duck Race, in which numbered plastic ducks &#x27;race&#x27; each other along the river Test, to be scrupulously retrieved before awarding a prize to whoever chose the winning duck.

The Beggars Fair is held in the streets and pubs of Romsey on the second Saturday in July. It is a free festival featuring all types of music, together with dance and other street entertainment.

Romsey Carnival takes place during a week in July with the highlight being the procession through the streets of Romsey on the final Sunday afternoon.

The Romsey Agricultural &amp; Horse Show is a large agricultural show that takes place on the second Saturday of September every year at Broadlands. The show is one of the oldest in England, held annually since 1842. In addition, Broadlands has twice hosted the CLA Game Fair, the largest countryside show in the world, most recently in July 2006.

The Winter Carnival takes places each year when Romsey&#x27;s Christmas lights are switched on.

The Romsey Arts Festival occurs every 3 years, showcasing talent from in and around the local area.

Romsey Beer Festival is organised by the local Round Table, and takes place in October or November each year, at Crosfield Hall.

== Education ==
===Former schools===
In around 1850, Osborne House School, located in Church Street, was established by John Frederick Osborne, who was a councillor as well as headmaster. In 1877, he was mayor of Romsey. It closed for a few years after his death, reopening in 1904 under the same name, owned by William Summers, who was the headmaster. It was a boarding school and offered &quot;Special attention... to backward pupils and to those requiring preparation for business or professional life&quot;, including preparation for entrance to London University (Summers&#x27; alma mater), Oxford, and Cambridge&quot;, as well as other examinations. Summers died during World War II, and it started to be used by the council as an overflow for council schools and as a centre for school dinners at some point. It was demolished in the 1960s and new buildings erected on the site. Osborne House School stood on the site of present-day Abbey Walk. During the 1920s, secondary school boys continued to wear shorts.

Gilbert Percy Whitley, later an ichthyologist and curator of fishes at the Australian Museum in Sydney for about 40 years, attended Osborne House School.

<text>The Malayan Emergency, also known as the Anti–British National Liberation War, was a guerrilla war fought in Malaya between communist pro-independence fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) and the military forces of the Federation of Malaya and Commonwealth (British Empire). The communists fought to win independence for Malaya from the British Empire and to establish a communist state, while the Malayan Federation and Commonwealth forces fought to combat communism and protect British economic and colonial interests. The term &quot;Emergency&quot; was used by the British to characterise the conflict in order to avoid referring to it as a war, because London-based insurers would not pay out in instances of civil wars.

The war began on 17 June 1948, after Britain declared a state of emergency in Malaya following attacks on plantations, which had been revenge attacks for the killing of left-wing activists. Leader of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) Chin Peng and his allies fled into the jungles and formed the MNLA to wage a war for national liberation against British colonial rule. Many MNLA fighters were veterans of the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), a communist guerrilla army previously trained, armed and funded by the British to fight against Japan during World War II. The communists gained support from many civilians, mainly those from the Chinese community. The communists&#x27; belief in class consciousness, and both ethnic and gender equality, inspired many women and indigenous people to join both the MNLA and its undercover supply network the Min Yuen. Additionally, hundreds of former Japanese soldiers joined the MNLA. After establishing a series of jungle bases the MNLA began raiding British colonial police and military installations. Mines, plantations, and trains were attacked by the MNLA with the goal of gaining independence for Malaya by bankrupting the British occupation.

The British attempted to starve the MNLA using scorched earth policies through food rationing, killing livestock, and aerial spraying of the herbicide Agent Orange. The British engaged in extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians, in violation of the Geneva Conventions. The most infamous example is the Batang Kali massacre, which the press has referred to as &quot;Britain&#x27;s My Lai&quot;. The Briggs Plan forcibly relocated between 400,000 and 1,000,000 civilians into concentration camps called &quot;new villages&quot;. Many Orang Asli indigenous communities were also targeted for internment because the British believed that they were supporting the communists. The widespread decapitation of people suspected to have been guerrillas led to the 1952 British Malayan headhunting scandal. Similar scandals relating to atrocities committed by British forces included the public display of corpses.

Although the emergency was declared over in 1960, communist leader Chin Peng renewed the insurgency against the Malaysian government in 1968. This second phase of the insurgency lasted until 1989.

==Origins==
===Socioeconomic issues (1941–1948)===
The economic disruption of World War II (WWII) on British Malaya led to widespread unemployment, low wages, and high levels of food price inflation. The weak economy was a factor in the growth of trade union movements and caused a rise in communist party membership, with considerable labour unrest and a large number of strikes occurring between 1946 and 1948. Malayan communists organised a successful 24-hour general strike on 29 January 1946, before organising 300 strikes in 1947.

To combat rising trade union activity the British used police and soldiers as strikebreakers, and employers enacted mass dismissals, forced evictions of striking workers from their homes, legal harassment, and began cutting the wages of their workers. Colonial police responded to rising trade union activity through arrests, deportations, and beating striking workers to death. Responding to the attacks against trade unions, communist militants began assassinating strikebreakers, and attacking anti-union estates. These attacks were used by the colonial occupation as a pretext to conduct mass arrests of left-wing activists. On 12 June the British colonial occupation banned the PMFTU, Malaya&#x27;s largest trade union.

Malaya&#x27;s rubber and tin resources were used by the British to pay war debts to the United States and to recover from the damage of WWII. Malaysian rubber exports to the United States were of greater value than all domestic exports from Britain to America, causing Malaya to be viewed by the British as a vital asset. Britain had prepared for Malaya to become an independent state, but only by handing power to a government which would be subservient to Britain and allow British businesses to keep control of Malaya&#x27;s natural resources.

===Sungai Siput incident (1948)===
The first shots of the Malayan Emergency were fired during the Sungai Siput incident, on June 17, 1948, in the office of the Elphil Estate near the town of Sungai Siput. Three European plantation managers were killed by three young Chinese men suspected to have been communists.

The deaths of these European plantation managers was used by the British colonial occupation to either arrest or kill many of Malaya&#x27;s communist and trade union leaders. These mass arrests and killings saw many left-wing activists going into hiding and fleeing into the Malayan jungles.

=== Origin and formation of the MNLA (1949) ===
Although the Malayan communists had begun preparations for a guerrilla war against the British, the emergency measures and mass arrest of communists and left-wing activists in 1948 took them by surprise. Led by Chin Peng the remaining Malayan communists retreated to rural areas and formed the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) on 1 February 1949.

The MNLA was partly a re-formation of the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), the communist guerrilla force which had been the principal resistance in Malaya against the Japanese occupation during WWII. The British had secretly helped form the MPAJA in 1942 and trained them in the use of explosives, firearms and radios. Chin Peng was a veteran anti-fascist and trade unionist who had played an integral role in the MPAJA&#x27;s resistance. Disbanded in December 1945, the MPAJA officially turned in its weapons to the British Military Administration, although many MPAJA soldiers secretly hid stockpiles of weapons in jungle hideouts. Members who agreed to disband were offered economic incentives. Around 4,000 members rejected these incentives and went underground.

The MNLA began their war for Malayan independence from the British Empire by targeting the colonial resource extraction industries, namely the tin mines and rubber plantations which were the main sources of income for the British occupation of Malaya. The MNLA attacked these industries in the hopes of bankrupting the British and winning independence by making the colonial administration too expensive to maintain.
== Communist guerrilla strategies ==
The Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) employed guerrilla tactics, attacking military and police outposts, sabotaging rubber plantations and tin mines, while also destroying transport and communication infrastructure. Support for the MNLA mainly came from the 3.12 million ethnic Chinese living in Malaya, many of whom were farmers living on the edges of the Malayan jungles and had been politically influenced by both the Chinese Communist Revolution and the resistance against Japan during WWII. Their support allowed the MNLA to supply themselves with food, medicine, information, and provided a source of new recruits. The ethnic Malay population supported them in smaller numbers. The MNLA gained the support of the Chinese because the Chinese were denied the equal right to vote in elections, had no land rights to speak of, and were usually very poor. The MNLA&#x27;s supply organisation was called the Min Yuen (People&#x27;s Movement). It had a network of contacts within the general population. Besides supplying material, especially food, it was also important to the MNLA as a source of intelligence. The MNLA and their supporters refer to the conflict as the Anti-British National Liberation War.

The MNLA&#x27;s camps and hideouts were in the inaccessible tropical jungle and had limited infrastructure. Almost 90% of MNLA guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, though there were some Malays, Indonesians and Indians among its members. The MNLA was organised into regiments, although these had no fixed establishments and each included all communist forces operating in a particular region. The regiments had political sections, commissars, instructors and secret service. In the camps, the soldiers attended lectures on Marxism–Leninism, and produced political newsletters to be distributed to civilians.

In the early stages of the conflict, the guerrillas envisaged establishing control in &quot;liberated areas&quot; from which the government forces had been driven, but did not succeed in this.

== British and Commonwealth strategies ==
During the first two years of the Emergency, British forces conducted a &#x27;counter-terror,&#x27; characterised by high levels of state coercion against civilian populations; including sweeps, cordons, large-scale deportation, and capital charges against suspected guerrillas. Police corruption and the British military&#x27;s widespread destruction of farmland and burning of homes belonging to villagers rumoured to be helping communists, led to a sharp increase in civilians joining the MNLA and communist movement. However, these tactics also prevented the communists from establishing liberated areas (the MCPs first, and foremost objective), successfully broke up larger guerrilla formations, and shifted the MNLA&#x27;s plan of securing territory, to one of widespread sabotage.

Commonwealth forces struggled to fight guerrillas who moved freely in the jungle and enjoyed support from rural Chinese populations. British planters and miners, who bore the brunt of the communist attacks, began to talk about government incompetence and being betrayed by Whitehall.

The initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets, such as mines and plantation estates. In April 1950, General Sir Harold Briggs, most famous for implementing the Briggs Plan, was appointed to Malaya. The central tenet of the Briggs Plan was to segregate MNLA guerrillas from their supporters among the population. A major component of the Briggs Plan involved targeting the MNLA&#x27;s food supplies, which were supplied from three main sources: food grown by the MNLA in the jungle, food supplied by the Orang Asli aboriginal people living in the deep jungle, and MNLA supporters within the &#x27;squatter&#x27; communities on the jungle fringes.

The Briggs Plan also included the forced relocation of some 500,000 rural Malayans, including 400,000 Chinese civilians, into internment camps called &quot;new villages&quot;. These internment camps were surrounded by barbed wire, police posts, and floodlit areas, all designed to stop the inmates from contacting and supplying MNLA guerrillas in the jungles, segregating the communists from their civilian supporters.

In 1948 the British had 13 infantry battalions in Malaya, including seven partly formed Gurkha battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment and a Royal Artillery Regiment being used as infantry.

The Permanent Secretary of Defence for Malaya, Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson, had served in the Chindits in Burma during World War II. Thompson&#x27;s in-depth experience of jungle warfare proved invaluable during this period as he was able to build effective civil-military relations and was one of the chief architects of the counter-insurgency plan in Malaya.

In 1951 the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Sir Henry Gurney, was killed near Fraser&#x27;s Hill during an MNLA ambush. General Gerald Templer was chosen to become the new High Commissioner in January 1952. During Templer&#x27;s two-year command, &quot;two-thirds of the guerrillas were wiped out and lost over half their strength, the incident rate fell from 500 to less than 100 per month and the civilian and security force casualties from 200 to less than 40.&quot; Orthodox historiography suggests that Templer changed the situation in the Emergency and his actions and policies were a major part of British success during his period in command. Revisionist historians have challenged this view and frequently support the ideas of Victor Purcell, a Sinologist who as early as 1954 claimed that Templer merely continued policies begun by his predecessors.

===Control of anti-guerrilla operations===
At all levels of the Malayan government (national, state, and district levels), the military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military, police and civilian administration officials. This allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated and also allowed all anti-guerrilla measures to be co-ordinated.

Each of the Malay states had a State War Executive Committee which included the State Chief Minister as chairman, the Chief Police Officer, the senior military commander, state home guard officer, state financial officer, state information officer, executive secretary, and up to six selected community leaders. The Police, Military, and Home Guard representatives and the Secretary formed the operations sub-committee responsible for the day-to-day direction of emergency operations. The operations subcommittees as a whole made joint decisions.

==== Agent Orange ====
During the Malayan Emergency, Britain became the first nation in history to make use of herbicides and defoliants as a military weapon. It was used to destroy bushes, food crops, and trees to deprive the guerrillas of both food and cover, playing a role in Britain&#x27;s food denial campaign during the early 1950s. A variety of herbicides were used to clear lines of communication and destroy food crops as part of this strategy. One of the herbicides, was a 50:50 mixture of butyl esters of 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D with the brand name Trioxone. This mixture was virtually identical to the later Agent Orange, though Trioxone likely had a heavier contamination of the health-damaging dioxin impurity.

In 1952 Trioxone and mixtures of the aforementioned herbicides, were sprayed along a number of key roads. From June to October 1952, of roadside vegetation at possible ambush points were sprayed with defoliant, described as a policy of &quot;national importance&quot;. The experts advised that the use of herbicides and defoliants for clearing the roadside could be effectively replaced by removing vegetation by hand and the spraying was stopped. However, after that strategy failed, the use of herbicides and defoliants in effort to fight the guerrillas was restarted under the command of Gerald Templer in February 1953 as a means of destroying food crops grown by communist forces in jungle clearings. Helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft despatched sodium trichloroacetate and Trioxone, along with pellets of chlorophenyl N,N-dimethyl-1-naphthylamine onto crops such as sweet potatoes and maize. Many Commonwealth personnel who handled and/or used Trioxone during the conflict suffered from serious exposure to dioxin and Trioxone. An estimated 10,000 civilians and guerrilla in Malaya also suffered from the effects of the defoliant, but many historians think that the number is much larger since Trioxone was used on a large scale in the Malayan conflict and, unlike the US, the British government limited information about its use to avoid negative global public opinion. The prolonged absence of vegetation caused by defoliation also resulted in major soil erosion.

Following the end of the Emergency, US Secretary of State Dean Rusk advised US President John F. Kennedy that the precedent of using herbicide in warfare had been established by the British through their use of aircraft to spray herbicide and thus destroy enemy crops and thin the thick jungle of northern Malaya.

===Nature of warfare===

The British Army soon realised that clumsy sweeps by large formations were unproductive. Instead, platoons or sections carried out patrols and laid ambushes, based on intelligence from various sources, including informers, surrendered MNLA personnel, aerial reconnaissance and so on. An operation named &quot;Nassau&quot;, carried out in the Kuala Langat swamp is described in &quot;The Guerrilla – and how to Fight Him&quot;: MNLA guerrillas had numerous advantages over Commonwealth forces since they lived in closer proximity to villagers, they sometimes had relatives or close friends in the village, and they were not afraid to threaten violence or torture and murder village leaders as an example to the others, which forced them to assist them with food and information. British forces thus faced a dual threat: the MNLA guerrillas and the silent network in villages who supported them. British troops often described the terror of jungle patrols. In addition to watching out for MNLA guerrillas, they had to navigate difficult terrain and avoid dangerous animals and insects. Many patrols would stay in the jungle for days, even weeks, without encountering the MNLA guerrillas. That strategy led to the infamous Batang Kali massacre in which 24 unarmed villagers were executed by British troops.

Royal Air Force activities, grouped under &quot;Operation Firedog&quot; included ground attacks in support of troops and the transport of supplies. The RAF used a wide mixture of aircraft to attack MNLA positions: from the new Avro Lincoln heavy bomber to Short Sunderland flying boats. Jets were used in the conflict when de Havilland Vampires replaced Spitfires of No. 60 Squadron RAF in 1950 and were used for ground attack. Jet bombers came with the English Electric Canberra in 1955. The Casualty Evacuation Flight was formed in early 1953 to bring the wounded out of the jungles; it used early helicopters such as the Westland Dragonfly, landing in small clearings The RAF progressed to using Westland Whirlwind helicopters to deploy troops in the jungle.

The MNLA was vastly outnumbered by the British forces and their Commonwealth and colonial allies in terms of regular full-time soldiers. Siding with the British occupation were a maximum of 40,000 British and other Commonwealth troops, 250,000 Home Guard members, and 66,000 police agents. Supporting the communists were 7,000+ communist guerrillas (1951 peak), an estimated 1,000,000 sympathisers, and an unknown number of civilian Min Yuen supporters and Orang Asli sympathisers.

==Commonwealth contribution==
Commonwealth forces from Africa and the Pacific fought on the side of the British backed Federation of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. These forces included troops from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Kenya, Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia.

===Australia and Pacific Commonwealth forces===

Australian ground forces first joined the Malayan Emergency in 1955 with the deployment of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR). The 2 RAR was later replaced by 3 RAR, which in turn was replaced by 1 RAR. The Royal Australian Air Force contributed No. 1 Squadron (Avro Lincoln bombers) and No. 38 Squadron (C-47 transports). In 1955, the RAAF extended Butterworth air base, from which Canberra bombers of No. 2 Squadron (replacing No. 1 Squadron) and CAC Sabres of No. 78 Wing carried out ground attack missions against the guerrillas. The Royal Australian Navy destroyers and joined the force in June 1955. Between 1956 and 1960, the aircraft carriers and and destroyers , , , , , , , and were attached to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve forces for three to nine months at a time. Several of the destroyers fired on communist positions in Johor.
New Zealand&#x27;s first contribution came in 1949, when Douglas C-47 Dakotas of RNZAF No. 41 Squadron were attached to the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Far East Air Force. New Zealand became more directly involved in the conflict in 1955; from May, RNZAF de Havilland Vampires and Venoms began to fly strike missions. In November 1955 133 soldiers of what was to become the Special Air Service of New Zealand arrived from Singapore, for training in-country with the British SAS, beginning operations by April 1956. The Royal New Zealand Air Force continued to carry out strike missions with Venoms of No. 14 Squadron and later No. 75 Squadron English Electric Canberras bombers, as well as supply-dropping operations in support of anti-guerrilla forces, using the Bristol Freighter. A total of 1,300 New Zealanders were stationed in Malaya between 1948 and 1964, and fifteen lost their lives. Approximately 1,600 Fijian troops were involved in the Malayan Emergency from 1952 to 1956. The experience was captured in the documentary, &quot;Back to Batu Pahat&quot;.

===African Commonwealth forces===
Southern Rhodesia and its successor, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, contributed two units to Malaya. Between 1951 and 1953, white Southern Rhodesian volunteers formed &quot;C&quot; Squadron of the Special Air Service. The Rhodesian African Rifles, comprising black soldiers and warrant officers led by white officers, were stationed in Johor between 1956 and 1958. The King&#x27;s African Rifles from Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Kenya were also deployed to Malaya.

=== Iban mercenaries ===
The British Empire hired thousands of mercenaries hailing from the Iban people (a subgroup of the Dayak people) of Borneo to fight against the Malayan National Liberation Army. During their service they were widely praised for their jungle and bushcraft skills. Though their military effectiveness and behaviour during the war has been brought into question.

Their deployment received a large amount of both positive and negative attention in British media. They were also responsible for a number of atrocities, most notably the decapitation and scalping of suspected pro-independence guerrillas. Photographs of this practice were leaked in 1952, sparking the British Malayan headhunting scandal. In 1953 most Ibans in Malaya joined the reformed Sarawak Rangers, transitioning them from mercenaries into regular soldiers.

According to a former member of the Sarawak Rangers, Ibans served with at least 42 separate battalions in the Malayan Emergency belonging to either British or Commonwealth militaries.

Iban mercenaries were first deployed to British Malaya by the British Empire to fight in the Malayan Emergency on the 8 August where they served Ferret Force. Many were motivated to fight with the hope that they could collect the heads and scalps of their enemies.

Their deployment was supported by the British politician Arthur Creech Jones, then serving as the Secretary of State for the Colonies who agreed to deploy Ibans to the Malayan Emergency for three months. Amid rumours that the Iban mercenaries they deployed were practiced headhunters, all Ibans serving with the British were removed from British Malaya and quietly redeployed in 1949 and served for the entirety of the war until its end in 1960.

Some historians have argued that the British military&#x27;s use of Ibans stemmed from stereotypes that &quot;primitive&quot; people enjoyed a closer relationship with nature than Europeans. Others have argued that the British army&#x27;s deployment and treatment of the Ibans during the Malayan Emergency reflected the British military&#x27;s history regarding what they perceived as &#x27;martial races&#x27;.

The deployment of Iban mercenaries recruited to fight in the Malayan Emergency was a widely publicised topic in the British press. Many newspapers articles contained titles referring to the Iban cultural practice of headhunting and contained articles portraying Ibans as violent and primitive while being friendly towards white Europeans. While many newspaper articles incorrectly argued that Ibans deployed to Malaya were no longer headhunters, others put forward arguments that Ibans in Malaya should be allowed to openly decapitate and scalp members of the MNLA.

The Iban mercenaries deployed to Malaya were widely praised for their jungle bushcraft skills, although some British and Commonwealth officers found that Ibans were outperformed in this role by recruits from Africa and certain parts of the Commonwealth. The behaviour of Iban mercenaries serving in Malaya was also the subject of criticism, as some Iban recruits were found to have looted corpses and others had threatened their commanding officers with weapons. Due to fears of racial tensions with ethnic Malays the Iban mercenaries that Britain deployed to Malaya were denied access to automatic weapons.

There were also communication difficulties as virtually all the Iban recruits in Malaya were illiterate and most British troops serving alongside them had no prior experience with Asian languages. Some Iban mercenaries refused to go on patrol after receving bad omens in their dreams. Iban society had no social classes making it difficult for them to adhere to military ranks. Some Royal Marines complained that their Iban allies were inaccurate with firearm, and Ibans were both the victims and perpetrators of an unusual amount of friendly fire incidents. The first Iban casualty of the war was a man called Jaweng ak Jugah who was shot dead after being mistaken for a &quot;communist terrorist&quot;.

At the beginning of the Malayan Emergency, the Ibans serving the British were classified as civilians and were thus awarded British and Commonwealth medals reserved for civilians. In one example, the Iban mercenary Awang anak Raweng, was awarded the George Cross in 1951 after he allegedly repelled an attack of 50 MNLA guerrillas. Another example is Menggong anak Panggit who was awarded the George Medal in 1953.

In 1953 Ibans in Malaya were given their own regiment, the Sarawak Rangers. Many would go onto fight during the Second Malayan Emergency.

== The October Resolution ==
In 1951 the MNLA implemented the October Resolution. The October Resolution involved a change of tactics by the MNLA by reducing attacks on economic targets and civilian collaborators, redirecting their efforts towards political organisation and subversion, and bolstering the supply network from the Min Yuen as well as jungle farming and was a response to the Briggs Plan.

== Amnesty declaration ==
On 8 September 1955, the Government of the Federation of Malaya issued a declaration of amnesty to the communists. The Government of Singapore issued an identical offer at the same time. Tunku Abdul Rahman, as Chief Minister, offered amnesty but rejected negotiations with the MNLA. The amnesty read that:
* Those of you who come in and surrender will not be prosecuted for any offence connected with the Emergency, which you have committed under Communist direction, either before this date or in ignorance of this declaration.
* You may surrender now and to whom you like including to members of the public.
* There will be no general &quot;ceasefire&quot; but the security forces will be on alert to help those who wish to accept this offer and for this purpose local &quot;ceasefire&quot; will be arranged.
* The Government will conduct investigations on those who surrender. Those who show that they are genuinely intent to be loyal to the Government of Malaya and to give up their Communist activities will be helped to regain their normal position in society and be reunited with their families. As regards the remainder, restrictions will have to be placed on their liberty but if any of them wish to go to China, their request will be given due consideration.

Following this amnesty declaration, an intensive publicity campaign was launched by the government. Alliance ministers in the Federal Government travelled extensively across Malaya exhorting civilians to call upon communist forces to surrender their weapons and accept the amnesty. Despite the campaign, few Communist guerrillas chose to surrender. Some political activists criticised the amnesty for being too restrictive and for being a rewording of earlier well established surrender offers. These critics advocated for direct negotiations with the communist guerrillas of the MNLA and MCP to work on a peace settlement. Leading officials of the Labour Party had, as part of the settlement, not excluded the possibility of recognition of the MCP as a political organisation. Within the Alliance itself, influential elements in both the MCA and UMNO were endeavouring to persuade the Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, to hold negotiations with the MCP.

===Baling Talks and their consequences===
In 1955 Chin Peng indicated that he would be willing to meet with British officials alongside senior Malayan politicians. The result of this was the Baling Talks, a meeting which took place between communist and Commonwealth forces to debate a peace treaty. The Baling Talks took place inside an English School in Baling on 28 December 1955. The MCP and MNLA was represented by Chin Peng, Rashid Maidin, and Chen Tien. The Commonwealth forces were represented by Tunku Abdul Rahman, Tan Cheng-Lock and David Saul Marshall. Despite the meeting being conducted successfully, the British forces were worried that a peace treaty with the MCP would lead to communist activists regaining influence in society. As a result, many of Chin Peng&#x27;s demands were dismissed.

Following the failure of the talks, Tunku Abdul Rahman withdrew the amnesty offers for MNLA members on 8 February 1956, five months after they had been offered, stating he was unwilling to meet the communists again unless they indicated beforehand their intention to make &quot;a complete surrender&quot;.

Following the failure of the Baling Talks, the MCP made various efforts to resume peace negotiations with the Malayan government, all without success. Meanwhile, discussions began in the new Emergency Operations Council to intensify the &quot;People&#x27;s War&quot; against the guerrillas. In July 1957, a few weeks before independence, the MCP made another attempt at peace talks, suggesting the following conditions for a negotiated peace:
* its members should be given privileges enjoyed by citizens
* a guarantee that political as well as armed members of the MCP would not be punished

The failure of the talks affected MCP policy. The strength of the MNLA and &#x27;Min Yuen&#x27; declined to 1830 members in August 1957. Those who remained faced exile, or death in the jungle. However, Tunku Abdul Rahman did not respond to the MCP&#x27;s proposals. Following the declaration of Malaya&#x27;s independence in August 1957, the MNLA lost its rationale as a force of colonial liberation.

The last serious resistance from MNLA guerrillas ended with a surrender in the Telok Anson marsh area in 1958. The remaining MNLA forces fled to the Thai border and further east. On 31 July 1960 the Malayan government declared the state of emergency over, and Chin Peng left south Thailand for Beijing where he was accommodated by the Chinese authorities in the International Liaison Bureau, where many other Southeast Asian Communist Party leaders were housed.

==Casualties==
During the conflict, security forces killed 6,710 MNLA guerrillas and captured 1,287, while 2,702 guerrillas surrendered during the conflict, and approximately 500 more did so at its conclusion. A total of 226 guerrillas were executed. 1,346 Malayan troops and police were killed during the fighting. 1,443 British personnel died, in what remains the largest loss of life among UK armed forces since the Second World War. 2,478 civilians were killed, with another 810 recorded as missing.

==Atrocities==

===Commonwealth===
====Torture====
During the Malayan conflict, there were instances during operations to find MNLA guerrillas where British troops detained and allegedly tortured villagers who were suspected of aiding the MNLA. Socialist historian Brian Lapping said that there was &quot;some vicious conduct by the British forces, who routinely beat up Chinese squatters when they refused, or possibly were unable, to give information&quot; about the MNLA. &quot;The Scotsman&quot; newspaper lauded these tactics as a good practice since &quot;simple-minded peasants are told and come to believe that the communist leaders are invulnerable&quot;. Some civilians and detainees were also allegedly shot, either because they attempted to flee from and potentially aid the MNLA or simply because they refused to give intelligence to British forces.

Widespread use of arbitrary detention, punitive actions against villages, and use of torture by the police, &quot;created animosity&quot; between Chinese squatters and British forces in Malaya which was counterproductive to gathering good intelligence. 

====Batang Kali Massacre====
During the Batang Kali massacre, 24 unarmed civilians were executed by the Scots Guards near a rubber plantation at Sungai Rimoh near Batang Kali in Selangor in December 1948. All the victims were male, ranging in age from young teenage boys to elderly men. Many of the victims&#x27; bodies were found to have been mutilated and their village of Batang Kali was burned to the ground. No weapons were found when the village was searched. The only survivor of the massacre was a man named Chong Hong who was in his 20s at the time. He fainted and was presumed dead. Soon afterwards the British colonial government staged a coverup of British military abuses which served to obfuscate the exact details of the massacre.

The massacre later became the focus of decades of legal battles between the UK government and the families of the civilians executed by British troops. According to Christi Silver, Batang Kali was notable in that it was the only incident of mass killings by Commonwealth forces during the war, which Silver attributes to the unique subculture of the Scots Guards and poor enforcement of discipline by junior officers.

====Internment camps====
As part of the Briggs Plan devised by British General Sir Harold Briggs, 500,000 people (roughly ten percent of Malaya&#x27;s population) were forced from their homes by British forces. Tens of thousands of homes were destroyed, and many people were imprisoned in British internment camps called &quot;new villages&quot;. During the Malayan Emergency, 450 new villages were created. The policy aimed to inflict collective punishment on villages where people were thought to support communism, and also to isolate civilians from guerrilla activity. Many of the forced evictions involved the destruction of existing settlements which went beyond the justification of military necessity. This practice is now prohibited by Article 17 (1) of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, which forbid civilian internment unless rendered absolutely necessary by military operations. 

====Collective punishment====
A key British war measure was inflicting collective punishments on villages whose population were deemed to be aiding MNLA guerrillas. At Tanjong Malim in March 1952, Templer imposed a twenty-two-hour house curfew, banned everyone from leaving the village, closed the schools, stopped bus services, and reduced the rice rations for 20,000 people. The last measure prompted the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to write to the Colonial Office to note that the &quot;chronically undernourished Malayan&quot; might not be able to survive as a result. &quot;This measure is bound to result in an increase, not only of sickness but also of deaths, particularly amongst the mothers and very young children&quot;. Some people were fined for leaving their homes to use external latrines. In another collective punishment, at Sengei Pelek the following month, measures included a house curfew, a reduction of 40 percent in the rice ration and the construction of a chain-link fence 22 yards outside the existing barbed wire fence around the town. Officials explained that the measures were being imposed upon the 4,000 villagers &quot;for their continually supplying food&quot; to the MNLA and &quot;because they did not give information to the authorities&quot;.

====Deportations====
Over the course of the war, some 30,000 mostly ethnic Chinese were deported by the British authorities to mainland China. This would have been a war crime under Article 17 (2) of Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, which states: &quot;Civilians shall not be compelled to leave their own territory for reasons connected with the conflict.&quot;

==== Public display of corpses ====
During the Emergency it was common practice for British forces and their allies to publicly display the corpses of suspected communists and anti-colonial guerrillas. This was often done in the centers of towns and villages. Oftentimes British and Commonwealth troops would round up local children and forced them to look at the corpses, monitoring their emotional reaction for clues on whether they knew the dead. Many of the corpses publicly displayed by British forces belonged to guerrillas who had previously been allies of Britain during WWII.

A notable victim of these public corpse displays was MNLA guerrilla leader Liew Kon Kim, whose corpse was publicly displayed in locations around British Malaya. At least two instances of public corpse displays by British forces in Malaya gained notable media attention in Britain, and were later dubbed &quot;The Telok Anson Tragedy&quot; and &quot;The Kulim Tragedy&quot;.

====Headhunting and scalping====

During the war British and Commonwealth forces hired over 1,000 Iban (Dyak) mercenaries from Borneo to act as jungle trackers. With a tradition of headhunting, they decapitated suspected MNLA members; the authorities held that taking the heads was the only means of later identification. Iban headhunters were permitted by British military leaders to keep the scalps of corpses as trophies. After the headhunting had been exposed to the public, the Foreign Office first tried to deny it was in use, before then trying to justify Iban headhunting and conducting damage control in the press. Privately, the Colonial Office noted that &quot;there is no doubt that under international law a similar case in wartime would be a war crime&quot;. Skull fragments from a trophy head were later found to have been displayed in a British regimental museum.

=====Headhunting exposed to British public=====
In April 1952, the British communist newspaper the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; (later known as the &quot;Morning Star&quot;) published a photograph of British Royal Marines inside a British military base openly posing with severed human heads. By republishing these images the British communists had hoped to turn public opinion against the war. Initially British government spokespersons belonging to the Admiralty and the Colonial Office claimed the photograph was fake. In response to the accusations that their headhunting photograph was fake, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; released another photograph taken in Malaya showing British soldiers posing with a severed head. Later the Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton, confirmed to parliament that the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; headhunting photographs were indeed genuine. In response to the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; articles exposing the decapitation of MNLA suspects, the practice was banned by Winston Churchill who feared that such photographs resulting from headhunting would expose the British for their brutality. However, Churchill&#x27;s order to discontinue the decapitations was widely ignored by Iban trackers who continued to behead suspected guerrillas.

Despite the shocking imagery of the photographs of soldiers posing with severed heads in Malaya, the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; was the only newspaper to publish them and the photographs were virtually ignored by the mainstream British press.

==Comparisons with Vietnam==
This war had similarities with the First Indochina War in Vietnam; both the French and the British returned to establish their colonial rule after Japanese occupation, both granted a high degree of autonomy to their own indigenous states (Vietnam on 8/3/1949 and Malaya on 1/2/1948), both had to fight communist anti-colonial rebellions as part of ideological conflicts, the headquarters of the communists in both Vietnam and Malaysia were in the jungle, both pro-colonial native states were granted full independence within the French Union (4/6/1954) or the British Commonwealth (31/8/1957) at the end of the war, and both Vietnam and Malaysia had to continue to fight the communist side after independence.

===Differences===
This conflict and the Vietnam War (following the First Indochina War) have often been compared. However, the two conflicts differ in the following ways:
* The MNLA never numbered more than about 8,000 full-time insurgents, but the People&#x27;s Army of (North) Vietnam fielded a quarter of a million regular troops, in addition to roughly 100,000 National Liberation Front (or Viet Cong) partisans.
* The Viet Cong were agents of the government of North Vietnam and could count on substantial support from their government; the MNLA had no such domestic state support.
* North Korea, Cuba and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) provided military hardware, logistical support, personnel and training to North Vietnam, whereas the MNLA received no material support, weapons or training from any foreign government.
* North Vietnam&#x27;s shared border with its ally China (PRC) allowed for continuous assistance and provided a safe haven for communist forces, but Malaya&#x27;s only land border is with non-communist Thailand.
* Britain did not approach the Emergency as a conventional conflict and quickly implemented an effective intelligence strategy, led by the Malayan Police Special Branch, and a systematic hearts and minds operation, both of which proved effective against the largely &quot;political&quot; aims of the guerrilla movement.
* The British military recognised that in a low-intensity war, individual soldiers&#x27; skill and endurance were of far greater importance than overwhelming firepower (artillery, air support, etc.). Even though many British soldiers were conscripted National Servicemen, the necessary skills and attitudes were taught at a Jungle Warfare School, which also developed the optimum tactics based on experience gained in the field.
* Vietnam was less ethnically fragmented than Malaya. During the Emergency, most MNLA members were ethnically Chinese and drew support from sections of the Chinese community. However, most of the more numerous indigenous Malays, many of whom were animated by anti-Chinese sentiments, largely remained loyal to the government and enlisted in high numbers into the security services.

===Similarities===
The United States in Vietnam were highly influenced by Britain&#x27;s military strategies during the Malayan Emergency and the two wars shared many similarities. Some examples are listed below.
* Both countries used Agent Orange. Britain pioneered the use of Agent Orange as a weapon of war during the Malayan Emergency. This fact was used by the United States as a justification to use Agent Orange in Vietnam.
* Both the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force used widespread saturation bombing.
* Both countries frequently used internment camps. In Malaya, internment camps called &quot;new villages&quot; were built by the British colonial occupation to imprison approximately 400,000 rural peasants. The United States attempted to replicate the new villages with their Strategic Hamlet Program. However, the Strategic Hamlets were unsuccessful in segregating communist guerrillas from their civilian supporters.
* Both countries made use of incendiary weapons, including flamethrowers and incendiary grenades.
* Both the Malayan and Vietnamese communists recruited women as fighters due to their beliefs in gender equality. Women served as generals in both communist armies, with notable examples being Lee Meng in Malaya and Nguyễn Thị Định in Vietnam.
* Both the Malayan and Vietnamese communists were led by veterans of WWII who had been trained by their future enemies. The British trained and funded the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army whose veterans would go onto resist the British colonial occupation, and the United States trained Vietnamese communists to fight against Japan during WWII.

==Legacy==
The Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation of 1963–1966 arose from tensions between Indonesia and the new British backed Federation of Malaysia that was conceived in the aftermath of the Malayan Emergency.

In the late 1960s, the coverage of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War prompted the initiation of investigations in the UK concerning war crimes perpetrated by British forces during the Emergency, such as the Batang Kali massacre. No charges have yet been brought against the British forces involved and the claims have been repeatedly dismissed by the British government as propaganda, despite evidence suggestive of a cover-up.

Following the end of the Malayan Emergency in 1960, the predominantly ethnic Chinese Malayan National Liberation Army, the armed wing of the MCP, retreated to the Malaysia–Thailand border where it regrouped and retrained for future offensives against the Malaysian government. A new phase of communist insurgency began in 1968. It was triggered when the MCP ambushed security forces in Kroh–Betong, in the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia, on 17 June 1968. The new conflict coincided with renewed tensions between ethnic Malays and Chinese following the 13 May incident of 1969, and the ongoing Vietnam War.

Communist leader Chin Peng spent much of the 1990s and early 2000s working to promote his perspective of the Emergency. In a collaboration with Australian academics, he met with historians and former Commonwealth military personnel at a series of meetings which led to the publication of &quot;Dialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party.&quot; Peng also travelled to England and teamed up with conservative journalist Ian Ward and his wife Norma Miraflor to write his autobiography &quot;Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History&quot;.

Many colonial documents, possibly relating to British atrocities in Malaya, were either destroyed or hidden by the British colonial authorities as a part of Operation Legacy. Traces of these documents were rediscovered during a legal battle in 2011 involving the victims of rape and torture by the British military during the Mau Mau uprising.

== List of battles/incidents during the Malayan Emergency ==

* Assassination of Sir Henry Gurney
* Batang Kali massacre
* Battle of Semur River
* Bukit Kepong incident
* Labis incident
* Operation Termite
* Penang ambush
* Sungai Siput incident

==In popular culture==

In popular Malaysian culture, the Emergency has frequently been portrayed as a primarily Malay struggle against the communists. This perception has been criticised by some, such as Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin, for not recognising Chinese and Indian efforts.

A number of films were set during the Emergency, including:
* &quot;The Planter&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Windom&#x27;s Way&quot; (1957)
* &quot;The 7th Dawn&quot; (1964)
* &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1969)
* &quot;Stand Up, Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Bukit Kepong&quot; (1981)
* &quot;The Garden of Evening Mists&quot; (2019)

* Mona Brand&#x27;s stage production &quot;Strangers in the Land&quot; (1952) was created as political commentary to criticise the occupation, depicting plantation owners as burning down villages and collecting the heads of murdered Malayans as trophies. The play was only performed in the UK at the tiny activist run Unity Theater because the British government had banned the play from commercial stages.
* &quot;The Malayan Trilogy&quot; series of novels (1956–1959) by Anthony Burgess is set during the Malayan Emergency.
* In &quot;The Sweeney&quot; episode &quot;The Bigger They Are&quot; (series 4, episode 8; 26 October 1978), the tycoon Leonard Gold is being blackmailed by Harold Collins, who has a photo of him present at a massacre of civilians in Malaya when he was in the British Army twenty-five years earlier.
* Throughout the series &quot;Porridge&quot;, there are references to Fletcher having served in Malaya, probably as a result of National Service. He regales his fellow inmates with stories of his time there, and in one episode it is revealed that Prison Officer Mackay had also served in Malaya.
