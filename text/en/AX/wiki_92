<text>Gullah (also called Gullah-English, Sea Island Creole English, and Geechee) is a creole language spoken by the Gullah people (also called &quot;Geechees&quot; within the community), an African American population living in coastal regions of South Carolina and Georgia (including urban Charleston and Savannah) as well as extreme northeastern Florida and the extreme southeast of North Carolina.

==Origins==
Gullah is based on different varieties of English and languages of Central Africa and West Africa. Scholars have proposed a number of theories about the origins of Gullah and its development:
# Gullah developed independently on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida throughout the 18th and 19th centuries by enslaved Africans. They developed a language that combined grammatical, phonological, and lexical features of the nonstandard English varieties spoken by that region&#x27;s white slaveholders and farmers, along with those from numerous Western and Central African languages. According to this view, Gullah developed separately or distinctly from African American Vernacular English and varieties of English spoken in the South.
# Some enslaved Africans spoke a Guinea Coast Creole English, also called West African Pidgin English, before they were forcibly relocated to the Americas. Guinea Coast Creole English was one of many languages spoken along the West African coast in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries as a language of trade between Europeans and Africans and among multilingual Africans. It seems to have been prevalent in British coastal slave trading centers such as James Island, Bunce Island, Elmina Castle, Cape Coast Castle and Anomabu. This theory of Gullah&#x27;s origins and development follows the monogenetic theory of creole development and the domestic origin hypothesis of English-based creoles.

==Vocabulary==
The Gullah people have several words of Niger-Congo and Bantu origin in their language that have survived to the present day, despite over four hundred years of slavery when African Americans were forced to speak English.

The vocabulary of Gullah comes primarily from English, but there are numerous Africanisms that exist in their language for which scholars have yet to produce detailed etymologies. Some of the African loanwords include:
 (plural), 
 , 
 , and

The Gullahs&#x27; English-based creole language is strikingly similar to Sierra Leone Krio of West Africa and contains such identical expressions as 
 , 
 , 
 , and
 . Linguists observe that 25% of the Gullah language&#x27;s vocabulary originated from Sierra Leone. 
Songs and fragments of stories were traced to the Mende and Vai people, and simple counting in the Guinea/Sierra Leone dialect of the Fula people was also observed.

==Turner&#x27;s research==
In the 1930s and 1940s, the linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner did a seminal study of the language based on field research in rural communities in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. Turner found that Gullah is strongly influenced by African languages in its phonology, vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and semantics. Turner identified over 300 loanwords from various languages of Africa in Gullah and almost 4,000 African personal names used by Gullah people. He also found Gullahs living in remote seaside settlements who could recite songs and story fragments and do simple counting in the Mende, Vai, and Fulani languages of West Africa.

In 1949, Turner published his findings in a classic work called &quot;Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect&quot; (). The fourth edition of the book was reprinted with a new introduction in 2002.

Before Turner&#x27;s work, mainstream scholars viewed Gullah speech as substandard English, a hodgepodge of mispronounced words and corrupted grammar, which uneducated black people developed in their efforts to copy the speech of their English, Irish, Scottish and French Huguenot slave owners.

Turner&#x27;s study was so well researched and detailed in its evidence of African influences in Gullah that some academics soon changed their minds. But his book primarily &quot;elicited praise but not emulation.&quot; Over time, other scholars began to take interest in the language and culture and start developing further research on Gullah language and culture.

== Phonology ==


==Grammar==

===Morphology===
The following sentences illustrate the basic verb tense and aspect system in Gullah:
: — &quot;I help them/I helped them&quot; (present/past tense)
: — &quot;I helped them&quot; (past tense) [I&#x27;ve been helping them]
: — &quot;I will help them&quot; (future tense) [I&#x27;m going to help them]
: — &quot;I have helped them&quot; (perfect aspect) [I&#x27;ve done helped them]
: — &quot;I am helping them&quot; (present continuous) [I do help them]
: — &quot;I was helping them&quot; (past continuous) [I&#x27;ve been helping them]

===Syntax===
These sentences illustrate 19th-century Gullah speech:
: — &quot;That big dog, it bit him&quot; (topicalization)
: — &quot;It is he (who) cried out that way&quot; (fronting)
: — &quot;I told him, said that dog would bite him&quot; (dependent clauses with &quot;say&quot;)
: — &quot;The dog ran, went, bit him&quot; (serial verb construction)
: — &quot;That is a big, big dog&quot; (reduplication)

==Storytelling==
The Gullah people have a rich storytelling tradition that is strongly influenced by African oral traditions but also by their historical experience in America. Their stories include animal trickster tales about the antics of &quot;Brer Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Brer Fox&quot; and &quot;Brer Bear&quot;, &quot;Brer Wolf&quot;, etc.; human trickster tales about clever and self-assertive slaves; and morality tales designed to impart moral teaching to children.

Several white American writers collected Gullah stories in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. The best collections were made by Charles Colcock Jones Jr. from Georgia and Albert Henry Stoddard from South Carolina. Jones, a Confederate officer during the Civil War, and Stoddard were both whites of the planter class who grew up speaking Gullah with the slaves (and later freedmen) on their families&#x27; plantations. Another collection was made by Abigail Christensen, a Northern woman whose parents came to the Low Country after the Civil War to assist the newly-freed slaves. Ambrose E. Gonzales, another writer of South Carolina planter-class background, also wrote original stories in 19th-century Gullah, based on Gullah literary forms; his works are well remembered in South Carolina today.

The linguistic accuracy of those writings has been questioned because of the authors&#x27; social backgrounds. Nonetheless, those works provide the best available information on Gullah, as it was spoken in its more conservative form in the 19th century.

==Today==
Gullah is spoken by about 5,000 people in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. As of 2021, an estimated 300 people are native speakers. Although some scholars argue that Gullah has changed little since the 19th century and that most speakers have always been bilingual, it is likely that at least some decreolization has taken place. In other words, some African-influenced grammatical structures in Gullah a century ago are less common in the language today. Nonetheless, Gullah is still understood as a creole language and is certainly distinct from Standard American English.

For generations, outsiders stigmatized Gullah-speakers by regarding their language as a mark of ignorance and low social status. As a result, Gullah people developed the habit of speaking their language only within the confines of their own homes and local communities. That causes difficulty in enumerating speakers and assessing decreolization. It was not used in public situations outside the safety of their home areas, and many speakers experienced discrimination even within the Gullah community. Some speculate that the prejudice of outsiders may have helped to maintain the language. Others suggest that a kind of valorization or &quot;covert prestige&quot; remained for many community members and that the complex pride has insulated the language from obliteration.

US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was raised as a Gullah-speaker in coastal Pin Point, Georgia. When asked why he has little to say during hearings of the court, he told a high school student that the ridicule he received for his Gullah speech, as a young man, caused him to develop the habit of listening, rather than speaking, in public. Thomas&#x27;s English-speaking grandfather raised him after the age of six in Savannah.

In recent years educated Gullah people have begun promoting use of Gullah openly as a symbol of cultural pride. In 2005, Gullah community leaders announced the completion of a translation of the New Testament into modern Gullah, a project that took more than 20 years to complete.

In 2017, Harvard University began offering Gullah/Geechee as a language class in its African Language Program. It is taught by Sunn m&#x27;Cheaux, a native speaker from South Carolina.

==Samples==
These sentences are examples of how Gullah was spoken in the 19th century:
This story, called &quot;Brer Lion an Brer Goat&quot;, was first published in 1888 by story collector Charles Colcock Jones Jr.:
This is a literal translation into English following Gullah grammar, including verb tense and aspect, exactly as in the original:
Brer Lion was hunting, and he spied Brer Goat lying down on top of a big rock working his mouth and chewing. He crept up to catch him. When he got close to him, he watched him good. Brer Goat kept on chewing. Brer Lion tried to find out what Brer Goat was eating. He didn&#x27;t see anything near him except the naked rock which he was lying down on. Brer Lion was astonished. He waited for Brer Goat. Brer Goat kept on chewing, and chewing, and chewing. Brer Lion couldn&#x27;t make the thing out, and he came close, and he said: &quot;Hey! Brer Goat, what are you eating?&quot; Brer Goat was scared when Brer Lion rose up before him, but he kept a bold heart, and he made (his) answer: &quot;I am chewing this rock, and if you don&#x27;t leave me (alone), when I am done with it I will eat you&quot;. This big word saved Brer Goat. A bold man gets out of difficulty where a cowardly man loses his life.

===The Bible in Gullah===
This passage is from the New Testament in Gullah:

Therefore when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of king Herod, lo! astronomers, came from the east to Jerusalem, and said, Where is he, that is born [the] king of Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and we have come to worship him. But king Herod heard, and was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And he gathered together all the princes of priests, and scribes of the people, and inquired of them, where Christ should be born. And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by a prophet [...]

==Kumbayah==
The phrase &quot;Kumbaya&quot; (&quot;Come by Here&quot;), taken from the song of the same name, is likely of Gullah origin.

==Related languages==
Gullah resembles other English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the Caribbean Basin, including Krio of Sierra Leone, Bahamian Creole, Jamaican Patois, Bajan Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Tobagonian Creole, Sranan Tongo, Guyanese Creole, and Belizean Creole. Those languages are speculated to use English as a lexifier (most of their vocabularies are derived from English) and that their syntax (sentence structure) is strongly influenced by African languages, but research by Salikoko Mufwene and others suggests that nonstandard Englishes may have also influenced the syntactical features of Gullah (and other creoles).

Gullah is most closely related to Afro-Seminole Creole, which is spoken in scattered Black Seminole communities in Oklahoma, Texas, and Northern Mexico. The Black Seminoles&#x27; ancestors were Gullahs who escaped from slavery in coastal South Carolina and Georgia in the 18th and 19th centuries and fled into the Florida wilderness. They emigrated from Florida after the Second Seminole War (1835–1842). Their modern descendants in the West speak a conservative form of Gullah that resembles the language of 19th-century plantation slaves.

There is debate among linguists on the relationship between Gullah and African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). There are some that postulate a Gullah-like &quot;plantation creole&quot; that was the origin of AAVE. Others cite different British dialects of English as having had more influence on the structure of AAVE.

<doc id="185804" wikidata="Q1114177" url="?curid=185804" title="Origins Game Fair">
<text>Origins Game Fair is an annual gaming convention that was first held in 1975. Since 1996, it has been held in Columbus, Ohio at the Greater Columbus Convention Center. Origins is run by the Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA). Origins was chartered to serve gaming in general, including wargaming and miniatures gaming.

 Origins is the site of the annual Origins Awards ceremony. For many years, the Charles S. Roberts Awards for historical boardgames were presented at Origins, but these are now presented at the World Boardgaming Championships. Board games, trading card games, LARPs and role-playing games are also popular at Origins.

Origins Game Fair was formerly known as the Origins International Game Expo. The name was changed in the summer of 2007.

Origins typically has a theme each year, which affects some of the events and decorations like banners or art, and the Origins mascot will be depicted wearing an outfit related to the theme as well. The theme in 2012 was Time Travel. In 2014 it was Monster. 2014 was also the 40th Origins convention and, keeping with the Monster theme, they introduced the mascot Crit. In 2015 the theme was Space. In 2016 it was Robots. 2017 was Dragons. 2018 was Mystery. 2019 was Mythical. A survey was distributed online to help select the theme for the 2020 show. The options were: Scary Fun, Games Around the World, Adventure, Futuristic, and Top Secret. According to the 2019 Origins Sitebook, the theme for 2020 will be Games Around the World.

==History==

Origins started in 1975 with a gathering of game players in Baltimore, Maryland. The Interest Group Baltimore, a local wargaming club, worked with the Baltimore-based Avalon Hill game company to put on the first show that year at Johns Hopkins University.

Avalon Hill produced the first commercial war games in 1958. In a nod to Baltimore&#x27;s position as the home of Avalon Hill and the birthplace of the commercial wargame hobby, Don Greenwood, a game designer with Avalon Hill and founder of the convention, suggested calling the show &quot;Origins&quot;.
Over the next few years, both Avalon Hill and SPI (another wargame company) ran the show. As the show continued expanding, the Game Manufacturers Association assumed management in 1978. RuneQuest debuted as Chaosium&#x27;s first RPG at the Origins convention in Ann Arbor, Michigan in July 1978.

In each of 1988 and 1992, Origins and Gen Con joined together to hold a single convention in Milwaukee.

In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that Origins would be postponed from its usual mid-June date to October 7–11. In its place, an event called Origins Online was to be held that would allow attendees to &quot;demo and buy games and merchandise&quot; and offer &quot;streaming workshops and educational seminars with guest authors, artists and game designers, plus hundreds of games online that attendees can sign up to participate in.&quot;

In June, due to a lack of response by GAMA concerning Black Lives Matter and the George Floyd Protests, some members of the community who were intending to run or participate in Origins Online events stepped down, and others joined them in solidarity. Such a large number of people withdrew, it is speculated that Origins Online may not have been able to run without them. Regardless of the reason, Origins Online was cancelled completely, and GAMA offered to &quot;match, dollar for dollar, any exhibitor, sponsor, advertiser, or vendor who donates the amounts they are owed for Origins Online to one of&quot; several different black organizations. Soon after, the regular Origins convention was cancelled for 2020 as well, citing fears of a second wave of COVID-19. This would mark 2020 as the first year without an Origins convention since 1975.

&quot;ICv2&quot; reported that Origins had &quot;17,706 attendees&quot; in June 2024 which was &quot;up over 9% from 2023&#x27;s attendance total, which was 16,082 people, but still down around 14% from the last pre-pandemic show in 2019, where Origins drew 20,642 people&quot;. Additionally in 2024, Origins &quot;had 326 exhibitors, up for 2023&#x27;s count of 305&quot; and event totals went &quot;from 6,135 to 6,528, up about 6%&quot;.

===Venues===
===Columbus, Ohio===

Throughout the first twenty years of its life, Origins migrated from city to city, until in 1996, GAMA decided to anchor Origins in a single location. After considering a number of possibilities, GAMA chose Columbus, Ohio.

==Controversies==

Several reports of sexual harassment emerged after 2018 Origins Game Fair in Columbus, Ohio. After multiple first hand accounts were published on social media and Reddit, GAMA, released a public statement regarding the complaints and has since then updated its anti-harassment policies.

<doc id="185807" wikidata="Q102227152" url="?curid=185807" title="Talisman The Adventure">
<text>Talisman The Adventure is a 1986 expansion to the &quot;Talisman&quot; board game, both produced by Games Workshop. &quot;The Adventure&quot;, which requires the original Second Edition board game, is incompatible with and has no counterpart for the Third Edition, and like &quot;Talisman&quot;, is currently out of print.

==Description==
===Contents===
This expansion includes 
* 37 new Adventure cards
* 11 new spells
* 8 new character cards 
** Centaur
** Ninja
** Ork
** Samurai
** Soldier
** Warrior of Chaos
** Witch Doctor
** Woodsman
* 6 Alternate endings (See &quot;Victory conditions&quot;) 
* 6 character record sheets with which to organize character&#x27;s attributes, followers and objects.
* rules sheet

===Victory conditions===
In the original game, the character who reached the Crown of Command first was the winner. In this supplement, when the player reaches the inner sanctum, the player draws an alternate ending card and encounters one of the following: 
* &quot;Demon Lord&quot;: a powerful demonic being with Craft 12 and 4 Lives. If the player defeats the Demon Lord, the player wins the game. Otherwise, play continues.
* &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;: the character draws Adventure and spell cards to be used against his or her foes. Play continues.
* &quot;Hercules&#x27; Belt&quot;: a powerful artifact which gives the character 12 Strength and 5 lives. Play continues.
* &quot;Dragon King&quot;: a randomized finale with many possibilities.
* &quot;The Horrible Black Void&quot;: the character is sucked into the void and dies instantly. (If playing with the &quot;Talisman Timescape&quot; set, the character is transferred there instead.) Play continues.
* &quot;Crown of Command&quot;: as in the original version, the player wins the game.

If drawing one of the above does not result in the end of the game, the card that was drawn is replaced with a new random ending.

==Publication history==
Games Workshop published &quot;Talisman&quot; in 1983, and followed up with several supplements, including &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot;, which was designed by Edward Campbell, Charles Johnson, Alan Merrett, and Aly Morrison, with interior art by Aly Morrison, and cover art by Christos Achilleos.

==Metal miniatures==
The supplement comes with small cards illustrating each character, which are then mounted in plastic bases to provide each player with a character token to move around the board. Games Workshop, through its subsidiary Citadel Miniatures, also offered metal miniatures of the characters for sale.

==Reception==
Robert Neville reviewed &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;This is just the thing for those irritatingly smug people who always win at &quot;Talisman&quot; – just watch their joy turn to misery as their beloved hero disappears down into the darkness. All in all, &quot;Talisman The Adventure&quot; is a fun package, and will do much to refresh the parts of &quot;Talisman&quot; that other expansion sets can&#x27;t reach.&quot;

<doc id="185808" wikidata="Q1931975" url="?curid=185808" title="Midland Main Line">
<text>The Midland Main Line (MML), sometimes also spelt Midland Mainline, is a major railway line from London to Sheffield in Yorkshire via the East Midlands. It comprises the lines from London&#x27;s St Pancras station via , / and .

Express passenger services on the line are operated by East Midlands Railway (EMR). The line is electrified between St Pancras and Wigston, south of Leicester, and the section south of Bedford forms a branch of the northern half of the Thameslink network, with a semi-fast service to Brighton and other suburban services. A northern part of the route, between Derby and Chesterfield, also forms part of the Cross Country Route operated by CrossCountry. Tracks from Nottingham to Leeds via Barnsley and Sheffield are shared with Northern. East Midlands Railway also operates regional and local services using parts of the line.

The Midland Main Line is undergoing a major upgrade of new digital signalling and full line electrification from London to Sheffield. High Speed 2 was planned to branch onto the Midland Main Line at East Midlands Parkway railway station.

==History==
===Midland Counties early developments===
The Midland Main Line was built in stages between the 1830s and the 1870s. The earliest section was opened by the Midland Counties Railway between Nottingham and Derby on 4 June 1839. On 5 May 1840 the section of the route from Trent Junction to Leicester was opened.

The line at Derby was joined on 1 July 1840 by the North Midland Railway to Leeds Hunslet Lane via Chesterfield, Rotherham Masborough, Swinton, and Normanton.

On 10 May 1844 the North Midland Railway, the Midland Counties Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway merged to form the Midland Railway.

===Midland Main Line southern extensions===

Without its own route to London, the Midland Railway relied upon a junction at with the London and Birmingham Railway line for access to the capital at London Euston. By the 1850s, the junction at Rugby had become severely congested. The Midland Railway employed Thomas Brassey to construct a new route from Leicester to via Kettering, Wellingborough, and Bedford giving access to London via the Great Northern Railway from Hitchin. The Crimean War resulted in a shortage of labour and finance, and only £900,000 () was available for the construction, approximately £15,000 for each mile (. To reduce construction costs, the railway followed natural contours, resulting in many curves and gradients. Seven bridges and one tunnel were required, with cuttings at Desborough and Sharnbrook. There are also major summits at Kibworth, Desbrough and at Sharnbrook where a 1 in 119 gradient from the south over takes the line to above sea level. This route opened for coal traffic on 15 April 1857, goods on 4 May, and passengers on 8 May. The section between Leicester and Bedford is still part of the Midland Main Line.

While this took some of the pressure off the route through Rugby, the GNR insisted that passengers for London alight at Hitchin, buying tickets in the short time available, to catch a GNR train to finish their journey. James Allport arranged a seven-year deal with the GN to run into Kings Cross for a guaranteed £20,000 a year (). Through services to London were introduced in February 1858.

This line met with similar capacity problems at Hitchin as the former route via Rugby, so a new line was constructed from Bedford via Luton to which opened on 1 October 1868. The construction of the London extension cost £9 million (equivalent to £ million in ).

As traffic built up, the Midland Railway opened a new deviation just north of Market Harborough railway station on 26 June 1885 to remove the flat crossing of the Rugby and Stamford Railway.

===Northernmost sections===

Plans by the Midland Railway to build a direct line from Derby to Manchester were thwarted in 1863 by the builders of the Buxton line who sought to monopolise on the West Coast Main Line.

In 1870, the Midland Railway opened a new route from Chesterfield to Rotherham which went through Sheffield via the Bradway Tunnel.

The mid-1870s, saw the Midland line extended northwards through the Yorkshire Dales and Eden Valley on what is now called the Settle–Carlisle Railway.

Before the line closures of the Beeching era, the lines to Buxton and via Millers Dale during most years presented an alternate (and competing) main line from London to Manchester, carrying named expresses such as &quot;The Palatine&quot; and the &quot;Blue Pullman&quot; diesel powered Manchester – London service (the &quot;Midland Pullman&quot;). Express trains to Leeds and Scotland such as the &quot;Thames–Clyde Express&quot; mainly used the Midland&#x27;s corollary Erewash Valley line, returned to it, and then used the Settle–Carlisle line. Expresses to Edinburgh Waverley, such as &quot;The Waverley&quot; travelled through Corby and Nottingham.

===Under British Railways and privatisation===

Most Leicester-Nottingham local passenger trains were taken over by diesel units from 14 April 1958, taking about 51 minutes between the two cities.
When the Great Central Main Line closed in 1966, the Midland Main Line became the only direct main-line rail link between London and the East Midlands and parts of South Yorkshire.

The Beeching cuts and electrification of the West Coast Main Line brought an end to the marginally longer London–Manchester service via Sheffield.

In 1977, the Parliamentary Select Committee on Nationalised Industries recommended considering electrification of more of Britain&#x27;s rail network, and by 1979 BR presented a range of options that included electrifying the Midland Main Line from London to Yorkshire by 2000. By 1983, the line had been electrified from Moorgate to Bedford, but proposals to continue electrification to Nottingham and Sheffield were not implemented.

The introduction of the High Speed Train (HST) in May 1983, following the Leicester area resignalling, brought about an increase of the ruling line speed on the fast lines from to .

Between 2001 and 2003, the line between Derby and Sheffield was upgraded from to as part of Operation Princess, the Network Rail funded CrossCountry route upgrade.

In January 2009, a new station, East Midlands Parkway, was opened between Loughborough and Trent Junction, to act as a park-and-ride station for suburban travellers from East Midlands cities and to serve nearby East Midlands Airport.

Since then, running has been introduced on extended stretches. Improved signalling, increased number of tracks, and the revival of proposals to extend electrification from Bedford to Sheffield are underway. Much of this £70 million upgrade, including some line-speed increases, came online on 9 December 2013 (see below).

===Network Rail route strategy for freight 2007===
Network Rail published a Route Utilisation Strategy for freight in 2007; over the coming years a cross-country freight route will be developed enhancing the Birmingham to Peterborough Line, increasing capacity through Leicester, and remodelling Syston and Wigston junctions.

===Network Rail 2010 route plan===
Traffic levels on the Midland Main Line are rising faster than the national average, with continued increases predicted. In 2006, the Strategic Rail Authority produced a Route Utilisation Strategy for the Midland Main Line to propose ways of meeting this demand; Network Rail started a new study in February 2008 and this was published in February 2010.

After electrification, the North Northamptonshire towns (Wellingborough, Kettering, and Corby) are planned to have an additional &#x27;Outer Suburban service&#x27; into London St Pancras, similar to the West Midlands Trains&#x27; Crewe – London Euston services, to cater for the growing commuter market. North Northamptonshire is a major growth area, with over 7,400 new homes planned to be built in Wellingborough and 5,500 new homes planned for Kettering.

Highlights include:
*Work related to line speed increases, removing foot crossings and replacing with footbridges
*Capacity enhancements for freight
*Re-signalling of the entire route, expected to be complete by 2016 when all signalling will be controlled by the East Midlands signalling centre in Derby
*Rebuilding Bedford and Leicester
*Accessibility enhancements at , , , , , and by 2015
*Upgraded approach signalling (flashing yellow aspects) added at key junctions – Radlett, Harpenden, and Leagrave allowing trains to traverse them at higher speeds
*Lengthening of platforms at Wellingborough, Kettering, Market Harborough, Loughborough, Long Eaton, and Beeston stations as well as work related to the Thameslink Programme (see below)
*Realignment of the track and construction of new platforms to increase the permissible speed through Market Harborough station from 60 mph to 85 mph saving 30–60 seconds
*Electrification (see below)
*Re-doubling the Kettering to Oakham Line between Kettering North Junction and Corby as well as re-signalling to Syston Junction via Oakham, allowing a half hourly London to Corby passenger service (from an infrastructure perspective) from December 2017 and creating additional paths for rail freight.

====Thameslink Programme====

The Thameslink Programme has lengthened the platforms at most stations south of Bedford to 12-car capability. St Pancras, Cricklewood, Hendon, and Luton Airport Parkway were already long enough, but bridges at Kentish Town mean it cannot expand beyond the current 8-car platform length. West Hampstead Thameslink has a new footbridge and a new station building. In September 2014 the current Thameslink Great Northern franchise was awarded and trains on this route are currently operated by Thameslink. In 2018 the Thameslink network expanded when some Southern services merged into it.

====Station improvements====
In 2013/14 station was refurbished and the platforms restructured.

As part of Wellingborough&#x27;s Stanton Cross development, station is to be expanded.

 between and was opened on 2 April 2017.

Two new stations are planned: 
* between Cricklewood and Hendon as part of the Brent Cross Cricklewood development in North London. It opened in December 2023. 
* between and as part of the new town just outside Bedford. Expected to be built by 2015, scheduled for 2019, but now expected to be 2024.

Some new stations have been proposed:
*Clay Cross between Chesterfield and Ambergate/Alferton. 
*Irchester () between Wellingborough and Bedford.
*Ampthill between Bedford and Flitwick.

===Extension of electrification===
 
Unlike the West Coast and East Coast Main Lines, the Midland Main Line has not been electrified along its full length. The line was electrified as far as Bedford in the early 1980s, but services relied on diesel traction beyond that.

In 2011 work commenced to extend the electrification, including to both Corby and Nottingham. Increasing costs initially saw this terminated at Kettering in 2017, but in 2021 work began on extending electrification to Market Harborough and onwards to Wigston with plans to extend further to Sheffield.

In May 2022, a briefing to contractors was released ahead of an invitation to tender for Midland Mainline Electrification project work to extend electrification to Nottingham and Sheffield. This scheme is expected to cost £1.3 billion.

===2021 Integrated Rail Plan===

In November 2021 the Government announced its Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands which made a number of proposals for the Midland Main Line. These included a commitment to complete the stalled electrification work, an upgrade to digital signalling, and a connection to High Speed 2. The latter would see a junction built south of East Midlands Parkway station rather than the previous plan of an East Midlands Hub further north on the Toton sidings. This will allow HS2 services to connect to both Derby and Nottingham city centres directly using the MML for access, which was a criticism of the previous HS2 eastern leg proposal.

==Route definition==
The term Midland Main Line has been used from the late 1840s to describe any route of the Midland Railway on which express trains were operated.

It is first recorded in print in 1848 in Bradshaw&#x27;s railway almanack of that year. In 1849 it begins to be mentioned regularly in newspapers such as the &quot;Derby Mercury&quot;.

In 1867, the &quot;Birmingham Journal&quot; uses the term to describe the new railway running into St Pancras railway station.

In 1868, the term was used to describe the Midland Railway main route from North to South through Sheffield and also on routes to Manchester, Leeds and Carlisle.

Under British Rail the term was used to define the route between St Pancras and Sheffield, but since then, Network Rail has restricted it in its description of Route 19 to the lines between St. Pancras and Chesterfield.

== Accidents ==
* 26 September 1860 Bull bridge accident; bridge collapse
* 2 September 1861 Kentish Town rail accident; collision
* 2 September 1898 Wellingborough rail accident; derailment due to post trolley on track
* 24 December 1910 Hawes Junction rail crash; signalman forgot about train
* 2 September 1913 Ais Gill rail accident; collision
* 3 December 1923 Nunnery Colliery
* 13 December 1926 Orgreave Paddy Mail accident

== Operators ==


===East Midlands Railway===
The principal operator is East Midlands Railway, which operates four InterCity trains every hour from London St Pancras with two trains per hour to both Nottingham and . EMR use Meridian trains in various carriage formations for its InterCity services.

EMR also operate a twice hourly commuter service from London St Pancras to Corby, which is branded as EMR Connect, using Class 360 Desiro electric trains.

===Thameslink===
Thameslink provides frequent, 24-hour commuter services south of Bedford as part of its Thameslink route to London Bridge, , , and Sutton, using 8-car and 12-car electric trains.

===Other operators===
CrossCountry runs an hourly service between Derby and Sheffield on its route between the South West and North East, and twice-hourly services between Nottingham and Derby, continuing to Birmingham and Cardiff. Northern runs an hourly service from Leeds to Nottingham via Barnsley and Alfreton. TransPennine Express also operates in the Sheffield area. 

==Route description==
The cities, towns and villages served by the MML are listed below. Stations in bold have a high usage. This table includes the historical extensions to Manchester (where it linked to the West Coast Main Line) and Carlisle (via Leeds where it meets with the &#x27;modern&#x27; East Coast Main Line).

Network Rail groups all lines in the East Midlands and the route north as far as Chesterfield and south to London as route 19. The actual line extends beyond this into routes 10 and 11.

Line-side train monitoring equipment includes hot axle box detectors (HABD) and wheel impact load detectors (WILD) ‘Wheelchex’, these are located as follows.
===Ambergate Junction to Manchester===

&quot;For marketing and franchising, this is no longer considered part of the Midland Main Line&quot;: see Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway

The line was once the Midland Railway&#x27;s route from London St Pancras to Manchester, branching at Ambergate Junction along the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway, now known as the Derwent Valley line.
In days gone by, it featured named expresses such as The Palatine. Much later in the twentieth century, it carried the Midland Pullman.

This line was closed in the 1960s between and , severing an important link between Manchester and the East Midlands, which has never been satisfactorily replaced by any mode of transport. A section of the route remains in the hands of the Peak Rail preservation group, operating between Matlock and Rowsley to the north.

===Leeds to Carlisle===
&quot;For marketing and franchising, this is no longer considered part of the Midland Main Line&quot;: see Settle–Carlisle Railway.


World War I prevented the Midland Railway from finishing its direct route through the West Riding to join the Settle and Carlisle (which would have cut six miles from the journey and avoided the need for reversal at Leeds).

The first part of the Midland&#x27;s West Riding extension from the main line at Royston (Yorks.) to Dewsbury was opened before the war. However, the second part of the extension was not completed. 
This involved a viaduct at Dewsbury over the River Calder, a tunnel under Dewsbury Moor and a new approach railway into Bradford from the south at a lower level than the existing railway (a good part of which was to be in tunnel) leading into Bradford Midland (or Bradford Forster Square) station.

The gap between the stations at Bradford still exists. Closing it today would also need to take into account the different levels between the two Bradford stations, a task made easier in the days of electric rather than steam traction, allowing for steeper gradients than possible at the time of the Midland&#x27;s proposed extension.

Two impressive viaducts remain on the completed part of the line between Royston Junction and Dewsbury as a testament to the Midland&#x27;s ambition to complete a third direct Anglo–Scottish route. The line served two goods stations and provided a route for occasional express passenger trains before its eventual closure in 1968.

The failure to complete this section ended the Midland&#x27;s hopes of being a serious competitor on routes to Scotland and finally put beyond all doubt that Leeds, not Bradford, would be the West Riding&#x27;s principal city. Midland trains to Scotland therefore continued to call at Leeds before travelling along the Aire Valley to the Settle and Carlisle. From Carlisle they then travelled onwards via either the Glasgow and South Western or Waverley Route. In days gone by the line enjoyed named expresses such as the Thames–Clyde Express and The Waverley.

==Former stations==
As with most railway lines in Britain, the route used to serve far more stations than it currently does (and consequently passes close to settlements that it no longer serves). Places that the current main line used to serve include

<text>Undercover journalism is a form of journalism in which a reporter tries to infiltrate in a community by posing as somebody friendly to that community.

==Role==
The role of undercover journalism has become the topic of much debate as moral and ethical lines have been crossed. The nine elements of journalism as outlined in a book by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel are as follows:

# Journalism&#x27;s first obligation is to tell the truth.
# Its first loyalty is to the citizens.
# Its essence is discipline of verification.
# Its practitioners must maintain an independence from those they cover.
# It must serve as an independent monitor of power.
# It must provide a forum for public criticism and compromise.
# It must strive to make the news significant, interesting, and relevant.
# It must keep the news comprehensive and proportional.
# Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience.

As reporters have gone undercover some of these guidelines have been bent and broken in order to uphold others on the list. Undercover reporting has brought to light numerous atrocities throughout history, yet often these reporters sacrifice ethical and moral code in the process.

==Ethics==
While journalism aims to seek and report the truth, the ethics of how the truth is revealed should always be considered. If undercover journalism is an active lie to get the truth, then eventually trust can possibly be broken between reporters and the public. According to the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;Overreliance on sting operations and subterfuge can weaken the public&#x27;s trust in the media and compromise journalists&#x27; claim to be truth-tellers. Undercover reporting can be a powerful tool, but it&#x27;s one to be used cautiously: against only the most important targets, and even then only when accompanied by solid traditional reporting.&quot; Undercover journalism exposes a lot of truths that would otherwise stay under the radar. In the 1990s, ABC &quot;Primetime Live&quot; went undercover to investigate rumors of Food Lion&#x27;s unsanitary practices.
According to the Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics, &quot;[j]ournalists should [...] [a]void undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information unless traditional, open methods will not yield information vital to the public.” Undercover journalism should be used scarcely and if it is used, then it should be done if there are no other options to get the information. It also should be accompanied by useful, interesting, and relevant information for the public.

== Notable undercover journalists==
Journalists who are famous for their undercover reports include:

*Hunter S. Thompson
*Gloria Steinem
*Donal MacIntyre
*Alex Dolan
*Nellie Bly
*Pam Zekman
*Anas Aremeyaw Anas
*Matt Taibbi
*Günter Wallraff
*Ramita Navai
*&quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; correspondents
*Barbara Ehrenreich (&quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot;)
*Carmelo Abbate
*David Daleiden

Gloria Steinem&#x27;s &quot;A Bunny&#x27;s Tale,&quot; which ran in two parts in &quot;Show&quot; magazine in 1963, exposed exploitative working conditions in New York&#x27;s Playboy Club. Steinem applied for a position at the club under an assumed name, got the job, and spent 11 days as a Playboy Bunny. The piece made her a celebrity and is considered a foundational text of second-wave feminism. As Steinem later wrote, &quot;My exposé of working in a Playboy Club has outlived all the Playboy Clubs, both here and abroad.&quot;

James O&#x27;Keefe is an American conservative activist known for producing secretly recorded undercover audio and video encounters with figures and workers in academic, governmental, and social service organizations, in an effort to show abusive or allegedly illegal behavior by employees and/or representatives of those organizations. His ethics have been under scrutiny for manipulating these recordings in order to make subjects appear guilty of some wrongdoing.

Hunter S. Thompson was known for his undercover work reporting on the California-based motorcycle gang, the Hells Angels. His book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot;, profiles the gang as Thompson spent roughly a year embedded among the Angels, during a time when their notoriety was at an all-time high.

Elizabeth Jane Cochran, writing under the pseudonym Nellie Bly, became known for her undercover work for the &quot;New York World&quot;, titled &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot;, when she checked herself into an insane asylum as a patient to report on cruelty and neglect. After ten days she was released and later went on to help a grand jury prosecute the mental ward.

Gunter Wallraff is a German journalist known for his undercover work, &quot;Ganz unten&quot; (&quot;The lowest of the low&quot;), on exposing the oppressive conditions faced by the immigrant workforce in Germany. He sought employment in German factories, pharmaceutical companies, and a wide array of odd jobs for roughly two years before publishing the book.

Anas Aremeyaw Anas is a Ghanaian investigative journalist born in the late 1970s. Anas is famous for utilizing his anonymity as a tool in his investigation arsenal (very few people have seen his face). A multimedia journalist who specializes in print media and documentary, Anas focuses on issues of human rights and anti-corruption in Ghana and sub-Saharan Africa. Anas has won critical acclaim for his work advocating for the right to not be held in human slavery or servitude and to have a standard of living in the event of an illness. His investigative works have won him worldwide acclaim with President Barack Obama highlighting his virtues in a speech during his 2009 visit to Ghana: &quot;An independent press. A vibrant private sector. A civil society. Those are the things that give life to democracy. We see that spirit in courageous journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas, who risked his life to report the truth.&quot; Anas has won over fourteen international awards for his investigative work. He was polled as the 5th most influential Ghanaian in 2011 by ETV, and named one of the &quot;Most Influential Africans of the Year&quot; by the New African Magazine, in December 2014. &quot;Chameleon&quot; a documentary about Anas&#x27; life and work by Ryan Mullins was premiered at the 2014 IDFA festival in Amsterdam.

Donal MacIntyre is an Irish journalist who went undercover to expose employment standards in the Adventure Sports industry following the Lyme Regis canoeing disaster. He also won an award for his undercover work exposing drug dealers and private security firms that work in collusion after living in character for eleven months.

Alex Dolan is a journalist and science teacher best known for her undercover work exposing poor student behavior in her British classroom for the filming of a Channel 4* documentary &quot;Undercover Teacher&quot;.

David Daleiden, an anti-abortion activist, secretly recorded conversations of officials at Planned Parenthood. Because Daleiden used a falsified driver&#x27;s license to obtain access to the Planned Parenthood officials, he was indicted by a Houston grand jury for a second degree felony.

Mazher Mahmood, the so-called &quot;fake sheik&quot;, who won awards for his journalism and then was jailed for perjury.

==Books based on undercover projects==
Related to this are books such as &quot;Black Like Me&quot; by John Howard Griffin, in which a white novelist dyed his skin black and traveled the southern United States, and &quot;Self-Made Man&quot; by Norah Vincent, a woman who dressed and passed herself off as a man. &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; by Laura Z. Hobson is a fictional account of a gentile journalist who poses as a Jew to investigate antisemitism.

<doc id="185812" wikidata="Q7515431" url="?curid=185812" title="Silly Philly">
<text>Silly Philly was the first comic strip by Bil Keane, most noted for the long-running comic &quot;The Family Circus&quot;. &quot;Silly Philly&quot; ran from April 27, 1947, to September 3, 1961.

In 1947, Keane created the Sunday strip while working for the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot;. The main character was a goofy, juvenile William Penn, who had somehow jumped down from his 37&#x27; statue on the tower of City Hall in Philadelphia and become something of a scamp. The cartoon often featured jokes submitted by readers. 

The Sunday strip sometimes included &quot;Mirthquakers&quot;, a puzzle and joke feature.

Keane, a native Philadelphian, has occasionally brought the city into reminiscences in &quot;Family Circus&quot;, which began in 1960.

<text>Íngrid Betancourt Pulecio (; born 25 December 1961) is a Colombian politician, former senator and anti-corruption activist, especially opposing political corruption.

Betancourt was kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on 23 February 2002 while campaigning for the Colombian presidency as a Green candidate, and was rescued by Colombian security forces six and a half years later on 2 July 2008. The rescue operation, dubbed Operation Jaque, rescued Betancourt along with 14 other hostages (three United States citizens, and 11 Colombian policemen and soldiers). She had decided to campaign in the former &quot;zone of dissention&quot;, after the military operation &quot;Tanatos&quot; was launched, and after the zone was declared free of guerrillas by the government. Her kidnapping received worldwide coverage, particularly in France, where she also held citizenship due to her prior marriage to a French diplomat.

Betancourt received multiple international awards in 2008 at her liberation, such as the Légion d&#x27;honneur or the Concord Prince of Asturias Award. After her release, she was portrayed by some of her fellow captives as &quot;controlling and manipulative&quot;; others described her as &quot;caring&quot; and &quot;courageous&quot;. One of them (Luis Eladio Pérez) claims Betancourt saved his life.

On 18 January 2022, she announced her candidacy for the 2022 Colombian presidential election in which she finished seventh.

==Biography==
Betancourt was born in Bogotá, Colombia. Her mother, Yolanda Pulecio, a former beauty queen famous for sheltering abandoned children, served in Congress, representing poor southern neighborhoods of Bogotá. Betancourt&#x27;s father, Gabriel Betancourt, was a minister of Education in both liberal and conservative governments (those of President Rojas Pinilla and President Lleras Restrepo), the assistant director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), then ambassador of Colombia to UNESCO in Paris, and head of the education commission of the Alliance for Progress in Washington, D.C. under John F. Kennedy. Betancourt&#x27;s mother Yolanda is of Italian descent.

After attending private school in France, a boarding school in England, and the Liceo Francés in Bogotá, Betancourt attended the Institut d&#x27;Études Politiques de Paris (commonly known as Sciences Po). In 2023, she was awarded a DPhil in Theology by the University of Oxford for her thesis entitled The Concept of the Non-person in Gustavo Gutiérrez Writings. She is current a research fellow at Harris Manchester College, Oxford.

Betancourt married French citizen Fabrice Delloye in 1983, and they had two children, Mélanie (born 1985) and Lorenzo (born 1988). Through her marriage she became a French citizen. Her husband served in the French diplomatic corps, and the couple lived in multiple countries, including Ecuador, the Seychelles, and the United States of America.

In the mid-1990s, Betancourt and Delloye divorced. Betancourt returned to Colombia and became advisor to the Minister of Finance and later to the Minister of Foreign Trade. In 1994, she was elected to the House of Representatives on an anticorruption ticket, and in 1998 she entered the Colombian Senate. Her children, Melanie and Lorenzo, moved to New Zealand to live with their father due to death threats stemming from Betancourt&#x27;s political activities.

Betancourt married Colombian advertising executive Juan Carlos Lecompte in 1997. Their marriage ended soon after her 2008 rescue.

==Political career==
In 1989, Luis Carlos Galán, a candidate for the Colombian presidency running on an anti-drug-trafficking platform, was assassinated. Betancourt&#x27;s mother was a supporter of Galán, and she was standing immediately behind him when he was shot dead. This event motivated Betancourt to return to Colombia in 1989. From 1990 onward, Betancourt worked at the Ministry of Finance and later at the Ministry of Foreign Trade, from which she later resigned to enter politics. Her first campaign distributed condoms, with the motto that people should protect themselves against corruption as they do against HIV.

===Election to the Chamber of Representatives, 1994===
Betancourt was elected to the Chamber of Representatives in 1994, against all odds. During her term, she criticized the administration of President Ernesto Samper, who was accused of corruption in the 8000 Process scandal after accepting money from the Cali drug cartel for his electoral campaign. In 1997, Betancourt launched a political party, the Partido Verde Oxigeno (Green Oxygen Party), as an alternative to the traditional conservative and liberal parties.

===Elected Senator of Colombia, 1998===
Betancourt ran for senator in the 1998 election, and the total number of votes she received was the largest of any candidate in a senate election. During her time in elected office, death threats caused her to send her children to New Zealand, where they would live with their father.

That same year, the presidential election was ultimately won by Andrés Pastrana. Pastrana persuaded Betancourt to endorse him, and she campaigned for him under the agreement of an anticorruption electoral reform to be adopted during his presidential term. The electoral reform was aborted due to strong pressures from the traditional parties and lack of commitment from the government. Betancourt withdrew her support of the government and joined the opposition forces.

===Presidential candidate, 2002===
Betancourt launched her presidential campaign on 20 May 2001, while standing next to a statue of Simón Bolívar in Bogotá. She then began a campaign bus trip around the country to attend local community meetings.

As part of her campaign for the presidency in 2002, Betancourt decided to visit the town of San Vicente del Caguán, in the demilitarized zone (DMZ), to support its mayor, a member of the Green Oxygen party. The peace process with the FARC had collapsed, the DMZ had been put to an end, and Pastrana had launched &quot;Operacion Tanatos&quot; to reclaim the area. At the time Betancourt decided to go, the Colombian Army had been deployed in the area in an attempt to evict the FARC guerillas. President Pastrana had given them 48 hours to leave the territory, and the deadline had expired. That same day President Pastrana attended a press conference in San Vicente del Caguan, in order to prove with his presence that the FARC had fled and that the military operation was a success. At the same time, the government ordered Betancourt&#x27;s bodyguards to abandon the mission of escorting her to San Vicente del Caguan.

Nonetheless, Betancourt was determined to go. Despite the army&#x27;s refusal to airlift her into San Vicente, she decided to drive and was given a government vehicle. The government later claimed that Betancourt had signed a document to release the government from any responsibility for what could happen to her. Clara Rojas, Adair Lamprea, and Betancourt have denied the existence of such a document. The document has never been produced by any Colombian official.

The peace talks reached an impasse after more than three years of negotiations. From the beginning, the FARC would not agree to a truce for the duration of the negotiations, nor would they agree that the peace talks be overseen by different representatives of the international community. Though the DMZ was purported to be a &quot;laboratory for peace&quot;, in practice the FARC continued its kidnapping activities, military attacks, purchasing of weapons, and even building of roads and airstrips for trafficking narcotics. Critics considered the DMZ to have been turned into a safe haven in which the FARC imposed its will as law, launching military attacks and acts of terrorism outside the DMZ before withdrawing back to it, in order to avoid direct confrontation with government armed forces. Also during this time, hundreds of civilians were kidnapped throughout different cities and rural areas of the country. They were then transported back to the DMZ, where they were kept in cages, many of them having been kidnapped for economic extortion, others for &quot;political reasons&quot;. By the end of 2001, the Colombian government and public opinion (according to different polls) were growing impatient and discouraged regarding the situation.

In February 2002, a turboprop plane flying from Florencia to Bogotá—a distance of some —was hijacked in midair by FARC members and forced to land on a highway strip near the city of Neiva, and then a member of the Colombian Congress was kidnapped. As a consequence, President Andrés Pastrana canceled the talks with the FARC and revoked the DMZ, arguing that the FARC had betrayed the terms of the negotiation and had used the DMZ to grow stronger in military and logistical capabilities. In a televised statement, the president expressed the government&#x27;s intention of retaking the DMZ, advising that the military operation would begin at midnight. He also urged the FARC to respect the lives and the livelihood of those civilians still present in the DMZ.

==Autobiography==
After her experience in the impeachment process against Colombian President E. Samper, Betancourt published her memoirs, in French, in March 2001, under the title &quot;La rage au cœur&quot;. The book generated intense media coverage in France, where it was the number one best seller for four weeks and a best seller for another nine. It has since appeared in Spanish as &quot;La rabia en el corazón&quot; and in English as &quot;Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia&quot; (2002).

==Kidnapping==
Most candidates for political office visited the former DMZ. When Betancourt announced her trip, the government confirmed that a security escort would accompany her from Florencia to San Vicente del Caguan. When she landed at Florencia&#x27;s airport, she received an offer to be transported to San Vicente del Caguan in a military helicopter. This offer was later retracted, and at the same time her bodyguards received the order to cancel their mission. President Pastrana and other officials explained they had turned down the helicopter ride offer, arguing that this meant rendering public resources to Betancourt&#x27;s private political interests. Betancourt stated that the government had, under constitutional provisions, the obligation of protecting any Colombian running for presidency, which included her.

When denied transport aboard a military helicopter that was heading to the DMZ, Betancourt revisited the original plan to travel there via ground transport, together with Clara Rojas, her campaign manager who was later named running mate for the 2002 election, and a handful of political aides. On 23 February 2002, Betancourt was stopped at the last military checkpoint before going into the former DMZ. Military officers have reported they insisted on stopping her car, and that Betancourt dismissed their warnings and continued her journey. These allegations contradict the testimony of Adair Lamprea, who was driving the car. He insists traffic was normal and the military officers at the checkpoint asked for their ID but did not try to stop them. This is corroborated by the fact that on the FARC roadblock where Betancourt was kidnapped, other vehicles were stopped, including a Red Cross four-wheel-drive car and a bus, which comprised normal traffic. According to Betancourt&#x27;s kidnapper, Nolberto Uni Vega (after his capture), Betancourt ended up at a FARC checkpoint, where she was kidnapped. Her kidnapping was not planned beforehand, said the rebel. Despite her abduction, Betancourt still appeared on the ballot for the presidential elections; her husband promised to continue her campaign. She received less than 1% of the votes.

Betancourt stated in an NPR interview that the government did offer to fly her but later reneged and took away her flight and then took away her bodyguards. She also stated she was never warned that it would be dangerous to travel by road, that checkpoints let her through with no warning or attempt to stop her, and that the government encouraged her to travel by road.

===Uribe&#x27;s initial policy===
Ever since the days of the Pastrana negotiations, when a limited exchange took place, the FARC have demanded the formalization of a mechanism for prisoner exchange. The mechanism would involve the release of what the FARC terms its &quot;political hostages&quot; in exchange for most jailed guerrillas, numbering about 500. For the FARC, most of its other hostages, those held for extortion purposes and which would number at least a thousand, would not be considered subject to such an exchange.

The newly elected Uribe administration initially ruled out any negotiation with the group that would not include a ceasefire, and instead pushed for rescue operations, many of which have traditionally been successful when carried out by the police&#x27;s GAULA anti-kidnapping group in urban settings, but not in the mountains and jungles where the FARC keeps most prisoners, according to official statistics and mainstream news reports.

Relatives of Betancourt and of most of FARC&#x27;s hostages strongly rejected any potential rescue operations, especially after the death of the governor of the Antioquia department, Guillermo Gaviria, his peace advisor and several soldiers, kidnapped by the FARC during a peace march in 2003. The governor and the others were shot at close range by the FARC in May 2003 when the government launched an army rescue mission into the jungle which failed as the guerrillas learned of the troops&#x27; presence in the area.

===Negotiations===
====2002====
A day after Betancourt&#x27;s kidnapping several non-governmental organizations (NGO) under the lead of Armand Burguet were organized in the European Union and around the world to establish an association or committee for the liberation of Ingrid Betancourt. The committee initially consisted of some 280 activists in 39 countries.

One month after her kidnapping, her father Gabriel died of heart and respiratory trouble.

====2003====
In July 2003 Opération 14 juillet was launched, which both failed to liberate Betancourt and caused a scandal for the French government. A video of Betancourt was released by FARC in August 2003.

====2004====

In August 2004, after several false-starts and in the face of mounting pressure from relatives, former Liberal presidents Alfonso López Michelsen and Ernesto Samper (who was accused in the &#x27;Proceso 8000&#x27; for financing his presidential campaign with drug funds) came out in favor of a humanitarian exchange. The Uribe government, seeming to have gradually relaxed its position, announced that it had given the FARC a formal proposal on 23 July, in which it offered to free 50 to 60 jailed rebels in exchange for the political and military hostages held by the FARC group (not including economic hostages, as the government had earlier demanded).

The government would make the first move, releasing insurgents charged or condemned for rebellion and either allowing them to leave the country or to stay and join the state&#x27;s reinsertion program. Then the FARC would release the hostages in its possession, including Ingrid Betancourt. The proposal would have been carried out with the backing and support of the French and Swiss governments, who publicly supported it once it was revealed.

The move was signaled as potentially positive by several relatives of the victims and Colombian political figures. Some critics of the president have considered that Uribe may seek to gain political prestige from such a move, though they would agree with the project in practice.

The FARC released a communiqué dated 20 August (but apparently published publicly only on 22 August) in which they denied having received the proposal earlier through the mediation of Switzerland as the government had stated. While making note of the fact that a proposal had been made by the Uribe administration and that it hoped that common ground could eventually be reached, the FARC criticized the offer because they believe that any deal should allow them to decide how many of its jailed comrades would be freed and that they should be allowed to return to the rebel ranks.

On 5 September, what has been considered as a sort of FARC counter proposal was revealed in the Colombian press. The FARC proposed that the government declare a &quot;security&quot; or &quot;guarantee&quot; zone for 72 hours in order for official insurgent and state negotiators to meet face to face and directly discuss a prisoner exchange. Government military forces would not have to leave the area but to concentrate in their available garrisons, in a similar move to that agreed by the Ernesto Samper administration (1994–1998) which involved the group freeing some captured security forces. In addition, the government&#x27;s peace commissioner would have to make an official public pronouncement regarding this proposal.

If the zone were created, the first day would be used for traveling to the chosen location, the second to discuss the matter, and the third for the guerrillas to abandon the area. The government would be able to choose the location for the &quot;security zone&quot; from among the municipalities of Peñas Coloradas, El Rosal or La Tuna, all in Caquetá department, where the FARC had influence.

The FARC proposal to arrange a meeting with the government was considered as positive by Yolanda Pulecio, Betancourt&#x27;s mother, who called it a sign of &quot;progress […] just as the (government) commissioner can meet with (right-wing) paramilitaries, why can&#x27;t he meet with the others, who are just as terrorist as they are.&quot;

====2006====
In February 2006, France urged the FARC to seize the chance offered by a European-proposed prisoner swap, accepted by Bogotá, and free dozens it had held for up to seven years. Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said it was &quot;up to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to show they were serious about releasing former Colombian presidential candidate Íngrid Betancourt and other detainees.&quot;

In an interview with French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; in June 2006, Raul Reyes, a leader of the FARC, said that Betancourt &quot;is doing well, within the environment she finds herself in. It&#x27;s not easy when one is deprived of freedom.&quot;

====2007====
In May 2007, a captured Colombian National Police sub-intendant, Jhon Frank Pinchao, escaped from FARC captivity, and claimed that Betancourt was being held in the same prison camp he had been in. On 18 May, President Álvaro Uribe reiterated his orders for the rescue by military means of Betancourt and other political figures.

Shortly after taking office in mid-May, French President Nicolas Sarkozy asked Uribe to release FARC&#x27;s &quot;chancellor&quot; Rodrigo Granda in exchange for Betancourt.

On 4 June 30 incarcerated members from the FARC were liberated as a goodwill gesture by the government to pursue the liberation of Betancourt and others. However this did not result in her freedom.

On 26 July, Melanie Delloye, Betancourt&#x27;s daughter, reported two French diplomats had been unsuccessful in confirming that she was still alive according to news agency EFE. President Sarkozy affirmed this to the press. However former hostage Pinchao repeated that Betancourt was alive, and had attempted to escape several times from the FARC camp where both were held, but had been recaptured and &quot;severely punished&quot;.

In August 2007, reporter Patricia Poleo, a Venezuelan national self-exiled in the United States, stated that Betancourt was being held in Venezuela and that her release was near. The government of Colombia expressed doubts about this information through its minister of foreign affairs Fernando Araújo.
Poleo also criticized Hugo Chávez for using this situation to improve relations with France after an impasse with the government of Jacques Chirac in which they refused to sell arms to Venezuela. A few days after Poleo&#x27;s statements, President Chávez openly offered his services to negotiate between the FARC and the government in an effort to release those kidnapped, but denied knowing about the whereabouts of Betancourt.

On 11 November 2007, Chávez told French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that he hoped to be able to show Sarkozy proof before their meeting on 20 November that Betancourt was alive, while on 18 November Chávez announced to the French press that he had been told by a FARC leader that she was still alive.

On 30 November, the Colombian government released information that they had captured three members of the urban cells of the FARC in Bogotá who had with them videos and letters of people held hostage by the FARC, including Betancourt. In the video Betancourt appears in the jungle sitting on a bench looking at the ground. She &quot;appeared extremely gaunt&quot;.
A letter intended for Íngrid&#x27;s mother, Yolanda, which was found at the same time, was also published in several newspapers.

====2008====

In 2008, Chávez, with the initial permission of the Colombian government and the participation of the International Red Cross, organized humanitarian operations in order to receive several civilian hostages whose release had been announced by FARC. The first operation led to the release of Clara Rojas and Consuelo González. Emmanuel, Rojas&#x27;s son born in captivity, had been freed previously after a stunning declaration from president Uribe, where it was discovered the infant was left in a foster home after being severely mistreated by the guerrillas.

On 27 February a second operation was carried out, freeing four former members of the Colombian Congress. The released hostages were very concerned about the health of Betancourt. One described her as &quot;exhausted physically and in her morale. […] Ingrid is mistreated very badly, they have vented their anger on her, they have her chained up in inhumane conditions.&quot; Another said that she had hepatitis B and was &quot;near the end&quot;. Nicolas Sarkozy said he was prepared to personally go to accept her release if necessary.

On 27 March, the Colombian government, with Uribe&#x27;s support, offered to free hundreds of guerrilla fighters in exchange for Betancourt&#x27;s release.

On 31 March, Colombian news station Caracol quoted several sources saying Betancourt had stopped taking her medication and stopped eating. She was said to be in desperate need of a blood transfusion.

On 2 April, Betancourt&#x27;s son, Lorenzo Delloye, addressed the FARC and the President Uribe, to facilitate her release in order to prevent her death. He quoted the need for a blood transfusion in order to keep her alive saying that otherwise she may die in the next few hours.

On 3 April, an envoy left for Colombia to try to make contact with Betancourt and many of the other captives, who had become ill after years of captivity in the jungle. After two days, the envoy, including a doctor, still hadn&#x27;t heard from the FARC, but received orders from the French government to wait. Five days after arrival of the envoy the FARC released a press note on the Bolivarian Press Agency website, refusing the mission access to their hostages, because &quot;the French medical mission was not appropriate and, moreover, was not the result of an agreement.&quot; Following the FARC&#x27;s refusal, the French government called off the humanitarian mission and said foreign minister Bernard Kouchner would visit the region.

On 2 July news reports stated that Betancourt and three American hostages were recovered (see Rescue below). Altogether, 15 hostages were freed, including 11 Colombian soldiers. Minister of National Defense Juan Manuel Santos said all the former hostages were in reasonably good health, although Betancourt stated she was tortured during her captivity.

==Rescue==

On 2 July 2008, Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos called a press conference to announce the rescue of Betancourt and 14 other captives. The operation that won their release, codenamed &quot;Jaque&quot; (Spanish for &quot;check&quot; as in checkmate), included members of the Colombian military intelligence who infiltrated local FARC squads and the secretariat of FARC, according to Santos. The FARC members in charge of the hostages were persuaded to accept a request from headquarters to gather the hostages together, supposedly to be flown to FARC chief Alfonso Cano. Instead, they were flown by government personnel dressed as FARC members to San José del Guaviare. No one was harmed during the rescue. Three American Northrop Grumman contractors, Marc Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Thomas Howes, were among those released.

Colombian military agents spent months planting themselves within FARC, gaining the members&#x27; trust, and joining the leadership council. Other agents were assigned to guard the hostages. Using their authority in the group, the agents ordered the hostages moved from three different locations to a central area. From this point, the hostages, agents, and about 60 real FARC members made a 90-mile march through the jungle to a spot where, agents told the FARC members, an &quot;international mission&quot; was coming to check on the hostages. On schedule, an unmarked white helicopter set down and Colombian security forces posing as FARC members jumped out. They told the FARC members that they would take the hostages to the meeting with the &quot;international mission.&quot; All of the captives were handcuffed and placed aboard the helicopter, along with two of their FARC guards, who were quickly disarmed and subdued after the helicopter lifted off. According to Betancourt, a crew member then turned and told the 15 hostages, &quot;We are the national military. You are free.&quot; Tracking technology was used by the rescuers to zero in on their target.

On 16 July 2008 it became public that one of the Colombian officials was misusing a Red Cross emblem during the rescue operation. Under international humanitarian law this is a war crime.

==Political consequences==
The liberated Betancourt thanked the Colombian armed forces and President Álvaro Uribe and gave her approval to Uribe&#x27;s third term as a president. She urged neighbouring presidents Hugo Chávez (Venezuela) and Rafael Correa (Ecuador) to help Colombia and seek the political transformations in her country by democratic means. And she stated that she would dedicate herself to helping those who were still held captive in the jungle. Some believe that the liberation of Betancourt caused a dramatic change of the political scene.

In an interview on French radio shortly after her return to France Betancourt distanced herself from Uribe&#x27;s approach while accepting that his security policy had been successful. She said the situation was at a point where &quot;the vocabulary has to change&quot;, arguing that &quot;the way in which we talk about the other side is very important&quot;. She also thanked president Hugo Chávez &quot;for his help in recovering the freedom of many Colombian hostages&quot; during their meeting in Caracas in 2010.

==Reunion and celebration==

Sarkozy sent a French Air Force jet with Betancourt&#x27;s children, her sister Astrid and her family and accompanied by Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, for a tearful reunion. After paying her respects at her father&#x27;s tomb she and the family boarded the jet and flew to France, where she was greeted by Sarkozy and the First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. She gave speeches and urged the world not to forget and to continue for the liberation of the rest of the hostages. She also spent several days in hospital.

On 9 July President Michelle Bachelet of Chile said she would nominate Betancourt for a Nobel Prize. Nicolas Sarkozy announced that she would receive the Legion of Honor at the Bastille Day celebrations.

On 20 July, Betancourt appeared next to singer Juanes at a rally in Trocadéro in Paris to celebrate Colombia&#x27;s independence day and to once more urge the FARC to release all their hostages. Speaking directly to Alfonso Cano she said:

===Allegations of payment===
On 4 July 2008, &quot;Radio Suisse Romande&quot; reported that unnamed &quot;reliable sources&quot; had told it the rescue took place after a payment of US$20 million by the United States. According to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, the French Foreign Ministry denied the payment of any ransom by France.

Frederich Blassel, the author of the &quot;Radio Suisse Romande&quot; story, told Colombia&#x27;s &quot;W Radio&quot; that, according to his source, the release wasn&#x27;t negotiated directly with FARC but with alias César, one of the two guerrillas captured during the operation, who would have received the payment of US$20 million. According to Blassel, the two rebels could be given new identities by Spain, France and Switzerland.

The Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos, and Vice President Francisco Santos, in response to these claims, denied any payment. &quot;That information is absolutely false. It has no basis. We don&#x27;t know where it comes from and why its being said&quot;. He also added with a touch of irony that &quot;Actually, it would have been a cheap offer, because we were willing to give up to USD 100 million […] We would be the first to inform publicly, because it is part of our rewards system policy, and besides, it would speak much worse about the FARC.&quot;

According to Colombia&#x27;s &quot;El Tiempo&quot; and &quot;W Radio&quot;, General Fredy Padilla de León, Commander of the Colombian Armed Forces, denied the existence of any payment by the Colombian government. General Padilla argued that if any payment had been made, it would have been better to make it publicly known, to use it as an incentive and to cause confusion within FARC&#x27;s ranks.

===Compensation request===
In June 2010 Betancourt requested from the Colombian justice, as other Colombian hostages previously had, monetary compensation under the Colombian law on protecting victims of terrorism. She presented her request on the grounds of having been victim of a lack of protection when her escorts were dismissed on 23 February 2002, which enabled rebels to kidnap her. The Colombian government said she was attacking in court the soldiers who had liberated her in 2008. Colombian vice president Francisco Santos said that the &quot;lawsuit&quot; deserved a &quot;world prize for greed, ungratefulness and gall&quot;.

A few days after the news of the request had broken and public indignation had been added to the government&#x27;s, Betancourt&#x27;s lawyer, Gabriel Devis, said that the focus had to be on the &quot;protection mechanisms the Colombian state offers to its citizens&quot; and that nobody was attacking any soldier. He stressed that the former hostage was &quot;deeply grateful&quot; to &quot;the armed forces and all those who in one way or another risked their lives to free the hostages.&quot;

Betancourt withdrew her claim for compensation, expressing her indignation at the way in which her undertaking had been distorted and the public opinion manipulated. She had suffered what she called a &quot;public lapidation as if she was a criminal&quot;.

==Apologies from the abductor==
On 15 April 2008, Betancourt&#x27;s abductor, Nolberto Uni Vega, said to journalists attending his trial in Combita that he was sorry for abducting the former presidential candidate and that he felt &quot;remorse&quot; over her plight. Uni gave a letter of apology to a journalist for delivery to Betancourt&#x27;s mother, who would pass it on to President Sarkozy.

==La Nuit Blanche==
In October 2007, Bertrand Delanoë, the mayor of Paris, announced the upcoming Nuit Blanche, saying, &quot;This year, both Paris and Rome want to dedicate &quot;La Nuit Blanche&quot; to Ingrid Bétancourt. [She is] an honorary citizen of the city of Paris, and an especially (committed and involved) woman, who has been held in Colombia by the FARC since 23 February 2002. We will [continue to] fight unceasingly for her release.&quot;

==&quot;Out of Captivity&quot; book==
In their book titled &quot;Out of Captivity&quot;, American Northrop Grumman contractors Marc Gonsalves, Keith Stansell, and Thomas Howes, all of whom spent time as hostages with Betancourt, described her behavior while a captive of FARC as selfish, as was her belief she deserved better treatment than the other captives owing to her political and social standing. The Americans, held captive by the FARC from 2003 to 2008, stated that throughout their captivity Betancourt claimed and took more than her fair share of scarce food, clothing, and personal space. Stansell said, &quot;I can get over just about anything, but I don&#x27;t know about Ingrid. Forgive? Yes. Move on? Yes. Respect? No.&quot; Marc Gonsalves has defended Betancourt, and stated: &quot;For me she is a courageous person, she behaved like only heroes do, this is why I am so hurt with Keith&#x27;s attacks.&quot;

Betancourt declined to comment on the Americans&#x27; allegations. In 2009, a spokesperson said Betancourt was &quot;dedicated to writing her own book and not making declarations until it is finished.&quot;

==Life after the rescue==
Betancourt received the Ordre national de la Légion d&#x27;honneur (National Order of the Legion of Honour) shortly after her rescue and the Prince of Asturias Award of Concord in October 2008. She also met with international heads of state and international personalities such as Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, Pope Benedict XVI, King Juan Carlos of Spain and Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela and President Cristina Kirchner of Argentina.

In 2009, she signed with Gallimard to write her memoirs. The resulting book, published on 21 September 2010 after 15 months of writing, is titled &quot;Même le silence a une fin&quot; (&quot;Even Silence Has an End: My Six Years of Captivity in the Colombian Jungle&quot;). It mainly describes Betancourt&#x27;s ordeal as a hostage of Colombian guerrillas and was praised as an &quot;extraordinary adventure story&quot;, expressing her anguish in a poetic way. Her writing was compared to the greatest authors&#x27;; &quot;just think of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; or novelists like Dumas and Arthur Koestler&quot;, writes Larry Rohter in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book review.

Betancourt filed for divorce in 2009.

Betancourt stated, &quot;I think we have that animal inside of us, all of us…. We can be so horrible to the others. For me it was like understanding what I couldn&#x27;t understand before, how, for example, the Nazis, how this could happen.&quot;

==Recognition==
She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women of 2013.

<text>Physics and Beyond () is a book by Werner Heisenberg, the German physicist who discovered the uncertainty principle. It tells, from his point of view, the history of exploring atomic science and quantum mechanics in the first half of the 20th century.

As the subtitle &quot;Encounters and Conversations&quot; suggests, the core part of this book takes the form of discussions between himself and other scientists. Heisenberg says: &quot;I wanted to show that science is done by people, and the most wonderful ideas come from dialog&quot;.

With chapters like &quot;The first encounter with the science about atoms&quot;, &quot;Quantum mechanics and conversations with Einstein&quot;, &quot;Conversation about the relation between biology, physics and chemistry&quot; or &quot;Conversations about language&quot; and &quot;The behavior of an individual during a political disaster&quot;, dated 1937–1941, a reader can hear speaking such persons as Erwin Schrödinger, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein or Max Planck, not only about physics, but also about many other questions related to biology, humans, philosophy, and politics.

Not only that, these conversations are often situated in detailed description of the historical atmosphere and a beautiful scenery, as many of them were led in nature during the many journeys they made, backpacking or sailing. &quot;&#x27;Do you see whales, Heisenberg?&#x27;, &#x27;Yes, I see only whales, but I hope they are only big waves.&#x27;&quot;, is one of humorous scenes when the author, Bohr and other friends were sailing in a dark night.

The book provides a first-hand account about how science is done and how quantum physics, especially the Copenhagen interpretation, emerged.

&quot;Nobody can reproduce these conversations verbatim, but I believe that the spirit of what the people said, and how they did, is conserved,&quot; the author tries to explain in the preface.

Many believe that the golden years of physics around 1925, when &quot;even small people could do big things&quot; are gone. But the people who had been there continue to speak to us through this book.

The book was published first in German 1969, in English as &quot;Physics and Beyond&quot; (1971) and in French in 1972 (La partie et le tout).

<doc id="185829" wikidata="Q1860793" url="?curid=185829" title="Scream Tracker">
<text>Scream Tracker is a tracker (an integrated multi-track step sequencer and sampler as a software application). It was created by Psi (Sami Tammilehto), one of the founders of the Finnish demogroup Future Crew. It was written in C and assembly language.

The first version (1.0) had monophonic 4-bit output via the PC speaker, as well as 8-bit output via Covox&#x27;s Speech Thing (a digital-to-analog converter using the parallel port) or a Sound Blaster 1.x card. 

The first popular version of Scream Tracker, version 2.2, was published in 1990. Versions prior to 3.0 created STM (Scream Tracker Module) files, while versions 3.0 and above used the S3M (ScreamTracker 3 Module) format. 

As of version 3.0, &quot;Scream Tracker&quot; supports up to 99 8-bit samples, 32 channels, 100 patterns, and 256 order positions. It can also handle up to 9 FM-synthesis channels on sound cards using the popular OPL2/3/4 chipsets, and, unusually, can play PCM samples and FM instruments at the same time. There are channels referred to as R1..8, L1..8 and A1..9 to be assigned to those 32 ones, which gives an effective amount of only 25 channels. 16-position free panning is available using the S8x command, but only on the Gravis Ultrasound. The usage of the A channels requires the presence of an AdLib-compatible card either by itself or alongside another sound card.

The last version of Scream Tracker was 3.21, released in 1994, placing it in competition with FastTracker 2. It was the precursor of the PC tracking scene and its interface inspired newer trackers like Impulse Tracker. Various other trackers (such as Impulse Tracker or OpenMPT) adopted the use of the Scream Tracker&#x27;s S3M format.

<text>The Perseus Digital Library, formerly known as the Perseus Project, is a free-access digital library founded by Gregory Crane in 1987 and hosted by the Department of Classical Studies of Tufts University. One of the pioneers of digital libraries, its self-proclaimed mission is to make the full record of humanity available to everyone. While originally focused on the ancient Greco-Roman world, it has since diversified and offers materials in Arabic, Germanic, English Renaissance literature, 19th century American documents and Italian poetry in Latin, and has sprouted several child projects and international cooperation. The current version, Perseus 4.0, is also known as the Perseus Hopper, and is mirrored by the University of Chicago.

== Purpose ==
The Perseus Digital Library was created to provide access to materials of the history of humanity to everyone, with Gregory Crane, the editor-in-chief of the library, stating that &quot;access to the cultural heritage of humanity is a right, not a privilege&quot;.

=== Open Source ===
This notably means that the Perseus Digital Library tries not to be exclusive to academics but aims to be accessible to everyone. To reflect this, the library supports open-source content and has published its code on SourceForge. The website is written in Java, uses sustainable formats such as XML and JPEG, and includes native support for the Greek, Latin and Arabic alphabets. It allows users to download all materials that belong to the public domain along with the Creative Commons rights information that specify their conditions of use. While automated downloading is not authorized, in order to protect items subject to intellectual property, the library offers download packages to the public.

The Perseus Digital library also adheres to sets of standards edified by other projects. It follows the norms of the Text Encoding Initiative for its XML mark-up. In the same vein, the library has applied the Canonical Text Services (CTS) protocol regarding citations to its classical Greek-Latin corpus.

Following this philosophy, Perseus chooses to use copyright-free texts, be it in the primary readings or in their translations and commentaries. For these reasons, the texts hosted necessarily date at the latest from the 19th and early 20th century, and must be divided into books, chapters and sections to be displayed individually. As such, those translations and commentaries can be outdated compared to the current state of the research, which can prove problematic when most of the now canonically accepted versions of ancient texts were established and sectioned later, during the 20th century.
Perseus however tries to make rare and out-of-print materials accessible, and, for some texts, the material one can find on the website is the only one that was produced, which makes it especially valuable to scholars.

Some content is restricted by intellectual property license agreements with the holders of the rights to that material. This is notably the case for the pictures of artifacts that come from partnership with museums.

==History==
The Perseus Library is one of the first digital libraries to have been created, and is widely regarded as a pioneer in the field and a role model of other similar initiatives.

The Perseus Library first originated as a branch of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, from a full-text retrieval tool on Ancient Greek materials made by Gregory Crane, who became the editor-in-chief of the project ever since it was created. The goal of the library was to provide a wider access to knowledge, past the academical field; to quote the mission statement, &quot;to make a full record of humanity, as intellectually accessible as possible, to every human being, regardless of linguistic or cultural background&quot;.

The planning period took place from 1985 to 1988, with the development of the Ancient Greek collection starting in 1987 thanks to funding from the Annenberg-CPB Project which allowed the Perseus Project to be developed.

Perseus 1.0, or HyperCard Perseus, was a CD-ROM released in 1992 by Yale University, using the Apple HyperCard for McIntosh. For practical reasons, it was limited to ancient Greek materials, and contained the texts of nine major Greek authors along with an English translation and commentary. The collection was enriched by use of hyperlink technology and contextual material such as pictures of artifacts, an atlas as well as an historical timeline, and an encyclopedia of places, people and terminology, in an attempt to help non-academic users gain access to the material. Perseus 1.0 got nonetheless criticized for its &quot;difficulty of use and odd content, both specialised and lacking&quot;. Furthermore, it was not a true digital library, but rather more a CD-ROM of primary readings published with various additional information.

A second version of the CD-ROM came in 1996 in the form of Perseus 2.0, which mainly expanded the collection of pictures. It was still limited to McIntosh computers, until a platform-independent version got released in 2000.

Hardware limitations induced costs and limited the scope of the projects, which ultimately led to the CD-ROM versions of Perseus only covering Greek material. Moreover, they were very expensive: even though the price was to only make minimal profits, the CDs cost between $150 and $350 depending on the amount of material included, and were only released in North America, which severely limited worldwide accessibility.

After moving to Tufts University in 1993, the Perseus Library switched to a website version in 1995 written in Perl. Thanks to this new interface, Perseus-Online could reach a wider audience. However, Perseus was still bound by copyright agreements made with the CD-ROM company, which limited the reuse of material.

Perseus 2.0 Online expanded the collection in 1997, adding Roman materials as well as Renaissance texts of Shakespeare and Marlowe. This version also introduced a search bar on the website, as well as articles which presented information on Heracles and the Olympic Games, which were quite successful. In 1999, a grant from the Digital Library Initiative Phase 2 allowed Perseus to expand into other areas of Humanities and to create collections on the History of London and the American Civil War.

Perseus 3.0 released in 2000 directly on the web. This version expanded and revised the website, adding new collections, but it was subject to some issues when it came to making links to material stable and consistent.

The current version of Perseus, Perseus 4.0, also known as the Perseus Hopper, was released in 2005, with Perseus 3.0 coexisting alongside and slowly fading out, until it got taken down in 2009. This time, the website was based on Java, written in the open-sourced language Hopper and TEI-compliant XML. The shift allowed Perseus to produce its own XML-encoded texts, which were not bound by copyright agreements. The Greek, Latin and English collections were released in 2006 under a Creative Commons License. The source code got subsequently released in 2007.

Perseus has nowadays branched into other projects: the Scaife Viewer, which is the first phase of the work towards Perseus 5.0, the Perseus Catalog, which provides links to the digital editions not hosted by the Perseus Library, the Perseids Project, which aims to support access to Classics scholarship by providing tools to foster language acquisition, facilitate working with documents, and encourage research, and, more recently, the Beyond Translation project, which aims to combine the Scaife Viewer with new versions and services of Perseus 4.0.

Furthermore, the library has been cooperating internationally with Leipzig University, with several projects emerging of it, such as the Ancient Greek and Latin Dependency Treebank, for classical philology, Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (LOFTS) which focuses on fragmentary texts, the Open Greek and Latin Project and Open Persian.

== Content ==
=== Collections ===
The Perseus Digital Library contains online collections on the Humanities pertaining to different subjects. 
The main collection focuses on the classical materials of ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and features an extensive number of texts written in Ancient Greek and Latin chosen for their status as a canonical literary text, in a degree of completeness and representativeness no other digital library can claim. It has however been noted that the materials that weren&#x27;t included on account on not being traditionally studied are further devalued by the lack of representation.

The library does not only host primary readings. Partnerships with museums allowed it to build a consequent collection of artifacts which showcases pictures of coins, sculptures, vases, but also gems, buildings and sites, as well as information concerning the context of artifact and its current location.
Moreover, Perseus includes commentaries and translations that are free of copyright. However, to be free of copyright, texts have to be sufficiently old, and, as a result, Classics scholars have insisted that the commentaries and translations provided by Perseus cannot be used in an academical setting due to their age and the existence of more recent editions for the most often researched texts.

Although the classical section is the most complete and established of the website, the Perseus Digital Library is not limited to this collection, and has branched throughout its existence into other categories of knowledge.
Materials on early modern English literature are as such available, and used to be called the Perseus Garner. They consisted of a heterogeneous compilation of primary materials from the early modern period in England, as well as selected secondary materials from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, comprising the works of Christopher Marlowe, the Globe Shakespeare, volumes from the New Variorum Shakespeare Series, Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles, Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s Voyages and the rhetorical works of Henry Peacham and Thomas Wilson, among other primary sources. Several reference works, include glossaries and lexicons, are also included. This collection of texts has however been criticized for its choices of inclusion, and described as neither balanced nor complete, and texts not included are devalued by their absence.

Records from American Memory, a corpus of electronic versions of the Library of Congress archival collections related to the cultural heritage of the United States, were harvested in order to offer a collection on the history of the 19th-century United States. This third-party collection was further completed by materials on the American Civil War. This sub-collection, as well as materials on the Humanist and Renaissance Italian Poetry in Latin and the Richmond Times Dispatch, are regarded as fairly complete due to their narrow subject.

Perseus also hosts a variety of documents on the study of Germanic people, such as Beowulf and a variety of sagas in Old Norse along with translations. This sub-section has been described as fairly good, considering that this field of research is less well researched than the other.

Finally, the Perseus Digital Library hosts Arabic materials, but its selection is limited to the Quran and dictionaries.

The Library used to host the Bolles Collection of the History of London, a digitized recreation of an existing special collection homogeneous in theme but heterogeneous in content, which interlinks maps of London, relevant texts, and historical and contemporary illustrations of the city. The collection got transferred to the Tufts Digital Library. The same can be said of the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri and the history of Tufts, which used to be on the website as well (Perseus). A section on the history of mechanics also used to be present on Perseus.

=== Use of technology ===
The Perseus Library follows the goal of Digital Humanities, which is to capitalize on the use of modern technology to further research in Classics and facilitate understanding of the material. As such, it uses a variety of tools to enrich the texts it hosts.

One of the way it does so is by automatically linking the texts to additional materials. Interlinks exist between a primary reading, its different versions, and its translations and commentaries. Users can also find maps of places mentioned in the texts as well as a historical timeline, and search tools allow readers to look for a text by its author or the presence of a specific lemma or word.
Perseus also enhanced its texts through TEI-compliant markup language, which allows each word to be linked to a dictionary entry, a morphological analysis tool known as Morpheus, a word frequency tool, and other texts where the word is used.
Since the mark-up is automatically generated, older sections of the libraries have been noted to be less rich and complete than newer ones. This structure allows for a machine-readable and searchable environment, and one of Perseus&#x27; goals is the automated generation of knowledge through text and data mining.

Each section of a text and item is also given a stable identifier of 10 digits, which makes citations possible in the form of four different URIs (text, citation, work, catalog record) containing URNs; furthermore, metadata schemes are employed as to make each section or object meaningful outside of the context of the library. Those sections are also given a Creative Commons license indicating conditions of use.
However, one should note the lack of a TEI-header containing bibliographical information and metadata about the respective source, and that such information needs to be searched for on the Perseus Catalog.
As a result of the use of this technology, Perseus has been useful to scholars of classical philology and history in facilitating the study of the material, but also to students who have benefited from the various tools the library offers.

=== Criticism on the website ===
The website has been criticised for being ergonomically poor and unintuitive, and new users may have problems accessing resources due to a confusing layout which seems to prioritize showcasing the Perseus Digital Library over its collections. The lack of presentation for collections accentuates this problem. Accessibility is another issue, with pages not always adhering to the standards of the Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

=== Sustainability ===
Perseus has proven convincing in terms of sustainability throughout its long history and ability to evolve, having notably been able to migrate from the SGML format to XML in Perseus 4.0. The preservation of the collections is further insured by a Fedora Commons Backend created in 2002 as well as a mirror site provided by the University of Chicago.
== Responsibility ==
=== Key Actors ===
The Perseus Digital Library has been under the consistent leadership of its founder and editor in chief Gregory Crane. The library is nowadays located at Tufts University with a full-time staff of eight members, consisting of Gregory Crane, Marie-Claire Beaulieu, who has joined the project in 2010 and become its Associate Editor in 2013, Bridget Almas, lead software developer of the Perseus Digital Library and one of the primary programmers of the Alpheios Project, Alison Babeu, Digital Librarian and Research Coordinator of the library since 2004, Lisa Cerrato, Managing Editor who was a part of Perseus since 1994, and Anna Krohn, digital library analyst and lead developer of the Perseus Catalog. Frederik Baumgardt and Tim Buckingham are also noted as working on the Perseids Project full time, respectively as Data Architect and Senior Research Coordinator.
A list of former staff and students can be found on the Perseus website.

=== Funding ===
A long list of agencies provided funding and grants to the Perseus Digital Library over the years. According to the home page of the Perseus website, the list of recent financial supporters includes: the Alpheios Project, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the United States Department of Education, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Endowment for the Humanities as well as private donors, and Tufts University. The Mellon Foundation, Tufts University, Harvard University&#x27;s Center for Hellenic Studies and, mainly, the National Endowment for the Humanities are specifically noted as key donors that made the Beyond Translation project possible.

Additional support for the Perseus project has been provided over the years by the Annenberg Foundation, Apple Inc., the Berger Family Technology Transfer Endowment, the Digital Libraries Initiative Phase 2, the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education part of the U.S. Department of Education, the Getty Grant program, the Modern Language Association, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Science Foundation, the Packard Humanities Institute, Xerox, Boston University, and Harvard University.

<doc id="185842" wikidata="Q178611" url="?curid=185842" title="Jura Mountains">
<text>The Jura Mountains ( ) are a sub-alpine mountain range a short distance north of the Western Alps and mainly demarcate a long part of the French–Swiss border. While the Jura range proper (&quot;folded Jura&quot;, ) is located in France and Switzerland, the range continues northeastwards through northern Switzerland and Germany as the Table Jura (&quot;not folded Jura&quot;, ), which is crossed by the High Rhine.

==Name==
The mountain range gives its name to the French department of Jura, the Swiss canton of Jura, the Jurassic period of the geologic timescale, and the Montes Jura of the Moon.

It is first attested as &quot;mons Iura&quot; in book one of Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;. Strabo uses a Greek masculine form &quot;ὁ Ἰόρας&quot; (&quot;through the Jura mountains&quot;, &quot;διὰ τοῦ Ἰόρα ὄρους&quot;) in his &quot;Geographica&quot; (4.6.11). Based on suggestions by Ferdinand de Saussure, early celticists such as Georges Dottin tried to establish an etymon &quot;iura-, iuri&quot; as a Celtic word for mountains, with similar putative etymologies (e.g. *&quot;juris&quot;, &quot;mountainous forest&quot;) still appearing in more recent non-academic publications. However, since there are no clear cognates in the surviving corpus of the Celtic languages, modern studies of Proto-Celtic and Gaulish etymology tend not to list any lemmata connected to Jura, and the name must be considered fundamentally unclear.

==Physiography==
The Jura Mountains are a far province of the larger Central European uplands. The Jura range proper lies in France and Switzerland.

In France, the Jura covers most of the Franche-Comté region, stretching south into the Rhône-Alpes region and north into the Grand Est region. The range reaches its highest point at the Crêt de la Neige (), in department of Ain, 5 km west from the Swiss border of the canton of Geneva, and finds its southern terminus in the northwestern part of the department of Savoie. The north end of the Jura extends into the southern tip of Alsace (Sundgau). Roughly of the mountain range in France is protected by the Jura Mountains Regional Natural Park.
The Swiss Jura is one of the three distinct geographical regions of Switzerland, the others being the Swiss plateau and the Swiss Alps. Most of the range covers the western border with France. In Switzerland, the Jura Mountains extend over an area covering (from northeast to southwest) the cantons of Zurich, Aargau, Basel-Landschaft, Solothurn, Jura, Bern (i.e., Bernese Jura), Neuchâtel, Vaud, and Geneva. The easternmost mountain of the Jura range proper is the Lägern, situated east of the river Aare. Much of the Swiss Jura region has no historical association with Early Modern Switzerland and was incorporated as part of the Swiss Confederacy only in the 19th century. In the 20th century, a movement for Jura separatism developed which resulted in the creation of the Canton of Jura in 1979.

The east of the Jura range proper separates the Rhine and Rhône basins. The northern and eastern part of the range drains towards the Rhine river and its tributaries Aare and Ill, whereas the western and southern parts drain towards the Rhône river and its (sub)tributaries Doubs, Saône, and Ain. Initially the river Doubs (a subtributary of the Rhône) flows about northeast, briefly venturing into Switzerland, then changing direction and flowing about southwest before joining the Saône ca. north of the French city of Lyon. In Lyon, the Saône joins the Rhône. While the Rhine flows into the North Sea, the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

Northeast, the Jura range proper (known as &quot;folded Jura&quot;, &quot;Faltenjura&quot;) is continued as the Table Jura (&quot;Tafeljura&quot;). The Table Jura ranges (from southwest to northeast) across the Swiss cantons of Basel-Landschaft, Aargau, and Schaffhausen (Randen), and the southern German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria (as Klettgau Jura, Baar Jura, and the Swabian and Franconian plateaus).
===Geology===

The range is built up vertically while decreasing in size laterally (along a rough northwest–southeast line). This deformation accommodates the compression from alpine folding as the main Alpine orogenic front moves roughly northwards. The deformation becomes less pervasive away from the younger, more active Alpine mountain building.

The geologic folds comprise three major bands (lithological units) of building that date from three epochs: the Lias (Early Jurassic), the Dogger (Middle Jurassic) and the Malm (Late Jurassic) geologic periods. Each era of folding reveals effects of previously shallow marine environments as evidenced by beds with carbonate sequences, containing abundant bioclasts and oolitic divisions between layers (called horizons).

Structurally, the Jura consists of a sequence of geologic folds, the formation of which is facilitated by an evaporitic decollement layer. The box folds are still relatively young, which is evident by the general shape of the landscape showing that they have not existed long enough to experience erosion, thus revealing recent mountain building.

=== Main peaks ===
==Tourism==
The Jura range offer a variety of tourist activities including hiking, cycling, downhill skiing and cross-country skiing. There are many signposted trails including the Jura ridgeway, a hiking route. Several peaks feature observation towers (e.g. Faux d&#x27;Enson, Hage).

Tourist attractions in the Swiss Jura include natural features such as the Creux du Van, lookout peaks such as the Chasseral, caves such as the Grottes de Vallorbe, as well as gorges such as Taubenloch. The Swiss Jura has been industrialized since the 18th century and became a major centre of the watchmaking industry. The area has several cities at very high altitudes, such as La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle and Sainte-Croix (renowned for its musical boxes); however, it generally has had a marked decline in population since 1960. Both Le Locle and its geographical twin town La Chaux-de-Fonds are recognised as an UNESCO World Heritage Site for their horological and related cultural past.

In the French Jura, the 11th-century Fort de Joux, famously remodeled and strengthened by Vauban in 1690 and subsequently by other military engineers, is situated on a natural rock outcropping in the middle of the range not far from Pontarlier. Part of the A40 autoroute crosses through a portion of the southern Jura between Bourg-en-Bresse and Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, which is known as the &quot;Highway of the Titans&quot;.

<doc id="185844" wikidata="Q415026" url="?curid=185844" title="Benzatropine">
<text>Benzatropine (INN), known as benztropine in the United States and Japan, is a medication used to treat movement disorders like parkinsonism and dystonia, as well as extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, including akathisia. It is not useful for tardive dyskinesia. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein or muscle. Benefits are seen within two hours and last for up to ten hours.
Common side effects include dry mouth, blurry vision, nausea, and constipation. Serious side effect may include urinary retention, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and poor coordination. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. Benzatropine is an anticholinergic which works by blocking the activity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
Benzatropine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 229th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions. It is sold under the brand name Cogentin among others.

== Medical uses ==
Benzatropine is used to reduce extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic treatment. Benzatropine is also a second-line drug for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. It improves tremor, and may alleviate rigidity and bradykinesia. Benzatropine is also sometimes used for the treatment of dystonia, a rare disorder that causes abnormal muscle contraction, resulting in twisting postures of limbs, trunk, or face.

== Adverse effects ==
These are principally anticholinergic:

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Cognitive changes
* Drowsiness
* Constipation
* Urinary retention
* Tachycardia
* Anorexia
* Severe delirium and hallucinations (in overdose)

While some studies suggest that use of anticholinergics increases the risk of tardive dyskinesia (a long-term side effect of antipsychotics), other studies have found no association between anticholinergic exposure and risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, although symptoms may be worsened.

Drugs that decrease cholinergic transmission may impair storage of new information into long-term memory. Anticholinergic agents can also impair time perception.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
==== Antihistamine and anticholinergic activity ====
Benzatropine is a centrally acting anticholinergic and antihistamine. In terms of its anticholinergic activity, it is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts a selective muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M3 receptor antagonist. Benzatropine partially blocks cholinergic activity in the basal ganglia. Animal studies have indicated that anticholinergic activity of benzatropine is approximately one-half that of atropine, while its antihistamine activity approaches that of mepyramine. Its anticholinergic effects have been established as therapeutically significant in the management of Parkinsonism. Benzatropine antagonizes the effect of acetylcholine, decreasing the imbalance between the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and dopamine, which may improve the symptoms of early Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Benzatropine has been also identified, by a high throughput screening approach, as a potent differentiating agent for oligodendrocytes, possibly working through M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors. In preclinical models for multiple sclerosis, benzatropine decreased clinical symptoms and enhanced re-myelination.

==== Atypical dopamine reuptake inhibition ====
In addition to its anticholinergic activity, benztropine has been found to increase the availability of dopamine by blocking its reuptake and storage in central sites, and as a result, increasing dopaminergic activity. Benzatropine and analogues are atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitors, which might make them useful for people with akathisia secondary to antipsychotic therapy.

==== Other actions ====
Benzatropine also acts as a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA).

==Other animals==
In veterinary medicine, benzatropine is used to treat priapism in stallions.

==Naming==
Since 1959, benzatropine is the official international nonproprietary name of the medication under the INN scheme, the medication naming system coordinated by the World Health Organization; it is also the British Approved Name (BAN) given in the British Pharmacopoeia, and has been the official nonproprietary name in Australia since 2015. Regional variations of the &quot;a&quot; spelling are also used in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, as well as Latin (all medications are assigned a Latin name by WHO).

&quot;Benztropine&quot; is the official United States Adopted Name (USAN), the medication naming system coordinated by the USAN Council, co-sponsored by the American Medical Association (AMA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA). It is also the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN) and was used in Australia until 2015, when it was harmonized with the INN.

Both names may be modified to account for the methanesulfonate salt as which the medication is formulated: the modified INN (INNm) and BAN (BANM) is &quot;benzatropine mesilate&quot;, while the modified USAN is &quot;benztropine mesylate&quot;. The modified JAN is a hybrid form, &quot;benztropine mesilate&quot;.

The misspelling benzotropine is also occasionally seen in the literature.

<text>Propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally.
Common side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking β-adrenergic receptors.
Propranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including:

===Cardiovascular===
* Hypertension
* Angina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina)
* Myocardial infarction
* Tachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy
* Portal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure
* Prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites
* Anxiety
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

While once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes.

Propranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study.

===Psychiatric===
Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas:

* Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias
* Aggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries
* Treating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia

====PTSD and phobias====
Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia. It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia.

Ethical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a &quot;memory damper&quot;, including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are &quot;based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose&quot;.

===Other uses===
* Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient
* Migraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache
* Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
* Infantile hemangioma
* Glaucoma
* Thyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition

Propranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy.

==Contraindications==

Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with:

* Reversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Slow heart rate (bradycardia) (&lt;60 beats/minute)
* Sick sinus syndrome
* Atrioventricular block (second- or third-degree)
* Shock
* Severe low blood pressure

==Adverse effects==
Propranolol should be used with caution in people with:

* Diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked
* Peripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated
* Phaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy
* Myasthenia gravis, which may be worsened
* Other drugs with bradycardic effects

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. β-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate.

Most β-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy &quot;generally compatible with breastfeeding.&quot;

==Overdose==
In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA.

== Interactions ==

Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with:

* Verapamil
* Epinephrine (adrenaline)
* β2-adrenergic receptor agonists
** Salbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others
* Clonidine
* Ergot alkaloids
* Isoprenaline (isoproterenol)
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
* Quinidine
* Cimetidine
* Lidocaine
* Phenobarbital
* Rifampicin
* Fluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol)

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood–brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose). Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity.

In addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks β-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in α-adrenoceptor activation, with the α1-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect α1-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent β-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses.

Both enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol&#x27;s ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects.

===Mechanism of action===
Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to β1 or β2 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β1 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to β2 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1–3 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2–7.5 hours) than the parent compound (3–4 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine.

Propranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L.

==History==
Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension.

Newer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension.

==Society and culture==
In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10–16% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals.

===Brand names===
Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. &quot;Inderal&quot; is a quasi-anagram of &quot;Alderlin&quot;, the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. 

Propranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma.

<text>Hans Albrecht Bethe (; ; July 2, 1906 – March 6, 2005) was a German-American physicist who made major contributions to nuclear physics, astrophysics, quantum electrodynamics and solid-state physics, and received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967 for his work on the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. For most of his career, Bethe was a professor at Cornell University.

In 1939, Bethe published a paper which established the CNO cycle as the primary energy source for heavier stars in the main sequence classification of stars, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 1967. During World War II, Bethe was head of the Theoretical Division at the secret Los Alamos National Laboratory that developed the first atomic bombs. There he played a key role in calculating the critical mass of the weapons and developing the theory behind the implosion method used in both the Trinity test and the &quot;Fat Man&quot; weapon dropped on Nagasaki in August 1945.

After the war, Bethe played an important role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, as he also served as the head of the theoretical division for the project, although he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. He later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I). In 1947, he wrote an important paper which provided the calculation of the Lamb shift, which is credited with revolutionizing quantum electrodynamics and further &quot;opened the way to the modern era of particle physics&quot;. He contributed to the understanding of neutrinos and was key in the solving of the solar neutrino problem. He contributed to the understanding of supernovas and their processes.

His scientific research never ceased, and he was publishing papers well into his nineties, making him one of the few scientists to have published at least one major paper in his field during every decade of his career, which in Bethe&#x27;s case spanned nearly seventy years. Physicist Freeman Dyson, once his doctoral student, called him &quot;the supreme problem-solver of the 20th century&quot;, and cosmologist Edward Kolb called him &quot;the last of the old masters&quot; of physics.

== Early life ==

Bethe was born in Strasbourg, which at the time was part of the Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen, Germany, on July 2, 1906, the only child of Anna (née Kuhn) and Albrecht Bethe, a of physiology at the University of Strasbourg. Although his mother, the daughter of Abraham Kuhn, professor at the University of Strasbourg, had a Jewish background, Bethe was raised Protestant, like his father; and he became an atheist later in life.
His father accepted a position as professor and director of the Institute of Physiology at the University of Kiel in 1912, and the family moved into the director&#x27;s apartment at the institute. Initially, he was schooled privately by a professional teacher as part of a group of eight girls and boys. The family moved again in 1915 when his father became the head of the new Institute of Physiology at the Goethe University Frankfurt.

Bethe attended the in Frankfurt, Germany. His education was interrupted in 1916, when he contracted tuberculosis, and he was sent to Bad Kreuznach to recuperate. By 1917, he had recovered sufficiently to attend the local and the following year, he was sent to the , a private, coeducational boarding school. He attended the again for his final three years of secondary schooling, from 1922 to 1924.

Having passed his , Bethe entered the University of Frankfurt in 1924. He decided to major in chemistry. The instruction in physics was poor, and while there were distinguished mathematicians in Frankfurt such as Carl Ludwig Siegel and Otto Szász, Bethe disliked their approaches, which presented mathematics without reference to the other sciences. Bethe found that he was a poor experimentalist who destroyed his lab coat by spilling sulfuric acid on it, but he found the advanced physics taught by the associate professor, Walter Gerlach, more interesting. Gerlach left in 1925 and was replaced by Karl Meissner, who advised Bethe that he should go to a university with a better school of theoretical physics, specifically the University of Munich, where he could study under Arnold Sommerfeld.

Bethe entered the University of Munich in April 1926, where Sommerfeld took him on as a student on Meissner&#x27;s recommendation. Sommerfeld taught an advanced course on differential equations in physics, which Bethe enjoyed. Because he was such a renowned scholar, Sommerfeld frequently received advance copies of scientific papers, which he put up for discussion at weekly evening seminars. When Bethe arrived, Sommerfeld had just received Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s papers on wave mechanics.

For his PhD thesis, Sommerfeld suggested that Bethe examine electron diffraction in crystals. As a starting point, Sommerfeld suggested Paul Ewald&#x27;s 1914 paper on X-ray diffraction in crystals. Bethe later recalled that he became too ambitious, and, in pursuit of greater accuracy, his calculations became unnecessarily complicated. When he met Wolfgang Pauli for the first time, Pauli told him: &quot;After Sommerfeld&#x27;s tales about you, I had expected much better from you than your thesis.&quot; &quot;I guess from Pauli,&quot; Bethe later recalled, &quot;that was a compliment.&quot;

== Early work ==
After Bethe received his doctorate, Erwin Madelung offered him an assistantship in Frankfurt, and in September 1928 Bethe moved in with his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father had met Vera Congehl earlier that year and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934.

Bethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, &quot;Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie&quot; (&quot;The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter&quot;). Starting from Max Born&#x27;s interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula. He submitted this paper for his &quot;habilitation&quot; in 1930.

Sommerfeld recommended Bethe for a Rockefeller Foundation Travelling Scholarship in 1929. This provided $150 a month (about $,000 in 2024 dollars) to study abroad. In 1930, Bethe chose to do postdoctoral work at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he worked under the supervision of Ralph Fowler. At the request of Patrick Blackett, who was working with cloud chambers, Bethe created a relativistic version of the Bethe formula.

Bethe was known for his sense of humor, and with Guido Beck and , two other postdoctoral research fellows, created a hoax paper &quot;On the Quantum Theory of the Temperature of Absolute Zero&quot; where he calculated the fine structure constant from the absolute zero temperature in Celsius units. The paper poked fun at a certain class of papers in theoretical physics of the day, which were purely speculative and based on spurious numerical arguments, such as Arthur Eddington&#x27;s attempts to explain the value of the fine structure constant from fundamental quantities in an earlier paper. They were forced to issue an apology.

For the second half of his scholarship, Bethe chose to go to Enrico Fermi&#x27;s laboratory in Rome in February 1931. He was greatly impressed by Fermi and regretted that he had not gone to Rome first. Bethe developed the Bethe ansatz, a method for finding the exact solutions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of certain one-dimensional quantum many-body models. He was influenced by Fermi&#x27;s simplicity and Sommerfeld&#x27;s rigor in approaching problems and these qualities influenced his own later research.

The Rockefeller Foundation offered an extension of Bethe&#x27;s fellowship, allowing him to return to Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a &quot;privatdozent&quot;. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the &quot;Handbuch der Physik&quot; on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that it was unusual in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject that required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the &quot;handbuch&quot; article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent, and complete coverage of it. His work on the &quot;handbuch&quot; articles occupied most of his time in Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.

In 1932, Bethe accepted an appointment as an assistant professor at the University of Tübingen, where Hans Geiger was the professor of experimental physics. One of the first laws passed by the new Nazi government was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. Due to his Jewish background, Bethe was dismissed from his job at the university, which was a government post. Geiger refused to help, but Sommerfeld immediately gave Bethe back his fellowship at Munich. Sommerfeld spent much of the summer term of 1933 finding places for Jewish students and colleagues.

Bethe left Germany in 1933, moving to England after receiving an offer for a position as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld&#x27;s connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls&#x27; wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because he was Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German and he did not have to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe&#x27;s interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls to come up with a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.

In 1933, the physics department at Cornell University, New York, was looking for a new theoretical physicist, and Lloyd Smith strongly recommended Bethe. This was supported by Bragg, who was visiting Cornell at the time. In August 1934, Cornell offered Bethe a position as an acting assistant professor. Bethe had already accepted a fellowship for a year to work with Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol for a semester, but Cornell agreed to let him start in the spring of 1935. Before leaving for the United States, he visited the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen in September 1934, where he proposed to Hilde Levi, who accepted. The match was opposed by Bethe&#x27;s mother, who despite having a Jewish background, did not want him to marry a Jewish woman. A few days before their wedding date in December, Bethe broke off their engagement. Niels Bohr and James Franck were so shocked by this action by Bethe that he was not invited to the institute again until after World War II.

== United States ==
Bethe arrived in the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000. Bethe&#x27;s appointment was part of a deliberate effort on the part of the new head of its physics department, Roswell Clifton Gibbs, to move into nuclear physics. Gibbs had hired Stanley Livingston, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence, to build a cyclotron at Cornell. To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited Robert Bacher. Bethe received requests to visit Columbia University from Isidor Isaac Rabi, Princeton University from Edward Condon, University of Rochester from Lee DuBridge, Purdue University from Karl Lark-Horovitz, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from Francis Wheeler Loomis, and Harvard University from John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow.

Together with Bacher and Livingston, Bethe published a series of three articles, which summarized most of what was known on the subject of nuclear physics until that time, an account that became known informally as &quot;Bethe&#x27;s Bible&quot;. It remained the standard work on the subject for many years. In this account, he also continued where others left off, filling in gaps in the older literature. Loomis offered Bethe a full professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, but Cornell matched the position offered, and the salary of $6,000. He wrote to his mother:


On March 17, 1938, Bethe attended the Carnegie Institute and George Washington University&#x27;s fourth annual Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics. There were only 34 invited attendees, but they included Gregory Breit, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, George Gamow, Donald Menzel, John von Neumann, Bengt Strömgren, Edward Teller, and Merle Tuve. Bethe initially declined the invitation to attend, because the conference&#x27;s topic, stellar energy generation, did not interest him, but Teller persuaded him to go. At the conference, Strömgren detailed what was known about the temperature, density, and chemical composition of the Sun, and challenged the physicists to come up with an explanation. Gamow and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker had proposed in a 1937 paper that the Sun&#x27;s energy was the result of a proton–proton chain reaction:
But this did not account for the observation of elements heavier than helium. By the end of the conference, Bethe, working in collaboration with Charles Critchfield, had come up with a series of subsequent nuclear reactions that explained how the Sun shines:

That this did not explain the processes in heavier stars was not overlooked. At the time there were doubts about whether the proton–proton cycle described the processes in the Sun, but more recent measurements of the Sun&#x27;s core temperature and luminosity show that it does. When he returned to Cornell, Bethe studied the relevant nuclear reactions and reaction cross sections, leading to his discovery of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle (CNO cycle):

The two papers, one on the proton–proton cycle, co-authored with Critchfield, and the other on the carbon-oxygen-nitrogen (CNO) cycle, were sent to the &quot;Physical Review&quot; for publication.

After &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, Bethe&#x27;s mother had become afraid to remain in Germany. Taking advantage of her Strasbourg origin, she was able to emigrate to the United States in June 1939 on the French quota, rather than the German one, which was full. Bethe&#x27;s graduate student Robert Marshak noted that the New York Academy of Sciences was offering a $500 prize for the best unpublished paper on the topic of solar and stellar energy. So Bethe, in need of $250 to release his mother&#x27;s furniture, withdrew the CNO cycle paper and sent it in to the New York Academy of Sciences. It won the prize, and Bethe gave Marshak $50 finder&#x27;s fee and used $250 to release his mother&#x27;s furniture. The paper was subsequently published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in March. It was a breakthrough in the understanding of the stars, and would win Bethe the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. In 2002, at age 96, Bethe sent a handwritten note to John N. Bahcall congratulating him on the use of solar neutrino observations to show that the CNO cycle accounts for approximately 7% of the Sun&#x27;s energy; the neutrino observations had started with Raymond Davis Jr., whose experiment was based on Bahcall&#x27;s calculations and encouragement, and the note led to Davis&#x27;s receiving a share of the 2002 Nobel Prize.

Bethe married Rose Ewald, the daughter of Paul Ewald, on September 13, 1939, in a simple civil ceremony. She had emigrated to the United States and was a student at Duke University and they met while Bethe was lecturing there in 1937. They had two children, Henry and Monica. (Henry was a contract bridge expert and former husband of Kitty Munson Cooper.)

Bethe became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1941. Writing to Sommerfeld in 1947, Bethe confided that &quot;I am much more at home in America than I ever was in Germany. As if I was born in Germany only by mistake, and only came to my true homeland at 28.&quot;

== Manhattan Project ==

When the Second World War began, Bethe wanted to contribute to the war effort, but was unable to work on classified projects until he became a citizen. Following the advice of the Caltech aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, Bethe collaborated with his friend Edward Teller on a theory of shock waves that are generated by the passage of a projectile through a gas. Bethe considered it one of their most influential papers. He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the army, thus making it impossible for Bethe (who was not an American citizen at the time) to access further research on the theory.

After receiving security clearance in December 1941, Bethe joined the MIT Radiation Laboratory, where he invented the Bethe-hole directional coupler, which is used in microwave waveguides such as those used in radar sets. In Chicago in June 1942, and then in July at the University of California, Berkeley, he participated in a series of meetings at the invitation of Robert Oppenheimer, which discussed the first designs for the atomic bomb. They went over the preliminary calculations by Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and others, and discussed the possibilities of using uranium-235 and plutonium. (Teller then raised the prospect of a thermonuclear device, Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; bomb. At one point Teller asked if the nitrogen in the atmosphere could be set alight. It fell to Bethe and Emil Konopinski to perform the calculations demonstrating the virtual impossibility of such an occurrence.) &quot;The fission bomb had to be done,&quot; he later recalled, &quot;because the Germans were presumably doing it.&quot;

When Oppenheimer was put in charge of forming a secret weapons design laboratory, Los Alamos, he appointed Bethe director of the T (Theoretical) Division, the laboratory&#x27;s smallest, but most prestigious division. This move irked the equally qualified, but more difficult to manage Teller and Felix Bloch, who had coveted the job. A series of disagreements between Bethe and Teller between February and June 1944 over the relative priority of Super research led to Teller&#x27;s group being removed from T Division and placed directly under Oppenheimer. In September it became part of Fermi&#x27;s new F Division.

Bethe&#x27;s work at Los Alamos included calculating the critical mass and efficiency of uranium-235 and the multiplication of nuclear fission in an exploding atomic bomb. Along with Richard Feynman, he developed a formula for calculating the bomb&#x27;s explosive yield. After August 1944, when the laboratory was reorganized and reoriented to solve the problem of the implosion of the plutonium bomb, Bethe spent much of his time studying the hydrodynamic aspects of implosion, a job that he continued into 1944. In 1945, he worked on the neutron initiator, and later, on radiation propagation from an exploding atomic bomb. The Trinity nuclear test validated the accuracy of T Division&#x27;s results. When it was detonated in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Bethe&#x27;s immediate concern was for its efficient operation, and not its moral implications. He is reported to have commented: &quot;I am not a philosopher.&quot;

== Hydrogen bomb ==
After the war, Bethe argued that a crash project for the hydrogen bomb should not be attempted, although after President Harry Truman announced the beginning of such a project and the outbreak of the Korean War, Bethe signed up and played a key role in the weapon&#x27;s development. Although he saw the project through to its end, Bethe had hoped that it would be impossible to create the hydrogen bomb. He later remarked in 1968 on the apparent contradiction in his stance, having first opposed the development of the weapon and later helping to create it:

As for his own role in the project and its relation to the dispute over who was responsible for the design, Bethe later said that:

In 1954, Bethe testified on behalf of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer security hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer&#x27;s stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its development, a topic which was seen as a key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments that led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried hard to persuade Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony played a major role in the revocation of Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.

== Later work ==

=== Lamb shift ===

After the war ended, Bethe returned to Cornell. In June 1947, he participated in the Shelter Island Conference. Sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and held at the Ram&#x27;s Head Inn on Shelter Island, New York, the conference on the &quot;Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot; was the first major physics conference held after the war. It was a chance for American physicists to come together, pick up where they had left off before the war, and establish the direction of post-war research.

A major talking point at the conference was the discovery by Willis Lamb and his graduate student, Robert Retherford, shortly before the conference began that one of the two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than that predicted by the theory of Paul Dirac; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, which gave the electron more energy. According to pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED), the energy of the electron consisted of the bare energy it had when uncoupled from an electromagnetic field, and the self-energy resulting from the electromagnetic coupling, but both were unobservable, since the electromagnetic field cannot be switched off. QED gave infinite values for the self-energies; but the Lamb shift showed that they were both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.

Bethe managed to perform the calculation on the train from New York to Schenectady, where he was working for General Electric. He did so by realising that it was a non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculation. The bare energy was easily removed as it was already included in the observed mass of the electron. The self energy term now increased logarithmically instead of linearly, making it mathematically convergent. Bethe arrived at a value for the Lamb shift of 1040 MHz, extremely close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. His paper, published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; in August 1947, was only three pages long and contained just twelve mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. It had been presumed that the infinities indicated that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required; Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary. 

His calculation of the Lamb shift has been called &quot;the most important discovery in the history of the theory of quantum electrodynamics&quot; by the physicist Richard Feynman, while physicist Paul Dirac called it &quot;the most important calculation in physics for decades&quot;.

One of Bethe&#x27;s most famous papers is one he never wrote: the 1948 Alpher–Bethe–Gamow paper. George Gamow added Bethe&#x27;s name (in absentia) without consulting him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against Ralph Alpher&#x27;s wishes. This was apparently a reflection of Gamow&#x27;s sense of humor, wanting to have a paper title that would sound like the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. As one of the &quot;Physical Review&quot;″s reviewers, Bethe saw the manuscript and struck out the words &quot;in absentia&quot;.

=== Astrophysics ===
Bethe believed that the atomic nucleus was like a quantum liquid drop. He investigated the nuclear matter problem by considering the work conducted by Keith Brueckner on perturbation theory. Working with Jeffrey Goldstone, he produced a solution for the case where there was an infinite hard-core potential. Then, working with Baird Brandow and Albert Petschek, he came up with an approximation that converted the scattering equation into an easily solved differential equation. This then led him to the Bethe-Faddeev equation, a generalisation of Ludvig Faddeev&#x27;s approach to three-body scattering. He then used these techniques to examine the neutron stars, which have densities similar to those of nuclei.

Bethe continued to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, and the way in which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and to solve them.

At age 85, Bethe wrote an important article about the solar neutrino problem, in which he helped establish the conversion mechanism for electron neutrinos into muon neutrinos proposed by Stanislav Mikheyev, Alexei Smirnov, and Lincoln Wolfenstein to explain a vexing discrepancy between theory and experiment. Bethe argued that physics beyond the Standard Model was required to understand the solar neutrino problem, because it presumed that neutrinos have no mass, and therefore, cannot metamorphosize into each other; whereas the MSW effect required this to occur. Bethe hoped that corroborating evidence would be found by the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Ontario by his 90th birthday, but he did not get the call from SNO until June 2001, when he was nearly 95.

In 1996, Kip Thorne approached Bethe and Brown about LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory designed to detect the gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes. Since Bethe and Brown were good at calculating things that could not be seen, could they look at the mergers? The 90-year-old Bethe quickly became enthused and soon began the required calculations. The result was a 1998 paper on the &quot;Evolution of Binary Compact Objects Which Merge&quot;, which Brown regarded as the best that the two produced together.

== Political stances ==

In 1968, Bethe, along with IBM physicist Richard Garwin, published an article criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the United States would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe was one of the primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Bethe campaigned for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. After the Chernobyl disaster, Bethe was part of a committee of experts who analysed the incident. They concluded that the reactor suffered from a fundamentally faulty design and also that human error had contributed significantly to the accident. &quot;My colleagues and I established,&quot; he explained &quot;that the Chernobyl disaster tells us about the deficiencies of the Soviet political and administrative system rather than about problems with nuclear power.&quot; Throughout his life Bethe remained a strong advocate for electricity from nuclear energy, which he described in 1977 as &quot;a necessity, not merely an option.&quot;

In the 1980s he and other physicists opposed the Strategic Defense Initiative missile system conceived by the Ronald Reagan administration. In 1995, at the age of 88, Bethe wrote an open letter calling on all scientists to &quot;cease and desist&quot; from working on any aspect of nuclear weapons development and manufacture. In 2004, he joined 47 other Nobel laureates in signing a letter endorsing John Kerry for President of the United States as someone who would &quot;restore science to its appropriate place in government&quot;.

Historian Gregg Herken wrote:
== Personal life ==

Bethe&#x27;s hobbies included a passion for stamp-collecting. He loved the outdoors and was an enthusiastic hiker all his life, exploring the Alps and the Rockies. He died in his home in Ithaca, New York, on March 6, 2005, of congestive heart failure. He was survived by his wife, Rose Ewald Bethe, and their two children. At the time of his death, he was the John Wendell Anderson Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at Cornell University.

== Honors and awards ==
Bethe received numerous honors and awards in his lifetime and afterward. He became a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947, and that year, he also received the National Academy of Sciences&#x27;s Henry Draper Medal and was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was awarded the Max Planck Medal in 1955, the Franklin Medal in 1959, the Royal Astronomical Society Eddington Medal and the United States Atomic Energy Commission Enrico Fermi Award in 1961, the Rumford Prize in 1963, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967, the National Medal of Science in 1975, the Oersted Medal in 1993, the Bruce Medal in 2001, and posthumously in 2005, the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences by the American Philosophical Society.

Bethe was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1957, and he gave the 1993 Bakerian Lecture at the Royal Society on the Mechanism of Supernovae.
In 1978 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

Cornell named the third of five new residential colleges, each of which is named after a distinguished former member of the Cornell faculty, as the Hans Bethe House after him. Similarly named after him is the Hans Bethe Center, 322 Fourth Street NE, Washington, D.C., home to the Council for a Livable World, where Bethe was a longtime board member, as well as the Bethe Center for Theoretical Physics at University of Bonn in Germany. An asteroid, 30828 Bethe, that was discovered in 1990 was named after him. The American Physical Society Hans Bethe Prize was named after him as well.

<text>KNX is an open standard (see EN 50090, ISO/IEC 14543) for commercial and residential building automation. KNX devices can manage lighting, blinds and shutters, HVAC, security systems, energy management, audio video, domestic appliances, displays, remote control, etc. KNX evolved from three earlier standards; the European Home Systems Protocol (EHS), BatiBUS, and the European Installation Bus (EIB or Instabus).

It can use twisted pair (in a tree, line or star topology), powerline, RF, or IP links. On this network, the devices form distributed applications and tight interaction is possible. This is implemented via interworking models with standardised datapoint types and objects, modelling logical device channels.

== Standard ==
The KNX standard has been built on the OSI-based EIB communication stack extended with the physical layers, configuration modes and application experience of BatiBUS and EHS.

KNX installations can use several physical communication media:

* Twisted pair wiring (TP1 Cable) (inherited from the EIB standard). (The previously inherited BatiBUS communication medium (TP0) is no longer part of the KNX Specifications.) 
*Power-line networking (inherited from EIB standard). (The previously inherited EHS communication medium (PL132) is no longer part of the KNX Specifications.)
* Radio (KNX-RF) 
* IP (also referred to as EIBnet/IP or KNXnet/IP)

KNX is not based on a specific hardware platform and a network can be controlled by anything from an 8-bit microcontroller to a PC, according to the demands of a particular building. The most common form of installation is over twisted pair medium.

KNX is an approved standard by the following organisations, (inter alia):

* International standard (ISO/IEC 14543-3)
* European standard (CENELEC EN 50090 and CEN EN 13321–1)
*US standard (ANSI/ASHRAE 135)
* China Guobiao (GB/T 20965)

It is administered by the KNX Association cvba, a non-profit organisation governed by Belgian law which was formed in 1999. The KNX Association had 500 registered hardware and software vendor members from 45 nations as at 1 July 2021. It had partnership agreements with 100,000 installer companies in 172 countries and more than 500 registered training centres. This is a royalty-free open standard and thus access to the KNX specifications is unrestricted.

== Architecture ==
KNX devices are commonly connected by a twisted pair bus and can be modified from a controller. The bus is routed in parallel to the electrical power supply to all devices and systems on the network linking:

* Sensors (e.g. push buttons, thermostats, anemometers, movement) gather information and send it on the bus as a data telegram;
* Actuators (dimming units, heating valves, displays) receive data telegrams which are then converted into actions; and
*Controllers and other logic functions (room temperature controllers, shutter controllers and other)
* System devices and components (e.g. line couplers, backbone couplers).

Classifying devices as either &quot;sensor&quot; or &quot;actuator&quot; is outdated and simplistic. Many actuators include controller functionality, but also sensor functionality (for instance measuring operating hours, number of switch cycles, current, electrical power consumption, and more).

Application software, together with system topology and commissioning software, is loaded onto the devices via a system interface component. Installed systems can be accessed via LAN, point to point links, or phone networks for central or distributed control of the system via computers, tablets and touch screens, and smartphones.

The key features of the KNX architecture are:

* Interworking and distributed application models for the building automation various tasks;
* Schemes for configuration and management of resources on the network, and to permit the binding of parts of a distributed application in different nodes;
* A communication system with a message protocol and models for the communication stack in each node (capable of hosting distributed applications (KNX Common Kernel); and
*Models for the realization of these elements when developing actual devices to be mounted and linked in an installation.

== Applications, interworking and binding ==
Central to the KNX architecture concepts are datapoints (inputs, outputs, parameters, and diagnostic data) which represent process and control variables in the system. The standardised containers for these datapoints are group objects and interface object properties. The communication system offers a reduced instruction set to read and write datapoint values. Datapoints have to conform to standardised datapoint types, themselves grouped into functional blocks. These functional blocks and datapoint types are related to applications fields, but some of them are of general use (such as date and time). Datapoints may be accessed through unicast or multicast mechanisms.

To logically link applications&#x27; datapoints across the network, KNX has three underlying binding schemes: one for free, one for structured and one for tagged binding:

* In &quot;free binding,&quot; links between datapoints are not prescribed - in combination with free addressing, this supports customized multicast grouping at the level of individual datapoints and is central to S-mode configuration (see below);
* In &quot;structured binding,&quot; the KNX specification stipulates a precise pattern for linking a whole set of datapoints, usually corresponding to a Functional Block or Channel (push-button modes follow this concept);
* &quot;Tagged binding&quot; is also pre-structured by the application models, but the numerical value of address is part of its value.

== Kernel and message protocol ==
The common kernel sits on top of the physical layers and the medium-specific data link layer and is shared by all the devices on the KNX Network. It is OSI 7-layer model compliant:

* A general data link layer, which sits above the specific data link layers for each medium, provides access control and the logical link control;
* A network layer (for nodes with routing functionality) provides a segment-wise acknowledged telegram (frame) and controls the hop count of a frame;
* A transport layer enables four types of communication: one-to-many connectionless (multicast), one-to-all connectionless (broadcast), one-to-one connectionless, one-to-one connection-oriented;
* (OSI session and presentation layers are empty); and
* An application layer offers a toolkit of services to the application process.

== Configuration modes ==
An installation has to be configured at the network topology level and at individual nodes or devices. The first level is a precondition or “bootstrap” phase, prior to the configuration of the distributed applications, i.e. binding and parameter setting. Configuration may be achieved through a combination of local activity on the devices (such pushing a button), and active network management communication over the bus (peer-to-peer, or more centralized master-slave).

The KNX configuration mode:

* picks out a certain scheme for configuration and binding;
* maps it to a particular choice of address scheme; and
* completes all this with a choice of management procedures and matching resource realizations.

Some modes require more active management over the bus, whereas some others are mainly oriented towards local configuration. There are three categories of KNX devices:

*A-mode or &quot;Automatic mode&quot; devices which can configure themselves, and are able to be installed by the end user;
*E-mode or &quot;Easy mode&quot; devices that require basic training to install: their behaviour is pre-programmed, but configuration parameters need to be tailored to the user&#x27;s requirements; or
*S-mode or &quot;System mode&quot; devices that can be used to create sophisticated building automation systems: they have no default behaviour, and must be programmed and installed by specialists.

KNX encompasses tools for project engineering tasks such as linking a series of individual devices into a functioning installation and integrating different media and configuration modes. This is embodied in an &quot;Engineering Tool Software&quot; (ETS) suite.

== Devices ==
A KNX installation always consists of a set of devices connected to the bus or network. Device models vary according to node roles, capabilities, management features and configuration modes, and are all laid down in the profiles. There are also general-purpose device models, such as for bus coupling units (BCUs) or bus interface modules (BIMs).

Devices may be identified and subsequently accessed throughout the network either by their individual address, or by their unique serial number, depending on the configuration mode. (Unique serial numbers are allocated by the KNX Association Certification Department.) Devices can also disclose both a manufacturer specific reference and functional (manufacturer independent) information when queried.

== Topology and addressing ==
A KNX wired network can be formed with tree, line and star topologies, which can be mixed as needed; ring topologies are &quot;not&quot; supported. A tree topology is recommended for a large installation.

KNX can link up to 57,375 devices using 16-bit addresses.

* The lowest eight bits provide up to 256 addresses within one line, which can consist of up to four segments, each having a maximum of 64 (TP1-64) devices, or up to 256 (TP1-256) devices. Each segment requires a local power supply and the maximum length of a segment is 1000 m. (The actual number of devices supported is dependent on the power supply and the power load of the individual devices.) Segments connected with line repeaters can extend to a length of 4000 m and link up to 256 devices.
* Lines may be grouped together into an area, with up to 15 lines connected to a main line via line couplers. The next four bits of the address are used to identify individual lines.
* An entire domain can be formed with 15 areas linked by a backbone line using backbone couplers, and the top four bits of the address space identify an area. (Line repeaters may not be used on a backbone or mainline.)

Coupling units allow address filtering which helps to improve performance given the limited bus signal speed. An installation based on KNXnet/IP allows the integration of KNX sub networks via IP as the KNX address structure is similar to an IP address.

==Physical layer==
=== TP 1 ===
The TP1 twisted pair bus (inherited from EIB) provides asynchronous, character oriented data transfer and half-duplex bidirectional differential signaling with a signaling speed of 9600 bit/s. Media access control is via CSMA/CA. Every bus user has equal data transmission rights and data is exchanged directly (peer-to-peer) between bus users. SELV power is distributed via the same pair for low-power devices. A deprecated specification, TP0, running at a slower signalling speed of , has been retained from the BatiBUS standard but KNX products cannot exchange information with BatiBUS devices.

=== PL 110 ===
PL 110 power-line transmission is delivered using spread frequency shift keying signalling with asynchronous transmission of data packets and half duplex bi-directional communication. It uses the central frequency 110 kHz (CENELEC B-band) and has a data rate of 1200 bit/s. It also uses CSMA. KNX Powerline is aimed at smart white goods, but the take-up has been low. An alternative variant, PL 132, has a carrier frequency centred on 132.5 kHz (CENELEC C-band).

=== RF ===
RF enables communication in the 868.3 MHz band for using frequency shift keying with Manchester data encoding.

=== IP ===
KNXnet/IP port 3671 has integration solutions for IP-enabled media like Ethernet (IEEE 802.2), Bluetooth, WiFi/Wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11), FireWire (IEEE 1394) etc.

==Frame format==
Ignoring any preamble for medium-specific access and collision control, a frame format is generally:
==Security==
KNX Telegrams can be signed or encrypted thanks to the extension of the protocol that was developed starting in 2013, KNX Data Secure for securing telegrams on the traditional KNX media TP and RF and KNX IP Secure for securing KNX telegrams tunnelled via IP. KNX Data Secure became an EN standard (EN 50090-3-4) in 2018, KNX IP Secure an ISO standard (ISO 22510) in 2019.

==Conformity==
Any product labeled with the KNX trademark must be certified to conform with the standards (and thus interoperable with other devices) by accredited third party test labs. All products bearing the KNX logo are programmed through a common interface using the vendor-independent ETS software.

<text>Slaughterhouse-Five, or, The Children&#x27;s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death is a 1969 semi-autobiographic science fiction-infused anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut. It follows the life experiences of Billy Pilgrim, from his early years, to his time as an American soldier and chaplain&#x27;s assistant during World War II, to the post-war years. Throughout the novel, Billy frequently travels back and forth through time. The protagonist deals with a temporal crisis as a result of his post-war psychological trauma. The text centers on Billy&#x27;s capture by the German Army and his survival of the Allied firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war, an experience that Vonnegut endured as an American serviceman. The work has been called an example of &quot;unmatched moral clarity&quot; and &quot;one of the most enduring anti-war novels of all time&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel&#x27;s first chapter begins with &quot;All this happened, more or less&quot;; this introduction implies an unreliable narrator tells the story. Vonnegut utilizes a non-linear, non-chronological description of events to reflect Billy Pilgrim&#x27;s psychological state. Events become clear through flashbacks and descriptions of time travel experiences. In the first chapter, the narrator describes his writing of the book, his experiences as a University of Chicago anthropology student and a Chicago City News Bureau correspondent, his research on the Children&#x27;s Crusade and the history of Dresden, and his visit to Cold War–era Europe with his wartime friend Bernard V. O&#x27;Hare. In the second chapter, Vonnegut introduces Billy Pilgrim, an American man from the fictional town of Ilium, New York. Billy believes that an extraterrestrial species from the planet Tralfamadore held him captive in an alien zoo and that he has experienced time travel.

As a chaplain&#x27;s assistant in the United States Army during World War II, Billy is an ill-trained, disoriented and fatalistic American soldier who discovers that he does not like war and refuses to fight. He is transferred from a base in South Carolina to the front line in Luxembourg during the Battle of the Bulge. He narrowly escapes death as the result of a string of events. He also meets Roland Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and sadistic bully who derides Billy&#x27;s cowardice. The two of them are captured in 1944 by the Germans, who confiscate all of Weary&#x27;s belongings and force him to wear wooden clogs that cut painfully into his feet; the resulting wounds become gangrenous, which eventually kills him. While Weary is dying in a rail car full of prisoners, he convinces a fellow soldier, Paul Lazzaro, that Billy is to blame for his death. Lazzaro vows to avenge Weary&#x27;s death by killing Billy, because revenge is &quot;the sweetest thing in life.&quot;

At this exact time, Billy becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot;; Billy travels through time to moments from his past and future. The novel describes the transportation of Billy and the other prisoners into Germany. The German soldiers held their prisoners in the German city of Dresden; the prisoners had to work in &quot;contract labor&quot; (forced labor); these events occurred in 1945. The Germans detained Billy and his fellow prisoners in an empty slaughterhouse called &quot;Schlachthof-fünf&quot; (&quot;slaughterhouse five&quot;). During the Allied bombing of Dresden, German guards hid their captives in the partially underground setting of the slaughterhouse; this protected those captives from complete annihilation.  As a result, they are among the few survivors of the firestorm that raged in the city between February 13 and 15, 1945. After V-E Day in May 1945, Billy was transferred to the United States and received an honorable discharge in July 1945.

Billy is hospitalized with symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and placed under psychiatric care at a Veterans Affairs hospital in Lake Placid. During Billy&#x27;s stay at the hospital, Eliot Rosewater introduces him to the work of an obscure science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout. After his release, Billy marries Valencia Merble, whose father owns the Ilium School of Optometry that Billy later attends. Billy becomes a successful and wealthy optometrist. In 1947, Billy and Valencia conceive their first child, Robert, on their honeymoon in Cape Ann, Massachusetts. Two years later, their second child, Barbara, was born. On Barbara&#x27;s wedding night, Billy is abducted by a flying saucer and taken to a planet many light-years away from Earth called Tralfamadore. The Tralfamadorians have the power to see in four dimensions; they simultaneously observe all points in the space-time continuum. They universally adopt a fatalistic worldview: death means nothing to them, and their typical response to hearing about death is &quot;so it goes.&quot;

The Tralfamadorians transport Billy to Tralfamadore and place him inside a transparent geodesic dome exhibit in a zoo; the inside resembles a house on planet Earth. The Tralfamadorians later abduct a pornographic film star named Montana Wildhack, who had disappeared on Earth and supposedly drowned in San Pedro Bay. The Tralfamadorians intend to have her mate with Billy. Montana and Billy fall in love and have a child together. Billy is instantaneously sent back to Earth in a time warp to re-live past or future moments of his life. 

In 1968, Billy and a co-pilot are the only survivors of a plane crash in Vermont. While driving to visit Billy in the hospital, Valencia crashes her car and dies of carbon monoxide poisoning. Billy shares a hospital room with Bertram Rumfoord, a Harvard University history professor researching an official war history of the USAAF in World War II. They discuss the bombing of Dresden, which the professor initially refuses to believe Billy witnessed. Despite the significant loss of civilian life and the destruction of Dresden, they both regard the bombing as a justifiable act.

Billy&#x27;s daughter takes him home to Ilium. He escapes and flees to New York City. In Times Square he visits a pornographic book store, where he discovers books written by Kilgore Trout and reads them. He discovers a science fiction novel titled &quot;The Big Board&quot; at the bookstore&quot;.&quot; The novel is about a couple abducted by extraterrestrials. The aliens trick the abductees into thinking they are managing investments on Earth, which excites the humans and, in turn, sparks interest in the observers. He also finds some magazine covers that mention Montana Wildhack&#x27;s disappearance. While Billy surveys the bookstore, one of Montana&#x27;s pornographic films plays in the background. Later in the evening, when he discusses his time travels to Tralfamadore on a radio talk show, he is ejected from the studio. He returns to his hotel room, falls asleep, and time-travels back to 1945 in Dresden. Billy and his fellow prisoners are tasked with locating and burying the dead. After a Maori New Zealand soldier working with Billy dies of dry heaves the Germans begin cremating the bodies en masse with flamethrowers. German soldiers execute Billy&#x27;s friend Edgar Derby for stealing a teapot. Eventually all of the German soldiers leave to fight on the Eastern Front, leaving Billy and the other prisoners alone with tweeting birds as the war ends.

Through non-chronological storytelling, other parts of Billy&#x27;s life are told throughout the book. After Billy is evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy as a child and often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly anti-communist, enlists as a Green Beret and fights in the Vietnam War. Billy is eventually killed in 1976, at which point the United States has been partitioned into twenty separate countries and attacked by China with thermonuclear weapons. He gives a speech in a baseball stadium in Chicago in which he predicts his own death and proclaims that &quot;if you think death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I&#x27;ve said.&quot; Billy soon after is shot with a laser gun by an assassin commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.

==Characters==

* Narrator: Recurring as a minor character, the narrator seems anonymous while also clearly identifying himself as Kurt Vonnegut, when he says, &quot;That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.&quot; As noted above, as an American soldier during World War II, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at the Battle of the Bulge and transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners-of-war survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar of &quot;Schlachthof Fünf&quot; (&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;). The narrator begins the story by describing his connection to the firebombing of Dresden and his reasons for writing &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;.
* Billy Pilgrim: A fatalistic optometrist ensconced in a dull, safe marriage in Ilium, New York. During World War II, he was held as a prisoner-of-war in Dresden and survived the firebombing, experiences which had a lasting effect on his post-war life. His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he relives past and future events and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because he claims to have seen when, how and why he will die.
* Roland Weary: A weak man dreaming of grandeur and obsessed with gore and vengeance, who saves Billy several times (despite Billy&#x27;s protests) in hopes of attaining military glory. He coped with his unpopularity in his home city of Pittsburgh by befriending and then beating people less well-liked than him, and is obsessed with his father&#x27;s collection of torture equipment. Weary is also a bully who beats Billy and gets them both captured, leading to the loss of his winter uniforms and boots. Weary dies of gangrene on the train en route to the POW camp, and blames Billy in his dying words.
* Paul Lazzaro: Another POW. A sickly, ill-tempered car thief from Cicero, Illinois who takes Weary&#x27;s dying words as a revenge commission to kill Billy. He keeps a mental list of his enemies, claiming he can have anyone &quot;killed for a thousand dollars plus traveling expenses.&quot; Lazzaro eventually fulfills his promise to Weary and has Billy assassinated by a laser gun in 1976.
* Kilgore Trout: A failed science fiction writer whose hometown is also Ilium, New York, and who makes money by managing newspaper delivery boys. He has received only one fan letter (from Eliot Rosewater; see below). After Billy meets him in a back alley in Ilium, he invites Trout to his wedding anniversary celebration. There, Kilgore follows Billy, thinking the latter has seen through a &quot;time window.&quot; Kilgore Trout is also a main character in Vonnegut&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;.
* Edgar Derby: A middle-aged high school teacher who felt that he needed to participate in the war rather than just send off his students to fight. One of his sons is serving with the marines in the Pacific Theatre. Though relatively unimportant, Derby seems to be the only American before the bombing of Dresden to understand what war can do to people. During Campbell&#x27;s presentation he stands up and castigates him, defending American democracy and the alliance with the Soviet Union. German forces summarily execute him for looting after they catch him taking a teapot from catacombs after the bombing. The undamaged teapot is identical to one he has at home, and it is his astonishment at the find amongst the rubble, that gives him away to the guards. Vonnegut has said that this death is the climax of the book as a whole.
* Howard W. Campbell Jr.: An American-born Nazi. Before the war, he lived in Germany where he was a noted German-language playwright recruited by the Nazi Ministry of Propaganda. In an essay, he connects the misery of American poverty to the disheveled appearance and behavior of the American POWs. Edgar Derby confronts him when Campbell tries to recruit American POWs into the American Free Corps to fight the Communist Soviet Union on behalf of the Nazis. He appears wearing swastika-adorned cowboy hat and boots and with a red, white and blue Nazi armband. Campbell is the protagonist of Vonnegut&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;Mother Night&quot;.
* Valencia Merble: Billy&#x27;s wife and the mother of their children, Robert and Barbara. Billy is emotionally distant from her. She dies from carbon monoxide poisoning after an automobile accident en route to the hospital to see Billy after his airplane crash.
* Robert Pilgrim: Son of Billy and Valencia. A troubled, middle-class boy and disappointing son who becomes an alcoholic at age 16, drops out of high school, and is arrested for vandalizing a Catholic cemetery. He later so absorbs the anti-Communist worldview that he metamorphoses from suburban adolescent rebel to Green Beret sergeant. He wins a Purple Heart, Bronze Star and Silver Star in the Vietnam War.
* Barbara Pilgrim: Daughter of Billy and Valencia. She is a &quot;bitchy flibbertigibbet&quot; from having had to assume the family&#x27;s leadership at the age of twenty. She has &quot;legs like an Edwardian grand piano,&quot; marries an optometrist, and treats her widowed father as a childish invalid.
* Tralfamadorians: The race of extraterrestrial beings who appear (to humans) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop, in which is set a single green eye. They abduct Billy and teach him about time&#x27;s relation to the world (as a fourth dimension), fate, and the nature of death. The Tralfamadorians are featured in several Vonnegut novels. In &quot;Slaughterhouse Five&quot;, they reveal that the universe will be accidentally destroyed by one of their test pilots, and there is nothing they can do about it.
* Montana Wildhack: A beautiful young model who is abducted and placed alongside Billy in the zoo on Tralfamadore. She and Billy develop an intimate relationship and they have a child. She apparently remains on Tralfamadore with the child after Billy is sent back to Earth. Billy sees her in a film showing in a pornographic book store when he stops to look at the Kilgore Trout novels sitting in the window. Her unexplained disappearance is featured on the covers of magazines sold in the store.
* &quot;Wild Bob&quot;: A superannuated army officer Billy meets in the war. He tells his fellow POWs to call him &quot;Wild Bob&quot;, as he thinks they are the 451st Infantry Regiment and under his command. He explains &quot;If you&#x27;re ever in Cody, Wyoming, ask for Wild Bob&quot;, which is a phrase that Billy repeats to himself throughout the novel. He dies of pneumonia.
* Eliot Rosewater: Billy befriends him in the veterans&#x27; hospital; he introduces Billy to the sci-fi novels of Kilgore Trout. Rosewater wrote the only fan letter Trout ever received. Rosewater had also suffered a terrible event during the war. Billy and Rosewater find the Trout novels helpful in dealing with the trauma of war. Rosewater is featured in other Vonnegut novels, such as &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot; (1965).
* Bertram Copeland Rumfoord: A Harvard history professor, retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general, and millionaire. He shares a hospital room with Billy and is interested in the Dresden bombing. He is in the hospital after breaking his leg on his honeymoon with his fifth wife Lily, a barely literate high school drop-out and go-go girl. He is described as similar in appearance and mannerisms to Theodore Roosevelt. Bertram is likely a relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, a character in Vonnegut&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;.
* The Scouts: Two American infantry scouts trapped behind German lines who find Roland Weary and Billy. Roland refers to himself and the scouts as the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. The scouts abandon Roland and Billy because the latter are slowing them down. They are revealed to have been shot and killed by Germans in ambush.
* Bernard V. O&#x27;Hare: The narrator&#x27;s old war friend who was also held in Dresden and accompanies him there after the war. He is the husband of Mary O&#x27;Hare, and is a district attorney from Pennsylvania.
* Mary O&#x27;Hare: The wife of Bernard V. O&#x27;Hare, to whom Vonnegut promised to name the book &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot;. She is briefly discussed in the beginning of the book. When the narrator and Bernard try to recollect their war experiences Mary complains that they were just &quot;babies&quot; during the war and that the narrator will portray them as valorous men. The narrator befriends Mary by promising that he will portray them as she said and that in his book &quot;there won&#x27;t be a part for Frank Sinatra or John Wayne.&quot;
* Werner Gluck: The sixteen-year-old German charged with guarding Billy and Edgar Derby when they are first placed at Slaughterhouse Five in Dresden. He does not know his way around and accidentally leads Billy and Edgar into a communal shower where some German refugee girls from Breslau are bathing. He is described as appearing similar to Billy.

==Style==
In keeping with Vonnegut&#x27;s signature style, the novel&#x27;s syntax and sentence structure are simple, and irony, sentimentality, black humor, and didacticism are prevalent throughout the work. Like much of his oeuvre, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is broken into small pieces, and in this case, into brief experiences, each focused on a specific point in time. Vonnegut has noted that his books &quot;are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips...and each chip is a joke.&quot; Vonnegut also includes hand-drawn illustrations in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, and also in his next novel, &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1973). Characteristically, Vonnegut makes heavy use of repetition, frequently using the phrase, &quot;So it goes&quot;. He uses it as a refrain when events of death, dying, and mortality occur or are mentioned; as a narrative transition to another subject; as a &quot;memento mori&quot;; as comic relief; and to explain the unexplained. The phrase appears 106 times.

The book has been categorized as a postmodern, meta-fictional novel. The first chapter of &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is written in the style of an author&#x27;s preface about how he came to write the novel. The narrator introduces the novel&#x27;s genesis by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He provides a description of himself and of the book, saying that it is a desperate attempt at creating a scholarly work. He ends the first chapter by discussing the beginning and end of the novel. He then segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: &quot;Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time&quot;, thus the transition from the writer&#x27;s perspective to that of the third-person, omniscient narrator. (The use of &quot;Listen&quot; as an opening interjection has been said to mimic the opening &quot;Hwaet!&quot; of the medieval epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.) The fictional &quot;story&quot; appears to begin in Chapter Two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not also fiction. This technique is common in postmodern meta-fiction.

The narrator explains that Billy Pilgrim experiences his life discontinuously, so that he randomly lives (and re-lives) his birth, youth, old age and death, rather than experiencing them in the normal linear order. There are two main narrative threads: a description of Billy&#x27;s World War II experience, which, though interrupted by episodes from other periods and places in his life, is mostly linear; and a description of his discontinuous pre-war and post-war lives. A main idea is that Billy&#x27;s existential perspective had been compromised by his having witnessed Dresden&#x27;s destruction (although he had come &quot;unstuck in time&quot; before arriving in Dresden). &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is told in short, declarative sentences, which create the impression that one is reading a factual report.

The first sentence says, &quot;All this happened, more or less.&quot; (In 2010, the line was ranked No. 38 on the &quot;American Book Review&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Best First Lines from Novels&quot;.) The opening sentences of the novel have been said to contain the aesthetic &quot;method statement&quot; of the entire novel.

==Themes==
===War and death===
In &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Vonnegut attempts to come to terms with war through the narrator&#x27;s eyes, Billy Pilgrim. An example within the novel, showing Vonnegut&#x27;s aim to accept his past war experiences, occurs in chapter one, when he states that &quot;All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn&#x27;t his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I&#x27;ve changed all the names.&quot;
As the novel continues, it is relevant that the reality is death.

&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; focuses on human imagination while interrogating the novel&#x27;s overall theme, which is the catastrophic impact that war leaves behind.
Death is something that happens fairly often in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five.&quot; When a death occurs in the novel, Vonnegut marks the occasion with the saying &quot;so it goes.&quot; Bergenholtz and Clark write about what Vonnegut actually means when he uses that saying: &quot;Presumably, readers who have not embraced Tralfamadorian determinism will be both amused and disturbed by this indiscriminate use of &#x27;So it goes.&#x27; Such humor is, of course, black humor.&quot;

===Religion and philosophy===
====Christian philosophy====
Christian philosophy is present in Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;; however, it is not very well-regarded. When God and Christianity is brought up in the work, it is mentioned in a bitter or disregarding tone. One only has to look at how the soldiers react to the mention of it. Though Billy Pilgrim had adopted some part of Christianity, he did not ascribe to all of it. JC Justus summarizes it the best when he mentions that, &quot;&#x27;Tralfamadorian determinism and passivity&#x27; that Pilgrim later adopts as well as Christian fatalism wherein God himself has ordained the atrocities of war...&quot;. Following Justus&#x27;s argument, Pilgrim was a character that had been through war and traveled through time. Having experienced all of these horrors in his lifetime, Pilgrim ended up adopting the Christian ideal that God had everything planned and he had given his approval for the war to happen.

====Tralfamadorian philosophy====
As Billy Pilgrim becomes &quot;unstuck in time&quot;, he is faced with a new type of philosophy. When Pilgrim becomes acquainted with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a different viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God&#x27;s divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosen &quot;him&quot;, the Tralfamadorians reply, &quot;Why &quot;you&quot;? Why &quot;us&quot; for that matter? Why &quot;anything&quot;? Because this moment simply is.&quot; The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which free will exists. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, &quot;I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply &quot;is.&quot;&quot; After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the &quot;visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe&quot; and &quot;studied reports on one hundred more,&quot; &quot;only on Earth is there any talk of free will.&quot;

Using the Tralfamadorian passivity of fate, Billy Pilgrim learns to overlook death and the shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only &quot;appears&quot; to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. ... When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is &quot;So it goes.&quot;

=== Postmodernism ===
The significance of postmodernism is a reoccurring theme in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s works. Postmodernism arose as a rejection of modernist narratives and structures. According to one critic, Tralfamadorianism is a restatement of Christian teleology: There is no purpose to life, effects do not have causes; the only reason for anything is that God has ordained it. This juxtaposition is displayed throughout the book, rather directly asking the reader to confront the logical absurdities inherent in both Christian faith and Tralfamadorianism. The rigid and dogmatic approach of Christianity is dismissed, while determinism is critiqued.

=== Mental illness===
Some have argued that Vonnegut is speaking out for veterans, many of whose post-war states are untreatable. Pilgrim&#x27;s symptoms have been identified as what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder, which didn&#x27;t exist as a term when the novel was written. In the words of one writer, &quot;perhaps due to the fact that PTSD was not officially recognized as a mental disorder yet, the establishment fails Billy by neither providing an accurate diagnosis nor proposing any coping mechanisms.&quot; Billy found life meaningless due to his experiences in the war, which desensitized and forever changed him.

==Symbols==
===Dresden===

Vonnegut was in the city of Dresden when it was bombed; he came home traumatized and unable to properly communicate the horror of what happened there. &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is the product of the twenty years of work it took for him to articulate the experience in a way that satisfied him. William Allen says, &quot;Precisely because the story was so hard to tell, and because Vonnegut was willing to take two decades necessary to tell it – to speak the unspeakable – &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is a great novel, a masterpiece sure to remain a permanent part of American literature.&quot;

===Food===
Billy Pilgrim ended up owning &quot;half of three Tastee-Freeze stands. Tastee-Freeze was a sort of frozen custard. It gave all the pleasure that ice cream could give, without the stiffness and bitter coldness of ice cream&quot; (61). Throughout &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, when Billy is eating or near food, he thinks of food in positive terms. This is partly because food is both a status symbol and comforting to people in Billy&#x27;s situation. &quot;Food may provide nourishment, but its more important function is to soothe... Finally, food also functions as a status symbol, a sign of wealth. For instance, en route to the German prisoner-of-war camp, Billy gets a glimpse of the guards&#x27; boxcar and is impressed by its contents... In sharp contrast, the Americans&#x27; boxcar proclaims their dependent prisoner-of-war status.&quot;

===The Bird===
Throughout the novel, the bird sings &quot;Poo-tee-weet?&quot; After the Dresden firebombing, the bird breaks out in song. The bird also sings outside of Billy&#x27;s hospital window. The song has been interpreted as symbolizing a loss of words, or the inadequacy of words to describe traumatic situations.

==Allusions and references==
===Allusions to other works===
As in other novels by Vonnegut, certain characters cross over from other stories, making cameo appearances and connecting the discrete novels to a greater opus. Fictional novelist Kilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. In one case, he is the only non-optometrist at a party; therefore, he is the odd man out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout&#x27;s opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if they turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where &quot;the burning never stops hurting.&quot; Other crossover characters are Eliot Rosewater, from &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;; Howard W. Campbell Jr., from &quot;Mother Night&quot;; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, from &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot;. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequently rebooted and do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut&#x27;s work.

In the &quot;Twayne&#x27;s United States Authors&quot; series volume on Kurt Vonnegut, about the protagonist&#x27;s name, Stanley Schatt says:
By naming the unheroic hero Billy Pilgrim, Vonnegut contrasts John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; with Billy&#x27;s story. As Wilfrid Sheed has pointed out, Billy&#x27;s solution to the problems of the modern world is to &quot;invent a heaven, out of 20th century materials, where Good Technology triumphs over Bad Technology. His scripture is Science Fiction, Man&#x27;s last, good fantasy&quot;.
===Cultural and historical allusions===
&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; makes numerous cultural, historical, geographical, and philosophical allusions. It tells of the bombing of Dresden in World War II, and refers to the Battle of the Bulge, the Vietnam War, and the civil rights protests in American cities during the 1960s. Billy&#x27;s wife, Valencia, has a &quot;Reagan for President!&quot; bumper sticker on her Cadillac, referring to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s failed 1968 Republican presidential nomination campaign. Another bumper sticker is mentioned, reading &quot;Impeach Earl Warren,&quot; referencing a real-life campaign by the far-right John Birch Society.

The Serenity Prayer appears twice. Critic Tony Tanner suggested that it is employed to illustrate the contrast between Billy Pilgrim&#x27;s and the Tralfamadorians&#x27; views of fatalism. Richard Hinchcliffe contends that Billy Pilgrim could be seen at first as typifying the Protestant work ethic, but he ultimately converts to evangelicalism.

=== Vonnegut&#x27;s own experiences ===
In 1995, Vonnegut said that Billy Pilgrim was modeled on Edward &quot;Joe&quot; Crone, a thin soldier who died in Dresden. Vonnegut had told this to friends earlier, but waited until after he learned that both of Crone&#x27;s parents were deceased to publicly disclose this information.

Edgar Derby, killed for looting a teapot, was modeled on Vonnegut&#x27;s fellow prisoner Mike Palaia, who was executed for plundering a jar of food (variously described as beans, fruit, or cherries).

==Reception==
The reviews of &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; have been largely positive since the March 31, 1969 review in the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;you&#x27;ll either love it, or push it back in the science-fiction corner.&quot; It was Vonnegut&#x27;s first novel to become a bestseller, staying on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for sixteen weeks and peaking at No. 4. In 1970, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was nominated for best-novel Nebula and Hugo Awards. It lost both to &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; by Ursula K. Le Guin. It has since been widely regarded as a classic anti-war novel, and has appeared in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923.

===Censorship controversy===
&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; has been the subject of many attempts at censorship due to its irreverent tone, purportedly obscene content and depictions of sex, American soldiers&#x27; use of profanity, and perceived heresy. It was one of the first literary acknowledgments that homosexual men, referred to in the novel as &quot;fairies&quot;, were among the victims of the Holocaust.

In the United States it has at times been banned from literature classes, removed from school libraries, and struck from literary curricula. In 1972, following the ruling of &quot;Todd v. Rochester Community Schools&quot;, it was banned from Rochester Community Schools in Oakland County, Michigan. The circuit judge described the book as &quot;depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian.&quot; It was later reinstated.

In 1973, Vonnegut learned of a school district in North Dakota that was antagonistic towards &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. An English teacher at a high school in the district wanted to read the novel with their class. Charles McCarthy, the head of the school board, declared the novel inappropriate because of obscene language. All copies of Vonnegut&#x27;s novel in the school were burned in a furnace.

In a letter to McCarthy in 1973, Vonnegut defended his credibility, his character, and his work. In the letter, entitled &quot;I Am Very Real&quot;, Vonnegut wrote that his books &quot;beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are&quot;. He contended that his work should not be censored based on the general message in the novel.

The U.S. Supreme Court considered the First Amendment implications of the removal of the book, among others, from public school libraries in the case of &quot;Island Trees School District v. Pico&quot;, and concluded that &quot;local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to &#x27;prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; is the sixty-seventh entry to the American Library Association&#x27;s list of the &quot;Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999&quot; and number forty-six on the ALA&#x27;s &quot;Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009&quot;. In August 2011, the novel was banned at the Republic High School in Missouri. The Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library countered by offering 150 free copies of the novel to Republic High School students on a first-come, first-served basis.

In an effort to comply with a new 2024 Tennessee state law which added to the 2022 Age Appropriate Materials Act, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; was banned - along with nearly 400 other titles - at the discretion of middle and high school librarians serving Wilson County Schools, a public school district in the greater metropolitan Nashville area. It has also been recently banned from school libraries in the state of Florida.

In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is &quot;adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity&quot; despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student. 

===Criticism===
&quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; has been described as a quietist work, because Billy Pilgrim believes that the notion of free will is a quaint Earthling illusion. According to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, &quot;Vonnegut&#x27;s critics seem to think that he is saying the same thing [as the Tralfamadorians].&quot; For Anthony Burgess, &quot;&quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; is a kind of evasion—in a sense, like J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot;—in which we&#x27;re being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy...&quot; For Charles Harris, &quot;The main idea emerging from &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; seems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance.&quot; For Alfred Kazin, &quot;Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden...He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, &#x27;So it goes.&#x27;&quot; For Tanner, &quot;Vonnegut has...total sympathy with such quietistic impulses.&quot; The same notion is found throughout &quot;The Vonnegut Statement&quot;, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut&#x27;s most loyal academic fans.

When confronted with the question of how the desire to improve the world fits with the notion of time presented in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, Vonnegut responded &quot;you understand, of course, that everything I say is horseshit.&quot;

==Adaptations==
*A film adaptation of the book was released in 1972. Although critically praised, the film was a box office flop. It won the &quot;Prix du Jury&quot; at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, as well as a Hugo Award and Saturn Award. Vonnegut commended the film greatly. In 2013, Guillermo del Toro announced his intention to remake the 1972 film and work with a script by Charlie Kaufman.
*In 1989, a theatrical adaptation was performed at the Everyman Theatre, in Liverpool, England.
*In 1996, another theatrical adaptation of the novel premiered at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago. The adaptation was written and directed by Eric Simonson and featured actors Rick Snyder, Robert Breuler and Deanna Dunagan. The play has subsequently been performed in several other theaters, including a New York premiere production in January 2008, by the Godlight Theatre Company. An operatic adaptation by Hans-Jürgen von Bose premiered in July 1996 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany. Billy Pilgrim II was sung by Uwe Schonbeck.
*In September 2009, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a feature-length radio drama based on the book, which was dramatised by Dave Sheasby, featured Andrew Scott as Billy Pilgrim and was scored by the group 65daysofstatic.
*In September 2020, a graphic novel adaptation of the book, written by Ryan North and drawn by Albert Monteys, was published by BOOM! Studios, through their Archaia Entertainment imprint. It was the first time the book has been adapted into the comics medium.

<text>Wireless communication (or just wireless, when the context allows) is the transfer of information (&quot;telecommunication&quot;) between two or more points without the use of an electrical conductor, optical fiber or other continuous guided medium for the transfer. The most common wireless technologies use radio waves. With radio waves, intended distances can be short, such as a few meters for Bluetooth, or as far as millions of kilometers for deep-space radio communications. It encompasses various types of fixed, mobile, and portable applications, including two-way radios, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and wireless networking. Other examples of applications of radio &quot;wireless technology&quot; include GPS units, garage door openers, wireless computer mouse, keyboards and headsets, headphones, radio receivers, satellite television, broadcast television and cordless telephones. Somewhat less common methods of achieving wireless communications involve other electromagnetic phenomena, such as light and magnetic or electric fields, or the use of sound.

The term &quot;wireless&quot; has been used twice in communications history, with slightly different meanings. It was initially used from about 1890 for the first radio transmitting and receiving technology, as in &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;, until the new word &quot;radio&quot; replaced it around 1920. Radio sets in the UK and the English-speaking world that were not portable continued to be referred to as &quot;wireless sets&quot; into the 1960s. The term &quot;wireless&quot; was revived in the 1980s and 1990s mainly to distinguish digital devices that communicate without wires, such as the examples listed in the previous paragraph, from those that require wires or cables. This became its primary usage in the 2000s, due to the advent of technologies such as mobile broadband, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

Wireless operations permit services, such as mobile and interplanetary communications, that are impossible or impractical to implement with the use of wires. The term is commonly used in the telecommunications industry to refer to telecommunications systems (e.g. radio transmitters and receivers, remote controls, etc.) that use some form of energy (e.g. radio waves and acoustic energy) to transfer information without the use of wires. Information is transferred in this manner over both short and long distances.

== History ==
=== Photophone ===
The first wireless telephone conversation occurred in 1880 when Alexander Graham Bell and Charles Sumner Tainter invented the photophone, a telephone that sent audio over a beam of light. The photophone required sunlight to operate, and a clear line of sight between the transmitter and receiver, which greatly decreased the viability of the photophone in any practical use. It would be several decades before the photophone&#x27;s principles found their first practical applications in military communications and later in fiber-optic communications.

===Electric wireless technology===
==== Early wireless ====
A number of wireless electrical signaling schemes including sending electric currents through water and the ground using electrostatic and electromagnetic induction were investigated for telegraphy in the late 19th century before practical radio systems became available. These included a patented induction system by Thomas Edison allowing a telegraph on a running train to connect with telegraph wires running parallel to the tracks, a William Preece induction telegraph system for sending messages across bodies of water, and several operational and proposed telegraphy and voice earth conduction systems.

The Edison system was used by stranded trains during the Great Blizzard of 1888 and earth conductive systems found limited use between trenches during World War I but these systems were never successful economically.

==== Radio waves ====

In 1894, Guglielmo Marconi began developing a wireless telegraph system using radio waves, which had been known about since proof of their existence in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz, but discounted as a communication format since they seemed, at the time, to be a short-range phenomenon. Marconi soon developed a system that was transmitting signals way beyond distances anyone could have predicted (due in part to the signals bouncing off the then unknown ionosphere). Marconi and Karl Ferdinand Braun were awarded the 1909 Nobel Prize for Physics for their contribution to this form of wireless telegraphy.

Millimetre wave communication was first investigated by Jagadish Chandra Bose during 18941896, when he reached an extremely high frequency of up to 60GHz in his experiments. He also introduced the use of semiconductor junctions to detect radio waves, when he patented the radio crystal detector in 1901.

===Wireless revolution===
The wireless revolution began in the 1990s, with the advent of digital wireless networks leading to a social revolution, and a paradigm shift from wired to wireless technology, including the proliferation of commercial wireless technologies such as cell phones, mobile telephony, pagers, wireless computer networks, cellular networks, the wireless Internet, and laptop and handheld computers with wireless connections. The wireless revolution has been driven by advances in radio frequency (RF), microelectronics, and microwave engineering, and the transition from analog to digital RF technology, which enabled a substantial increase in voice traffic along with the delivery of digital data such as text messaging, images and streaming media.

== Modes ==
&quot;Wireless communications&quot; can be via:

=== Radio ===
Radio and microwave communication carry information by modulating properties of electromagnetic waves transmitted through space. Specifically, the transmitter generates artificial electromagnetic waves by applying time-varying electric currents to its antenna. The waves travel away from the antenna until they eventually reach the antenna of a receiver, which induces an electric current in the receiving antenna. This current can be detected and demodulated to recreate the information sent by the transmitter.

=== Wireless optical ===
==== Free-space optical (long-range) ====
 Free-space optical communication (FSO) is an optical communication technology that uses light propagating in free space to transmit wireless data for telecommunications or computer networking. &quot;Free space&quot; means the light beams travel through the open air or outer space. This contrasts with other communication technologies that use light beams traveling through transmission lines such as optical fiber or dielectric &quot;light pipes&quot;.

The technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations. For example, free space optical links are used in cities between office buildings that are not wired for networking, where the cost of running cable through the building and under the street would be prohibitive. Another widely used example is consumer IR devices such as remote controls and IrDA (Infrared Data Association) networking, which is used as an alternative to WiFi networking to allow laptops, PDAs, printers, and digital cameras to exchange data.

=== Sonic ===
Sonic, especially ultrasonic short-range communication involves the transmission and reception of sound.

=== Electromagnetic induction ===
Electromagnetic induction only allows short-range communication and power transmission. It has been used in biomedical situations such as pacemakers, as well as for short-range RFID tags.

== Services ==
Common examples of wireless equipment include:
* Infrared and ultrasonic remote control devices
* Professional LMR (Land Mobile Radio) and SMR (Specialized Mobile Radio) are typically used by business, industrial, and Public Safety entities.
* Consumer Two-way radio including FRS Family Radio Service, GMRS (General Mobile Radio Service), and Citizens band (&quot;CB&quot;) radios.
* The Amateur Radio Service (Ham radio).
* Consumer and professional Marine VHF radios.
* Airband and radio navigation equipment used by aviators and air traffic control
* Cellular telephones and pagers: provide connectivity for portable and mobile applications, both personal and business.
* Global Positioning System (GPS): allows drivers of cars and trucks, captains of boats and ships, and pilots of aircraft to ascertain their location anywhere on earth.
* Cordless computer peripherals: the cordless mouse is a common example; wireless headphones, keyboards, and printers can also be linked to a computer via wireless using technology such as Wireless USB or Bluetooth.
* Cordless telephone sets: these are limited-range devices, not to be confused with cell phones.
* Satellite television: Is broadcast from satellites in geostationary orbit. Typical services use direct broadcast satellite to provide multiple television channels to viewers.

== Electromagnetic spectrum ==

AM and FM radios and other electronic devices make use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies of the radio spectrum that are available for use for communication are treated as a public resource and are regulated by organizations such as the American Federal Communications Commission, Ofcom in the United Kingdom, the international ITU-R or the European ETSI. Their regulations determine which frequency ranges can be used for what purpose and by whom. In the absence of such control or alternative arrangements such as a privatized electromagnetic spectrum, chaos might result if, for example, airlines did not have specific frequencies to work under and an amateur radio operator was interfering with a pilot&#x27;s ability to land an aircraft. Wireless communication spans the spectrum from 9 kHz to 300 GHz.

== Applications ==
=== Mobile telephones ===
One of the best-known examples of wireless technology is the mobile phone, also known as a cellular phone, with more than 6.6 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide as of the end of 2010. These wireless phones use radio waves from signal-transmission towers to enable their users to make phone calls from many locations worldwide. They can be used within the range of the mobile telephone site used to house the equipment required to transmit and receive the radio signals from these instruments.

=== Data communications ===
Wireless data communications allow wireless networking between desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, cell phones, and other related devices. The various available technologies differ in local availability, coverage range, and performance, and in some circumstances, users employ multiple connection types and switch between them using connection manager software or a mobile VPN to handle the multiple connections as a secure, single virtual network. Supporting technologies include:

:Wi-Fi is a wireless local area network that enables portable computing devices to connect easily with other devices, peripherals, and the Internet. Standardized as IEEE 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac, ax, Wi-Fi has link speeds similar to older standards of wired Ethernet. Wi-Fi has become the de facto standard for access in private homes, within offices, and at public hotspots. Some businesses charge customers a monthly fee for service, while others have begun offering it free in an effort to increase the sales of their goods.

:Cellular data service offers coverage within a range of 10-15 miles from the nearest cell site. Speeds have increased as technologies have evolved, from earlier technologies such as GSM, CDMA and GPRS, through 3G, to 4G networks such as W-CDMA, EDGE or CDMA2000. As of 2018, the proposed next generation is 5G.

:Low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) bridge the gap between Wi-Fi and Cellular for low-bitrate Internet of things (IoT) applications.
:Mobile-satellite communications may be used where other wireless connections are unavailable, such as in largely rural areas or remote locations. Satellite communications are especially important for transportation, aviation, maritime and military use.

:Wireless sensor networks are responsible for sensing noise, interference, and activity in data collection networks. This allows us to detect relevant quantities, monitor and collect data, formulate clear user displays, and to perform decision-making functions

Wireless data communications are used to span a distance beyond the capabilities of typical cabling in point-to-point communication and point-to-multipoint communication, to provide a backup communications link in case of normal network failure, to link portable or temporary workstations, to overcome situations where normal cabling is difficult or financially impractical, or to remotely connect mobile users or networks.

====Peripherals====
Peripheral devices in computing can also be connected wirelessly, as part of a Wi-Fi network or directly via an optical or radio-frequency (RF) peripheral interface. Originally these units used bulky, highly local transceivers to mediate between a computer and a keyboard and mouse; however, more recent generations have used smaller, higher-performance devices. Radio-frequency interfaces, such as Bluetooth or Wireless USB, provide greater ranges of efficient use, usually up to 10 feet, but distance, physical obstacles, competing signals, and even human bodies can all degrade the signal quality. Concerns about the security of wireless keyboards arose at the end of 2007 when it was revealed that Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of encryption in some of its 27 MHz models were highly insecure.

=== Energy transfer ===

Wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. There are two different fundamental methods for wireless energy transfer. Energy can be transferred using either far-field methods that involve beaming power/lasers, radio or microwave transmissions, or near-field using electromagnetic induction. Wireless energy transfer may be combined with wireless information transmission in what is known as Wireless Powered Communication. In 2015, researchers at the University of Washington demonstrated far-field energy transfer using Wi-Fi signals to power cameras.

=== Medical technologies ===
New wireless technologies, such as mobile body area networks (MBAN), have the capability to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and body temperature. The MBAN works by sending low-powered wireless signals to receivers that feed into nursing stations or monitoring sites. This technology helps with the intentional and unintentional risk of infection or disconnection that arise from wired connections.

<doc id="185869" wikidata="Q9075304" url="?curid=185869" title="Sean O'Hagan">
<text>Sean O&#x27;Hagan (born 1959) is an Irish singer and songwriter who leads the avant-pop band the High Llamas, which he founded in 1992. He is also known for being one half of the songwriting duo (with Cathal Coughlan) in Microdisney and for his work during the early 1990s with the English-French band Stereolab.

== Life and career ==
O&#x27;Hagan was born in England to Irish parents, moving to Cork as a teenager.

He is a founding member of the Irish indie band Microdisney, alongside Cathal Coughlan; the band initially formed in Cork but was based in London from 1982 until their split in 1988. 

He released a solo album titled &quot;High Llamas&quot; in 1990, which would become the name of a band he subsequently formed. The High Llamas were influenced by the Beach Boys, Ennio Morricone, Antonio Carlos Jobim and avant-garde electronica. He has also collaborated extensively with Stereolab, he was an official member from 1993 to 1994, and is credited as a guest musician on later releases.

In 1996, O&#x27;Hagan collaborated with Tim Gane of Stereolab as Turn On, releasing an album of the same name on Drag City Records. They also worked together on the soundtrack to the film &quot;La Vie d&#x27;Artiste&quot;.

On 27 November 2017, it was announced that O&#x27;Hagan and Coughlan would reform Microdisney for a one-off concert in the National Concert Hall, Dublin on 2 June 2018. The concert sold out, and was followed by gigs in Cork and London. Coughlan died in 2022.

=== Unrealised Beach Boys collaboration ===
In the mid 1990s, Brian Wilson was attempting to organize a comeback album with the Beach Boys and his collaborator Andy Paley. After Wilson&#x27;s bandmate Bruce Johnston heard the High Llamas&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Hawaii&quot;, an unsuccessful attempt was made to instead coordinate a collaboration between O&#x27;Hagan and Wilson. Some of the songs that later appeared on the High Llamas&#x27; 1998 album &quot;Cold and Bouncy&quot; were then briefly under consideration to be recorded by the Beach Boys.

One of the reasons that the collaboration never happened, by O&#x27;Hagan&#x27;s account, was interference from Wilson&#x27;s wife Melinda and former wrestler Joe Thomas, who was ultimately chosen to produce Wilson&#x27;s 1998 solo album, &quot;Imagination&quot;. O&#x27;Hagan, who thought Wilson&#x27;s musical talents were best served at reclaiming his title as a &quot;20th-century avant-garde pop genius&quot;, had voiced objections to Thomas&#x27; desire to instead break Wilson into the adult contemporary market. According to O&#x27;Hagan, he attended one meeting with Wilson and two with the Beach Boys, but Wilson&#x27;s &quot;camp&quot; was unable to reach an agreement with the other Beach Boys. He said of Wilson in a 2001 interview,

A post attributed to Wilson on his website wrote that O&#x27;Hagan was &quot;a real sweet guy, but I didn&#x27;t think I needed him to show me how to do the things I had already done 30 years earlier&quot;. Johnston surmised that &quot;Brian was a little intimidated by Sean, in the same way that Gershwin may have been intimidated by Oscar Levant.&quot;

<text>Horst von Möllendorff (26 April 1906 – 17 December 1992) was a German cartoonist who was &quot;drafted&quot; to work for the Nazis&#x27; animated short industry. He was hired as a result of former commercial animator Hans Fischerkoesen not being able to come up with adequate story ideas for his short films. Horst was pulled from his job as a popular Berlin newspaper cartoonist to become a gagman for the animation industry.

Möllendorff received authorship for at least three films: 
* &quot;Verwitterte Melodie&quot; (&quot;Weather-beaten Melody&quot;), 1942
* &quot;Der Schneemann&quot; (&quot;The Snowman&quot;), 1943

<text>Der Schneemann, also known as The Snowman, Snowman in July or The Magic Snowman, is a 1944 animated short film, created in Nazi Germany. It was written by cartoonist Horst von Möllendorff and animated by Hans Fischerkoesen. It was animated in Potsdam, Germany, near UFA&#x27;s Neubabelsberg Studios.

==Plot==
Snow falls on the snowman to form a heart shape on him. The snowman wakes and begins juggling with the snow. A dog begins chasing him and takes a bite out of him. The dog then throws snow at the snowman but this only fills the missing part of the snowman. Eventually the dog leaves.

The snowman starts skating on ice but falls through and staggers away largely melted. However, by falling down a hill and rolling in the snow the snowman reforms himself.

The snowman now falls to sleep at night. A rabbit tries to steal his carrot nose but the snowman prevents this. The snowman gets up and enters a house and finds a calendar. He finds the month July on it and then puts himself in a refrigerator so that he may see this month.

During this time, the sun makes the snow melt and gives colour to the botanical species. Meanwhile, the snowman sleeps in the refrigerator.

The snowman wakes in July. His back is stuck in the fridge. He adjusts the thermostat and waits. He leaves the refrigerator and looks for the signs of summer through the window. He embraces the summer and breathes in the perfume of the flowers. He puts a pink rose in his lapel and rolls in the fields.

The snowman melts under the heat of the sun. He begin to sing &quot;Da ist der Sommer meines Lebens...&quot; (&quot;that&#x27;s the summer of my life&quot;) and turns into water. These are the only spoken words in the film. The rabbit from earlier mourns his loss whilst the children of the rabbit jump into the snowman&#x27;s hat. He picks up the snowman&#x27;s carrot and takes a bite from it.

<doc id="185877" wikidata="Q130710790" url="?curid=185877" title="Rafael Hernández Airport">
<text>Rafael Hernández Airport () , also referred to as the Rafael Hernández International Airport (), is an airport located in the municipality of Aguadilla in northwestern Puerto Rico. Named after the composer Rafael Hernández Marín, it is the second-largest airport of the archipelago and island in terms of passenger traffic after the main airport of Luis Muñoz Marín International. It is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Air and Marine Operations. Set to be modernized, the 11,702 ft (2.2163 mi) long runway of the airport is the longest in the Caribbean.

In the past, the airport has been served by a number of passenger air carriers operating scheduled jet service including American Airlines, Arrow Air, Capitol Air, Continental Airlines, Kiwi International Airlines, Pan Am (II and III),Trans World Airlines (TWA), Southeast Airlines, Aeronaves de Puerto Rico and Delta Connection, and also by Turkish Airlines Cargo on the cargo airline side. Taesa flew in 1996 from Mexico City International Airport in Mexico City, and in 1985, Arrow Air operated domestic McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jet service on a once a week basis to the airport from San Juan (SJU) as well DC-10 nonstop flights six days a week from JFK International Airport (JFK) in New York. Pan Am III also flew jets between Aguadilla and San Juan during the early 2000s. Currently, although the airport lacks non-stop flights to Asia, it is the only airport in Puerto Rico served by an Asian commercial airline, in this case by Emirates Sky Cargo.

==History==
In 1939, the Army sent Major George C. Kenney to Puerto Rico to conduct a preliminary survey of possible air base sites on Puerto Rico. He examined a total of 42 sites and declared that Punta Borinquen the best site for a major air base. Planted sugar cane farms covered some that the government purchased for military use in the first week of September 1939 at a cost of $1,215,000. Later that year, Major Karl S. Axtater assumed command of what was to become Borinquen Army Air Field.

With the establishment of an independent United States Air Force in 1947, the complex was renamed Ramey Air Force Base in 1948. Ramey AFB was home to a Strategic Air Command bombardment wing and housed a number of B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bombers. The B-36s were later replaced by B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers and KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft, while a tenant weather reconnaissance squadron operated WB-47 Stratojet and WC-130 Hercules aircraft. Due to the size and weight of the B-36, the runway at Ramey had to be built to a length of and a width of , added an Blast Pad at each end and a shoulder on each side.

The closure of what became Ramey Air Force Base began in 1971 and lasted until 1973. Following its closure, it was converted into a civilian airport. It used to receive domestic commercial flights by Prinair and Vieques Air Link as well as service from JFK International Airport in New York City with Capitol Air, and Boeing 720 passenger flights from Miami operated by Southeast Airlines. It is also noted for being the place that the large clothing company, Wrangler Jeans used to land their planes filled with company-related cargo as part of their airline operation, Wrangler Aviation, which was later renamed to Sky Lease Cargo.

In the mid and late 1970s, the Ahrens Aircraft Corporation attempted to set up operations at former USAF industrial facilities at the airport in order to manufacture the Ahrens AR 404 regional airliner, a short takeoff and landing (STOL) turboprop aircraft, with financial incentives promised by the Puerto Rican government for development. However, a subsequent government investigation over these incentives ensued and the project was cancelled after only two AR 404s were built at Rafael Hernández Airport.

In 2004, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced that it would be remodeling and expanding BQN to accommodate more flights and passengers. An expansion of the terminal building and a new parking lot were among the projects in mind, with said expansion being inaugurated on July 12, 2005.

Since the closure of Ramey AFB in 1974, the airport&#x27;s control tower had remained standing, but was non-operational, limiting the airport to UNICOM communication as an uncontrolled airport. Following refurbishment of the former USAF control tower in 2006 and 2007, the newly renovated control tower became operational on July 5, 2007.

On February 20, 2012, it was announced by both the mayor of Aguadilla and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce that the airport will be designated a &quot;free trade zone&quot; (FTZ), as are many other airports in the U.S., a move that is believed will improve the development of the airport and surrounding areas.

On April 10, 2014, Lufthansa Technik announced the creation of a maintenance, repair and overhaul center (MRO) at the airport. This created operations for maintenance of Lufthansa Aircraft flying on the Americas, starting with 2 reconditioning lines by C and D checks for the Airbus A320, with plans to expand up to 5 reconditioning lines.

===Passenger service===
In 1988, Carnival Airlines and ATA began passenger jet service. In the 1990s, American Airlines, joined those two airlines, followed by Pan Am II and TWA. Carnival Airlines operated Airbus A300 wide body jet service to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey and Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the early 1990s, Carnival Airlines also operated the first intra-Puerto Rican jet service from the airport to Ponce with Boeing 727s as well as with wide body Airbus A300s. Another carrier, Prinair, also had previously conducted operations at Rafael Hernández Airport. North Cay Airways also provided passenger air service from San Juan at some time during the airport&#x27;s history. In 1995, American Airlines was operating daily nonstop Boeing 757-200 jet service to New York JFK airport with Carnival Airlines also flying nonstop to JFK at this same with Boeing 727-200 jet service three days a week.

In 2000, North American Airlines had reopened passenger service with a non-stop flight to New York JFK three times a week. Later, Continental Airlines joined North American with a daily flight to their hub in Newark. Continental has since merged with United Airlines, and the latter airline has continued to provide service. Boston-Maine Airways operating as Pan Am began jet service to Orlando Sanford International Airport in Florida and to Santo Domingo.

In 2005, JetBlue began a daily flight to their hub at New York JFK. Soon after the arrival of JetBlue, North American ceased operations. As a result, JetBlue announced that it would add a second daily flight to New York JFK.

In 2006, Delta Connection began regional jet service to Atlanta, Georgia, five times a week, although this service ended on January 20, 2007, as part of Delta&#x27;s restructuring plan. Later in 2007, JetBlue began service to Orlando International Airport in Florida.

In the summer of 2007, Spirit Airlines announced plans to begin service from the airport to their hub in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a flight five times a week during the summer. It then reduced its service frequency to a flight two times a week.

In 2007, there were 59 flights per week including one daily flight to New York City, one to Newark and Orlando and a flight operated five times per week to Fort Lauderdale.

Spirit increased their flight frequency to daily to/from Fort Lauderdale. In addition, Spirit added a daily non-stop service to Orlando in February 2008. JetBlue continued to have two daily flights to New York City after the holiday season, adding a second daily flight to/from Orlando on May 1, 2008. On June 2, 2008, Pan Am World Airways Dominicana restored service between the airport and Santo Domingo-Las Americas as well as to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic.

On May 24, 2022, Frontier Airlines launched service for the first time to/from Orlando International Airport (MCO). The new service operates three to four times weekly and marks the airline&#x27;s 13th route serving Puerto Rico from destinations in the U.S. and the Caribbean.

Spirit eventually stopped all flights from Aguadilla in 2023.

==Facilities==
Rafael Hernández Airport covers an area of 1600 acres (647 ha). BQN has one runway, 8/26: 11,702 ft x 200 ft (3,567 m x 61 m) Asphalt/Concrete.

===North Side===
The north side of the airport consists of a passenger terminal with an international side capable of handling flights of over 200 passengers. It also hosts the Main Cargo Terminal, the FedEx Terminal, and the General Aviation Terminal. The north side also houses the Copeca Jet Center Executive Terminal, as well as five service hangars. The military side of the airport is also located on the north side, housing Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, a United States Coast Guard facility, as well as the 141st Air Control Squadron (which operates at the Punta Borinquen Radar Station), a non-flying unit of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. Many Federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the US Border Patrol Ramey Sector in Map and the CBP Air and Marine Operations Operating Locations Southeast Region Caribbean Air and Marine Branch based their operations on this side of the airport.
The closure of what became Ramey Air Force Base began in 1971 and lasted until 1973. Following its closure, it was converted into a civilian airport. It used to receive domestic commercial flights by Prinair and Vieques Air Link as well as service from JFK International Airport in New York City with Capitol Air, and 707 passenger flights from Miami with Southeast Airlines. It is also noted for being the place that the large clothing company, Wrangler Jeans used to land their planes filled with company-related cargo as part of their airline operation, Wrangler Aviation, which was later renamed to Sky Lease Cargo.

In the mid and late 1970s, the Ahrens Aircraft Corporation attempted to set up operations at former USAF industrial facilities at the airport in order to manufacture the Ahrens AR 404 regional airliner, a short takeoff and landing (STOL) turboprop aircraft, with financial incentives promised by the Puerto Rican government for development. However, a subsequent government investigation over these incentives ensued and the project was cancelled after only two AR 404s were built at Rafael Hernández Airport.

In 2004, the Puerto Rico Ports Authority announced that it would be remodeling and expanding BQN to accommodate more flights and passengers. An expansion of the terminal building and a new parking lot were among the projects in mind, with said expansion being inaugurated on July 12, 2005.

Since the closure of Ramey AFB in 1974, the airport&#x27;s control tower had remained standing, but was non-operational, limiting the airport to UNICOM communication as an uncontrolled airport. Following refurbishment of the former USAF control tower in 2006 and 2007, the newly renovated control tower became operational on July 5, 2007.

On February 20, 2012, it was announced by both the mayor of Aguadilla and the U.S. Secretary of Commerce that the airport will be designated a &quot;free trade zone&quot; (FTZ), as are many other airports in the U.S., a move that is believed will improve the development of the airport and surrounding areas.

On April 10, 2014, Lufthansa Technik announced the creation of a maintenance, repair and overhaul center (MRO) at the airport. This created operations for maintenance of Lufthansa Aircraft flying on the Americas, starting with 2 reconditioning lines by C and D checks for the Airbus A320, with plans to expand up to 5 reconditioning lines.

===South Side===
The south side of the airport is the largest portion of the airport, but is currently undeveloped. Since the airport was transferred from the U.S. Air Force and the General Services Administration (GSA) to Puerto Rico Port Authority in 1973, the south side has been the object of various disputes and competing political campaign promises by local elected officials and local political candidates. Despite such promises over the past four decades, the south side remains undeveloped. Under the administration of Sila M. Calderón and Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, a master plan was conceived to turn the south side into an air cargo hub for the Caribbean, but local residents objected to the use of the south side for cargo rather than a modern passenger terminal.

===Passenger Terminal===
The passenger terminal was upgraded to include air conditioning, more space for modern airline ticket counters and car rental counters. It consists of two gates, Gate 14 and Gate 15. Gate 15 is used for departures while Gate 14 is used for arrivals. The terminal is divided into two sections, domestic and the international, with the domestic side equipped with a United States Department of Agriculture facility, while the international side contains a United States Customs inspection facility.

===Cargo Terminal===
The cargo section of the airport is divided in two sections, the Main Terminal and the FedEx Terminal. The FedEx Terminal is home to FedEx and its local affiliates. The remaining Cargo Carriers are located in the Main Terminal.

The U.S Coast Guard and various reserve components of the Armed Forces maintain a military presence within the former Air Force base. Many Federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the United States Border Patrol Ramey sector and the CBP Air and Marine Operations Caribbean Branch operate at the airport.

==Future expansion==
A January 16, 2010, news report stated that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved a master plan to redevelop the Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla that would involve an investment of $1 billion over the next 20 years. In 2010, the Aguadilla airport had two commercial passenger gates. The master plan calls for a total of 30 commercial passenger gates.

There are also plans to expand the airport access road.

There are official plans to renovate the runway to coincide with FedEx’s expansion. There are plans to add a second runaway to the airport.

In June 2021, an official plan of expansion was announced by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and paid by the FAA. The expansion plan includes building a new runway to replace the current one completed by 2027 as the current runway has only five years left of service, having been built in the 1930s for World War II.

Aside from the new runway, a new passenger terminal and three new cargo warehouses are planned to be built. The Puerto Rico Ports Authority seeks to bring back airlines with the new expansion. There are also plans to renovate the airport&#x27;s facilities including bathrooms, relocating stores, adding jet bridges and more.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
JetBlue studied expansion for the 3 main airports in Puerto Rico for 2011 (Aguadilla, Ponce, and San Juan) and is one of two airlines that operate in all three airports, the other one being Frontier. In the past, American Airlines offered service to their hub in Miami from Rafael Hernández Airport. Previously, the airport was closed due to the pandemic and passenger flights weren&#x27;t permitted. On April 1, 2021, the airport reopened for passenger flights.

===Cargo===

==Statistics==
This table shows the continuous growth of passenger traffic at the airport since 2001, but affected in 2009 by the lack of new flights: For the year 2007, the airport transported 400,473 passengers, nearly a 500% increase in five years. Rafael Hernández Airport has an average of 47 regular passengers flights per week.

<text>Saskadena Six (formerly Suicide Six) is a ski resort in South Pomfret, Vermont. Its claim to historical fame as the earliest ski resort derives from the installation, in January 1934, of an improvised rope tow, the first in the United States, on a hill located on Clinton Gilbert&#x27;s farm. The rope tow was originally powered with a Ford Model T engine. By the following month, Wallace &quot;Bunny&quot; Bertram (a former ski coach at Dartmouth College who had helped build the original rope lift) took over the operation, and installed a more reliable electric motor. A few years later he moved his operation to a steeper hill nearby, shown on the map as &quot;Hill 6&quot;. Bertram once joked that to ski down the nearby would be suicide. Two years later the resort was opened using this name and photos of Bertram can be seen in the resort museum in the base lodge. Devotees of ski mountaineering and backcountry skiing mark this as the beginning of the divergence of resort skiing and traditional backcountry skiing.

Suicide Six was the location of the first National Snow Surfing Championships in 1982, considered an important event in the development of snowboarding as a sport, which later would become the U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships.

Bunny Bertram sold the resort to Laurance Rockefeller in 1961 and development continued in conjunction with Rockefeller&#x27;s nearby Woodstock Inn. In a 2004 article, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; described Suicide Six as &quot;steeped in history&quot;, and now a &quot;low key&quot; location for &quot;a taste of rural skiing&quot;. As of late 2011, when Suicide Six marked its 75th anniversary, the facility included 23 runs and continued to operate as the ski area of the Woodstock Inn. In 2016, the resort celebrated its 81st anniversary, and installed a brand new Leitner-Poma Alpha quad chairlift, over in length to the summit. In 2018, the mountain had developed summer programs, and opened a lift-served mountain bike park, only the 6th such park in the state of Vermont. In 2020, the lift served mountain biking was ceased, but the area is open to the public to park and ride up/down as they please. Maintenance of the MTB trails has been assumed by the Woodstock Area Mountain Bike Association (WAMBA). The continued investment and development into the area as a year-round destination continues to add vibrance and activities to the region in the heart of the Green Mountains.

The resort is host to the longest running ski race in North America, The Fisk Trophy Race. It was first held in 1937 and is a rite of passage for serious eastern ski racers. Notable past winners include Bode Miller, Chip Knight, Jimmy Cochran, Shane McConkey, and many other Olympians, US Ski Team members, and NCAA Champions.

In 2022, the ski area announced that they would be retiring the Suicide Six name citing the &quot;increasing awareness surrounding mental health&quot; and &quot;growing concerns about the insensitive nature of the historical name.&quot; The new name Saskadena (pronounced sahs-kah-deena) means &#x27;standing mountain&#x27; in the Abenaki language and was selected in consultation with Chief Don Stevens of the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk-Abenaki Nation &quot;to honor the original inhabitants of the land and the mountain’s multi-generational legacy and values of community, inclusion, adventure, discovery, and fun.&quot;

<doc id="185884" wikidata="Q7874733" url="?curid=185884" title="USS Thresher (SS-200)">
<text> was the most decorated United States Navy submarine of World War II, with 15 battle stars and a Navy Unit Commendation. &quot;Thresher&quot; was the third of twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines that were commissioned. All twelve fought in the war, and she was one of five to survive it.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Thresher&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 27 May 1939 at the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 27 March 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Cox Jones, wife of Rear Admiral Claud A. Jones and commissioned on 27 August 1940, with Lieutenant Commander William Lovett Anderson in command.

== August 1940–December 1941 ==
Following training and sea trials, &quot;Thresher&quot; got underway from New London, Connecticut on 25 October 1940 for engineering trials in Gravesend Bay, New York, and shakedown off the Dry Tortugas.

She operated along the United States East Coast into 1941. She departed on 1 May 1941 for the Caribbean Sea, transiting the Panama Canal on 9 May, stopping in San Diego, California, through 21 May, and arriving at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 31 May. She operated from the Hawaiian Islands into the fall of 1941, as tensions rose in the Far East and the United States prepared for war in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

&quot;Thresher&quot; and her sister ship departed Submarine Base Pearl Harbor on 31 October 1941 on a simulated war patrol north of Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Both carried live torpedoes. &quot;Tautog&quot; returned first, and on 7 December 1941 &quot;Thresher&quot; neared the main Hawaiian Islands to end her cruise. Escorted by the destroyer through Hawaiian waters lest she be mistaken for a hostile submarine, &quot;Thresher&quot; received word at 08:10 that Pearl Harbor was under attack by Japanese aircraft.

==Patrols==

===First and second===

&quot;Litchfield&quot; promptly set off to join American light forces departing from the harbor, leaving &quot;Thresher&quot; alone to conduct her first real war patrol. However, the destroyer was ordered back to escort; radio contact was established, and a rendezvous arranged, with &quot;Thresher&quot;. At the pre-appointed time, &quot;Thresher&quot; poked up her periscope to have a look, and noticed a destroyer—similar to &quot;Litchfield&quot;—approaching bows-on. Instead of a warm reception from friends, she got a hot reception from the destroyer&#x27;s forward gunners, who opened fire on her as soon as her black conning tower broke the surface. &quot;Thresher&quot; immediately went deep to avoid. She again tried to enter the harbor on 8 December, but was driven off by depth-bombs from a patrol plane, before finally arrived to provide safe conduct for the boat at midday.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 30 December 1941, &quot;Thresher&quot; headed for the Marshall and Mariana Islands. Reconnoitering Majuro, Arno, and Mili atolls from 9 to 13 January 1942, she shifted to waters off Japanese-held Guam in the early morning darkness of 4 February. A little before daybreak, a small freighter was sighted north of Agana Harbor and &quot;Thresher&quot; closed for the attack. She loosed a three-torpedo spread, holing the ship and sending it down by the bow and dead in the water. &quot;Thresher&quot; then fired another spread of torpedoes, but all missed. Upon returning to the scene one-half-hour later the ship was gone and &quot;Thresher&quot; thought she had scored a kill; postwar accounting did not substantiate it.

While &quot;en route&quot; home to Pearl Harbor on 24 February, an overzealous Navy plane attacked &quot;Thresher&quot; but did no damage and the sub safely returned to port on 26 February.

=== Third and fourth ===

After refit, &quot;Thresher&quot; departed 23 March 1942 for a patrol area near the Japanese home islands. There, she was to gather weather data off Honshū for use by Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s task force (the carriers and , then approaching Japan. Embarked in &quot;Hornet&quot; were 16 United States Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle, intended to attack Tokyo on 18 April.

Warned by of four Japanese submarines operating off Tokyo Bay, &quot;Thresher&quot; was detected by one of them and fired on, without damage.

On the morning of 10 April, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted a large Japanese freighter. A three-torpedo spread was fired and all missed as the target escaped in the mist. When the target emerged from the murk, &quot;Thresher&quot; was not in a position to launch another attack and proceeded on her way.

A second target was sighted later that day, and this time the hunting was better. One torpedo broke the back of freighter &quot;Sado Maru&quot; (3,000 tons) off Yokohama, sending it to the bottom in less than three minutes. The subsequent depth charge attack was delivered by three or four patrol vessels (one of the most severe of the war) caused &quot;Thresher&quot; to lose depth control and she plunged to , which was below her test depth, before control was regained. She then disobeyed orders and remained to assist Halsey.

On 13 April, running on the surface to recharge her batteries, &quot;Thresher&quot; took a wave over her conning tower. Water cascaded down the open hatch and rushed into the boat, shorting many electrical circuits. For a short time, there was a significant danger that chlorine gas would be released, but quick thinking and damage control prevented any hazard. Eventually, all shorts were repaired and the boat pumped out.

The next day, &quot;Thresher&quot; departed her assigned patrol area and turned her attention to gathering weather data. She conducted periscope patrols in the advance screen of Halsey&#x27;s task force, searching for any enemy craft that could warn the Japanese homeland. She was detached from this duty on 16 April and, after evading two Japanese patrol planes, returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 April.

On 26 June 1942, &quot;Thresher&quot; commenced her fourth war patrol heading for waters between the Palau and the Marshall Islands. On 6 July one torpedo struck home during an attack on a tanker off Enijun Pass. The two surface escorts were soon joined by aircraft and, after a three-hour depth charging, &quot;Thresher&quot; was able to resume her search for other targets.

Three days later, midway between Kwajalein and Wotje atolls, &quot;Thresher&quot; fired two torpedoes at a 4,836 ton torpedo boat tender which caused tremendous explosions as the tender sank beneath the waves. &quot;Thresher&quot; withdrew from expected countermeasures. Within an hour, two depth charges shook the boat, and ten minutes later, a banging and clanking alerted her to the fact the Japanese were apparently bringing a large grapnel into play in an attempt to capture the boat.

After applying full right rudder, &quot;Thresher&quot; made a 10‑minute high-speed run which shook her free from the giant hook. Then, as a depth charge exploded near her conning tower, the boat went deeper. Bending on rudder, &quot;Thresher&quot; left the enemy behind, with some 30-odd depth charges exploding in her wake. Shaken but not seriously damaged, &quot;Thresher&quot; made minor repairs as she headed for Truk to reconnoiter the passes leading into this enemy naval bastion.

Missing a freighter with torpedoes on the night of 20 July, &quot;Thresher&quot; surfaced in a rain squall before daybreak the next morning. The boat&#x27;s sonar picked up the sound of screws, close and closing. Soon an enemy patrol craft came into view, on a collision course. Surprisingly, the Japanese chose not to ram, but instead turned hard right, and came to a parallel course some away. &quot;Thresher&quot; went deep, while the enemy&#x27;s guns fired close but ineffective salvoes into the water ahead of the disappearing boat.

After escaping to the Palaus, &quot;Thresher&quot; tangled with an enemy Q-ship off Ambon in the former Netherlands East Indies. The two torpedoes she fired at the enemy failed to explode, and the Q-ship subjected &quot;Thresher&quot; to a salvo of eight depth charges before giving up the attack. Since she had been reassigned to the Southwest Pacific Submarine Force, &quot;Thresher&quot; sailed away from this encounter &quot;en route&quot; to Australian waters and terminated her fourth war patrol at Fremantle on 15 August.

=== Fifth and sixth ===

After refit, &quot;Thresher&quot; loaded mines and departed Fremantle on 15 September 1942, bound for the Gulf of Siam. She fired torpedoes at two freighters north of Lombok Strait on 19 September but was unable to determine the results of her attacks. On the night of 25 September, luck again failed to smile on her as a single torpedo streaked beneath a large, high-speed target in the Sulu Sea.

&quot;Thresher&quot; later surfaced at 23:00 and proceeded on a course which took her north to Pearl Bank. There, in the northernmost reaches of the Gulf of Siam, she made one of the first mine plants by a submarine in the Pacific War. These strategic mine fields laid by &quot;Thresher&quot; and her sisters in subsequent patrols, covered Japanese shipping lanes in areas of the Southwest Pacific Command previously unpatrolled by submarines. Later, these minefields filled the gap between patrol zones along the coastal waters of Malaya, Siam, and Indochina, when many boats were diverted to participate in the Solomon Islands campaign.

While reconnoitering off Balikpapan, Borneo, and the Celebes coast, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted a tanker aground on a reef off Kapoposang Island in the Java Sea. She soon surfaced for a deck gun attack and left the enemy ship with decks awash. The boat then returned to Fremantle on 12 November for refit.

Underway from Fremantle on 16 December 1942, she arrived off Soerabaya, Java, on 25 December. She intercepted a convoy of freighters, escorted by two destroyers, several subchasers, and two aircraft. Slipping past the escorts, &quot;Thresher&quot; sent five torpedoes towards the leading three ships. Two successive explosions followed. Rising to periscope depth, the boat observed the second ship in the column down by the bow, with her stern up in the air and her screws, still revolving, out of the water. A second ship lay dead in the water, enveloped in smoke. Escaping unscathed from this tangle with a coastal convoy, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted an enemy aircraft carrier the next night, but was picked up by escorts and held at bay for more than an hour while the tempting target faded into the night.

On the night of 29 December 1942, &quot;Thresher&quot; (now in the hands of William J. &quot;Moke&quot; Millican, Class of 1928) made contact with a 3,000-ton freighter. Just before midnight, she fired a spread of torpedoes at the cargo ship, but all missed or ran too deep. Undaunted, she waited for the moonrise and then surfaced to use her deck gun. Outmaneuvering the enemy, who tried to ram her, &quot;Thresher&quot; scored eight hits in succession with her main gun, where her target probably sank in the shallow water, one of the few sunk entirely by deck guns.

=== Seventh ===
After arriving back in Fremantle on 10 January 1943, the boat got underway 15 days later for her seventh war patrol, with four torpedoes short of a normal load. At 11:00 on 14 February, &quot;Thresher&quot; made contact with a Japanese &quot;I-65&quot; class submarine east of Thwartway Island. She launched two torpedoes; one was a dud, and the other exploded on the ocean bottom. Turning north and firing deck guns, &quot;Thresher&quot;&#x27;s adversary soon disappeared over the horizon.

Proceeding to the Flores Sea, &quot;Thresher&quot; intercepted a three-ship convoy escorted by two anti-submarine vessels on 21 February. One of the sub&#x27;s two torpedoes hit the stern of a transport. &quot;Thresher&quot; then evaded 13 depth charges before returning to periscope depth a little more than an hour later. She observed her target lying dead in the water while barges lightered troops to an undamaged mate. As escorts searched the waters nearby, &quot;Thresher&quot; closed and torpedoed the second transport, which had stopped to transfer survivors. Two loud explosions reverberated in the background as the boat dived to avoid possible countermeasures.

The following day, &quot;Thresher&quot; returned to celebrate Washington&#x27;s Birthday by finishing off the first transport which jack-knifed into a &quot;codice_1&quot; shape and sank within three minutes.

&quot;Thresher&quot; prowled for more game and came upon a tanker and a freighter on 2 March. A single torpedo hit on the 5,232-ton tanker and it sank. The freighter, sighting torpedo wakes, took evasive action to avoid being hit. Then, a nearby escort arrived on the scene and kept &quot;Thresher&quot; at bay while the target escaped. The boat subsequently concluded this patrol arriving at Fremantle on 10 March.

On her return to base, her skipper roundly criticized the torpedoes, especially the failure to sink the I-boat. Admiral Ralph W. Christie denied it and relieved him.

=== Eighth and ninth ===

Her eighth war patrol (commanded by Harry Hull, Class of 1932), lasting 4 April to 23 May 1943, was uneventful, but her ninth saw the boat score another kill. Off Balikpapan, Borneo, she sighted a three-ship convoy, escorted by a sole destroyer (&quot;Hokaze&quot;) on the night of 30 June 1943. After an unrewarding try with a trio of torpedoes, &quot;Thresher&quot; dodged the escort&#x27;s depth charging attack and returned for another attempt. Tracking with radar, &quot;Thresher&quot; set a tanker ablaze from stem to stern and scored hits on a 5,274-ton passenger freighter in the Makassar Strait.

Heading for Tambu Bay on the morning of 5 July, &quot;Thresher&quot; tracked a tanker. Chasing her quarry along the Sulawesi (Celebes) coast, the submarine lurked nearby until the escort left. &quot;Thresher&quot; then closed, loosed three torpedoes, and scored one hit on the bow of the enemy vessel. This blow failed to stop the tanker, which fired her guns to keep &quot;Thresher&quot; at bay as she escaped at high speed.

Four days later, &quot;Thresher&quot; arrived off Catmou Point, Negros Island. Under cover of darkness, the boat surfaced and delivered of stores and 40,000 rounds of ammunition to Filipino guerrillas. Receiving intelligence documents in return, &quot;Thresher&quot; got underway for a resumption of her patrol shortly before midnight on 9 July. She soon departed the Philippines and sailed &quot;via&quot; Midway Island and Pearl Harbor to the west coast for a major overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California.

=== Tenth ===

Newly refitted and again commanded by Harry Hull, &quot;Thresher&quot; departed the west coast on 8 October 1943 and arrived at Pearl Harbor one week later; she commenced her tenth war patrol on 1 November, bound for the waters north of the Caroline Islands. Prowling north of Truk, &quot;Thresher&quot; commenced tracking a five-ship convoy on the morning of 12 November and slipped past two escorts shortly before midnight.

She fired three torpedoes into a 4,862-ton transport. The next attack, another three torpedo spread, missed their mark. Escorting antisubmarine craft hunted in vain for the American attacker, dropping 20 depth charges in a harassing barrage.

=== Eleventh and twelfth ===

&quot;Thresher’s&quot; 11th war patrol (this one under command of Duncan C. MacMillan, Class of 1926) took her to the South China Sea south of Formosa. While cruising on the surface on 10 January 1944, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted a pair of masts, low on the horizon, and quickly dove to avoid possible detection. Coming to periscope depth soon thereafter, she approached cautiously, keeping in mind the ship may have been the advance screen of a convoy. The contact proved to be a 150-ton trawler. &quot;Thresher&quot; battle-surfaced, commencing fire at ; the trawler sank after &quot;Thresher&quot; expended 45 shells, 1,000 rounds of .50 cal (12.7 mm); and 770 rounds.

&quot;Thresher&quot; next set course for the Luzon Strait, between Batan Island and Luzon, in the Philippines. At 11:43 on 15 January, she came to the surface and spotted a Japanese aircraft carrier with an escorting destroyer soon thereafter. The boat submerged to periscope depth in time to observe two enemy destroyers rapidly approaching. With insufficient time to maneuver for a &quot;down the throat&quot; shot, &quot;Thresher&quot; went deep and rigged for silent running. The destroyer churned overhead and dropped four depth charges, none close. After remaining overhead two hours, dropping between ten and fifteen more depth charges, the enemy finally turned away, leaving &quot;Thresher&quot; unscathed.

Again coming to periscope depth at 17:00, &quot;Thresher&quot; soon sighted a four-ship convoy at with a single sub-chaser as escort. Surfacing at 19:11, &quot;Thresher&quot; began the chase, tracking the convoy by radar. The three leading targets steamed in column, with the escort between the third and fourth merchantmen. &quot;Thresher&quot; maneuvered to the west to silhouette the targets against the rising moon. The convoy changed course at 21:55, giving &quot;Thresher&quot; an excellent setup for her stern tubes. At 22:07, the boat let fly from with four torpedoes at the lead ship, a 6,960 ton freighter. &quot;Thresher&quot; observed two hits, and the vessel, its bow in the air, was observed in a sinking condition.

&quot;Thresher&quot; next fired three bow tubes at the second target, a 4,092 ton freighter. Three torpedoes struck the freighter and literally blew her to pieces. The cargo of oil burst into flames and illuminated the night as brightly as day.

The third ship started firing on &quot;Thresher&quot; with deck guns, passing down the port side at . With the submarine now readily visible, and her stern tubes dry, &quot;Thresher&quot; dove as bullets from the approaching escort splashed nearby. &quot;Thresher&quot; counted some 20 explosions from depth charges before the patrol craft left an hour later. Upon surfacing, &quot;Thresher&quot; was again alone and set off to patrol along the Singapore-to-Japan trade route.

On 26 January, &quot;Thresher&quot; made radar contact with a small convoy and soon spotted two ships steaming along beneath the overcast night skies. At 00:11, &quot;Thresher&quot; fired three bow torpedoes at a 1,266-ton freighter, then cleared the area. Her &quot;fish&quot; scored a bullseye, and the quarry disappeared within a minute. A second spread, 35 seconds after the first, claimed a 2,205-ton freighter. A third target made off to the south at high speed, &quot;spraying the ocean with five-inch ammunition&quot;. Resuming the approach at 00:20, &quot;Thresher&quot; doggedly tailed the Japanese ship for four hours before reaching a favorable attack position. Firing her last torpedoes at 04:46, &quot;Thresher&quot; began to build up speed and had just commenced a turn when one torpedo struck the enemy ship, causing a tremendous explosion. The blast slowed the freighter, but its tremendous concussion stopped &quot;Thresher&quot; dead in the water. All four main engine overspeed trips were actuated; cork insulation flew; lights broke; clocks stopped; and water poured down the antenna trunk. By the time &quot;Thresher&quot; regained battle readiness, the enemy was too far away to encourage further pursuit. Well within the range of shore-based aircraft, &quot;Thresher&quot; quit the chase. Escorts, alerted to the fact an American submarine was prowling in the vicinity, arrived on the scene and conducted a three-hour-long, futile, depth-charging.

On 28 and 29 January, &quot;Thresher&quot; patrolled the Formosa-to-Palau route, in the Luzon Strait, before returning &quot;via&quot; Midway Island to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 18 February. There, Lieutenant Commander MacMillan was awarded the Navy Cross for his aggressive action during the patrol.

&quot;Thresher&quot; went to sea again on 18 March 1944, departing Pearl Harbor for the central Caroline Islands. She remained on air-sea rescue (&quot;lifeguard&quot;) station during American carrier strikes on Truk, bombarded Oroluk Atoll on 11 April, and photographed islands in that group. The boat played &quot;hide and seek&quot; with numerous enemy aircraft and witnessed several American bombing raids on Truk. She sighted only two enemy ships and was unable to attack either, before she returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 May.

=== Thirteenth ===

On 14 June 1944, &quot;Thresher&quot; headed out for her 13th war patrol, again commanded by MacMillan. On 25 June, she joined a &quot;wolfpack&quot; that also included , , and . Nicknamed the &quot;Mickey Finns&quot; and under the overall command of Captain William V. &quot;Mickey&quot; O&#x27;Regan (flying his flag in &quot;Guardfish&quot;), the group picked up &quot;ditching signals&quot; from a downed aircraft that afternoon and changed course to investigate. Arriving in the vicinity on 27 June, they found only a drop tank and no trace of plane or pilot.

Over the succeeding days, the boats observed several planes but contacted only a few fishing vessels and small patrol craft. This drought of targets continued until 11 July, when &quot;Thresher&quot; made radar contact with a group of six ships steaming on the Formosa-Luzon route. As she changed course to intercept, she dispatched contact reports to the other boats. &quot;Guardfish&quot; and &quot;Apogon&quot; picked up the contact, but &quot;Piranha&quot; could not. &quot;Thresher&quot; deployed to a position astern of the convoy, to trail the enemy group and be ready to pick off stragglers. &quot;Guardfish&quot; took the enemy&#x27;s port flank, and &quot;Apogon&quot; maneuvered to the convoy&#x27;s starboard quarter.

A Japanese escort latched on to &quot;Thresher&quot;, however, and trailed her, depriving her of a chance to attack the convoy. Meanwhile, &quot;Piranha&quot; managed to sink a 6,504-ton passenger/cargo ship. &quot;Apogon&quot; was rammed and forced to return to base for repairs.

Rendezvousing on 13 July, the remaining boats resumed the hunt. At 16:00 on 16 July, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted smoke on the horizon. She surfaced and dispatched a contact report. After a cat-and-mouse period of some two hours, she noted the convoy consisted of six ships: a large tanker, three freighters, and two escorts.

&quot;Thresher&quot; closed beneath a clear and dark night sky. At 23:29, with the range to the near escort at , she commenced fire. Three torpedoes sped from the forward tubes toward the lead escort, three to the first freighter. &quot;Thresher&quot; then turned and emptied all four stern tubes at the second freighter. Four explosions were sighted and as &quot;Thresher&quot; departed at high speed, another six soon after.

Commencing a reload of her tubes at midnight (00.00 or 24.00), &quot;Thresher&quot; returned to the area and continued the attack on the convoy which consisted now of only three ships: a freighter, the oiler, and an escort. At 01:18, &quot;Thresher&quot; fired two bow tubes at the escort and three at the leading freighter; the sub then fired her stern tubes at the oiler. Soon thereafter, &quot;Thresher&quot; heard at least six explosions. The escort promptly began a depth charge barrage. Returning to periscope depth, &quot;Thresher&quot; found the convoy had remained stubbornly afloat. She began reloading her tubes again at 01.22 and returned to the chase.

While tube number six was still being reloaded, &quot;Thresher&quot; fired two other bow tubes at the freighter, two more at the oiler, and the remaining full one at the escort; she then swung about and fired one stern tube at the latter. Two torpedoes exploded at 02:46, and the cargo ship sank immediately. One minute later, two &quot;fish&quot; struck the oiler. A tremendous explosion lighted the entire sky, and the ship sank within 15 seconds.

While it could not be ascertained whether or not the last escort went down, the effect of two torpedo hits made it likely he had been heavily damaged. All torpedoes expended, &quot;Thresher&quot; headed for Midway. The boat claimed to have destroyed the entire convoy, but a post-war assessment confirmed only two cargo vessels, &quot;Sainei Maru&quot; (4,916 tons) and &quot;Shozan Maru&quot; (2,838 tons), and no escort. &quot;Thresher&quot; did, however, receive the Navy Unit Commendation for the patrol, and MacMillan received his second Navy Cross.

=== Fourteenth ===
Upon completion of voyage repairs (and with John R. Middleton Jr., Class of 1935, now at the helm), &quot;Thresher&quot; stood out of Midway on 23 August 1944, bound for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea on her fourteenth war patrol. Six days later, while cruising on the surface, &quot;Thresher&quot; was battered by heavy seas which caused the boat to roll some 53 degrees from the vertical and produced waves up to high.

Rounding the southern tip of Kyūshū, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted several small craft before making contact with a minelayer and two subchasers on 10 September. Clearing the vicinity at high speed, &quot;Thresher&quot; headed for a new patrol area.

&quot;Thresher&quot; was twice frustrated on 13 September, when a large oiler passed far out of reach and a freighter, attacked with four torpedoes, refused to sink. An escorting aircraft harried the boat and prevented any further attacks.

At 15:31 on 18 September, &quot;Thresher&quot; sighted the masts, funnel and bridge of a ship on the horizon. After determining the enemy&#x27;s base course and zigzag plan, &quot;Thresher&quot; surfaced and locked on the freighter with radar at 19:23. Another pip, an escort vessel, soon appeared on radar.

By 21:00, &quot;Thresher&quot; had maneuvered into position off the enemy&#x27;s port bow and waited for the Japanese ships to make a zig which would place her at a desirable point for the attack. &quot;Thresher&quot; closed in for the kill and loosed four torpedoes as the group turned to the right. The Japanese, however, did not meet her prediction, and the first spread ran wide of its targets. Still undetected, &quot;Thresher&quot; quickly came about and fired four stern &quot;fish&quot; from . The second spread ran true, hitting 6,854-ton freighter &quot;Gyōkū Maru&quot;. The explosions broke the cargoman&#x27;s back, and she quickly slipped from sight. &quot;Thresher&quot; retired at high speed when she detected the presence of three additional ships closing rapidly.

&quot;Thresher&quot; reloaded and turned upon her pursuers, loosing a spread of torpedoes which barely missed. She evaded her hunters and shifted to waters off Manchuria. The boat sighted only fishing craft until 26 August, when a large cargo vessel hove into sight at 09:44. &quot;Thresher&quot; surfaced at 13:15 and headed for the nearest point on the enemy&#x27;s zigzag course. An hour later, the submarine spotted a floatplane on patrol, and hurriedly dived. As she went deep, one depth charge exploded nearby.

Staying under until 16:00, &quot;Thresher&quot; came to the surface and reacquired her target at 18:15. Tracking until sunset, she postulated the enemy vessel was bound for Daisei Gunto and an intercept course was plotted accordingly. Attacking from the bright moon side, &quot;Thresher&quot; fired two bow tubes, aiming one torpedo at the hull near the mainmast and one at the foremast. Both struck home, and the 1,468-ton freighter broke up and sank within a minute.

The following day, 26 September, &quot;Thresher&quot; came upon a 5,000-ton oiler and cut loose with four stern tubes from a range of . Those on the bridge saw the target disappear within a minute. Tubes dry, &quot;Thresher&quot; headed for Midway. &quot;En route&quot;, on 3 October, she sighted, tracked, and approached a small trawler. After sunset, &quot;Thresher&quot; surfaced and manned her deck guns. After firing 27 rounds of five-inch ammunition, the boat soon received close return fire which forced her to back off. Too dark to see the target, &quot;Thresher&quot; resumed her passage to Midway.

After fueling at Midway on 8 October, &quot;Thresher&quot; sailed for the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 October 1944. Following a lengthy refit, &quot;Thresher&quot; got underway on 31 January 1945 for the Marianas, in company with , , and . Remaining at Saipan overnight on 12–13 February, the impromptu wolf pack pushed on toward its assigned patrol areas north of Luzon. However, only two of &quot;Thresher&quot;″s contacts developed into attacks. One failed due to the target&#x27;s shallow draft; and the second contact evaded. &quot;Thresher&quot; did, however, conduct air-sea guard patrols; and conducted a shore bombardment of Basco Harbor, Batan Island, on 28 March. The latter part of this patrol was conducted in company with &quot;Piranha&quot; and .

== End of active duty ==

Clearing her patrol station, &quot;Thresher&quot; nested alongside for voyage repairs before pushing on for Oahu on 4 April 1945. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 20 days later, &quot;Thresher&quot; ended her active combat service, after fifteen war patrols. Undergoing a routine refit and voyage repairs, &quot;Thresher&quot; subsequently rendered target training services out of Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok. She was operating out of the latter base on 15 August 1945 when the war in the Pacific ended.

&quot;Thresher&quot; cleared Eniwetok on 15 September, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 September, and stood out to sea on 26 September. Making port at San Francisco, on 4 October, the boat subsequently left the West Coast on 31 October. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 November and arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 18 November. She was decommissioned there on 13 December 1945.

&quot;Thresher&quot; was recommissioned on 6 February 1946 to be used as a target during atomic bomb test at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. However, during the refurbishing, it was decided she had deteriorated beyond economical repair, and work was stopped. &quot;Thresher&quot; was decommissioned for the final time on 12 July 1946. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 December 1947, and on 18 March 1948 sold for scrap to Max Siegel of Everett, Massachusetts.

==Honors and awards==
* Navy Unit Commendation for World War II service
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 15 battle stars for World War II service

&quot;Thresher&quot; was the most decorated U.S. submarine and among the most decorated U.S. ships of World War II.

==In culture==

&quot;Thresher&quot; is the subject of the third episode of the first season of syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. The episode, entitled &quot;The End of the Line,&quot; aired 5 Apr 1957. It portrayed the Japanese attempt to grab Thresher with a grappling hook when she was off Kwajalein in July 1942.

&quot;Thresher&quot; was also the subject of the sixth episode of the second season of syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. The episode, entitled &quot;The Thresher Story,&quot; recounts the events of firing her 3&quot; gun on her Fifth war patrol and being subsequently refitted with &quot;an old relic,&quot; a 5&quot;/51 (which had entered service in 1911).

<doc id="185885" wikidata="Q2164015" url="?curid=185885" title="USS Thresher (SSN-593)">
<text>USS &quot;Thresher&quot; (SSN-593) was the lead boat of her class of nuclear-powered attack submarines in the United States Navy. She was the U.S. Navy&#x27;s second submarine to be named after the thresher shark.

On 10 April 1963, &quot;Thresher&quot; sank during deep-diving tests about east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, killing all 129 crew and shipyard personnel aboard. Her loss was a watershed for the U.S. Navy, leading to the implementation of a rigorous submarine safety program known as SUBSAFE. The first nuclear submarine lost at sea, &quot;Thresher&quot; was also the third of four submarines lost with more than 100 people aboard, the others being the French &quot;Surcouf&quot;, sinking with 130 personnel in 1942, USS &quot;Argonaut&quot;, lost with 102 aboard in 1943, and Russian &quot;Kursk&quot;, which sank with 118 aboard in 2000.

==Significance of design and loss==

Created to find and destroy Soviet submarines, &quot;Thresher&quot; was the fastest and quietest submarine of its day, matching the smaller, contemporary . She also had the most advanced weapons system, including launchers for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s newest anti-submarine missile, the SUBROC, as well as passive and active sonar that could detect vessels at unprecedented range. Shortly after her loss, the Commander of Submarine Force Atlantic wrote in the March 1964 issue of the U.S. Naval Institute&#x27;s monthly journal &quot;Proceedings&quot; that &quot;the Navy had depended upon this performance to the extent that it had asked for and received authority to build 14 of these ships, as well as an additional 11 submarines with very much the same characteristics. This was the first time since World War II that we had considered our design sufficiently advanced to embark upon construction of a large class of general-purpose attack submarines.&quot;

Following Navy tradition, this class of subs was originally named &quot;Thresher&quot; after the lead boat. When &quot;Thresher&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 April 1963, the class name was changed to that of the second boat, . Having been lost at sea, &quot;Thresher&quot; was not decommissioned by the U.S. Navy and remains on &quot;Eternal Patrol&quot;.

==Early career==

The contract to build &quot;Thresher&quot; was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 15 January 1958, and her keel was laid on 28 May 1958. She was launched bow first on 9 July 1960, was sponsored by Mary B. Warder (wife of World War II skipper Frederick B. Warder), and was commissioned on 3 August 1961, Commander Dean L. Axene commanding.

&quot;Thresher&quot; conducted lengthy sea trials in the western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea areas in 1961–1962. These tests allowed a thorough evaluation of her many new and complex technological features and weapons. She took part in Nuclear Submarine Exercise (NUSUBEX) 3–61 off the northeastern coast of the United States from 18–24 September 1961.

On 18 October 1961, &quot;Thresher,&quot; in company with the diesel-electric submarine , headed south on a three-week test and training cruise to San Juan, Puerto Rico, arriving 2 November. Following customary procedure while in port, her reactor was shut down. Since no shore power connection was available in San Juan, the ship&#x27;s backup diesel generator was used to carry the &quot;hotel&quot; electrical loads. Several hours later, the backup generator broke down and the electrical load was transferred to the ship&#x27;s battery. As most of the battery power was needed to keep vital systems operating and to restart the reactor, lighting and air conditioning were shut down. Without air conditioning, temperature and humidity in the submarine rose, reaching after about 10 hours. The crew attempted to repair the diesel generator (four men would receive Navy commendation medals for their work that night). After it became apparent that the generator could not be fixed before the battery was depleted, the crew tried to restart the reactor, but the remaining battery charge was insufficient. The captain, returning to the ship from a shore function, arrived just after the battery ran down. The crew eventually borrowed cables from another ship in the harbor and connected them to the adjacent &quot;Cavalla&quot;, which started her diesels and provided enough power to allow &quot;Thresher&quot; to restart her reactor.

&quot;Thresher&quot; conducted further trials and fired test torpedoes before returning to Portsmouth on 29 November 1961. The boat remained in port through the end of the year, and spent the first two months of 1962 with her sonar and SUBROC systems under evaluation. In March, she participated in NUSUBEX 2–62 (an exercise designed to improve the tactical capabilities of nuclear submarines) and in anti-submarine warfare training with Task Group ALPHA.

Off Charleston, South Carolina, &quot;Thresher&quot; undertook operations supporting development of the SUBROC anti-submarine missile. She returned briefly to New England waters, after which she proceeded to Florida for more SUBROC tests. While moored at Port Canaveral, Florida, the submarine was accidentally struck by a tug, which damaged one of her ballast tanks. After repairs at Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Company, &quot;Thresher&quot; went south for more tests and trials off Key West, Florida, then returned northward. The submarine entered Portsmouth Shipyard on 16 July 1962 to begin a scheduled six-month post-shakedown availability to examine systems and make repairs and corrections as necessary. As is typical with a first-of-class boat, the work took longer than expected, lasting nearly nine months. The ship was finally recertified and undocked on 8 April 1963.

==Sinking==
On 9 April 1963, &quot;Thresher&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Commander John Wesley Harvey, left from Kittery, Maine, at 8:00 a.m. and met with the submarine rescue ship at 11:00 a.m. to begin her initial post-overhaul dive trials, in an area some east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. That afternoon, &quot;Thresher&quot; conducted an initial trim-dive test, surfaced, and then performed a second dive to half of her 1,300-foot (400-meter) test depth. Before she entered the yard in late 1962, the Thresher had been to her test depth about 40 times. She remained submerged overnight and re-established underwater communications with &quot;Skylark&quot; at 6:30 a.m. on 10 April to commence deep-dive trials. Following standard practice, &quot;Thresher&quot; slowly dove deeper as she traveled in circles under &quot;Skylark&quot; – to remain within communications distance – pausing every of depth to check the integrity of all systems. As &quot;Thresher&quot; neared her test depth, &quot;Skylark&quot; received garbled communications over underwater telephone indicating &quot; ...  minor difficulties, have positive up-angle, attempting to blow&quot;, and then a final, even more garbled message that included the number &quot;900&quot;. When &quot;Skylark&quot; received no further communication, surface observers gradually realized a problem had occurred.

By mid-afternoon, 15 Navy ships were en route to the search area. At 6:30 p.m., the commander of Submarine Force Atlantic sent word to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to begin notifying the crew&#x27;s family members, starting with Commander Harvey&#x27;s wife Irene, that &quot;Thresher&quot; was missing.

Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George W. Anderson Jr. went before the press corps at the Pentagon to announce that the submarine was lost with all hands. President John F. Kennedy ordered all flags to be flown at half staff from 12 to 15 April in honor of the 129 lost submariners and shipyard personnel.

==Search and recovery==

By morning on 11 April, submarines USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; and USS &quot;Sea Owl&quot;, both operating near &quot;Thresher’&quot;s location, were ordered to join in the search for the missing submarine. The Navy quickly mounted an extensive search with surface ships and support from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), with its deep-search capability. The laboratory&#x27;s small acoustic research vessel &quot;Rockville&quot;, with a unique trainable search sonar, left on 12 April 1963 for the search area. &quot;Rockville&quot; was to be followed by other personnel with a deep-camera system. , , and became engaged in a close sonar search of an area square. , , and investigated likely contacts found in the sonar search. The NRL deep-towed camera system and personnel later operated from &quot;James M. Gilliss&quot; with some success, finding debris later confirmed to be from &quot;Thresher&quot;. The bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot; was alerted on 11 April and brought from San Diego to Boston. It was deployed for two series of dives into the debris field; the first taking place from 24 to 30 June, and the second from late August until early September. The equipment-handling capability of &quot;Gilliss&quot; proved inadequate, even hazardous, to handle the towed vehicle, and the entire search was paused in September.

The inadequacy of the existing small Auxiliary General Oceanographic Research (AGOR) vessels such as &quot;James M. Gilliss&quot; for handling deep-towed search vehicles led to a search for a vessel of a size and configuration that could handle such equipment in a sheltered area. In late 1963, that search resulted in the acquisition of , with the intent to eventually add a sheltered center well for deploying equipment.

The 1964 search included &quot;Mizar&quot; (with partial modifications but not a center well), , and &quot;Trieste II&quot;, &quot;Trieste&quot;″s successor. That submersible incorporated parts of the original bathyscaphe and was completed in early 1964. The bathyscaphe was placed on board and shipped to Boston. &quot;Mizar&quot; did have a system called Underwater Tracking Equipment (UTE) by which it could track its towed vehicle, and it was planned for use to track &quot;Trieste&quot;. Before her departure from NRL in Washington, &quot;Mizar&quot; was equipped with highly sensitive proton magnetometers furnished by the instrument division of Varian Associates in Palo Alto. In use, the magnetometers were suspended on an electrical line that also towed underwater video cameras.

&quot;Mizar&quot; sailed on 25 June to begin the deep search and found the wreck within two days. The shattered remains of &quot;Thresher&quot;″s hull were on the sea floor, about below the surface, in five major sections. Most of the debris had spread over an area of about . Major sections of &quot;Thresher&quot;, including the sail, sonar dome, bow section, engineering spaces section, operations spaces section, and the stern planes were found. By July 22, most of the lost submarine had been photographed. In early August, the entire task force returned to the area with the submersible. Its first two dives were unsuccessful, but on the third dive, the UTE enabled placement of &quot;Trieste II&quot; on the wreck, at first not seeing wreckage because the bathyscaphe was sitting upon it.

&quot;Trieste II&quot; was commanded by Lieutenant John B. Mooney Jr., with co-pilot Lieutenant John H. Howland and Captain Frank Andrews, in an operation that recovered parts of the wreckage in September 1964.

On 9 July 2021, the United States Navy declassified the narrative of the submarine &quot;Seawolf&quot; during the search for &quot;Thresher&quot;. &quot;Seawolf&quot; detected acoustic signals at 23.5 kHz and 3.5 kHz as well as metal banging noises which were interpreted at the time as originating from &quot;Thresher&quot;. However, after the commander of Task Group 89.7 ordered that echo ranging and fathometers be secured so as to not interfere with the search, no further acoustic signals were detected by &quot;Seawolf&quot; other than those originating from other searching ships and the submarine &quot;Sea Owl&quot;. Ultimately, the Court of Inquiry determined:

==Cause==
Deep-sea photography, recovered artifacts, and an evaluation of &quot;Thresher&quot;&#x27;s design and operational history permitted a court of inquiry to conclude that the submarine had probably suffered the failure of a salt-water piping system joint that relied heavily on silver brazing instead of welding. Earlier tests using ultrasound equipment found potential problems with about 14% of the tested brazed joints, most of which were determined not to pose a risk significant enough to require repair. But on 30 November 1960, nearly three years prior to the accident, suffered such a silver-braze joint failure near test depth while on an exercise, flooding the engine room with an estimated 18 tons of water in the 3 minutes it took to surface under power and with blown tanks. This incident was followed months later by more silver-braze failures aboard the ballistic missile submarine during trials. High-pressure water spraying from a broken pipe joint may have shorted out one of the many electrical panels, causing a shutdown (&quot;scram&quot;) of the reactor, which in turn caused loss of propulsion.

The inability to blow the ballast tanks was later attributed to excessive moisture in the submarine&#x27;s high-pressure air flasks, moisture that froze and plugged the flasks&#x27; flowpaths while passing through the valves. This was later simulated in dockside tests on &quot;Thresher&quot;″s sister sub, . During a test to simulate blowing ballast at or near test depth, ice formed on strainers installed in valves; the flow of air lasted only a few seconds. Air dryers were later retrofitted to the high-pressure air compressors, beginning with &quot;Tinosa&quot;, to permit the emergency blow system to operate properly. Submarines typically rely on speed and deck angle (angle of attack) rather than deballasting to surface; they are propelled at an angle toward the surface. Ballast tanks were almost never blown at depth, as doing so could cause the submarine to rocket to the surface out of control. Normal procedure was to drive the submarine to periscope depth, raise the periscope to verify that the area was clear, and then blow the tanks and surface the submarine.

Subsequent study of SOSUS (sound surveillance system) data from the time of the incident has given rise to doubts as to whether flooding preceded the reactor scram, as no impact sounds of the high pressure water in the compartments of the submarine could be detected on instrument recordings from SOSUS at the time. Such flooding would have caused a significant sonic event, and the recorded data yielded no such evidence.

At the time, reactor-plant operating procedures did not allow for a rapid reactor restart following a scram, or even the ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to propel the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an overly rapid cool-down of the reactor. &quot;Thresher&quot;″s reactor control officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole—a &quot;mustang&quot; with years of submarine service in enlisted status, serving as a chief petty officer aboard the first nuclear submarine, USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571), before becoming a commissioned officer—was not on the boat during the fatal dive; his trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard operating procedures and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though &quot;Thresher&quot; was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure that he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to &quot;answer bells&quot; and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover noted that the procedures were for normal operating conditions, and not intended to restrict necessary actions in an emergency involving the safety of the ship. After the accident Rickover further reduced plant restart times, which had already been gradually improving with new technology and operating experience, in addition to limiting factors that could cause a shutdown.

In a dockside simulation of flooding in the engine room, held before &quot;Thresher&quot; sailed, the watch in charge took 20 minutes to isolate a simulated leak in the auxiliary seawater system. At test depth with the reactor shut down, &quot;Thresher&quot; would not have had 20 minutes to recover. Even after isolating a short circuit in the reactor controls, it would have taken nearly 10 minutes to restart the plant.

It was believed at the time that &quot;Thresher&quot; likely imploded at a depth of , though 2013 acoustic analysis concluded implosion occurred at .

==Later events==
The aftermath of the public relations aspect of this major disaster has since been part of various case studies.

The U.S. Navy has periodically monitored the environmental conditions of the site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. naval nuclear-powered craft. These reports provide results of the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine life, which is performed to ascertain whether &quot;Thresher&quot;″s nuclear reactor has had a significant effect on the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting deep-sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm that there has been no significant effect on the environment. Nuclear fuel in the submarine remains intact.

Information declassified in the 2008 National Geographic Documentary &quot;Titanic: Ballard&#x27;s Secret Mission&quot; shows that USNR Commander Robert Ballard, the oceanographer credited with locating the wreck of , was sent by the Navy on a mission under cover of the search for &quot;Titanic&quot; to map and collect visual data on the wrecks of both &quot;Thresher&quot; and . Ballard had approached the Navy in 1982 for funding to find &quot;Titanic&quot; with his new deep-diving robot submersible. The Navy conditionally granted him the funds on condition that the submarine wrecks were surveyed before &quot;Titanic&quot;. Ballard&#x27;s robotic survey showed that the depth at which &quot;Thresher&quot; had sunk caused implosion and total destruction; the only recoverable piece was a foot of mangled pipe. His 1985 search for &quot;Scorpion&quot; revealed a large debris field &quot;as though it had been put through a shredding machine&quot;. His obligation to inspect the wrecks completed, and with the radioactive threat from both established as small, Ballard then searched for &quot;Titanic&quot;. Financial limitations allowed him 12 days to search, and the debris-field search technique he had used for the two submarines was applied to locate &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Almost all records of the court of inquiry remain unavailable to the public. In 1998, the Navy began declassifying them, but decided in 2012 that it would not release them to the public. In February 2020, in response to a FOIA lawsuit by military historian James Bryant, a federal court ordered the Navy to begin releasing documents by May 2020.

On May 22, 2020, the Navy stated in a court-mandated status report that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Navy&#x27;s Undersea Warfare Division (OPNAV N97) had placed the records review on hold as N97 staff were limited to supporting mission-essential tasks supporting undersea forces and operations only. However, the Navy stated that they &quot;will return to the review and process of Plaintiff’s FOIA request once the office is able to expand beyond mission-essential capabilities&quot;. Following the release of the July 18, 2020, court-mandated report, the Navy stated that they had identified and approved additional resources and reservists to begin processing the documents in August. The Navy began a rolling release of the records on September 23, 2020.

==Disaster sequence of 10 April 1963==


During the 1963 inquiry, Admiral Hyman Rickover stated:

I believe the loss of the &quot;Thresher&quot; should not be viewed solely as the result of failure of a specific braze, weld, system or component, but rather should be considered a consequence of the philosophy of design, construction and inspection that has been permitted in our naval shipbuilding programs. I think it is important that we re-evaluate our present practices where, in the desire to make advancements, we may have forsaken the fundamentals of good engineering.

==Alternative theory of the sinking: electrical failure==
On 8 April 2013, Bruce Rule, US Office of Naval Intelligence lead acoustic analyst for over 42 years, published his own analysis of the data collected by USS &quot;Skylark&quot; and Atlantic SOSUS arrays in a paper in the &quot;Navy Times&quot;. Rule based his analysis on SOSUS data that was highly classified in 1963, was not discussed in open session of the Court of Inquiry and was not revealed at the congressional hearings. A retired Navy captain and former commanding officer of the same class of submarine as &quot;Thresher&quot;, citing Rule&#x27;s findings, has called for the U.S. government to declassify the data associated with the boat&#x27;s sinking, and presented an alternative disaster sequence based upon the acoustic data.

Rule concluded that the primary cause of the sinking was a failure of the electrical bus that powered the main coolant pumps. According to Rule, SOSUS data indicates that after two minutes of electrical instability, the bus failed at 09:11 a.m., causing the main coolant pumps to trip off. This caused an immediate reactor scram, resulting in a loss of propulsion. &quot;Thresher&quot; could not be deballasted because ice had formed in the high-pressure air pipes, and so she sank. Rule&#x27;s analysis holds that flooding (whether from a silver brazed joint or anywhere else) played no role in the reactor scram or the sinking, and that &quot;Thresher&quot; was intact until she imploded. In addition to the SOSUS data that does not record any sound of flooding, the crew of &quot;Skylark&quot; did not report hearing any noise that sounded like flooding, and &quot;Skylark&quot; was able to communicate with &quot;Thresher&quot;, despite the fact that, at test depth, even a small leak would have produced a deafening roar. Additionally, the previous commander of &quot;Thresher&quot; testified that he would not have described flooding, even from a small-diameter pipe, as a &quot;minor problem&quot;.

Rule interprets the communication &quot;900&quot; from &quot;Thresher&quot; at 09:17 a.m. as a reference to test depth, signifying that &quot;Thresher&quot; was below her test depth of , or below sea level. According to Rule the SOSUS data indicates an implosion of &quot;Thresher&quot; at 09:18:24, at a depth of , below her predicted collapse depth. The implosion took 0.1 seconds, too fast for the human nervous system to perceive.

==SUBSAFE legacy==
When the Court of Inquiry delivered its final report, it recommended that the Navy implement a more rigorous program of design review and safety inspections during construction. That program, launched in December 1963, was known as SUBSAFE. From 1915 to 1963, the U.S. Navy lost a total of 16 submarines to non-combat accidents. Since the inception of SUBSAFE only one submarine has suffered a similar fate, and that was , which sank in 1968 for reasons still undetermined. &quot;Scorpion&quot; was not SUBSAFE-certified.

* &quot;The Fear-Makers&quot;, an episode in the 1964 season of the television series &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, is inspired by the loss of the USS &quot;Thresher&quot;. Anthony Wilson, a writer for the series, was fascinated by the loss of the USS &quot;Thresher&quot; (and with &#x27;fear gas&#x27; as an incapacitating chemical weapon aboard the submarines, an agent similar to the contemporary BZ gas), and he wrote a teleplay for the series. In Wilson&#x27;s teleplay, the submarine, &quot;Seaview&quot;, searches for a missing submarine, &quot;Polidor&quot;.

<text>Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain.

The typical partial pressure reference values are oxygen Pa  more than 80 mmHg (11 kPa) and carbon dioxide Pa  less than 45 mmHg (6.0 kPa).

== Cause ==
A variety of conditions that can potentially result in respiratory failure. The etiologies of each type of respiratory failure (see below) may differ, as well. Different types of conditions may cause respiratory failure:
* Conditions that reduce the flow of air into and out of the lungs, including physical obstruction by foreign bodies or masses and reduced breathing due to drugs or changes to the chest.
*Conditions that impair the lungs&#x27; blood supply. These include thromboembolic conditions and conditions that reduce the output of the right heart, such as right heart failure and some myocardial infarctions.
* Conditions that limit the ability of the lung tissue to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the air within the lungs. Any disease which can damage the lung tissue can fit into this category. The most common causes are (in no particular order) infections, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary edema.
==Types==
Respiratory failure is generally organized into 4 types. Below is a diagram that provides a general overview of the 4 types of respiratory failure, their distinguishing characteristics, and major causes of each.

===Type 1===
Type 1 respiratory failure is characterized by a low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) (PaO2) &lt; 60 mmHg with a normal (normocapnia) or low (hypocapnia) level of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in the blood.

The fundamental defect in type 1 respiratory failure is a failure of oxygenation characterized by:

Type I respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect oxygenation and therefore lead to lower-than-normal oxygen in the blood. These include:

* Low ambient oxygen (e.g. at high altitude).
* Ventilation-perfusion mismatch (parts of the lung receive oxygen but not enough blood to absorb it, e.g. pulmonary embolism, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Congestive heart failure.
* Alveolar hypoventilation (decreased minute volume due to reduced respiratory muscle activity, e.g. in acute neuromuscular disease); this form can also cause type 2 respiratory failure if severe.
* Diffusion problem (oxygen cannot enter the capillaries due to parenchymal disease, e.g. in pneumonia or ARDS).
* Right-to-left shunt (oxygenated blood mixes with non-oxygenated blood from the venous system, e.g. Arteriovenous malformation, Complete atelectasis, Severe pneumonia, Severe pulmonary edema).

===Type 2===
Hypoxemia (PaO2 &lt;8kPa or normal) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 &gt;6.0kPa).

The basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:

Type 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected. Defined as the buildup of carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2) that has been generated by the body but cannot be eliminated. The underlying causes include:
* Increased airways resistance (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, suffocation)
* Reduced breathing effort (drug effects, brain stem lesion, extreme obesity)
* A decrease in the area of the lung available for gas exchange (such as in chronic bronchitis)
* Neuromuscular problems (Guillain–Barré syndrome, motor neuron disease)
* Deformed (kyphoscoliosis), rigid (ankylosing spondylitis), or flail chest.

===Type 3===
Type 3 respiratory failure is a type of Type 1 respiratory failure, with decreased PaO2 (hypoxemia) and either normal or decreased PaCO2. However, because of its prevalence, it has been given its own category. Type 3 respiratory failure is often referred to as peri-operative respiratory failure, because it is distinguished by being a Type 1 respiratory failure that is specifically associated with an operation, procedure, or surgery.

The pathophysiology of type 3 respiratory failure often includes lung atelectasis, which is a term used to describe a collapsing of the functional units of the lung that allow for gas exchange. Because atelectasis occurs so commonly in the perioperative period, this form is also called perioperative respiratory failure. After general anesthesia, decreases in functional residual capacity leads to collapse of dependent lung units.

===Type 4===
Type 4 respiratory failure occurs when metabolic (oxygen) demands exceed what the cardiopulmonary system can provide. It often results from hypoperfusion of respiratory muscles as in patients in shock, such as cardiogenic shock or hypovolemic shock. Patients in shock often experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (e.g., in cardiogenic shock). Lactic acidosis and anemia can also result in type 4 respiratory failure. However, type 1 and 2 are the most widely accepted.

== Physical exam==
Physical exam findings often found in patients with respiratory failure include findings indicative of impaired oxygenation (low blood oxygen level). These include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Accessory muscle use in breathing or other signs of respiratory distress
* Altered mental status (eg. confusion, lethargy)
* Clubbing of fingertips (see image right)
* Peripheral cyanosis (eg. bluish color on mucosal membranes or fingers and/or toes)
* Tachypnea (faster breathing rate)
* Pale conjunctiva
People with respiratory failure often exhibit other signs or symptoms that are associated with the underlying cause of their respiratory failure. For instance, if respiratory failure is caused by cardiogenic shock (decreased perfusion due to heart dysfunction, symptoms of heart dysfunction (e.g., pitting edema) are also expected.

== Diagnosis ==
Arterial blood gas (ABG) assessment is considered the gold standard diagnostic test for establishing a diagnosis of respiratory failure. This is because ABG can be used to measure blood oxygen levels (PaO2), and respiratory failure (all types) is characterized by a low blood oxygen level.

Alternative or supporting diagnostic methods include the following:

* Capnometry: measures the amount of carbon dioxide in exhaled air.
* Pulse Oximetry: measures the fraction of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen (SpO2).

Imaging (eg. ultrasonography, radiography) may be used to assist in the diagnostic workup. For example, it may be utilized to determine the etiology of a person&#x27;s respiratory failure. 
==Treatment==

Treatment of the underlying cause is required, if possible. The treatment of acute respiratory failure may involve medication such as bronchodilators (for airways disease), antibiotics (for infections), glucocorticoids (for numerous causes), diuretics (for pulmonary oedema), amongst others. Respiratory failure resulting from an overdose of opioids may be treated with the antidote naloxone. In contrast, most benzodiazepine overdose does not benefit from its antidote, flumazenil. Respiratory therapy/respiratory physiotherapy may be beneficial in some cases of respiratory failure.

Type 1 respiratory failure may require oxygen therapy to achieve adequate oxygen saturation. Lack of oxygen response may indicate other modalities such as heated humidified high-flow therapy, continuous positive airway pressure or (if severe) endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. .

Type 2 respiratory failure often requires non-invasive ventilation (NIV) unless medical therapy can improve the situation. Mechanical ventilation is sometimes indicated immediately or otherwise if NIV fails. Respiratory stimulants such as doxapram are now rarely used.

There is tentative evidence that in those with respiratory failure identified before arrival in hospital, continuous positive airway pressure can be helpful when started before conveying to hospital.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis is highly variable and dependent on etiology and availability of appropriate treatment and management. One of three hospitalized cases of acute respiratory failure is fatal.

<text>In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum.

The taxonomic rank of &quot;subdivision&quot; in fungi and plant taxonomy is equivalent to &quot;subphylum&quot; in zoological taxonomy. Some plant taxonomists have also used the rank of subphylum, for instance monocotyledons as a subphylum of phylum Angiospermae and vertebrates as a subphylum of phylum Chordata.

== Taxonomic rank ==
Subphylum is:
#subordinate to the phylum 
#superordinate to the infraphylum, which is in turn superordinate to microphylum.

Where convenient, subphyla in turn can be divided into infraphyla; in turn such an infraphylum also would be superordinate to any classes or superclasses in the hierarchy.

== Examples ==
Not all fauna phyla are divided into subphyla. Those that are include: 
*Arthropoda: divided into subphyla Trilobitomorpha, Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Hexapoda and Crustacea,
*Brachiopoda: divided into subphyla Linguliformea, Craniformea and Rhynchonelliformea,
*Chordata: divided into Tunicata, Cephalochordata, and its largest subphylum Vertebrata.

Examples of infraphyla include the Mycetozoa, the Gnathostomata and the Agnatha.

<text>Club drugs, also called rave drugs or party drugs, are a loosely defined category of recreational drugs which are associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music (EDM) parties, and raves in the 1980s to today. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates and benzodiazepines, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club drugs are a &quot;category of convenience&quot;, in which drugs are included due to the locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while under the influence of the drugs. Club drugs are generally used by adolescents and young adults.
Club drugs range from entactogens such as MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;), 2C-B (&quot;nexus&quot;) and inhalants (e.g., nitrous oxide and poppers) to stimulants (e.g., amphetamine and cocaine), depressants/sedatives (Quaaludes, GHB, Rohypnol) and psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs (LSD and DMT). Dancers at all-night parties and dance events have used some of these drugs for their stimulating properties since the 1960s Mod subculture in U.K., whose members took amphetamine to stay up all night. In the 1970s disco scene, the club drugs of choice shifted to the stimulant cocaine and the depressant Quaaludes. Quaaludes were so common at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed &quot;disco biscuits&quot;. In the 1990s and 2000s, methamphetamine and MDMA are sold and used in many clubs. &quot;Club drugs&quot; vary by country and region; in some regions, even opiates such as heroin and morphine have been sold at clubs, though this practice is relatively uncommon. Narconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as &quot;Ecstasy&quot;, include harmaline; piperazines (e.g., BZP and TFMPP); PMA/PMMA; mephedrone (generally used outside the US) and MDPV.

The legal status of club drugs varies according to the region and the drug. Some drugs are legal in some jurisdictions, such as &quot;poppers&quot; (which are often sold as &quot;room deodorizer&quot; or &quot;leather polish&quot; to get around drug laws) and nitrous oxide (which is legal when used from a whipped cream can). Other club drugs, such as amphetamine, are generally illegal unless the individual has a medical prescription. Some club drugs are almost always illegal, such as cocaine and MDMA.

There are a range of risks from using club drugs. As with all drugs, from legal drugs like alcohol to illegal drugs like BZP, usage can increase the risk of injury due to falls, dangerous or risky behavior (e.g., unsafe sex) and, if the user drives, injury or death due to impaired driving accidents. Some club drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines, are addictive, and regular use can lead to the user craving more of the drug. Some club drugs are more associated with overdoses. Some club drugs can cause adverse health effects which can be harmful to the user, such as the dehydration associated with MDMA use in an all-night dance club setting.

== Types ==

=== Ecstasy ===
MDMA (ecstasy) is a popular club drug in the rave and electronic dance music scenes and in nightclubs. It is known under many nicknames, including &quot;e&quot; and &quot;Molly&quot;. MDMA is often considered the drug of choice within the rave culture and is also used at clubs, festivals, house parties and free parties. In the rave environment, the sensory effects from the music and lighting are often highly synergistic with the drug. The psychedelic quality of MDMA and its amphetamine-like energizing effect offers multiple reasons for its appeal to users in the rave setting. Some users enjoy the feeling of mass communion from the inhibition-reducing effects of the drug, while others use it as &quot;party fuel&quot; for all-night dancing.

MDMA is taken by users less frequently than other stimulants, typically less than once per week. Effects include &quot;[g]reater enjoyment of dancing&quot;, &quot;[d]istortions of perceptions, particularly light, music and touch&quot;; and &quot;[a]rtificial feelings of empathy and emotional warmth&quot;. MDMA is sometimes taken in conjunction with other psychoactive drugs, such as LSD, DMT,
psilocybin mushrooms and 2C-B. Users sometimes use mentholated products while taking MDMA for its cooling sensation.

=== Stimulants ===

A number of stimulants are used as club drugs. Various amphetamines and methamphetamines are used as stimulants, as is cocaine. These drugs enable clubgoers to dance all night. Cocaine is a powerful nervous system stimulant. Its effects can last from fifteen or thirty minutes to an hour. The duration of cocaine&#x27;s effects depends on the amount taken and the route of administration. Cocaine can be in the form of fine white powder, bitter to the taste. When inhaled or injected, it causes a numbing effect. Cocaine increases alertness, feelings of well-being and euphoria, energy and motor activity, feelings of competence and sexuality. Cocaine&#x27;s stimulant effects are similar to that of amphetamine, however, these effects tend to be much shorter lasting and more prominent.

=== Depressants/sedatives ===

Methaqualone (Quaaludes) became increasingly popular as a recreational drug in the late 1960s and 1970s, known variously as &quot;ludes&quot; or &quot;sopers&quot; (also &quot;soaps&quot;) in the U.S. and &quot;mandrakes&quot; and &quot;mandies&quot; in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The drug was often used by hippies and by people who went dancing at glam rock clubs in the 1970s and at discos (one slang term for Quaaludes in the disco era was &quot;disco biscuits&quot;). In the mid-1970s, there were bars in Manhattan called &quot;juice bars&quot; that only served non-alcoholic drinks that catered to people who liked to dance on methaqualone. Purported methaqualone is in a significant minority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines. Methaqualone is one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in South Africa. It is also popular elsewhere in Africa and in India. Commonly known as Mandrax, M-pills, buttons, or smarties, a mixture of crushed mandrax and cannabis is smoked, usually through a smoking pipe made from the neck of a broken bottle.

The depressant GHB (also used by assailants as a date rape drug, in which case they slip it into a victim&#x27;s drink) is intentionally taken by some users as a party drug and club drug.

Rohypnol (also used as a date rape drug) is a sedative/hypnotic that causes intoxication and impairs cognitive functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, confusion and anterograde amnesia. It can be described as a hangover-like effect which can persist to the next day. It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs.

Although the previously mentioned drugs are generally categorized as club drugs by the media and the United States government, this distinction probably does not have an accurate correlation to real usage patterns. For example, alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, hard liquor) are generally not included under the category of club drugs, even though they are probably used more than any other drug at clubs, particularly those that are liquor-licensed nightclubs or bars.

=== Psychedelic drugs ===
A psychedelic is a psychoactive drug whose primary action is to alter cognition and perception, typically by agonising serotonin receptors, causing thought and visual/auditory changes, and heightened state of consciousness. Major psychedelic drugs include Bufotenin, Racemorphan, LSD, DMT, and psilocybin mushrooms.

Not to be confused with psychoactive drugs, such as stimulants and opioids, which induce states of altered consciousness, psychedelics tend to affect the mind in ways that result in the experience being qualitatively different from those of ordinary consciousness. Whereas stimulants cause an energized feeling and opiates produce a dreamy, relaxed state, the psychedelic experience is often compared to non-ordinary forms of consciousness such as trance, meditation, yoga, religious ecstasy, dreaming and even near-death experiences. With a few exceptions, most psychedelic drugs fall into one of the three following families of chemical compounds; tryptamines, phenethylamines, and lysergamides. Many psychedelic drugs are illegal worldwide under the UN conventions unless used in a medical or religious context. Despite these regulations, recreational use of psychedelics is common, including at raves and EDM concerts and festivals.

=== Inhalants ===

&quot;Poppers&quot; are small bottles of volatile drugs which are inhaled by clubgoers for the &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;high&quot; that they can create. Nitrites such as alkyl nitrite originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open, which led to the nickname &quot;poppers.&quot; The drug became popular in the US first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s, where dancers used the drug for the &quot;rush&quot; it provides, and because it was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to loud, bass-heavy disco. The drug became popular again in the mid-1980s and 1990s rave and EDM scenes. As with disco clubgoers, rave participants and EDM enthusiasts used the drug because its &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;high&quot; was perceived to enhance the experience of dancing to pulsating music and lights.

Nitrous oxide is a dissociative inhalant that can cause depersonalization, derealization (feeling like the world is not real), dizziness, euphoria, and some sound distortion (flanging). In some cases, it may cause slight hallucinations and have a mild aphrodisiac effect. While medical grade nitrous oxide is only available to dentists and other licensed health care providers, recreational users often obtain the drug by inhaling the nitrous oxide used in whipped cream aerosol cans. Nitrous oxide users also buy small &quot;whippet&quot; canisters of nitrous oxide intended for use in restaurant whipped cream dispensers and then &quot;crack&quot; open these canisters to inhale the gas. Users typically transfer the gas to a plastic bag or balloon prior to inhaling it.

=== Ketamine ===

Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has a long history of being used in clubs and was one of the most popular substances used in the New York Club Kid scene. Ketamine produces a dissociative state, characterized by a sense of detachment from one&#x27;s physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. Effects include hallucinations, changes in the perception of distances, relative scale, color and durations/time, as well as a slowing of the visual system&#x27;s ability to update what the user is seeing.

=== Other ===
In the 2000s, synthetic phenethylamines such as 2C-I, 2C-B and DOB have been referred to as club drugs due to their stimulating and psychedelic nature (and their chemical relationship with MDMA). By late 2012, derivates of the psychedelic 2C-X drugs, the NBOMes and especially 25I-NBOMe, had become common at raves in Europe. The drug organization Norconon states that other synthetic drugs used in clubs, or which are sold as &quot;Ecstasy&quot; include harmaline; piperazines (e.g., BZP and TFMPP); PMA/PMMA; mephedrone (generally used outside the US) and MDPV.

Though far less common than other &quot;club drugs&quot; like MDMA, ketamine, or LSD, heroin can be found in some of New York City&#x27;s clubs. Marijuana and related cannabis products are used by some clubgoers; for example, some Rohypnol and ketamine users mix the powdered drug with marijuana and smoke it.

== Effects ==
=== Desired effects ===
Although each club drug has different effects, their use in clubs reflects their perceived contribution to the user&#x27;s experience dancing to a beat as lights flash to the music. Club drug users are generally taking the drugs to &quot;enhance social intimacy and sensory stimulation&quot; from the dance club experience. Some club drugs&#x27; popularity stems from their ability to induce euphoria, lowered inhibition and an intoxicated feeling. Some drugs, such as amphetamine and cocaine, give the dancer hyperactivity and energy to dance all night. Many drugs produce a feeling of heightened physical sensation, and increased libido and sexual pleasure. Some club drugs, such as LSD, DMT, MDMA, 2C-B and ketamine enhance the experience of being in a nightclub with pulsating lights and flashing lasers and throbbing dance music, because they cause hallucinations or unusual perception effects.

=== Risks and adverse effects ===
Although research continues into the full scope of the effects of illegal drugs, regular and unsafe use of club drugs is widely accepted to have damaging side effects and carry a risk of addiction. Increased heart rate, a steep increase in body temperature, increase in blood pressure, spasms and dehydration are all common side effects of MDMA and methamphetamine. Breathing and respiratory issues, drowsiness, nausea and confusion are common side effects of said drugs. They can also make the user anxious, stressed and panicked, or even hallucinate. Withdrawal is also a risk with many club drugs. Drug cravings as the chemical leaves the user&#x27;s body can be complicated by sleep deprivation, dehydration and hypoglycaemia to result in debilitating &#x27;come downs&#x27; which can result in depression-like symptoms. In the worst instance, club drugs result in the death of the user from cardiac arrest or water intoxication due to the increase in heart rate and thirstiness induced. Inconsistency in the strength and exact composition of the supplied drug causing users to overdose. Wide variance in the measured rate of deaths caused by drugs such as ecstasy across countries suggest that user and societal/environmental factors may also affect the lethality of club drugs.

==== Drug interactions ====
Another risk is drug interactions. Some club drug users take multiple drugs at the same time. &quot;Club drugs often are taken together, with alcohol, or with other drugs to enhance their effect.&quot; Drug interactions can cause hazardous side effects. When club drug users are in a liquor-licensed nightclub, users may mix pills or powders (MDMA, 2C-B, GHB, ketamine) with consumption of alcoholic drinks such as beer, wine or hard liquor. Some depressants, such as Rohypnol, are dangerous to take while drinking alcohol. &quot;Ketamine often is taken in &quot;trail mixes&quot; of methamphetamine, phencyclidine, cocaine, sildenafil citrate (Viagra), morphine or heroin.&quot;

==== Injury or death due to risky behavior ====
Another risk with club drugs is one shared by all drugs, from legal drugs like alcohol to abused over-the-counter drugs (taking large amounts of dextromethorphan cough syrup) and illegal drugs (BZP, amphetamines, etc.): while impaired, the user is more likely to be injured, engage in dangerous or risky behaviour (e.g., unsafe sex) or, if she or he drives, have an accident resulting in injury or death due to impaired driving.

==== Misrepresentation ====

In many cases, illegal club drugs are misrepresented. That is, a dealer will tell a purchaser that she/he has a certain illegal drug for sale, while in fact the dealer&#x27;s pills, capsules or bags of powder do not contain that chemical. For example, MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;) is very hard to synthesize in illegal underground labs, and methamphetamine is much easier (it can be made from household chemicals and over-the-counter cold remedies containing pseudoephedrine). As such, what dealers sell as MDMA is often methamphetamine powder. Similarly, pills sold by drug dealers as LSD, a drug which only the top chemists have the training to synthesize, most often contain no LSD; instead, they often contain PCP, a veterinary tranquilizer which produces dissociation and hallucinations in humans. In some cases, the dealer has intentionally substituted a less expensive, more available illegal drug for another drug. In other cases, the substitution was made by a higher-level drug cartel or organization, and the dealer may in fact believe that the bogus product is MDMA or LSD.

==== &quot;Cutting&quot;, adulteration and &quot;spiking&quot; ====

With the exception of marijuana, which typically is uncut and unlaced, many illegal drugs, especially those which come in a powder or pill form are &quot;cut&quot; with other substances or &quot;spiked&quot; with other drugs. Cocaine, amphetamines and other stimulants often have caffeine powder added, as this increases the dealer&#x27;s profit by bulking out the powder, so that less expensive cocaine or amphetamine has to be used in making the product. Some substances used to &quot;cut&quot; illegal drugs are not inherently harmful, as they are just used to &quot;pad&quot; or &quot;bulk out&quot; a quantity of the illegal drug and increase profits, such as lactose (milk sugar), a white powder often added to heroin. Even fairly innocuous powders that are added to illegal drugs, though, can have adverse effects with some routes of illegal drug administration, such as injection. With some drugs, adulterants are sometimes added to make the product more appealing. For example, &quot;flavoured cocaine&quot; has flavoured powder added to the drug.

Whereas the main goal of &quot;cutting&quot; is to bulk out a quantity of pure, expensive illegal drugs with an innocuous and not overly harmful substance (lactose) or fairly low-impact product (e.g., caffeine in amphetamine pills), the goal of &quot;spiking&quot; is to try to make lower-quality illegal drug or a lower-potency source of illegal drugs give the user the type of &quot;high&quot; or psychedelic experience she or he is seeking. While it was earlier stated that marijuana is most often uncut and un-spiked, some dealers add PCP to marijuana (this is nicknamed &quot;wet marijuana&quot;), because adding this dissociative hallucinogen to low-grade, low-THC marijuana can convert it into a cannabis that creates striking hallucinogenic effects. Drug researchers learned that some dealers were spiking marijuana when they tested US teens who stated that they had only used a single illegal drug (marijuana) and the teens tested positive for marijuana and PCP. Some dealers who have a very small quantity of MDMA powder to sell &quot;spike&quot; it with less expensive and easier to produce methamphetamine powder.
* Street cocaine is often adulterated or &quot;cut&quot; with talc, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol, caffeine, procaine, phencyclidine, phenytoin, lignocaine, strychnine, amphetamine, or heroin.
* A common methamphetamine adulterant is dimethyl sulfone, a solvent and cosmetic base without known effect on the nervous system; other adulterants include dimethylamphetamine HCl, ephedrine HCl, sodium thiosulfate, sodium chloride, sodium glutamate, and a mixture of caffeine with sodium benzoate.

==== Addiction ====
Not all club drugs are addictive (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club drugs are addictive. Amphetamine heavily used in recreational fashion pose a risk of addiction.

Cocaine addiction is a psychological desire to use cocaine regularly. Cocaine overdose may result in cardiovascular and brain damage, such as: constricting blood vessels in the brain, causing strokes and constricting arteries in the heart; causing heart attacks. The use of cocaine creates euphoria and high amounts of energy. If taken in large, unsafe doses, it is possible to cause mood swings, paranoia, insomnia, psychosis, high blood pressure, a fast heart rate, panic attacks, cognitive impairments and drastic changes in personality. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal (also known as &quot;comedown or crash&quot;) range from moderate to severe: dysphoria, depression, anxiety, psychological and physical weakness, pain, and compulsive cravings.
GHB addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking. Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.

==== Ketamine risks ====
Ketamine use as a recreational drug has been implicated in deaths globally, with more than 90 deaths in England and Wales in the years of 2005–2013. They include accidental poisonings, drownings, traffic accidents, and suicides. The majority of deaths were among young people. This has led to increased regulation (e.g., upgrading ketamine from a Class C to a Class B banned substance in the U.K.). At sufficiently high doses, Ketamine users may experience what is called the &quot;K-hole&quot;, a state of extreme dissociation with visual and auditory hallucinations.

== Acute treatment ==

The main treatment for individuals facing acute medical issues due to club drug consumption or overdoses is &quot;cardiorespiratory maintenance&quot;. Since club drug users may have consumed multiple drugs, a mix of alcohol and other drugs, or a drug adulterated with other chemicals, it is hard for doctors to know what type of overdose to treat for, even if the user is conscious and can tell the medical team what drug they think they took. A doctor recommends &quot;cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, urinalysis, and performance of a comprehensive chemistry panel to check for electrolyte imbalance, renal toxicity, and possible underlying disorders&quot; and preventing &quot;seizures&quot;. Some doctors use activated charcoal and a cathartic&quot; to detoxify the drugs in the gastrointestinal system. Cooling the victim is recommended to avoid hyperthermia. If the victim overdosed on Rohypnol, the antidote flumazenil can be given; this is the only club drug for which there is an antidote.

== History ==
In the mid to late-1970s disco club scene, there was a thriving drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud dance music and the flashing lights on the dancefloor. Substances such as cocaine (nicknamed &quot;blow&quot;), amyl nitrite (&quot;poppers&quot;), and Quaaludes. Quaaludes were described as [the] &quot;...other quintessential 1970s club drug&quot;, which suspends motor coordination.&quot;) According to Peter Braunstein, &quot;massive quantities of drugs were ingested in discothèques.&quot;

Throughout the 1980s, the use of club drugs expanded into colleges, social parties, and raves. As raves grew in popularity through the late 1980s and into the late 1990s, drug usage, especially MDMA, grew with them. Much like discos, raves made use of flashing lights, loud techno/electronic dance music to enhance the user experience. Before their scheduling, some club drugs (especially designer drugs referred to as research chemicals) were advertised as alcohol-free and drug-free. Another reason that drug producers create new drugs is to avoid drug laws.

Since the early 2000s, medical professionals have acknowledged and addressed the problem of the increasing consumption of alcoholic drinks and club drugs (such as MDMA, cocaine, rohypnol, GHB, ketamine, PCP, LSD, and methamphetamine) associated with rave culture among adolescents and young adults in the Western world. Studies have shown that adolescents are more likely than young adults to use multiple drugs, and the consumption of club drugs is highly associated with the presence of criminal behaviors and recent alcohol abuse or dependence.

== In Australia ==
Club drugs are used in Australia in a variety of dance clubs and nightclubs. One in ten Australians have used MDMA at least once in their lifetime; one in thirty have used MDMA in the past 12 months. One in a hundred Australians has used ketamine at least once in their lives and one in five hundred over the past 12 months. One in two hundred Australians have used GHB at least once in their lives and one in one thousand in the past 12 months. Regarding the entire Australian population, seven per cent of Australians have used cocaine at least once in their lifetime and two per cent of Australians have used it in the past 12 months. Today, these drugs are widely used across age and socioeconomic groups and often sold in nightclubs and pubs throughout Australia.

<doc id="185901" wikidata="Q68947" url="?curid=185901" title="Subspecies">
<text>In biological classification, subspecies (: subspecies) is a rank below species, used for populations that live in different areas and vary in size, shape, or other physical characteristics (morphology), but that can successfully interbreed. Not all species have subspecies, but for those that do there must be at least two. Subspecies is abbreviated as subsp. or ssp. and the singular and plural forms are the same (&quot;the subspecies is&quot; or &quot;the subspecies are&quot;).

In zoology, under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the subspecies is the only taxonomic rank below that of species that can receive a name. In botany and mycology, under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, other infraspecific ranks, such as variety, may be named. In bacteriology and virology, under standard bacterial nomenclature and virus nomenclature, there are recommendations but not strict requirements for recognizing other important infraspecific ranks.

A taxonomist decides whether to recognize a subspecies. A common criterion for recognizing two distinct populations as subspecies rather than full species is the ability of them to interbreed even if some male offspring may be sterile. In the wild, subspecies do not interbreed due to geographic isolation or sexual selection. The differences between subspecies are usually less distinct than the differences between species.

==Nomenclature==
The scientific name of a species is a binomial or binomen, and comprises two Latin words, the first denoting the genus and the second denoting the species. The scientific name of a subspecies is formed slightly differently in the different nomenclature codes. In zoology, under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the scientific name of a subspecies is termed a trinomen, and comprises three words, namely the binomen followed by the name of the subspecies. For example, the binomen for the leopard is &quot;Panthera pardus&quot;. The trinomen &quot;Panthera pardus fusca&quot; denotes a subspecies, the Indian leopard. All components of the trinomen are written in italics.
In botany, subspecies is one of many ranks below that of species, such as variety, subvariety, form, and subform. To identify the rank, the subspecific name must be preceded by &quot;subspecies&quot; (which can be abbreviated to &quot;subsp.&quot; or &quot;ssp.&quot;), as in &quot;Schoenoplectus californicus&quot; subsp. &quot;tatora&quot;.

In bacteriology, the only rank below species that is regulated explicitly by the code of nomenclature is &quot;subspecies&quot;, but infrasubspecific taxa are extremely important in bacteriology; Appendix 10 of the code lays out some recommendations that are intended to encourage uniformity in describing such taxa. Names published before 1992 in the rank of &quot;variety&quot; are taken to be names of subspecies (see &quot;International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes&quot;). As in botany, &quot;subspecies&quot; is conventionally abbreviated as &quot;subsp.&quot;, and is used in the scientific name: &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; subsp. &quot;spizizenii&quot;.

===Nominotypical subspecies and subspecies autonyms===

In zoological nomenclature, when a species is split into subspecies, the originally described population is retained as the &quot;nominotypical subspecies&quot; or &quot;nominate subspecies&quot;, which repeats the same name as the species. For example, &quot;Motacilla alba alba&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;M. a. alba&quot;) is the nominotypical subspecies of the white wagtail (&quot;Motacilla alba&quot;).

The subspecies name that repeats the species name is referred to in botanical nomenclature as the subspecies &quot;autonym&quot;, and the subspecific taxon as the &quot;autonymous subspecies&quot;.

===Doubtful cases===
When zoologists disagree over whether a certain population is a subspecies or a full species, the species name may be written in parentheses. Thus &quot;Larus (argentatus) smithsonianus&quot; means the American herring gull; the notation within the parentheses means that some consider it a subspecies of a larger herring gull species and therefore call it &quot;Larus argentatus smithsonianus&quot;, while others consider it a full species and therefore call it &quot;Larus smithsonianus&quot; (and the user of the notation is not taking a position).

==Criteria==
A subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species – the only such rank recognized in the zoological code, and one of three main ranks below species in the botanical code. When geographically separate populations of a species exhibit recognizable phenotypic differences, biologists may identify these as separate subspecies; a subspecies is a recognized local variant of a species. Botanists and mycologists have the choice of ranks lower than subspecies, such as variety (varietas) or form (forma), to recognize smaller differences between populations.

==Monotypic and polytypic species==
In biological terms, rather than in relation to nomenclature, a polytypic species has two or more genetically and phenotypically divergent subspecies, races, or more generally speaking, populations that differ from each other so that a separate description is warranted. These distinct groups do not interbreed as they are isolated from another, but they can interbreed and have fertile offspring, e.g. in captivity. These subspecies, races, or populations, are usually described and named by zoologists, botanists and microbiologists.

In a monotypic species, all populations exhibit the same genetic and phenotypical characteristics. Monotypic species can occur in several ways:
* All members of the species are very similar and cannot be sensibly divided into biologically significant subcategories.
* The individuals vary considerably, but the variation is essentially random and largely meaningless so far as genetic transmission of these variations is concerned.
* The variation among individuals is noticeable and follows a pattern, but there are no clear dividing lines among separate groups: they fade imperceptibly into one another. Such clinal variation always indicates substantial gene flow among the apparently separate groups that make up the population(s). Populations that have a steady, substantial gene flow among them are likely to represent a monotypic species, even when a fair degree of genetic variation is obvious.

<doc id="185907" wikidata="Q3238261" url="?curid=185907" title="Subgenus">
<text>In biology, a subgenus (plural: subgenera) is a taxonomic rank directly below genus.

In the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, a subgeneric name can be used independently or included in a species name, in parentheses, placed between the generic name and the specific epithet: e.g. the tiger cowry of the Indo-Pacific, &quot;Cypraea&quot; (&quot;Cypraea&quot;) &quot;tigris&quot; , which belongs to the subgenus &quot;Cypraea&quot; of the genus &quot;Cypraea&quot;. However, it is not mandatory, or even customary, when giving the name of a species, to include the subgeneric name.

In the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICNafp), the subgenus is one of the possible subdivisions of a genus. There is no limit to the number of divisions that are permitted within a genus by adding the prefix &quot;sub-&quot; or in other ways as long as no confusion can result. The secondary ranks of section and series are subordinate to subgenus. An example is &quot;Banksia&quot; subg. &quot;Isostylis&quot;, a subgenus of the large Australian genus &quot;Banksia&quot;. The ICNafp requires an explicit &quot;connecting term&quot; to indicate the rank of the division within the genus. Connecting terms are usually abbreviated, e.g. &quot;subg.&quot; for &quot;subgenus&quot;, and are not italicized.

In zoological nomenclature, when a genus is split into subgenera, the originally described population is retained as the &quot;nominotypical subgenus&quot; or &quot;nominate subgenus&quot;, which repeats the same name as the genus. For example, &quot;Panthera&quot; (&quot;Panthera&quot;) &quot;pardus&quot;, a leopard. In botanical nomenclature the same principle applies, although the terminology is different. Thus the subgenus that contains the original type of the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; is &quot;Rhododendron&quot; subg. &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. Such names are called &quot;autonyms&quot;.

<doc id="185918" wikidata="Q935526" url="?curid=185918" title="Joy">
<text>Joy is the state of being that allows one to experience feelings of intense, long-lasting happiness and contentment of life. It is closely related to, and often evoked by, well-being, success, or good fortune. Happiness, pleasure, and gratitude are closely related to joy but are not identical to it.

==Distinction vs similar emotions==
 saw a clear distinction between joy, pleasure, and happiness: &quot;I sometimes wonder whether all pleasures are not substitutes for Joy&quot;, and &quot;I call it Joy, which is here a technical term and must be sharply distinguished both from Happiness and Pleasure. Joy (in my sense) has indeed one characteristic, and one only, in common with them; the fact that anyone who has experienced it will want it again... I doubt whether anyone who has tasted it would ever, if both were in his power, exchange it for all the pleasures in the world. But then Joy is never in our power and Pleasure often is.&quot;

Michela Summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that joy &quot;accompanies the process through and through, whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process... joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment, whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one&#x27;s life or one&#x27;s own life as a whole.&quot;

==Psychology==

===Sources and types===
The causes of joy have been ascribed to various sources.

Ingrid Fetell Lee has studied the sources of joy. She wrote the book &quot;Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness&quot;, and gave a TED talk on the subject, titled &quot;Where joy hides and how to find it.&quot;

Joy is most commonly found through engagement, self-connection, and living in the moment.

===Health effects===
Joy improves health and well-being and brings psychological changes that improve a person&#x27;s mood and well-being. Some people have a natural capacity for joy, meaning they experience joy more easily compared to others. While there is no conclusive evidence for the genetics of happiness, joy is known to be hereditary. Experience of joy is increased through healthy habits such as sharing food, physical activity, writing, and self-connection.

===Queer Joy===
Queer joy is a concept that acknowledges the importance of joy and pleasure in the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals. It challenges the dominant narrative that being queer is exclusively rooted in pain or trauma and instead recognizes the resilience, resistance, and creativity of LGBTQ+ people. Examples of queer joy can be seen in shows like Queer Eye, Ru Paul’s Drag Race or films like The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Film director Baz Luhrmann often references queer joy in his films with the use of maximalist, glittery, ostentatious costumes and set designs. The Rainbow Flag is a good example of a visual representation of queer joy. Jean Paul Gaultier’s designs – Frequently celebrate queer and camp aesthetics, blending androgyny and high fashion. Andrew Logan is a British sculptor, performance artist, and founder of the Alternative Miss World, a surrealist pageant celebrating creativity, transformation, and gender fluidity since 1972. His work, infused with vibrant colors, mirrored mosaics, and camp aesthetics, embodies queer joy, rejecting conventional beauty standards in favor of playful self-expression. His events have featured legendary queer artists, including Leigh Bowery, whose extravagant performances blurred the lines between fashion, drag, and art, and Grayson Perry, the Turner Prize-winning ceramicist and transvestite artist known for his irreverent explorations of identity and British culture. Logan’s legacy is one of unapologetic celebration, creating spaces where queerness, eccentricity, and artistic freedom flourish. Queer artist, Fritha Lewin, has created 3D bead graphics that look like giant glitter or confetti (Tassays) with the purpose of spreading queer joy using decoration, art and murals. It is being used in offices, homes, commercial spaces and public spaces. The bead graphics are customisable so are bringing queer joy into spaces not typically associated with queerness, such as luxury hotel spaces and corporate offices because the brand colours can be used. She has created an alternative to the Scottish Register for Tartans called the Queer Tartan Register. Queer communities often create joyful, sometimes silly, versions of heteronormative cultural traditions (eg NYC’s ballroom culture, or drag culture) which are also a form of queer joy.

<text>National Educational Television (NET) was an American educational broadcast television network owned by the Ford Foundation and later co-owned by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It operated from May 16, 1954, to October 4, 1970, and was succeeded by the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which has memberships with many television stations that were formerly part of NET.

The Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) provided funds for cataloging the NET collection, and as part of an on-going preservation effort with the Library of Congress, over 10,000 digitized television programs from the non-commercial TV stations and producers spanning 20 years from 1952 to 1972 have been contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting.

==History==
The network was founded as the Educational Television and Radio Center (ETRC) in November 1952 by a grant from the Ford Foundation&#x27;s Fund for Adult Education (FAE). It was originally a limited service for exchanging and distributing educational television programs produced by local television stations to other stations; it did not produce any material by itself.

In the spring of 1954, ETRC moved its operations to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and on May 16 of that year, it began operating as a &quot;network&quot;. It put together a weekly five-hour package of television programs, distributing them primarily on kinescope film to the affiliated stations by mail. By 1956, ETRC had 22 affiliated stations, expected to grow to 26 by March 1957. The programming was noted for treating subjects in depth, including hour-long interviews with people of literary and historical importance. The programming was also noted for being dry and academic, with little consideration given to entertainment value, a marked contrast to commercial television. Many of the shows were designed as adult education, and ETRC was nicknamed the &quot;University of the Air&quot; (or, less kindly, &quot;The Bicycle Network&quot;, both for its low budget and for the way NET supposedly sent programs to its affiliates, by distributing its program films and videotapes via non-electronic means such as by mail, termed in the television industry as &quot;bicycling&quot;).

The center&#x27;s headquarters moved from Ann Arbor to New York City in 1958, and the organization became known as the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC). The center became more aggressive at this time, aiming to ascend to the role of the U.S.&#x27; fourth television network. Among its efforts, the network began importing programs from the BBC into the United States, starting with &quot;An Age of Kings&quot; in 1961. It increased its programming output to ten hours a week. Most NETRC network programs were produced by the affiliate stations because the NETRC had no production staff or facilities of its own. NETRC also contracted programs from independent producers and acquired foreign material from countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Yugoslavia, the USSR, France, Italy, and West Germany.

Starting from 1962, the federal government took over the FAE&#x27;s grants-in-aid program through the Education Television Facilities Act.

In November 1963 NETRC changed its name to National Educational Television, and spun off its radio assets. Under the centerpiece program &quot;NET Journal&quot;, which began airing in the fall of 1966, NET began to air controversial, hard-hitting documentaries that explored numerous social issues of the day such as poverty and racism. While praised by critics, some affiliates, especially those in politically and culturally conservative markets, objected to the perceived liberal slant of the programming. Another NET produced program begun in 1967, &quot;Public Broadcast Laboratory&quot;, produced similar complaints.

In 1966, NET&#x27;s position as a combined network and production center came into question when President Lyndon Johnson arranged for the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study on the future of educational television. The Carnegie Commission released its report in 1967, recommending educational television be transformed into &quot;public television&quot;. The new organization would be controlled by the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting (a corporation established by the federal government) and receive funding from the government and other sources. Under this plan, funds were to be distributed to individual stations and independent production centers – which is what NET would have been reduced to. The Ford Foundation, interested Educational Television Stations, and President Johnson supported the recommendations of the Carnegie Commission in the Public Broadcasting Act, which was signed into law on November 7, 1967.

===Replacement by PBS===
The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) began as an entity in November 1969, with NET continuing to produce several programs and to be the name of the network. NET&#x27;s production of &quot;NET Journal&quot; and &quot;Public Broadcast Laboratory&quot; continued to be liabilities amid accusations of partisanship funded by the government. Eventually, Ford and the CPB decided to shut NET down, to be replaced by PBS as the network distributing programming to stations, but, unlike NET, it was not directly involved in production matters, which had been perceived as the main source of the controversies surrounding NET. Instead, local stations and outside suppliers would provide programming for the system, a model that endures to this day with PBS. In early 1970, both Ford and the CPB threatened to cut NET&#x27;s funding unless NET merged its operations with New York City-area affiliate WNDT. NET agreed to do so.

WNDT&#x27;s call sign was changed to WNET on October 1, 1970, as the station and NET&#x27;s merger was completed. On October 5, PBS began network broadcasting. NET ceased to operate as a network from that point, although some NET-branded programming, such as &quot;NET Journal&quot; and &quot;NET Playhouse&quot; remained part of the PBS schedule (now produced by WNET) until the brand was retired 2 years later. Some of the programs that began their runs on NET, such as &quot;Washington Week&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, continue to air on PBS today.

From Berlin, Ion Luca Caragiale watches the events with a &quot;hopelessness stifled by disgust&quot;, as reported by his son Luca. His exposé demanding social justice in the Romanian Kingdom is translated into German by Mite Kremnitz and carried by &quot;Die Zeit&quot; of Vienna. The &quot;pillars of fire&quot; witnessed by Banu inspire him to name his 1911 magazine &quot;Flacăra&quot; – &quot;Flame&quot;.

<doc id="185944" wikidata="Q110846504" url="?curid=185944" title="Anglocentrism">
<text>Anglocentrism refers to the practice of viewing the world primarily through the lens of English or Anglo-American culture, language, and values, often marginalizing or disregarding non-English-speaking or non-Anglo perspectives. This term is used to describe a bias that elevates English-speaking countries and their viewpoints over others, particularly in global discourse, education, media, and politics.

Historically, Anglocentrism emerged alongside British imperialism, where British norms and values were exported globally through colonization. In modern contexts, it often manifests in the dominance of the English language in international communication, academia, and business, with English-speaking countries (especially the United States and the United Kingdom) setting standards in many fields.

Critics of Anglocentrism argue that it fosters cultural homogenization and erases the diversity of global voices. In educational settings, for example, Anglocentric curriculums may overlook non-Western knowledge systems or cultural contributions. Moreover, in media and politics, the prominence of English-speaking narratives may limit the representation of non-Anglo cultures and experiences.

As global interconnectedness grows, awareness of Anglocentrism and its effects has led to efforts to promote linguistic and cultural pluralism in international institutions and discourse.

<text>Information architecture (IA) is the structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design, architecture and information science to the digital landscape. Typically, it involves a model or concept of information that is used and applied to activities which require explicit details of complex information systems. These activities include library systems and database development.

==Definition==
&quot;Information architecture&quot; has somewhat different meanings in different branches of information systems or information technology:
# The structural design of shared information environments.
# The art and science of organizing and labeling web sites, intranets, online communities, and software to support findability and usability.
# An emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.
# The combination of organization, labeling, search and navigation systems within websites and intranets.
# Extracting required parameters/data of Engineering Designs in the process of creating a knowledge-base linking different systems and standards.
# A blueprint and navigational aid to the content of information-rich systems.
# A subset of data architecture where usable data (a.k.a. information) is constructed in and designed or arranged in a fashion most useful or empirically holistic to the users of this data.
# The practice of organizing the information / content / functionality of a web site so that it presents the best user experience it can, with information and services being easily usable and findable (as applied to web design and development).
# The conceptual framework surrounding information, providing context, awareness of location and sustainable structure.

=== Debate ===
The difficulty in establishing a common definition for &quot;information architecture&quot; arises partly from the term&#x27;s existence in multiple fields. In the field of systems design, for example, information architecture is a component of enterprise architecture that deals with the information component when describing the structure of an enterprise.

While the definition of information architecture is relatively well-established in the field of systems design, it is much more debatable within the context of online information (i.e., websites). Andrew Dillon refers to the latter as the &quot;big IA–little IA debate&quot;. In the little IA view, information architecture is essentially the application of information science to web design which considers, for example, issues of classification and information retrieval. In the big IA view, information architecture involves more than just the organization of a website; it also factors in user experience, thereby considering usability issues of information design.

==Notable people in information architecture==

<doc id="185953" wikidata="Q1469686" url="?curid=185953" title="Perpetual war">
<text>A perpetual war, endless war or forever war is a lasting state of war with no clear conditions that would lead to its conclusion. These wars are usually situations of ongoing tension that may escalate at any moment, similar to the Cold War. From the late 20th century, the concepts have been used to critique the United States Armed Forces interventions in foreign nations and the military–industrial complex such as the Vietnam War and the Soviet-Afghan War, or wars with ambiguous enemies such as the war on terror or war on drugs.

== Causes ==
Poor military planning is one of the major reasons that a forever war can occur. If the territory gained in a war is not occupied or controlled properly, this can allow a deadly insurgency to occur, potentially stretching out a conflict that never ends. Similarly, warfare that is fought irregularly, such as rebellions in Africa, do not have a set of military objectives in mind, usually because these rebel groups intend to commit war crimes against the civilian population. Thus, the lack of actual military goals can in itself be a reason that a forever war can occur. A very large defense budget may also be a factor in the transpiration of a forever war. , the United States has an inflation-adjusted military budget that is greater than its budget for World War II, which enables it to fight continuously in Iraq and other countries.

Civil wars are prone to military stalemate which can prolong the war indefinitely. A lack of democracy is associated with an increased risk of civil war.

Forever wars can occur in order to keep money flowing into institutions, such as the military–industrial–congressional complex (MICC). Thus, forever wars can serve as domestic political engines, as policy makers promote policies of continuing and expanding wars.

Forever wars can be to the benefit of small armed groups, who may achieve political goals by wearing down a larger group or country. For example, in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the beginning of the war on terror, Al-Qaeda aimed to involve the United States in a prolonged guerrilla war in Afghanistan, challenging its will to fight such a long war.

Wars between ethnic or ideological groups can become forever wars, as such wars are harder to end with a negotiated peace deal due to the different interests of the two sides. An additional barrier may arise in the case of religious wars if one or both parties believe that the other must be destroyed.

==In current events==
There are current examples of literal perpetual-like war, such as the Myanmar conflict and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which have both been ongoing for over 75 years. These conflicts are typically characterized by long periods of low-intensity conflict interspersed with shorter periods of intense fighting. In a less literal sense, the term has been applied to superpowers who engage in constant hostile military activity around the world. As their militaries are always engaged in combat, it could be said that these countries are in a state of perpetual war, albeit not necessarily one where their citizens experience on a daily basis. In particular, much has been written on the activities of United States.

The concept of a perpetual war has been used since opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. James Pinckney Harrison argues in &quot;The Endless War: Fifty Years of Struggle in Vietnam&quot; (1981) that the Vietnam War was &quot;endless&quot; due to the success of the communist revolution in nationalizing the people. The concept was used by Trần Văn Đôn, a general in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, in his book &quot;Our Endless War: Inside Vietnam&quot; (1978).

American historian James Chace argues in his book &quot;Endless War: How we got involved in Central America&quot; (1983) that US policy in Central America is based upon the assumption that US hegemony is threatened within the region. According to Chace, US involvement in Central America worked towards resisting the domino effect of the spread of a &quot;communist take-over&quot;, largely through establishing the credibility of US military. Though these policies were meant to deter conflict, they themselves created the conditions for instability in the region, which furthered a US response. This resulted in a self-perpetuating, or &quot;endless&quot;, loop. He additionally argues US investment in pursuing an expanding military presence in Central America reflects an endless preparation for war.

A key argument of Chace is that much of this military involvement stems from a logic of US paranoia in reaction to the Cuban Revolution. A similar argument is put forward by David Keen, political economist and Professor of Complex Emergencies at the London School of Economics. His book &quot;Endless War? Hidden Function of the &#x27;War on Terror&quot;&#x27; (2006) argues that the United States&#x27; strategies and tactics in the war on terror use a &quot;militaristic state-cased framework&quot;. This framework, though &quot;counterproductive&quot;, has an &quot;inner logic&quot; and a &quot;psychological function&quot; of responding to the trauma of September 11 attacks.

Noam Chomsky posits that a state of perpetual war is an aid to (and is promoted by) the powerful members of dominant political and economic classes, helping maintain their positions of economic and political superiority.

British journalist Robert Fisk, a critic of Western policies in the Middle East, argues that recent Western conflicts against the Middle East, after the end of the Cold War, have been part of a new perpetual war. He suggests that former U.S. President George H. W. Bush launched attacks on Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan to distract the population from his domestic political problems. In addition, he claims that despite victorious claims after the first Gulf War that Saddam Hussein had been &quot;defanged&quot;, he was again the target of Western attacks until his execution in 2006.

Similarly, Ted Koppel described the war on terror as &quot;Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s War&quot;. Critics of Western policies have used the term &quot;perpetual war&quot; in reference to non-military &quot;wars&quot;, such as the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, &quot;War on Poverty&quot;, &quot;War on Cancer&quot;, Lou Dobbs&#x27;s &quot;War on the Middle Class&quot;, the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, the &quot;War on Women&quot;, or Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;War on Christmas&quot;.

==In socioeconomics and politics==
The economic make-up of the 5th century BC Athens-led Delian League also bears resemblance to the economic ramifications of &quot;preparing&quot; for perpetual war. Aspects of any given empire, such as the British Empire and its relation to its domestic businesses that were owned by a wealthy minority of individuals, such as the East India Company, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and De Beers, manifest an observed relationship between a minority of individuals influencing Empire or State policy, such as the Child&#x27;s War in India, the Anglo-Mysore Wars in India, the Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay in Canada, and the Second Boer War in South Africa, follow a pattern where the Empire allocates resources pursuing and sustaining policies that financially profit the Empire&#x27;s domestic business&#x27;s owners.

=== Military–industrial complex ===

The concept of a military–industrial complex was first suggested by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the idea that military action can be seen as a form of market-creation goes back at least as far as speeches beginning in 1930 prior to the publication of &quot;War Is a Racket&quot; in 1935. On January 16, 1961, President Eisenhower delivered his farewell speech expressing great concern for the direction of the newfound armaments industry post-WWII. While recognizing the boom in economic growth after the war, he reminded the people of United States that this was a way of profiting off warfare and that if not regulated enough it could lead to the &quot;grave&quot; expansion of the armaments industry. For his warning of the thirst to profit from warfare through weapon production, Eisenhower coined the term &quot;military industrial complex&quot;. He said, &quot;The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.&quot; Eisenhower feared that the military–industrial complex could lead to a state of perpetual war as the big armament industry will continue to profit from warfare. Additionally, NSC 68 can be used as a reference to understand U.S. President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s reasoning for the continued build up the United States&#x27; nuclear arsenal and how this contributed to the Cold War. This concept is still present in today&#x27;s policies as William D. Hartung states in his article &quot;The Doctrine of Armed Exceptionalism&quot;.

=== War on terror ===
Traditionally, the term &quot;war&quot; referred to the physical and conventional act of engaging in armed conflict. However, the implications of what war entails has evolved over time. The war on terror has often been cited as a perpetual war, being a war with &quot;no specific battlefield and the enemy isn’t an army.&quot; The war on terror has been directed at countless &quot;enemies,&quot; as it has no clear target. Georgetown University Historian Bruce Hoffman describes traditional war as a war that &quot;ends with the vanquishing of an opponent, with some form or armistice or truce- some kind of surrender instrument or document.&quot; In contrast, the war on terror continues with no end in sight.

The war on terror was declared in 2001 by President George W. Bush, following the September 11 attacks, but as early as 1996, Osama bin Laden of Al-Qaeda made a threat to the United States, by making a declaration of war. The growing tensions of the Middle East are suggested by Laurence Andrew Dobrot to be very wide cultural misunderstandings and faults the West for not making peace with the Middle East. As the deputy director for the Missile Defense Agency&#x27;s Airborne Laser Program, Dobrot examines the hostility which has been continuous not only since 2001, but since the birth of Wahhabism.

Dobrot proposed that the U.S should recognize the cultural hostility of the tribal Arabs in order to make the first steps towards progression of making peace.

The Crusades arose as European expansion was growing at the peak of unified Islamic dominance. On September 16, 2001, in a speech, President Bush referred to the war on terror as a crusade. He said:

 No one could have conceivably imagined suicide bombers burrowing into our society and then emerging all in the same day to fly their aircraft - fly U.S. aircraft into buildings full of innocent people - and show no remorse. This is a new kind of -- a new kind of evil. And we understand. And the American people are beginning to understand. This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while. And the American people must be patient. I&#x27;m going to be patient.

Andrew Bacevich described Bush&#x27;s naming of the war on terror as a crusade as something which does not make the war separate, rather something that shows that it is part of an &quot;eternal war.&quot;

=== War memorials ===

With the advent of perpetual war, communities have begun to construct war memorials with names of the dead while the wars are ongoing. The Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial in Irvine, California was dedicated in 2010 to American troops who lost their lives in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with space for 8,000 names (approximately 4,500 used at time of construction) and the intention to update it yearly.

==Views of influential writers==

===Sun Tzu===

Ancient war advisor Sun Tzu expressed views in the 6th century BC about perpetual war. The following quotation from chapter 2, Waging War, of his book &quot;The Art of War&quot; suggests the negative impacts of prolonged war:

===Alexis de Tocqueville===
Historian Alexis de Tocqueville made predictions in 1840 concerning perpetual war in democratic countries. The following is from Volume 2, chapter 22, &quot;Why Democratic Nations Naturally Desire Peace and Democratic Armies, War&quot;, 18th paragraph, in his book, Democracy in America:

==Fiction==

* In George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the three superstates of the world, Eurasia, Oceania and Eastasia, are said to be in a perpetual state of war with each other. The attacks are in the form of rocket attacks (similar to the V2 Attacks on London in WW2) although it is implied in the book that the attacks could be launched by the home Government against their own people in order to perpetuate fear and hatred of the enemy. Therefore, perpetual war may in fact secretly be a strategy used by the state to continuously promote its own political agenda. However, the military attacks are limited to the non-aligned areas (North and Central Africa, India etc.), an example of this is The Malabar Front (India) where Oceania won a victory against Eurasia.
* In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, the Kaleds and the Thals are in a perpetual state of war and have been for 1000 years. This state of war finally results in both sides occupying one city each on either side of mountains, and leads to both sides&#x27; supplies being so completely ravaged by the war that both sides have a collection of black powder weapons, modern and futuristic weapons and armour. It is out of this war that the Daleks are created by Davros.
* Also in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, the Sontarans and the Rutans have been in a perpetual state of war for over 50,000 years. There appears to be no end in sight, with each side continually attempting to completely obliterate the other. This has resulted in either side constantly gaining and losing territory (including the Milky Way galaxy, which is known in Doctor Who as the &quot;Mutter&#x27;s Spiral&quot;).
* And again in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot;, the Daleks and the Movellans have basically been drawn into an Endless War, due to their battle computers both giving a logical set of orders, only to have one set countered by the other battle computer with an equally logical set of orders. As both sides are using logical instructions, neither side could win as both sides would be able to counter the advances of the other as both were using logic. The Daleks returned to Skaro to find Davros to see if he could give them an advantage. The Movellans tried to get the Doctor to give them the same advantage.
* In the &quot;2000AD&quot; series &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot;, the North (Norts) and South (Southers) of the Planet Nu-Earth, for hundreds of years, have been in a perpetual state of war against each other using conventional, biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. The length of the war as well as the weapons involved have turned the planet uninhabitable without protective suits. It was for this reason that the Southers created the GIs or Genetic Infantry which would be able to survive in the environment.
* Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;The Forever War&quot; is about a war that is made perpetual due to the Einsteinian time dilation effects due to space travel. The novel is said to have been shaped by Haldeman&#x27;s experience in the Vietnam War as the book contains references to the war paired up with sci-fi concepts. A quote by Haldeman shows great influence from Hobbes&#x27; concept of perpetual war, &quot;Life begins in a bloody mess and sometimes it ends the same way, and only odd people seek out blood between those times, maybe crazy people.&quot;
* In the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;A Taste of Armageddon&quot;, the neighboring planets of Eminiar and Vendikar have been at war for 500 years. To avoid the physical devastation of an actual war, the belligerents agreed to conduct only computer-simulated attacks as long as the resulting &quot;victims&quot; voluntarily kill themselves in &quot;disintegration stations&quot;.
* The 2006 film &quot;Children of Men&quot; displays themes of perpetual war by exploring the wars on Terror and Poverty. The movie is set in a dystopia suffering universal infertility. The social and political world has become chaotic as few people exercise social power from their wealthy positions. Meanwhile, there is constant conflict all around the world, which specifically the oppressed group suffers. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; takes notice to the norm of bombs casually exploding in public places, such as a cafe. Dargis writes, &quot;It imagines the unthinkable: What if instead of containing Iraq, the world has become Iraq, a universal battleground of military control, security zones, refugee camps and warring tribal identities?&quot;

<text>, a Latin phrase meaning &quot;the war of all against all&quot;, is the description that Thomas Hobbes gives to human existence in the state-of-nature thought experiment that he conducts in &quot;De Cive&quot; (1642) and &quot;Leviathan&quot; (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of &quot;each against all&quot; where war is rare and terms such as &quot;competition&quot; or &quot;struggle&quot; are more common.

== Thomas Hobbes&#x27; use ==
In &quot;Leviathan&quot; itself, Hobbes speaks of &#x27;warre of every one against every one&#x27;, of &#x27;a war [...] of every man against every man&#x27; and of &#x27;a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour&#x27;, but the Latin phrase occurs in &quot;De Cive&quot;:
Later on, two slightly modified versions are presented in &quot;De Cive&quot;:


In chapter XIII of &quot;Leviathan&quot;, Hobbes explains the concept with these words:
The thought experiment places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to enter a social contract, giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the legitimation of a state in fulfilling its role as &quot;sovereign&quot; to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.

Hobbes distinguishes between war and battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation in which one knows there is a &#x27;Will to contend by Battle&#x27;.

== Later uses ==
In his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1785), Thomas Jefferson uses the phrase (&quot;war of all things against all things&quot;, assuming is intended to be neuter like ) as he laments that the constitution of that state was twice at risk of being sacrificed to the nomination of a dictator after the manner of the Roman Republic.

The phrase was sometimes used by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels:
* In &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot; (1843–1844):

* In &quot;Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy&quot; (1857–1858):

:The English translation eliminates the Latin phrase used in the original German.
* In a letter from Marx to Engels (18 June 1862):

* In a letter to Pyotr Lavrov (London, 12–17 November 1875), Engels is expressed clearly against any attempt to legitimize the trend anthropomorphizing human nature to the distorted view of natural selection:

* It was also used by Friedrich Nietzsche in &quot;On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense&quot; (1873):

* Max Stirner also used the term in his book &quot;The One and his own&quot;. 
* Rudolf Steiner describes it with the term &quot;war of all against all&quot; a future epoch, when the human race will be submitted to a powerful selfishness.

<text>The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a national memorial centered on a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore (, or Six Grandfathers) in the Black Hills near Keystone, South Dakota, United States. The sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, named it the Shrine of Democracy, and oversaw the execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the heads of four United States presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, chosen to represent the nation&#x27;s birth, growth, development, and preservation. Mount Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually to the memorial park which covers . The mountain&#x27;s elevation is above sea level.

Borglum chose Mount Rushmore in part because it faces southeast for maximum sun exposure. The carving was the idea of Doane Robinson, a historian for the state of South Dakota. Robinson originally wanted the sculpture to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse. Borglum chose the four presidents instead.

Peter Norbeck, U.S. senator from South Dakota, sponsored the project and secured federal funding. Construction began in 1927 and the presidents&#x27; faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. After Gutzon Borglum died in March 1941, his son Lincoln took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist, but lack of funding forced construction to end on October 31, 1941, and only Washington&#x27;s sculpture includes any detail below chin level.

The sculpture at Mount Rushmore is built on land that was illegally taken from the Sioux Nation in the 1870s. The Sioux continue to demand return of the land, and in 1980 the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot; that the taking of the Black Hills required just compensation, and awarded the tribe $102 million. The Sioux have refused the money, and demand the return of the land. This conflict continues, leading some critics of the monument to refer to it as a &quot;Shrine of Hypocrisy&quot;.&quot;

== History ==

=== &quot;Six Grandfathers&quot; to &quot;Mount Rushmore&quot; ===
Mount Rushmore and the surrounding Black Hills () are considered sacred by Plains Indians such as the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Lakota Sioux, who used the area for centuries as a place to pray and gather food, building materials, and medicine.
The Lakota called the mountain &quot;Six Grandfathers&quot; (), symbolizing ancestral deities personified as the six directions: north, south, east, west, above (sky), and below (earth).
In the latter half of the 19th century, expansion by the United States into the Black Hills led to the Sioux Wars. In the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the U.S. government granted exclusive use of all of the Black Hills, including Six Grandfathers, to the Sioux in perpetuity.

Six Grandfathers was a significant part of the spiritual journey taken in the early 1870s by Lakota leader Black Elk (, also known as &quot;The Sixth Grandfather&quot;) that culminated at the nearby Black Elk Peak (&quot;,&quot; &quot;Making of Owls&quot;). U.S. general George Armstrong Custer summited Black Elk Peak a few years later in 1874 during the Black Hills Expedition, which triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush and Great Sioux War of 1876.
In 1877, the U.S. broke the Treaty of Fort Laramie and asserted control over the area, leading to an influx of settlers and prospectors.

Among those prospectors was New York mining promoter James Wilson, who organized the Harney Peak Tin Company, and hired New York attorney Charles E. Rushmore to visit the Black Hills and confirm the company&#x27;s land claims. During a visit in 1884 or 1885,
Rushmore saw Six Grandfathers and asked his guide, Bill Challis, the mountain&#x27;s name; Challis replied that the mountain did not have a name, but that it would henceforth be named after Rushmore.
The name &quot;Mount Rushmore&quot; continued to be used locally, and was officially recognized by the United States Board of Geographic Names in June 1930.

=== Concept, design and funding ===

By the 1920s, South Dakota had become a U.S. state, and was a popular destination for road trippers visiting the Black Hills National Forest, Wind Cave National Park, and Needles Highway.
In 1923, the Secretary of the South Dakota State Historical Society, Doane Robinson, who would come to be known as the &quot;Father of Mount Rushmore&quot;, learned about the &quot;Shrine to the Confederacy&quot;, a project to carve the likenesses of Confederate generals into the side of Stone Mountain, Georgia, that had been underway since 1915.
Seeking to boost tourism to South Dakota, Robinson began promoting the idea of a similar monument in the Black Hills, representing &quot;not only the wild grandeur of its local geography but also the triumph of western civilization over that geography through its anthropomorphic representation.&quot;

Robinson initially approached sculptor Lorado Taft, but Taft was ill at the time and uninterested in Robinson&#x27;s project. Robinson next sought the help of then-U.S. Senator Peter Norbeck, who had established Custer State Park when he was Governor in 1919. Norbeck cautiously supported Robinson&#x27;s plan, and Robinson began campaigning for it publicly. Some in the local community also supported Robinson&#x27;s plan, but many opposed it vigorously.

On August 20, 1924, Robinson wrote to Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of &quot;Shrine to the Confederacy&quot;, asking him to travel to the Black Hills region to determine whether the carving could be accomplished.
Borglum, who had involved himself with the Ku Klux Klan, one of the Stone Mountain memorial&#x27;s funders, had been having disagreements with the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, and on September 24, 1924, travelled to South Dakota to meet Robinson.

Borglum&#x27;s original plan was to make the carvings in 150-meter-high granite pillars known as the Needles (&quot;&quot;). However, the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting. Also, some in the Black Hills such as Cora Babbitt Johnson, protested against carving the Needles on environmental and religious grounds. On August 14, 1925, Borglum summitted Black Elk Peak while scouting alternative locations, and reportedly said upon seeing Mount Rushmore, &quot;America will march along that skyline.&quot; He chose Mount Rushmore, a grander location, partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to sunlight.

Borglum rejected Robinson&#x27;s original plan of depicting characters from the Old West, such as Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud, Sacagawea, John C. Fremont, and Crazy Horse, and instead decided to depict four American presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.
The four presidential faces were said to be carved into the granite with the intention of symbolizing &quot;an accomplishment born, planned, and created in the minds and by the hands of Americans for Americans&quot;.
The Lakota and other local indigenous communities objected to the overall plan as constituting desecration of their sacred lands, and to the racist and sometimes violent anti-indigenous policies of the four presidents depicted.
For the Lakota and other tribes, the monument &quot;came to epitomize the loss of their sacred lands and the injustices they&#x27;ve suffered under the U.S. government.&quot;

Senator Norbeck and Congressman William Williamson of South Dakota introduced bills in early 1925 for permission to use federal land, which passed easily. South Dakota legislation had less support, only passing narrowly on its third attempt, which Governor Carl Gunderson signed into law on March 5, 1925. Private funding came slowly and Borglum invited President Calvin Coolidge to an August 1927 dedication ceremony, at which he promised federal funding. Congress passed the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Act, signed by Coolidge, which authorized up to $250,000 in matching funds. The 1929 presidential transition to Herbert Hoover delayed funding until an initial federal match of $54,670.56 was acquired.

Carving started in 1927 and ended in 1941 with no fatalities.

=== Construction ===

Between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal carvings of United States Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory. The carving of Mount Rushmore involved the use of dynamite, followed by the process of &quot;honeycombing&quot;, where workers drill holes close together, allowing small pieces to be removed by hand. In total, about of rock were blasted off the mountainside. The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington&#x27;s right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on Jefferson&#x27;s figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington&#x27;s left.

The chief carver of the mountain was Luigi Del Bianco, an artisan and stonemason who emigrated to the U.S. from Friuli in Italy and was chosen to work on this project because of his understanding of sculptural language and ability to imbue emotion in the carved portraits.

The national monument is in an unincorporated area in Pennington County, adjacent to the town of Keystone.

In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington&#x27;s face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time. In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.

The Sculptor&#x27;s Studio – a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting – was built in 1939 under the direction of Borglum. Borglum died from an embolism in March 1941. His son, Lincoln Borglum, continued the project. Originally, it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist, but insufficient funding forced the carving to end. Borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the Louisiana Purchase commemorating in gilded letters the Declaration of Independence, U.S. Constitution, Louisiana Purchase, and seven other territorial acquisitions from the Alaska purchase to the Panama Canal Zone. In total, the entire project cost US$989,992.32 (equivalent to $ in ).

Nick Clifford, the last remaining carver, died in November 2019 at age 98.

=== Later developments ===
Harold Spitznagel and Cecil Doty designed the original visitor center, finished in 1957, as part of the Mission 66 effort to improve visitors&#x27; facilities at national parks and monuments across the country. Ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in 1998, such as a Visitor Center, the Lincoln Borglum Museum, and the Presidential Trail.

On October 15, 1966, Mount Rushmore was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A 500-word essay giving the history of the United States by Nebraska student William Andrew Burkett was selected as the college-age group winner in a 1934 competition, and that essay was placed on the Entablature on a bronze plate in 1973. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush officially dedicated Mount Rushmore.

In 2004, Gerard Baker was appointed superintendent of the park, the first and so far only Native American in that role. Baker stated that he will open up more &quot;avenues of interpretation&quot;, and that the four presidents are &quot;only one avenue and only one focus.&quot;

=== Proposals to add additional faces ===
In 1937, when the sculpture was not yet complete, a bill in Congress supporting the addition of women&#x27;s rights activist Susan B. Anthony failed. When the sculpture was completed in 1941, the sculptors said that the remaining rock was not suitable for additional carvings. This stance was shared by RESPEC, an engineering firm charged with monitoring the stability of the rock in 1989. Proposals of additional sculptures include John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963, and Ronald Reagan in 1985 and 1999 – the latter proposal receiving a debate in Congress at the time. Barack Obama was asked about his own potential addition in 2008 and he joked that his ears were too large.

Donald Trump has on occasion expressed interest in his own addition to the mountain. During a 2017 rally in Ohio, Trump said, &quot;I&#x27;d ask whether or not you some day think I will be on Mount Rushmore... If I did it joking, totally joking, having fun, the fake news media will say, &#x27;He believes he should be on Mount Rushmore.&#x27; So I won&#x27;t say it.&quot; South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, described the potential addition as Trump&#x27;s &quot;dream&quot; in 2018. On January 28, 2025, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) introduced a bill, H.R. 792, in the House of Representatives to add Trump&#x27;s likeness to the monument.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an August 2024 interview that President Joe Biden is a “Mount Rushmore kind of president” and stated his likeness should be added to the monument.

== Tourism ==

Tourism is South Dakota&#x27;s second-largest industry, and Mount Rushmore is the state&#x27;s top tourist attraction. 2,185,447 people visited the park in 2012.

The popularity of the location, as with many other national monuments, derives from its immediate recognizability; &quot;there are no substitutes for iconic resources such as the Statue of Liberty, the Lincoln Memorial, or Mount Rushmore. These locations are one of a kind places&quot;. However, Mount Rushmore also provides access to a surrounding environment of wilderness, which distinguishes it from the typical proximity of national monuments to urban centers like Washington, D.C., and New York City.

In the 1950s and 1960s, local Lakota Sioux elder Benjamin Black Elk (son of medicine man Black Elk, who had been present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn) was known as the &quot;Fifth Face of Mount Rushmore&quot;, posing for photographs with thousands of tourists daily in his native attire. The South Dakota State Historical Society notes that he was one of the most photographed people in the world over that 20-year period.

== Hall of Records ==
Borglum originally envisioned a grand Hall of Records where America&#x27;s greatest historical documents and artifacts could be protected and shown to tourists. He managed to start the project, but cut only 70 feet (21 m) into the rock before work stopped in 1939 to focus on the faces. In 1998, a repository was constructed inside the mouth of the cave housing 16 enamel panels with biographical and historical information about Mount Rushmore as well as the texts of the documents Borglum wanted to preserve there. The repository consists of a teakwood box inside of a titanium vault placed in the ground with a granite capstone.

== Conservation ==
The ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the National Park Service. Maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually. Due to budget constraints, the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens. However, in 2005 Alfred Kärcher, a German manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines, conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks, using pressurized water at over . Other efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally to cracks in the stone by Gutzon Borglum, which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance. The components of Borglum&#x27;s sealant included linseed oil, granite dust, and white lead, but a modern silicone replacement for the cracks is now used, disguised with granite dust.

In 1998, electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of three millimeters. The site was digitally recorded in 2009 using a terrestrial laser scanning method as part of the international Scottish Ten project, providing a high-resolution record to aid the conservation of the site. This data was made publicly accessible online.

== Ecology ==

The flora and fauna of Mount Rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the Black Hills region of South Dakota. Birds including the turkey vulture, golden eagle, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, swallows and white-throated swifts fly around Mount Rushmore and nest in the ledges of the mountain. Smaller birds, including songbirds, nuthatches, woodpeckers and flycatchers inhabit the surrounding pine forests. Terrestrial mammals include the mouse, least chipmunk, red squirrel, skunk, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, badger, coyote, bighorn sheep, bobcat, elk, mule deer, yellow-bellied marmot, and American bison. The striped chorus frog, western chorus frog, and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area, along with several species of snake. Grizzly Bear Brook and Starling Basin Brook, the two streams in the memorial, support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout. Mountain goats are not indigenous to the region. Those living near Mount Rushmore are descendants of a herd that Canada gifted to Custer State Park in 1924, which later escaped.

At lower elevations, coniferous trees, mainly the ponderosa pine, surround most of the monument. Other trees include the bur oak, the Black Hills spruce, and the cottonwood. Nine species of shrubs grow near Mount Rushmore. There is also a wide variety of wildflowers, including especially the snapdragon, sunflower, and violet. Towards higher elevations, plant life becomes sparser. However, only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the Black Hills are indigenous to the region.

The area receives about of precipitation on average per year, enough to support abundant animal and plant life. Trees and other plants help to control surface runoff. Dikes, seeps, and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill, providing watering spots for animals. In addition, stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater, creating aquifers.

A 2016 investigation by the U.S. Geological Survey found unusually high concentrations of perchlorate in the surface water and groundwater of the area. A sample collected from a stream had a maximum perchlorate concentration of 54 micrograms per liter, roughly 270 times higher than samples taken from locations outside the area. The report concluded the probable cause of the contamination was the aerial fireworks displays that had taken place on Independence Days from 1998 to 2009. The National Park Service also reported that at least 27 forest fires around Mount Rushmore in that same period (1998 to 2009) have been caused by fireworks displays.

A study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding Mount Rushmore around every 27 years. Large fires are not common. Most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris. The area is a climax community with an equilibrium such that a pine beetle infestation would threaten the forest.

Mount Rushmore is largely composed of granite. The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the Black Elk Peak granite batholith in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith magma intruded into the pre-existing mica schist rocks during the Proterozoic, 1.6 billion years ago. Coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of Black Elk Peak and are visibly lighter in color, thus explaining the light-colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents.

The Black Hills granites were exposed to erosion during the Neoproterozoic, but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the Cambrian. Remaining buried throughout the Paleozoic, they were re-exposed again during the Laramide orogeny around 70 million years ago. The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome. Subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist. Some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of Washington.

The tallest mountain in the region is Black Elk Peak (). Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite. The durable granite erodes only every 10,000 years, thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long-term exposure. The mountain&#x27;s height of above sea level made it suitable, and because it faces the southeast, the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day.

It is not possible to add another president to the memorial, because the rock that surrounds the existing faces is not suitable for additional carving, and because additional sculpting could create instabilities in the existing carvings.

=== Soils ===
The Mount Rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam (Mocmount) to silt loam (Buska) texture, brown to dark grayish brown.

=== Climate ===
Mount Rushmore has a dry-winter humid continental climate (&quot;Dwb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). It is inside a USDA Plant Hardiness Zone of 5a, meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than .

The two wettest months of the year are May and June. Orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer.

== In popular culture ==

Mount Rushmore has been depicted in multiple films, comic books, and television series. Its functions vary from settings for action scenes to the site of hidden locations. Its most famous appearance is as the location of the final chase scene in the 1959 film &quot;North by Northwest.&quot; It is used as a secret base of operations by the protagonists in the 2004 film &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;, and the secret underground city of Cíbola is located there in the 2007 film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot;. In the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; episode &quot;Candace Loses Her Head&quot;, both Phineas and Ferb sculpt Candace&#x27;s face on the monument for her 15th birthday. In some films, the presidential faces are replaced with others; examples include the 1980 film &quot;Superman II&quot; and the 1996 film &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; where the villains add their faces to the monument, and the 2003 film &quot;Head of State&quot; where the newly elected president&#x27;s face is added. In works showing attacks on landmarks to signify the scope of a threat, Mount Rushmore is a common target; examples include the aforementioned facial replacements in &quot;Superman II&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; as well as natural disasters in works like the 2006 miniseries &quot;10.5: Apocalypse&quot; and terrorist attacks as in the 1997 film &quot;The Peacekeeper&quot;. An atypical representation of the monument appears in the 2013 film &quot;Nebraska&quot;, where instead of being treated with reverence it is criticized for being unfinished.

== Land dispute ==
The Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) had granted the Black Hills to the Lakota people in perpetuity, but the United States took the area from the tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it &quot;Mount Crazy Horse&quot;, and Lakota holy man John Fire Lame Deer planted a prayer staff on top of the mountain. Lame Deer said that the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents&#x27; faces &quot;which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the Black Hills are fulfilled.&quot;

The 1980 United States Supreme Court decision &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot; ruled that the Sioux had not received just compensation for their land in the Black Hills, which includes Mount Rushmore. The court proposed $102 million as compensation for the loss of the Black Hills. This compensation was valued at $1.3 billion in 2011, and – with accumulated interest – nearly $2 billion in 2021. In 2020, Oglala Lakota Nation citizen and Indigenous activist Nick Tilsen explained that his people would not accept a settlement, &quot;because we won&#x27;t settle for anything less than the full return of our lands as stipulated by the treaties our nations signed and agreed upon.&quot;

Construction on the Crazy Horse Memorial began in 1940 elsewhere in the Black Hills. Ostensibly to commemorate the Native American leader and as a response to Mount Rushmore, if completed it would be larger than Mount Rushmore. The Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation has rejected offers of federal funds. Its construction has the support of some Lakota chiefs, but it is the subject of controversy, even among Native American tribes.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
Borglum titled his sculpture at Mount Rushmore as the &quot;Shrine of Democracy&quot;, but the illegal seizure of the Black Hills where the memorial is located has led to some critics to refer to it as the &quot;Shrine of Hypocrisy&quot;.

On August 11, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued the Mount Rushmore Memorial 3-cent commemorative stamp on the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. On January 2, 1974, a 26-cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued. In 1991 the United States Mint released commemorative silver dollar, half-dollar, and five-dollar coins celebrating the 50th anniversary of the monument&#x27;s dedication, and the sculpture was the main subject of the 2006 South Dakota state quarter.

In music, American composer Michael Daugherty&#x27;s 2010 piece for chorus and orchestra, &quot;Mount Rushmore&quot;, depicts each of the four presidents in separate movements. The piece sets texts by George Washington, William Billings, Thomas Jefferson, Maria Cosway, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. By contrast, the song, &quot;Little Snakes&quot;, by Protest The Hero, &quot;addresses the violent colonial history involved in the sculpting of Mount Rushmore&quot;, critiquing the monument as a symbol of colonialism, referencing the genocide of indigenous peoples and the ownership of slaves by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

The Washington Nationals baseball club uses large foam rubber depictions of the &quot;Rushmore Four&quot; in both their marketing campaigns and in a series of in-stadium promotions such as the Presidents Race.

<text>Political capital (PC) refers to an individual&#x27;s ability to influence political decisions. Political capital can be understood as a metaphor used in political theory to conceptualize the accumulation of resources and power built through relationships, trust, goodwill, and influence between politicians or parties and other stakeholders, such as constituents. Political capital can be understood as a type of currency used to mobilize voters, achieve policy reform, or accomplish other political goals. Although not a literal form of capital, political capital is often described as a type of credit, or a resource that can be banked, spent or misspent, invested, lost, and saved.

Some thinkers distinguish between reputational and representative political capital. Reputational capital refers to a politician&#x27;s credibility and reliability. It is accumulated by maintaining consistent policy positions and ideological views. Representative capital refers to a politician&#x27;s influence in policymaking. It is accumulated through experience, seniority, and serving in leadership positions. Thus, political capital—reputational and representative—is the product of relationships among opinion (public impressions), policy (legislative rewards/penalties), and political judgement (prudent decision-making).

== Origins ==

Pierre Bourdieu is regularly credited with developing the most popular theories of political capital (as well as social capital) in his 1991 book &quot;Language and Symbolic Power&quot;. However, the concept of political capital was introduced to political theory in 1961 by American political scientist Edward C. Banfield in his book &quot;Political Influence&quot;. Banfield described political capital as a “stock of influence” which might be built “by &#x27;buying&#x27; a bit here and there from the many small &#x27;owners&#x27; who were endowed with it by the constitution-makers”—that is, political capital can be used for types of exchange between politicians or between politicians and voters. Like money, Banfield says, political capital must be spent and saved wisely, or a politician would be “out of business” before long.

Bourdieu&#x27;s theory of political capital further elaborates on the metaphor of money and the concept of capital itself. In “The Forms of Capital”, Bourdieu defines capital as “accumulated labor (in its materialized form or its &#x27;incorporated,&#x27; embodied form) which, when appropriated…by agents or groups of agents, enables them to appropriate social energy in the form of reified or living labor.” Political capital, then, is how symbolically understood capital functions within a political system: it is a form of credit accumulated by politicians, which can be used to accomplish other goals, such as the work required to pass legislation or achieve reelection.

== Measurement ==
A variety of approaches within political theory measure political capital as a way of analyzing its influence on local, regional, state, national, and international politics. Political capital is sometimes theorized in terms of objectification, or applying concrete forms to the otherwise abstract concept. Some theorists consider things like the number of votes, people present at a meeting, protesters present at a march, money donated to a political campaign, public opinion survey results, and other factors to be objectified or material and measurable elements of political capital. 

Theorists also consider political capital within a framework of instrumental and structural elements; instrumental political capital is made up of available resources, such as funding, while structural political capital shapes decision-making processes.

== Dynamics ==
The amount of political capital one has is assigned from observers rather than claimed by oneself. A politician gains political capital by winning elections, pursuing policies that have public support, achieving success with initiatives, and performing favors for other politicians. Political capital can also be wasted, such as by failed attempts to promote unpopular policies that are not central to a politician&#x27;s agenda.

== Criticism ==
Journalist Michael Hirsh has argued that the concept of political capital is often misunderstood and unhelpful at explaining the dynamics of political power.
