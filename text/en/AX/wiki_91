<text>Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (), also translated as Thus Spake Zarathustra, is a work of philosophical fiction written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; it was published in four volumes between 1883 and 1885. The protagonist is nominally the historical Zarathustra, more commonly called Zoroaster in the West. 

Much of the book consists of discourses by Zarathustra on a wide variety of subjects, most of which end with the refrain &quot;thus spoke Zarathustra&quot;. The character of Zarathustra first appeared in Nietzsche&#x27;s earlier book &quot;The Gay Science&quot; (at §342, which closely resembles §1 of &quot;Zarathustra&#x27;s Prologue&quot; in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;). 

The style of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Zarathustra&quot; has facilitated varied and often incompatible ideas about what Nietzsche&#x27;s Zarathustra says. The &quot;[e]xplanations and claims&quot; given by the character of Zarathustra in this work &quot;are almost always analogical and figurative&quot;. Though there is no consensus about what Zarathustra &quot;means&quot; when he speaks, there is some consensus &quot;about&quot; that which he speaks. &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; deals with ideas about the &quot;Übermensch&quot;, the death of God, the will to power, and eternal recurrence.

== Origins ==
Nietzsche was born into, and largely remained within, the Bildungsbürgertum, a sort of highly cultivated middle class. By the time he was a teenager, he had been writing music and poetry. His aunt Rosalie gave him a biography of Alexander von Humboldt for his 15th birthday, and reading this inspired a love of learning &quot;for its own sake&quot;. The schools he attended, the books he read, and his general milieu fostered and inculcated his interests in Bildung, a concept at least tangential to many in &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, and he worked extremely hard. He became an outstanding philologist almost accidentally, and he renounced his ideas about being an artist. As a philologist he became particularly sensitive to the transmissions and modifications of ideas, which also bears relevance into &quot;Zarathustra&quot;. Nietzsche&#x27;s growing distaste toward philology, however, was yoked with his growing taste toward philosophy. As a student, this yoke was his work with Diogenes Laertius. Even with that work he strongly opposed received opinion. With subsequent and properly philosophical work he continued to oppose received opinion. His books leading up to &quot;Zarathustra&quot; have been described as nihilistic destruction. Such nihilistic destruction combined with his increasing isolation and the rejection of his marriage proposals (to Lou Andreas-Salomé) devastated him. While he was working on &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; he was walking very much. The imagery of his walks mingled with his physical and emotional and intellectual pains and his prior decades of hard work. What &quot;erupted&quot; was &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;.

Nietzsche has said that the central idea of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; is the eternal recurrence. He has also said that this central idea first occurred to him in August 1881: he was near a &quot;pyramidal block of stone&quot; while walking through the woods along the shores of Lake Silvaplana in the Upper Engadine, and he made a small note that read &quot;6,000 feet beyond man and time&quot;.

A few weeks after meeting this idea, he paraphrased in a notebook something written by Friedrich von Hellwald about Zarathustra. This paraphrase was developed into the beginning of &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;.

A year and a half after making that paraphrase, Nietzsche was living in Rapallo. Nietzsche claimed that the entire first part was conceived, and that Zarathustra himself &quot;came over him&quot;, while walking. He was regularly walking &quot;the magnificent road to Zoagli&quot; and &quot;the whole Bay of Santa Margherita&quot;. He said in a letter that the entire first part &quot;was conceived in the course of strenuous hiking: absolute certainty, as if every sentence were being called out to me&quot;.

Nietzsche returned to &quot;the sacred place&quot; in the summer of 1883 and he &quot;found&quot; the second part.

Nietzsche was in Nice the following winter and he &quot;found&quot; the third part.

According to Nietzsche in &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; it was &quot;scarcely one year for the entire work&quot;, and ten days each part. More broadly, however, he said in a letter: &quot;The &quot;whole&quot; of &quot;Zarathustra&quot; is an explosion of forces that have been accumulating for decades&quot;.

In January 1884, Nietzsche finished the third part and thought the book finished. But by November he expected a fourth part to be finished by January. He also mentioned a fifth and sixth part leading to Zarathustra&#x27;s death, &quot;or else he will give me no peace&quot;. But after the fourth part was finished he called it &quot;a fourth (and last) part of &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, a kind of sublime finale, which is not at all meant for the public&quot;.

The first three parts were initially published individually and were first published together in a single volume in 1887. The fourth part was written in 1885. While Nietzsche retained mental capacity and was involved in the publication of his works, forty copies of the fourth part were printed at his own expense and distributed to his closest friends, to whom he expressed &quot;a vehement desire never to have the Fourth Part made public&quot;. In 1889, however, Nietzsche became significantly incapacitated. In March 1892 part four was published separately, and the following July the four parts were published in a single volume.

== Character of Zarathustra ==
In the 1888 &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, Nietzsche explains what he meant by making the Persian figure of Zoroaster the protagonist of his book:
Thus, &quot;[a]s Nietzsche admits himself, by choosing the name of Zarathustra as the prophet of his philosophy in a poetical idiom, he wanted to pay homage to the original Aryan prophet as a prominent founding figure of the spiritual-moral phase in human history, and reverse his teachings at the same time, according to his fundamental critical views on morality. The original Zoroastrian world-view interpreted being on the basis of the universality of the moral values and saw the whole world as an arena of the struggle between two fundamental moral elements, Good and Evil, depicted in two antagonistic divine figures [Ahura Mazda and Ahriman]. Nietzsche’s Zarathustra, in contrast, puts forward his ontological immoralism and tries to prove and reestablish the primordial innocence of beings by destroying philosophically all moralistic interpretations and evaluations of being&quot;.

==Synopsis==
===First part===
The book begins with a prologue that sets up many of the themes that will be explored throughout the work. Zarathustra is introduced as a hermit who has lived ten years on a mountain with his two companions, an eagle and a serpent. One morning – inspired by the sun, which is happy only when it shines upon others – Zarathustra decides to return to the world and share his wisdom. Upon descending the mountain, he encounters a saint living in a forest, who spends his days praising God. Zarathustra marvels that the saint has not yet heard that &quot;God is dead&quot;.

Arriving at the nearest town, Zarathustra addresses a crowd which has gathered to watch a tightrope walker. He tells them that mankind&#x27;s goal must be to create something superior to itself – a new type of human, the &quot;Übermensch&quot;. All men, he says, must be prepared to will their own destruction in order to bring the &quot;Übermensch&quot; into being. The crowd greets this speech with scorn and mockery, and meanwhile the tightrope show begins. When the rope-dancer is halfway across, a clown comes up behind him, urging him to get out of the way. The clown then leaps over the rope-dancer, causing the latter to fall to his death. The crowd scatters; Zarathustra takes the corpse of the rope-dancer on his shoulders, carries it into the forest, and lays it in a hollow tree. He decides that from this point on, he will no longer attempt to speak to the masses, but only to a few chosen disciples.

There follows a series of discourses in which Zarathustra overturns many of the precepts of Christian morality. He gathers a group of disciples, but ultimately abandons them, saying that he will not return until they have disowned him.

===Second part===
Zarathustra retires to his mountain cave, and several years pass by. One night, he dreams that he looks into a mirror and sees the face of a devil instead of his own; he takes this as a sign that his doctrines are being distorted by his enemies, and joyfully descends the mountain to recover his lost disciples.

More discourses follow, which continue to develop the themes of the death of God and the rise of the &quot;Übermensch&quot;, and also introduce the concept of the will to power. There are hints, however, that Zarathustra is holding something back. A series of dreams and visions prompt him to reveal this secret teaching, but he cannot bring himself to do so. He withdraws from his disciples once more, in order to perfect himself.

===Third part===
While journeying home, Zarathustra is waylaid by the spirit of gravity, a dwarf-like creature which clings to his back and whispers taunts into his ear. Zarathustra at first becomes despondent, but then takes courage; he challenges the spirit to hear the &quot;abysmal thought&quot; which he has so far refrained from speaking. This is the doctrine of eternal recurrence. Time, says Zarathustra, is infinite, stretching both forward and backward into eternity. This means that everything that happens now must have happened before, and that every moment must continue to repeat itself eternally.

As he speaks, Zarathustra hears a dog howl in terror, and then he sees a new vision – a shepherd choking on a black serpent which has crept into his throat. At Zarathustra&#x27;s urging, the shepherd bites the serpent&#x27;s head off and spits it out. In that moment, the shepherd is transformed into a laughing, radiant being, something greater than human.

Zarathustra continues his journey, delivering more discourses inspired by his observations. Arriving at his mountain cave, he remains there for some time, reflecting on his mission. He is disgusted at humanity&#x27;s pettiness, and despairs at the thought of the eternal recurrence of such an insignificant race. Eventually, however, he discovers his own longing for eternity, and sings a song in celebration of eternal return.

===Fourth part===
Zarathustra begins to grow old as he remains secluded in his cave. One day, he is visited by a soothsayer, who says that he has come to tempt Zarathustra to his final sin – compassion (&quot;mitleiden&quot;, which can also be translated as &quot;pity&quot;). A loud cry of distress is heard, and the soothsayer tells Zarathustra that &quot;the higher man&quot; is calling to him. Zarathustra is alarmed, and rushes to the aid of the higher man.

Searching through his domain for the person who uttered the cry for help, Zarathustra encounters a series of characters representative of various aspects of humanity. He engages each of them in conversation, and ends by inviting each one to await his return in his cave. After a day&#x27;s search, however, he is unable to find the higher man. Returning home, he hears the cry of distress once more, now coming from inside his own cave. He realises that all the people he has spoken to that day are collectively the higher man. Welcoming them to his home, he nevertheless tells them that they are not the men he has been waiting for; they are only the precursors of the &quot;Übermensch&quot;.

Zarathustra hosts a supper for his guests, which is enlivened by songs and arguments, and ends in the facetious worship of a donkey. The higher men thank Zarathustra for relieving them of their distress and teaching them to be content with life.

The following morning, outside his cave, Zarathustra encounters a lion and a flock of doves, which he interprets as a sign that those whom he calls his children are near. As the higher men emerge from the cave, the lion roars at them, causing them to cry out and flee. Their cry reminds Zarathustra of the soothsayer&#x27;s prediction that he would be tempted into feeling compassion for the higher man. He declares that this is over, and that from this time forward he will think of nothing but his work.

==Themes==
Scholars have argued that &quot;the worst possible way to understand Zarathustra is as a teacher of doctrines&quot;. Nonetheless &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; &quot;has contributed most to the public perception of Nietzsche as philosophernamely, as the teacher of the &#x27;doctrines&#x27; of the will to power, the overman and the eternal return&quot;.

=== Will to power ===

Nietzsche&#x27;s thinking was significantly influenced by the thinking of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer emphasised will, and particularly will to live. Nietzsche emphasised &quot;Wille zur Macht&quot;, or will to power.

Nietzsche was not a systematic philosopher and left much of what he wrote open to interpretation. Receptive fascists are said to have misinterpreted the will to power, having overlooked Nietzsche&#x27;s distinction between &quot;Kraft&quot; (&quot;force&quot; or &quot;strength&quot;) and &quot;Macht&quot; (&quot;power&quot; or &quot;might&quot;).

Scholars have often had recourse to Nietzsche&#x27;s notebooks, where will to power is described in ways such as &quot;willing-to-become-stronger [&quot;Stärker-werden-wollen&quot;], willing growth&quot;.

=== &quot;Übermensch&quot; ===

It is allegedly &quot;well-known that as a term, Nietzsche’s Übermensch derives from Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s hyperanthropos&quot;. This hyperanthropos, or &quot;overman,&quot; appears in Lucian&#x27;s Menippean satire &quot;Κατάπλους ἢ Τύραννος&quot;, usually translated &quot;Downward Journey or The Tyrant&quot;. This hyperanthropos is &quot;imagined to be superior to others of &#x27;lesser&#x27; station in this-worldly life and the same tyrant after his (comically unwilling) transport into the underworld&quot;.
Nietzsche celebrated Goethe as an actualisation of the Übermensch.

=== Eternal recurrence ===

Nietzsche includes some brief writings on eternal recurrence in his earlier book &quot;The Gay Science&quot;. Zarathustra also appears in that book. In &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, the eternal recurrence is, according to Nietzsche, the &quot;fundamental idea of the work&quot;.

Interpretations of the eternal recurrence have mostly revolved around cosmological and attitudinal and normative principles.

As a cosmological principle, it has been supposed to mean that time is circular, that all things recur eternally. A weak attempt at proof has been noted in Nietzsche&#x27;s notebooks, and it is not clear to what extent, if at all, Nietzsche believed in the truth of it. Critics have mostly dealt with the cosmological principle as a puzzle of &quot;why&quot; Nietzsche might have touted the idea.

As an attitudinal principle it has often been dealt with as a thought experiment, to see how one would react, or as a sort of ultimate expression of life-affirmation, as if one should &quot;desire&quot; eternal recurrence.

As a normative principle, it has been thought of as a measure or standard, akin to a &quot;moral rule&quot;.

=== Criticism of religion ===
Nietzsche studied extensively and was very familiar with Schopenhauer and Christianity and Buddhism, each of which he considered nihilistic and &quot;enemies to a healthy culture&quot;. &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; can be understood as a &quot;polemic&quot; against these influences.

Though Nietzsche &quot;probably learned Sanskrit while at Leipzig from 1865 to 1868&quot;, and &quot;was probably one of the best read and most solidly grounded in Buddhism for his time among Europeans&quot;, Nietzsche was writing when Eastern thought was only beginning to be acknowledged in the West, and Eastern thought was easily misconstrued. Nietzsche&#x27;s interpretations of Buddhism were coloured by his study of Schopenhauer, and it is &quot;clear that Nietzsche, as well as Schopenhauer, entertained inaccurate views of Buddhism&quot;. An egregious example has been the idea of &quot;śūnyatā&quot; as &quot;nothingness&quot; rather than &quot;emptiness&quot;. &quot;Perhaps the most serious misreading we find in Nietzsche&#x27;s account of Buddhism was his inability to recognize that the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness was an initiatory stage leading to a reawakening&quot;. Nietzsche dismissed Schopenhauer and Christianity and Buddhism as pessimistic and nihilistic, but, according to Benjamin A. Elman, &quot;[w]hen understood on its own terms, Buddhism cannot be dismissed as pessimistic or nihilistic&quot;. Moreover, answers which Nietzsche assembled to the questions he was asking, not only generally but also in &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, put him &quot;very close to some basic doctrines found in Buddhism&quot;. An example is when Zarathustra says that &quot;the soul is only a word for something about the body&quot;.

===Nihilism===
One of the most vexed points in discussions of Nietzsche has been whether or not he was a nihilist. Though arguments have been made for either side, what is clear is that Nietzsche was at least &quot;interested&quot; in nihilism.

As far as nihilism touched other people, at least, metaphysical understandings of the world were progressively undermined until people could contend that &quot;God is dead&quot;. Without God, humanity was greatly devalued. Without metaphysical or supernatural lenses, humans could be seen as animals with primitive drives which were or could be sublimated. According to Hollingdale, this led to Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas about the will to power. Likewise, &quot;&quot;Sublimated will to power&quot; was now the Ariadne&#x27;s thread tracing the way out of the labyrinth of nihilism&quot;.

==Style==

The nature of the text is musical and operatic. While working on it Nietzsche wrote &quot;of his aim &#x27;to become Wagner&#x27;s heir&#x27;&quot;. Nietzsche thought of it as akin to a symphony or opera. &quot;No lesser a symphonist than Gustav Mahler corroborates: &#x27;His &quot;Zarathustra&quot; was born completely from the spirit of music, and is even &quot;symphonically constructed&quot;&#x27;&quot;. Nietzsche The length of paragraphs and the punctuation and the repetitions all enhance the musicality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The title is &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;. Much of the book is what Zarathustra said. What Zarathustra says 

Nietzsche would often appropriate masks and models to develop himself and his thoughts and ideas, and to find voices and names through which to communicate. While writing &quot;Zarathustra&quot;, Nietzsche was particularly influenced by &quot;the language of Luther and the poetic form of the Bible&quot;. But &quot;Zarathustra&quot; also frequently alludes to or appropriates from Hölderlin&#x27;s &quot;Hyperion&quot; and Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot;, among other things. It is generally agreed that the sorcerer is based on Wagner and the soothsayer is based on Schopenhauer.

The original text contains a great deal of word-play. For instance, words beginning with &quot;über&quot; (&#x27;over, above&#x27;) and (&#x27;down, below&#x27;) are often paired to emphasise the contrast, which is not always possible to bring out in translation, except by coinages. An example is &quot;untergang&quot; (lit. &#x27;down-going&#x27;), which is used in German to mean &#x27;setting&#x27; (as in, of the sun), but also &#x27;sinking&#x27;, &#x27;demise&#x27;, &#x27;downfall&#x27;, or &#x27;doom&#x27;. Nietzsche pairs this word with its opposite &quot;übergang&quot; (&#x27;over-going&#x27;), used to mean &#x27;transition&#x27;. Another example is &quot;übermensch&quot; (&#x27;overman&#x27; or &#x27;superman&#x27;).

==Reception==

Nietzsche considered &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, writing:

In a letter of February 1884, he wrote:

To this, Parkes has said: &quot;Many scholars believe that Nietzsche managed to make that step&quot;. But critical opinion varies extremely. The book is &quot;a masterpiece of literature as well as philosophy&quot; and &quot;in large part a failure&quot;.

The style of the book, along with its ambiguity and paradoxical nature, has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis (as Nietzsche may have intended). &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; remained unpopular as a topic for scholars (especially those in the Anglo-American analytic tradition) until the latter half of the 20th century brought widespread interest in Nietzsche and his unconventional style.

The critic Harold Bloom criticized &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; in &quot;The Western Canon&quot; (1994), calling it &quot;a gorgeous disaster&quot; and &quot;unreadable&quot;. Other commentators have suggested that Nietzsche&#x27;s style is intentionally ironic for much of the book.

==English translations==

The first English translation of &quot;Zarathustra&quot; was published in 1896 by Alexander Tille.

=== Common (1909) ===
Thomas Common published a translation in 1909 which was based on Alexander Tille&#x27;s earlier attempt.

Kaufmann&#x27;s introduction to his own translation included a blistering critique of Common&#x27;s version; he notes that in one instance, Common has taken the German &quot;most evil&quot; and rendered it &quot;baddest&quot;, a particularly unfortunate error not merely for his having coined the term &quot;baddest&quot;, but also because Nietzsche dedicated a third of &quot;The Genealogy of Morals&quot; to the difference between &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. This and other errors led Kaufmann to wonder whether Common &quot;had little German and less English&quot;.

The German text available to Common was considerably flawed.

From &quot;Zarathustra&#x27;s Prologue&quot;:
=== Kaufmann (1954) and Hollingdale (1961) ===
The Common translation remained widely accepted until more critical translations, titled &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, were published by Walter Kaufmann in 1954, and R.J. Hollingdale in 1961.

Clancy Martin states the German text from which Hollingdale and Kaufmann worked was untrue to Nietzsche&#x27;s own work in some ways. Martin criticizes Kaufmann for changing punctuation, altering literal and philosophical meanings, and dampening some of Nietzsche&#x27;s more controversial metaphors. Kaufmann&#x27;s version, which has become the most widely available, features a translator&#x27;s note suggesting that Nietzsche&#x27;s text would have benefited from an editor; Martin suggests that Kaufmann &quot;took it upon himself to become [Nietzsche&#x27;s] editor&quot;.

<text>Bach flower remedies (BFRs) are solutions of brandy and water—the water containing extreme dilutions of flower material developed by Edward Bach, an English homeopath, in the 1910s. Bach claimed that the dew found on flower petals retains the supposed healing properties of that plant. Systematic reviews of clinical trials of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond that of a placebo.

==Description==
The Bach flower remedy solutions, which contain a 50:50 mix of water and rum, are called mother tincture. Stock remedies—the solutions sold in shops—are dilutions of mother tincture into other liquid. Most often the liquid used is alcohol, so that the alcohol level by volume in most stock Bach remedies is between 25 and 40% (50 to 80 proof). The solutions do not have a characteristic scent or taste of the plant because of dilution. The dilution process results in the statistical likelihood that little more than a single molecule may remain; it is claimed that the remedies contain &quot;energetic&quot; or &quot;vibrational&quot; nature of the flower and that this can be transmitted to the user. The solutions are described by some as vibrational medicines, which implies they rely on the pseudoscientific concept of water memory. They are often labeled as homeopathic because they are extremely diluted in water, but are not homeopathy as they do not follow other homeopathic ideas such as the law of similars.

== Effectiveness ==
In a 2002 database review of randomized trials Edzard Ernst concluded:

All randomized double-blind studies, whether finding for or against the solutions, have suffered from small cohort sizes but the studies using the best methods found no effect over placebo. The most likely means of action for flower remedies is as placebos, enhanced by introspection on the patient&#x27;s emotional state, or simply being listened to by the practitioner. The act of selecting and taking a remedy may act as a calming ritual.

A systematic review in 2009 concluded:
A newer systematic review published in 2010 by Ernst concluded: 

Flower remedies are sometimes promoted as being capable of boosting the immune system, but &quot;there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer&quot;.

==Use==
Each solution is used alone or in conjunction with other solutions, and each flower is said by advocates to impart specific qualities. Remedies are usually taken orally.

The solutions may be recommended by a naturopath or by a trained Bach flower practitioner after an interview.. Neither of these are licensed medical professionals.

The best known solution product is the &quot;Rescue Remedy&quot; combination, which contains an equal amount each of rock rose, impatiens, clematis, star of Bethlehem and cherry plum remedies. Rescue Remedy is a trademark and other companies produce the same formula under other names, such as Five Flower Remedy. &quot;Rescue Cream&quot; contains the same remedies in a cream form, with the addition of crab apple.

== Philosophy ==

Bach believed that illness was the result of a conflict between the purposes of the soul and the personality&#x27;s actions and outlook. This internal war, according to Bach, leads to negative moods and to &quot;energy blocking&quot;, thought to cause a lack of &quot;harmony&quot;, thus leading to physical diseases.

Bach derived his solutions intuitively and based on his perceived psychic connections to the plants, rather than using research based on scientific methods. If Bach felt a negative emotion, he would hold his hand over different plants, and if one alleviated the emotion, he would ascribe the power to heal that emotional problem to that plant. He imagined that early-morning sunlight passing through dew-drops on flower petals transferred the healing power of the flower onto the water, so he would collect the dew drops from the plants and preserve the dew with an equal amount of brandy to produce a mother tincture which would be further diluted before use. Later, he found that the amount of dew he could collect was not sufficient, so he would suspend flowers in spring water and allow the sun&#x27;s rays to pass through them. If this was impractical because of lack of sunlight or other reasons, he wrote that the flowers may be boiled. The result of this process Bach termed the &quot;mother tincture&quot;, which is then further diluted before sale or use.

Bach was satisfied with the method, because of its simplicity, and because it involved a process of combination of the four elements:

By the time of his death in 1936 at 50 years of age, Bach had created a system of 38 different flower remedies along with their corresponding theories of ailments.

<doc id="185618" wikidata="Q1190985" url="?curid=185618" title="Heavenly Stems">
<text>The ten Heavenly Stems (or Celestial Stems) are a system of ordinals indigenous to China and used throughout East Asia, first attested during the Shang dynasty as the names of the ten days of the week. They were also used in Shang-era rituals in the names of dead family members, who were offered sacrifices on the corresponding day of the Shang week. Stems are no longer used as names for the days of the week, but have acquired many other uses. Most prominently, they have been used in conjunction with the associated set of twelve Earthly Branches in the compound sexagenary cycle, an important feature of historical Chinese calendars.

==Origin==
Some scholars believe the Heavenly Stems, and the associated ten-day week, are connected to a story from Chinese mythology where ten suns appeared in the sky, whose order comprised a ten-day cycle (); the Heavenly Stems are conjectured to be the names for each of these ten suns. They were found in the given names of the kings of the Shang in their temple names. These consisted of a relational term (&#x27;father&#x27;, &#x27;mother&#x27;, &#x27;grandfather&#x27;, &#x27;grandmother&#x27;) which was added to one of the ten Stems—e.g. &#x27;Grandfather Jia&#x27;. These names are often found on Shang bronzes designating whom the bronze was honoring (and on which day of the week their rites would have been performed, that day matching the day designated by their name). The sinologist David Keightley, who specialized in ancient Chinese bronzes, believes that the Stems were chosen posthumously through divination. Some historians think the ruling class of the Shang had ten clans, but it is not clear whether their society reflected the myth or vice versa. Their association with the concepts of yin and yang and &quot;wuxing&quot; developed following the collapse of the Shang.

Jonathan Smith has proposed that the heavenly stems predate the Shang and originally referred to ten asterisms along the ecliptic, of which their oracle bone script characters were drawings; he identifies similarities between these and asterisms in the later Four Images and Twenty-Eight Mansions systems. These would have been used to track the moon&#x27;s progression along its monthly circuit, in conjunction with the earthly branches referring to its phase.

The literal meanings of the characters were, and are now, roughly as follows. Among the modern meanings, those deriving from the characters&#x27; position in the sequence of Heavenly Stems are in italics.

== Current usage ==
The Heavenly Stems remain widely used as ordinals throughout the Sinosphere, similarly to the way the alphabet is used in languages like English.

* In Korea and Japan, the Heavenly Stems are used in legal documents: the Korean renderings () and () are used to indicate the larger and the smaller parties to a legal contract, respectively—and are sometimes used as synonyms for such. This use is also common in the Korean IT industry.

* The Chinese mathematician Li Shanlan (1810–1882) developed a system using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches to stand in for Latin letters in their use as labels for mathematical variables. In Li&#x27;s system, the letters – are represented by the ten Heavenly Stems, – are represented by the twelve Earthly Branches, and the final four letters , , and are represented by (&#x27;matter&#x27;), (&#x27;Heaven&#x27;), (&#x27;earth&#x27;), and (&#x27;human&#x27;) respectively. The radical may be added to any of the aforementioned character to indicate the upper case form of the corresponding letter: e.g. → , → ; → , → .
* Names for organic chemicals—e.g. methanol (), ethanol ().
* Diseases—e.g. Hepatitis A (), Hepatitis B: ().
* Sports leagues—e.g. Serie A is rendered as .
* Students&#x27; grades in Taiwan, with the inserted prior to the Heavenly Stems in the list—i.e. the American grades A, B, C, D and F correspond to , , , and .
* In astrology and feng shui, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches form the four pillars of Chinese metaphysics in Qimen Dunjia and Daliuren.

<text>Vocal cord nodules are bilaterally symmetrical benign white masses that form at the midpoint of the vocal folds. Although diagnosis involves a physical examination of the head and neck, as well as perceptual voice measures, visualization of the vocal nodules via laryngeal endoscopy remains the primary diagnostic method. Vocal fold nodules interfere with the vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds by increasing the mass of the vocal folds and changing the configuration of the vocal fold closure pattern. Due to these changes, the quality of the voice may be affected. As such, the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules include vocal hoarseness and breathiness. Other common symptoms include vocal fatigue, soreness or pain lateral to the larynx, and reduced frequency and intensity range. Airflow levels during speech may also be increased. Vocal fold nodules are thought to be the result of vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress, including repeated or chronic vocal overuse, abuse, or misuse. Predisposing factors include profession, gender, dehydration, respiratory infection, and other inflammatory factors.

For professional voice users as well as individuals who frequently experience hoarseness, vocal hygiene practices are recommended for the prevention of vocal fold nodules and other voice disorders. Vocal hygiene practices include three components: regulating the quantity and quality of voice use, improving vocal fold hydration, and reducing behaviours that jeopardize vocal health. About 10% of nodules resolve on their own, which is more likely if they are smaller and the onset more recent. Treatment of vocal fold nodules usually involves behavioural intervention therapy administered by a speech–language pathologist. In severe cases, surgery to remove the lesions is recommended for best prognosis. In children, vocal fold nodules are more common in males; in adults, they are more common in females.

== Signs and symptoms ==

One of the major perceptual signs of vocal fold nodules is a change in the quality of the voice. The voice may be perceived as hoarse, due to aperiodic vibrations of the vocal folds, and may also be perceived as breathy, due to an incomplete closure of the vocal folds upon phonation. The degree of hoarseness and breathiness perceived may vary in severity. This variability may be due to the size and firmness of the nodules. Other common symptoms include difficulty producing vocal pitches in the higher range, increased phonatory effort, and vocal fatigue. There may be a sensation of soreness or pain in the neck, lateral to the larynx, which generally occurs because of the increased effort needed to produce the voice.

=== Acoustic signs ===
Major acoustic signs of vocal fold nodules involve changes in the frequency and the intensity of the voice. The fundamental frequency, an acoustic measure of voice pitch, may be normal. However, the range of pitches the individual is capable of producing may be reduced, and it may be especially difficult to produce pitches in the higher range. The intensity of the voice, an acoustic measure of amplitude or loudness, may also be normal. However, the individual&#x27;s amplitude range may be reduced as well. Perturbations or variations in frequency, known as jitter, and in amplitude, known as shimmer, may be increased.

=== Aerodynamic signs ===
If the nodules affect the closure of the vocal folds, airflow levels during speech may be increased in comparison to the speaker&#x27;s habitual levels. However, airflow levels may still fall within the upper limits of the normal range. The degree to which an individual&#x27;s airflow levels increase seems to depend on the severity of the injury. Subglottal pressure, the air pressure that is available below the glottis and in the trachea to produce speech, may be increased as well.

== Causes ==
Vocal fold nodules are thought to be the result of vocal fold tissue trauma caused by excessive mechanical stress. During phonation, the vocal folds undergo many forms of mechanical stress. One example of such stress is the impact stress caused by the collision between the left and right vocal fold surfaces during vibration. This stress is thought to reach its maximum in the mid-membranous region of the vocal folds, at the junction of the anterior 1/3rd and posterior 2/3rd, the most common site of nodule formation. Vocal overuse (speaking for long periods), abuse (yelling), or misuse (hyperfunction) may produce excessive amounts of mechanical stress by increasing the rate and/or force with which the vocal folds collide. This may lead to trauma that is focalized to the mid-membranous vocal fold and subsequent wound formation. Repeated or chronic mechanical stress is thought to lead to the remodeling of the superficial layer of the lamina propria. It is this process of tissue remodeling that results in the formation of benign lesions of the vocal folds such as nodules.

There are several factors that may predispose an individual to vocal fold nodules. Activities or professions that may contribute to phonotraumatic behaviors include cheerleading, untrained singing, speaking above noise, and teaching without voice amplification, as these increase mechanical stress and subsequent vocal fold trauma. Gender may be another predisposing factor, as vocal fold nodules occur more frequently in females. The presence of dehydration, respiratory infection, and inflammatory factors may also act as predisposing or aggravating factors. Inflammatory factors may include allergies, tobacco and alcohol use, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and other environmental influences.

== Pathophysiology ==
Vocal fold nodules often alter the mechanical properties of the vocal folds, which can interfere with their vibratory characteristics. Nodules may increase the mass of the vocal folds, especially along the medial edge where they are typically found. This increased mass may result in aperiodic or irregular vibration, the perception of greater pitch and loudness perturbations, and of increased hoarseness. Nodules may also affect the mucosal wave of the vocal folds by changing the configuration of the vocal fold closure pattern. They often cause incomplete closure of the vocal folds, resulting in an hourglass configuration. The incomplete closure allows more air to escape through the vocal folds, which often results in the perception of breathiness. The degree to which nodules will affect the mucosal wave and vibratory characteristics of the vocal folds depends highly on the size of the nodule. Smaller nodules may still allow the vocal folds to achieve complete closure.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosing vocal fold nodules typically includes a comprehensive analysis of medical and voice history, a physical examination of the head and neck, perceptual evaluation of voice, and visualization of the vocal folds. Visualization is considered to be the main method of diagnosis as perceptual evaluation, which includes acoustic and aerodynamic measures, alone is insufficient. Laryngeal videostroboscopy, an imaging technique, is commonly used to view the vocal folds: this procedure can be performed nasally or orally. Vocal fold nodules are most often characterized as bilaterally symmetrical whitish masses, and tend to form at the midpoint of the vocal folds.

Nodules may prevent complete closure of the glottis, also known as glottal closure, and their presence may lead to an hourglass-shaped glottal closure. Voice problems may result from the presence of vocal fold nodules. They are diagnosed based on the presence of perceptual features not explicable by other causes. Such symptoms include: vocal fatigue, breathiness, loss of high pitch notes, lack of vocal control, or increased phonatory effort (i.e. increased effort to produce speech).

== Prevention ==

=== Regulating voice use ===
For individuals who work with their voice (e.g., singers, actors, teachers, stock brokers), voice training that includes vocal function exercises (VFEs) may help reduce undue vocal strain. Furthermore, recommendations for voice professionals include warm-up and cool-down exercises for the voice to reduce strain. Additionally, using amplification devices, such as speakers or microphones, is recommended for individuals who speak to large, and even small groups or in the presence of background noise.

=== Hydration ===
Staying hydrated decreases the pressure that the vocal folds exert on one another by ensuring sufficient lubrication by mucosa, increasing the efficiency of vocal fold oscillation during speech, and promoting a healthy voice quality. Consumption of caffeine in large quantities is dehydrating and is therefore implicated in an increased risk of vocal fold nodules.

=== Lifestyle changes ===
Behaviours such as frequent throat clearing, shouting, speaking over background noise, and hard crying are associated with an increased risk of developing nodules and other vocal pathologies. Furthermore, unconventional voice practices such as speaking in the falsetto register, cause excessive strain and may result in nodules. The avoidance of damaging vocal behaviours may prevent the formation of nodules. Tobacco, alcohol, certain medications, and recreational drugs have also been implicated in pathologies of the vocal folds. Reducing exposure to these substances has been shown to reduce one&#x27;s risk of nodules. Other behaviours that are implicated in vocal fold nodules include poor sleeping habits and poor nutrition.

==Treatment==
The two main methods of treating vocal fold nodules are voice therapy (a behavioural treatment) and laryngeal microsurgery (a surgical treatment). Because of general risks of surgery (e.g. scar formation, or those posed by general anesthesia), behavioural treatment is usually recommended first.

=== Behavioural treatment ===
Behavioural voice therapy is typically carried out by speech–language pathologists. While behavioural treatments methods vary greatly, they are generally effective at improving vocal quality and decreasing size of vocal fold nodules. Complete resolution of nodules through behavioural treatment is possible but unlikely.

Behavioural techniques can be indirect or direct. Indirect approaches focus on improving vocal hygiene, introducing and/or maintaining safe voice practices (thereby reducing opportunities for phonotrauma) and, occasionally, implementing vocal rest. Direct approaches involve reducing the physiological strain on the vocal system while the voice is being used (e.g. during speaking or singing), such as by reducing collision forces between the vocal folds, ensuring sufficient pulmonary support while speaking (e.g. by changing the individual&#x27;s breathing pattern), and optimizing resonance of the larynx and other structures of the vocal apparatus.

Behavioural treatments also vary in delivery model. Traditional therapy distribution (e.g. eight sessions within eight weeks), more intensive approaches (e.g. eight session within three weeks) and remote therapy (i.e. telehealth) have all shown effectiveness in treating vocal fold nodules.

Assessment of outcomes of behavioural treatments also varies greatly. Effects can be measured visually (e.g. by the same methods typically used to confirm the presence of vocal fold nodules: video endoscopy and video stroboscopy), aerodynamically (e.g. by measuring parameters such as transglottal pressure and the glottal airflow waveform), perceptually (e.g. by rating the voice in terms of dimensions such as roughness, breathiness, asthenia and strain), in terms of effect on quality of life measures, or using any combination of the above.

Finally, recurrence of vocal fold nodules after behavioural treatment is always a possibility, particularly if nodules were not completely resolved or if skills gained during treatment were not carried-over outside of therapy sessions or maintained after therapy blocks.

=== Surgery ===
When behavioural treatments have been deemed ineffective for a voice user, surgical intervention is often considered. Surgical treatments are considered in cases of unresolved dysphonia which negatively impacts the patient&#x27;s quality of life. Removal of vocal fold nodules is a relatively safe and minor surgery. However, those who sing professionally or otherwise should take serious consideration before having surgery as it can affect the ability to sustain phonation, as well as alter the vocal range. While the patient is subdued under general anesthesia, long thin scissors and scalpels or CO2 surgical lasers might be used to remove the nodules. Microsutures are sometimes used to close the incision. Vocal rest for a period of 4 to 14 days is recommended post surgery to facilitate healing.

== Prognosis ==
Vocal fold nodules typically respond well to non-surgical/behavioural treatment techniques such as those described in the &quot;Treatment&quot; section. Therefore, if the patient is able to engage in such behaviour modification techniques the prognosis is good (although exact data is not available). If lesions are still present after non-surgical treatment methods, it is likely they are another form of benign vocal fold lesion (polyp, fibrous mass, cyst, or pseudocyst). The prognosis of requiring surgery would only occur after an exhaustive attempt at non-surgical therapy techniques has been applied.

== Epidemiology ==
Research on the epidemiology of vocal fold nodules in children has suggested that nodules are more common in boys (2:1), in particular boys who are active and scream more frequently. However, in adulthood, women are more likely to have nodules, and are especially likely if they have an outgoing personality or sing frequently. The exact prevalence of vocal fold nodules is not known, but it has been reported that 23.4% of children who attended an ENT clinic for voice hoarseness, 6% of phoniatric clinic attendees, and 43% of teachers with dysphonia had nodules.

<text>Clement Greenberg () (January 16, 1909 – May 7, 1994), occasionally writing under the pseudonym K. Hardesh, was an American essayist known mainly as an art critic closely associated with American modern art of the mid-20th century and a formalist aesthetician. He is best remembered for his association with the art movement abstract expressionism and the painter Jackson Pollock.

== Early life ==
Clement Greenberg was born in the Bronx, New York City, in 1909. His parents were middle-class Jewish immigrants, and he was the eldest of their three sons. Since childhood, Greenberg sketched compulsively, until becoming a young adult, when he began to focus on literature. He attended Erasmus Hall High School, the Marquand School for Boys, and Syracuse University, graduating with an A.B. in 1930, cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa. After college, already fluent in Yiddish and English since childhood, Greenberg taught himself Italian and German in addition to French and Latin. Over the next few years, he traveled the U.S. working for his father&#x27;s dry-goods business, but the work did not suit his inclinations, so he turned to working as a translator. Greenberg married in 1934, had a son the next year, and was divorced the year after that. In 1936, he took a series of jobs with the federal government, in the Civil Service Administration, the Veterans&#x27; Administration, and finally the Appraisers&#x27; Division of the Customs Service in 1937. It was then that Greenberg began to write seriously, and soon after began getting published in a handful of small magazines and literary journals.

== &quot;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&quot; ==
Though his first published essays dealt mainly with literature and theatre, art still held a powerful attraction for Greenberg, so in 1939, he made a sudden name as a visual art writer with possibly his most well-known and oft-quoted essay, &quot;Avant-Garde and Kitsch&quot;, first published in the journal &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. In this Marxist-influenced essay, Greenberg claimed that true avant-garde art is a product of the Enlightenment&#x27;s revolution of critical thinking, and as such resists and recoils from the degradation of culture in both mainstream capitalist and communist society, while acknowledging the paradox that, at the same time, the artist, dependent on the market or the state, remains inexorably attached &quot;by an umbilical cord of gold&quot;. Kitsch, on the other hand, is the product of industrialization and the urbanization of the working class, a filler made for consumption by the working class: a populace hungry for culture, but without the resources and education to enjoy avant-garde culture. Greenberg writes:

Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility. It is the source of its profits. Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas. Kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations. Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same. Kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times. Kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money—not even their time.

For Greenberg, avant-garde art was too &quot;innocent&quot; to be effectively used as propaganda or bent to a cause, while kitsch was ideal for stirring up false sentiment.

Greenberg appropriated the German word &quot;kitsch&quot; to describe this low, concocted form of &quot;culture&quot;, though its connotations have since been recast to a more affirmative acceptance of nostalgic materials of capitalist/communist culture.

== Art history, Abstract Expressionism and after==
Greenberg wrote several seminal essays that defined his views on art history in the 20th century.

In 1940, Greenberg joined &quot;Partisan Review&quot; as an editor. He became art critic for &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1942. He was associate editor of &quot;Commentary&quot; from 1945 until 1957.

In December 1950, Greenberg joined the government funded American Committee for Cultural Freedom. He believed modernism provided a critical commentary on experience. It was constantly changing to adapt to kitsch pseudo-culture, which was itself always developing. In the years after World War II, Greenberg pushed the position that the best avant-garde artists were emerging in America rather than Europe. Particularly, he championed Jackson Pollock as the greatest painter of his generation, commemorating the artist&#x27;s &quot;all-over&quot; gestural canvases. In the 1955 essay &quot;American-Type Painting&quot;, Greenberg promoted the work of Abstract Expressionists, among them Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, Barnett Newman, and Clyfford Still, as the next stage in Modernist art, arguing that these painters were moving toward greater emphasis on the &quot;flatness&quot; of the picture plane.

Greenberg helped to articulate a concept of medium specificity. It posited that there are inherent qualities specific to each artistic medium, and part of the modernist project involved creating artworks that are more and more committed to their particular medium. In the case of painting, the two-dimensional reality of the medium led to an increasing emphasis on flatness, in contrast with the illusion of depth commonly found in painting since the Renaissance and the invention of pictorial perspective.

In Greenberg&#x27;s view, after World War II the United States had become the guardian of &quot;advanced art&quot;. He praised similar movements abroad and, after the success of the Painters Eleven exhibition in 1956 with the American Abstract Artists at New York&#x27;s Riverside Gallery, he traveled to Toronto in 1957 to see the group&#x27;s work. He was particularly impressed by the potential of painters William Ronald and Jack Bush, and later developed a close friendship with Bush. Greenberg saw Bush&#x27;s post-Painters Eleven work as a clear manifestation of the shift from abstract expressionism to color field painting and lyrical abstraction, a shift he had called for in most of his critical writings of the period.

Greenberg expressed mixed feelings about pop art. On the one hand he maintained that pop art partook of a trend toward &quot;openness and clarity as against the turgidities of second generation Abstract Expressionism.&quot; But Greenberg claimed that pop art did not &quot;really challenge taste on more than a superficial level&quot;.

During the 1960s, Greenberg remained an influential figure on a younger generation of critics, including Michael Fried and Rosalind E. Krauss. His antagonism to &quot;postmodernist&quot; theories and socially engaged movements in art caused him to become a target for critics who labeled him, and the art he admired, &quot;old-fashioned&quot;.

In 1968, Greenberg delivered the inaugural John Power Memorial Lecture at the Power Institute of Fine Arts at the University of Sydney, Australia.

In his book &quot;The Painted Word&quot;, Tom Wolfe criticized Greenberg along with Harold Rosenberg and Leo Steinberg, whom he dubbed the kings of &quot;Cultureburg&quot;. Wolfe argued that these three critics were dominating the world of art with their theories and that, unlike the world of literature in which anyone can buy a book, the art world was controlled by an insular circle of rich collectors, museums and critics with outsized influence.

== Post-painterly abstraction ==

Eventually, Greenberg was concerned that some abstract expressionism had been &quot;reduced to a set of mannerisms&quot; and increasingly looked to a new set of artists who abandoned such elements as subject matter, connection with the artist, and definite brush strokes. He suggested this process attained a level of &quot;purity&quot; (a word he only used within scare quotes) that revealed the truthfulness of the canvas, and the two-dimensional aspects of the space (flatness). Greenberg coined the term &quot;post-painterly abstraction&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;abstract expressionism&quot;, or &quot;painterly abstraction&quot;, as he preferred to call it. &quot;Post-painterly abstraction&quot; was a term given to myriad abstract art that reacted against gestural abstraction of second-generation abstract expressionists. Among the dominant trends in post-painterly abstraction are hard-edged painters such as Ellsworth Kelly and Frank Stella, who explored relationships between tightly ruled shapes and edges—in Stella&#x27;s case, between the shapes depicted on the surface and the literal shape of the support—and color-field painters such as Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis, who stained first Magna then water-based acrylic paints into unprimed canvas, exploring tactile and optical aspects of large, vivid fields of pure, open color. The line between these movements is tenuous, however, as artists such as Kenneth Noland used aspects of both movements in his art. Post-painterly abstraction is generally seen as continuing the modernist dialectic of self-criticism.

==Clement Greenberg Collection==
In 2000, the Portland Art Museum (PAM) acquired the Clement Greenberg Collection of 159 paintings, prints, drawings, and sculpture by 59 important artists of the late-20th century and early-21st century. PAM exhibits the works primarily in the Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art; some sculpture resides outdoors. Most of the artists represented are American, along with several Canadians and a handful of artists of other nationalities. Artists represented in the collection include Edward Avedisian, Walter Darby Bannard, Stanley Boxer, Jack Bush, Anthony Caro, Dan Christensen, Ronald Davis, Richard Diebenkorn, Enrico Donati, Friedel Dzubas, André Fauteux, Paul Feeley, Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Goodnough, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Wolfgang Hollegha, Robert Jacobsen, Paul Jenkins, Seymour Lipton, Georges Mathieu, Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, William Perehudoff, Jackson Pollock, Larry Poons, William Ronald, Anne Ryan, David Smith, Theodoros Stamos, Anne Truitt, Alfred Wallis, and Larry Zox.

Greenberg&#x27;s widow, Janice van Horne, donated his annotated library of exhibition catalogues and publications on artists in Greenberg&#x27;s collection to the Portland Art Museum. Greenberg&#x27;s annotated library is available at the Portland Art Museum&#x27;s Crumpacker Family Library which is open to the public free of charge.

==In popular culture==
Greenberg was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Tambor in the 2000 film &quot;Pollock&quot;, about the life of Jackson Pollock.

<text>The Gherkin, officially 30 St Mary Axe and previously known as the Swiss Re Building, is a commercial skyscraper in London&#x27;s primary financial district, the City of London. It was completed in December 2003 and opened in April 2004. With 41 floors, it is tall and stands on the sites of the former Baltic Exchange and Chamber of Shipping, which were extensively damaged in 1992 in the Baltic Exchange bombing by a device placed by the Provisional IRA in St Mary Axe, a narrow street leading north from Leadenhall Street.

After plans to build the 92-storey Millennium Tower were dropped, 30 St Mary Axe was designed by Foster + Partners and the Arup Group. It was built by Skanska; construction started in 2001.

The building has become a recognisable landmark of London, and it is one of the city&#x27;s most widely recognised examples of contemporary architecture. It won the 2003 Emporis Skyscraper Award.

== Site and early plans ==
The building stands on the site of the former Baltic Exchange (24–28 St Mary Axe), which was the headquarters of a global marketplace for shipping freight contracts and soft commodities, and the Chamber of Shipping (30–32 St Mary Axe). The tower&#x27;s topmost panoramic dome, known as the &quot;Lens&quot;, recalls the iconic glass dome that covered part of the ground floor of the Baltic Exchange and much of which is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum. &quot;The Gherkin&quot; nickname was applied to the current building at least as early as 1999, referring to the plan&#x27;s highly unorthodox layout and appearance.

On 10 April 1992, the Provisional IRA detonated a bomb close to the Baltic Exchange, causing extensive damage to the historic building and neighbouring structures. The United Kingdom government&#x27;s statutory adviser on the historic environment, English Heritage, and the City of London&#x27;s governing body, the City of London Corporation, were keen that any redevelopment must restore the Baltic Exchange&#x27;s old façade onto St Mary Axe. The Exchange Hall was a celebrated fixture of the shipping market.

English Heritage then discovered that the damage was far more severe than initially thought, and they stopped insisting on full restoration, albeit over the objections of architectural conservationists. The Baltic Exchange and the Chamber of Shipping sold the land to Trafalgar House in 1995. Most of the remaining structures on the Baltic Exchange site were then carefully dismantled, and the interior of Exchange Hall and the façade were preserved, hoping for a reconstruction of the building in the future. The salvaged material was sold for £800,000 and moved to Tallinn, Estonia, where it awaits reconstruction as the centrepiece of the city&#x27;s commercial sector.

In 1996, Trafalgar House submitted plans for the London Millennium Tower, a building with more than of office space, apartments, shops, restaurants and gardens. This plan was dropped after objections that it was totally out-of-scale in the City of London, and anticipated disruption to flight paths for both London City and London Heathrow airports; the revised plan for a lower tower was accepted.

=== Planning process ===
John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, granted planning permission on 23 August 2000 to construct a building on the site, which would be much larger than the old Exchange. The site needed development, was not on any of the &quot;sight lines&quot; (planning guidance requires that new buildings do not obstruct or detract from the view of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral dome when viewed from a number of locations around London), and had housed the Baltic Exchange.

The plan for the site was to reconstruct the Baltic Exchange. GMW Architects proposed a new rectangular building surrounding a restored exchange: it would have the type of large floor plan that banks liked. Eventually, the planners realised that the exchange was not recoverable, forcing them to relax their building constraints; they hinted that an &quot;architecturally significant&quot; building might obtain a favourable reception from City authorities. This enabled alternative designs to be considered. The building was redesigned according to the client&#x27;s needs, rather than for the needs of a large, capital-efficient, money-making building.

The new building&#x27;s low-level plan satisfied the planning authority&#x27;s desire to maintain London&#x27;s traditional streetscape, with its narrow streets. The massing of the tower was not too imposing. Like Barclays&#x27; former city headquarters in Lombard Street, the idea was that the passer-by in neighbouring streets would be nearly oblivious to the tower&#x27;s existence until directly underneath it.

Foster and Partners was awarded the tender for its design for the building in 1999. The project was managed by RWG Associates, structural engineering was provided by Arup, and Skanska served as the main contractor.

== Design and construction ==
The design by Foster + Assocs has been described as incorporating various architectural styles: high-tech architecture (also known as structural expressionism), neo-futurism, and post-modernism.

The building was constructed by Skanska, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004. The main tenant of the building is Swiss Re, who had the building commissioned as the head office for its UK operation. The tower is thus sometimes known as the Swiss Re Building, although this name has never been official and was never in popular usage anyway, unlike the Gherkin moniker.

The building uses energy-saving methods which allow it to use only half the power that a similar tower would typically consume. Gaps in each floor create six shafts that serve as a natural ventilation system for the entire building, even though required firebreaks on every sixth floor interrupt the &quot;chimney&quot;. The shafts create a giant double glazing effect; air is sandwiched between two layers of glazing and insulates the office space inside.

Architects promote double glazing in residential houses, which avoids the inefficient convection of heat across the relatively narrow gap between the panes, but the tower exploits this effect. The shafts pull warm air out of the building during the summer and warm the building in the winter using passive solar heating. The shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building, making the work environment more pleasing, and keeping the lighting costs down.

The primary methods for controlling wind-excited sways are to increase the stiffness, or increase damping with tuned/active mass dampers. To a design by Arup, its fully triangulated perimeter structure makes the building rigid enough without any extra reinforcements. Despite its overall curved glass shape, there is only one piece of curved glass on the building, the lens-shaped cap at the apex.

On the building&#x27;s top level (the 40th floor), there is a bar for tenants and their guests, with a panoramic view of London. A restaurant operates on the 39th floor, and private dining rooms on the 38th. Most buildings have extensive lift equipment on the roof of the building, but this was not possible for the Gherkin, since a bar had been planned for the 40th floor. The architects dealt with this by having the main lift only reach the 34th floor, with a separate push-from-below lift to the 39th floor. There is a marble stairwell and a disabled persons&#x27; lift, which leads the visitor up to the bar in the dome.

The building is visible over long distances: From the north, for instance, it can be seen from the M11 motorway, some away, while to the west it can be seen from the statue of George III in Windsor Great Park.

== After completion ==

In April 2005, a glass panel two thirds up the tower fell to the plaza beneath. The plaza was sealed off, but the building remained open. A temporary covered walkway, extending across the plaza to the building&#x27;s reception, was erected to protect visitors. Engineers examined the other 744 glass panels on the building. The cost of repair was covered by main contractor Skanska and curtain-wall supplier Schmidlin (now called Schmidlin-TSK AG). The open-floor ventilation system did not operate as designed due to tenants adding glass partitions to increase security.

Since its completion, the building has won a number of awards for architecture. In October 2004, the architect was awarded the 2004 Stirling Prize. For the first time in the prize&#x27;s history, the judges were unanimous. In December 2005, a survey of the world&#x27;s largest firms of architects published in &quot;2006 BD World Architecture 200&quot; voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster + Partners on the design of the building, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: &quot;I was looking at the glass all around and [thought], &#x27;Why on earth did we do that?&#x27; Now, we would do things differently.&quot; The building appeared in recent films such as &quot;Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince&quot;, &quot;A Good Year&quot;, &quot;Basic Instinct 2&quot;, and &quot;Match Point&quot; and, rechristened the &quot;Spirit of London&quot;, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London&quot;.

In September 2006, the building was put up for sale with a price tag of £600 million. Potential buyers included British Land, Land Securities, Prudential, ING, and the Abu Dhabi royal family. On 21 February 2007, IVG Immobilien AG and UK investment firm Evans Randall completed their joint purchase of the building for £630 million, making it Britain&#x27;s most expensive office building. Swiss Re made a gain of more than £300 million from the sale. The new owners are seeking compensation from four of their former managers on the deal, in which about £620 million was paid for a building with a build cost of about £200 million, giving the previous owners a clear £300 million profit.

Since February 2010, Sky News has broadcast its flagship business programme, &quot;Jeff Randall Live&quot;, from a studio in the building. The top two floors of the tower have been available since at least 2015 for private hire for events.
Deloitte announced in April 2014 that the building was again being put up for sale, with an expected price of £550 million. The current owners could not afford to make loan repayments, citing differences in the value of the multi-currency loan and the British pound, high interest rates and general financing structure. In November 2014, the Gherkin was purchased for £700 million by the Safra Group, controlled by the Lebanese - Brazilian billionaire Joseph Safra.

=== Roman tomb ===
In the construction process of 30 St Mary Axe, a skeleton of a teenage girl was unearthed and dated as roughly 1600 years old. To prevent damaging it throughout the construction process, it was stored in the Museum of London. In 2006, 3 years after the completion of the building, she was returned to and reburied on the site. Her tomb is visible and marked with an inscription in both Latin and English:

<text>The MPEG-21 standard, from the Moving Picture Experts Group, aims at defining an open framework for multimedia applications. MPEG-21 is ratified in the standards ISO/IEC 21000 - Multimedia framework (MPEG-21).

MPEG-21 is based on two essential concepts: 
* definition of a Digital Item (a fundamental unit of distribution and transaction)
* users interacting with Digital Items

Digital Items can be considered the kernel of the Multimedia Framework and the users can be considered as who interacts with them inside the Multimedia Framework. At its most basic level, MPEG-21 provides a framework in which one user interacts with another one, and the object of that interaction is a Digital Item. Due to that, we could say that the main objective of the MPEG-21 is to define the technology needed to support users to exchange, access, consume, trade or manipulate Digital Items in an efficient and transparent way.

&quot;MPEG-21 Part 9: File Format&quot; defined the storage of an MPEG-21 Digital Item in a file format based on the ISO base media file format, with some or all of Digital Item&#x27;s ancillary data (such as movies, images or other non-XML data) within the same file. It uses filename extensions &quot;.m21&quot; or &quot;.mp21&quot; and MIME type &quot;application/mp21&quot;.

==Digital rights management==

MPEG-21 defines also a &quot;Rights Expression Language&quot; standard as means of managing restrictions for digital content usage. As an XML-based standard, MPEG-21 is designed to communicate machine-readable license information and do so in a &quot;ubiquitous, unambiguous and secure&quot; manner.

Among the aspirations for this standard, that the industry hope will put an end to file sharing, is that it will constitute: &quot;A normative open framework for multimedia delivery and consumption for use by all the players in the delivery and consumption chain. This open framework will provide content creators, producers, distributors and service providers with equal opportunities in the MPEG-21 enabled open market.&quot;

<doc id="185637" wikidata="Q3786" url="?curid=185637" title="Esslingen am Neckar">
<text>Esslingen am Neckar (Swabian: &quot;Esslenga am Neckor&quot;; until 16 October 1964 officially &quot; Eßlingen am Neckar&quot;) is a town in the Stuttgart Region of Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany, seat of the District of Esslingen as well as the largest town in the district. Within Baden-Württemberg it is the 11th largest city.

It is located on the river Neckar, about southeast of Stuttgart city center. The regions surrounding the city of Esslingen are also mostly developed.

Esslingen was a free imperial city for several centuries until it was annexed by Württemberg in 1802.

The German Timber-Frame Road passes through the city.

== History ==

=== Prehistoric times ===
There is archaeological evidence that what is now the city of Esslingen was settled since the Neolithic period. Traces of human settlement found at the site of the city church date back to around 1000 B.C.

=== Roman times ===
In the 1st century AD the Esslingen region became part of the Roman Empire. During this period a Roman warehouse was located in the area of Oberesslingen. The nearest major Roman settlements and garrisons were at Cannstatt and Köngen.

=== Migration and Merovingian period ===
There are so far no findings from the early Alemanni period, which do exist on the Filder (uplands) nearby. There are findings in Rüdern which suggest a rich grave with eastern influence, including, for example, a set of three-winged spear heads. The ending &quot;-ingen&quot; indicates a group of people wherein a man named Azzilo, Hezzilo or Hetsilo was landlord and family patriarch played an influential role. This means the city&#x27;s name originally meant: &quot;the peoples of Azzilo&quot;. This name, for the first time documented in 856 as &quot;Ezlinga&quot; and 866 as &quot;Hetsilinga&quot; ended up becoming today&#x27;s Esslingen.

In the 6th century, the Alemanni were subjugated by the Merovingians under king Clovis I. But they still took over administrative tasks and formed a Duchy in Francia. In the 8th century they tried to become sovereign again. But the attempt failed near Cannstatt. The end of the Alemannian duchy was marked with the &quot;Council of Cannstatt&quot;.

In an excavation by Günter Fehring, the remains of the Vitalis-Cella under the church St. Dionysius were uncovered. Proof of settlement dates back to the late Merovingian period. Even older are the single row graves in Oberesslingen and Sirnau.

=== Middle Ages ===
Esslingen was first mentioned in 777 in the last will of Abbot Fulrad from Saint-Denis (near Paris), the chaplain of Pippin and Charlemagne. He bequeathed the &quot;sixth cell upon the river Neckar&quot; that he had received from an Alemannic nobleman by the name of &quot;Hafti&quot; to his monastery, Saint-Denis. He also brought the bones of Saint Vitalis to Esslingen, which made it a destination for pilgrims and led to its growth.

Around 800 Esslingen became a market town, its market rights being certified in 866. In 949–953 it was a possession of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia. Esslingen received city rights in 1229 under Emperor Frederick II. During the same period the still-extant Neckar bridge was built, making Esslingen a major center for trade on the route between Italy, Switzerland, and northern Germany. Taxes provided by the bridge and market led to further growth of the town, as did the export of the highly regarded wines from the region.

The period between the 13th century and 16th century saw many conflicts between the Free Imperial City and the Counts of Württemberg (later Duchy of Württemberg). About half the population died in the Thirty Years&#x27; War between 1618 and 1648 through famine or epidemics. Esslingen lost its independence as an Imperial city during the Napoleonic era in 1802–1803, becoming part of the Duchy of Württemberg.

The city had a defensive wall, part of which remains, including a landmark &quot;fat tower&quot; (Der Dicke Turm) set on the hill and vineyards above the city.

===19th century to Present===
The beginning of the 19th century was characterized by industrialization. Glove manufacturing, food processing, textiles, and metal working were early industries in Esslingen. On 20 November 1845 the first train ran from Cannstatt to Esslingen station.

Esslingen was occupied by U.S. troops starting in April 1945, at the very end of World War II. During the war the city suffered very little damage, and it was peaceably surrendered to the approaching allied forces, thus the medieval character of its city center has been mostly preserved.

After the Second World War about 47,000 people moved to Esslingen, mostly refugees and displaced persons from East Germany. Housing developments in Oberesslingen and Zollberg were created to overcome the shortage of housing.

In 1973 Nürtingen district was merged with Esslingen am Neckar, making Esslingen the seat of a much enlarged district.

==Transport==

===Air transport===
Stuttgart Airport, the largest airport in Baden-Württemberg, is located in the Esslingen District, roughly ten kilometers south of the town, on the border with the town of Leinfelden-Echterdingen. A plane owned by Lufthansa has been named after the town.
The junction on the Bundesautobahn 8 Karlsruhe-Munich which serves Esslingen is just after the airport when traveling towards Munich.

===Road Transport===
Esslingen is directly on the B10 State Highway which runs as a dual carriageway from Stuttgart to Süßen, and continues onward to Ulm. The exit for Esslingen, just after the B10 passes under the ancient Pliensau Bridge, is particularly unusual, because in the direction of Ulm there are two entry and exit points to the dual carriageway. This makes it is possible to reach the center of Esslingen directly from Stuttgart, and to drive from central Esslingen directly onto the Dual Carriageway in the direction of Ulm without having to pass traffic lights.
Despite the six to eight lanes on the new Pliensau Bridge and the surrounding roads, the infrastructure around Pliensauvorstadt and the route to Zollberg still suffers from frequent congestion.

Esslingen is also on the German Timber-Frame Road.

===Long Distance Rail Transport===
Esslingen (Neckar) station is on the Fils Valley Railway and is served by line S 1 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn and regional services. The town is on the main rail line between Stuttgart and Ulm, operated by Deutsche Bahn, the main German rail operator. In 2009, the company named a high speed &#x27;Intercity-Express&#x27; train &quot;Esslingen-am-Neckar&quot;.

===S-Bahn===
The Stuttgart S-Bahn line S1 which operates between Kirchheim-unter-Teck and Herrenberg via Stuttgart centre, serves the stations of Mettingen, Esslingen (Neckar), Oberesslingen and Esslingen (Zell). Under the planned rebuilding of the railways in central Stuttgart under the Stuttgart 21 scheme, the S1 will be shortened to operate from Kirchheim unter Teck as far as Stuttgart Schwabstraße station.

===Direct bus connection to Stuttgart Airport===
To avoid the long S-Bahn route to the airport via Stuttgart, the Bus 122, operated by the END Company, now runs directly from the central bus and rail interchange to the airport via Ostfildern Scharnhausen.

===Urban Tramway===

The Esslingen Urban Tram system was opened in May 1912 and closed on 7 July 1944 after 32 years of operation. It was replaced by trolley buses. The operating company, the Esslinger Städtische Straßenbahn (ESS, translated Esslingen Town Tramway) changed its name in 1944 to the Städtischer Verkehrsbetrieb Esslingen (SVE, or &quot;Esslingen Transport Company&quot;).

===Former Interurban Tram===

On 18 December 1926 the Esslingen-Nellingen-Denkendorf (END) interurban tram began operating. This was the last tram system to be built in Germany before the wave of closures later in the century: after this date permission from the authorities was only given for extensions to existing systems. The tram had to negotiate a five kilometer gradient out of the Neckar Valley to reach the towns and villages of the Eastern Filder region. In total, the system transported 153 million passengers from Denkendorf and later from Neuhausen to Esslingen, and took delivery of two new open trams in 1958. The line was discontinued in February 1978.

===Trolley bus and diesel bus===
Esslingen, along with Solingen and Eberswalde, is one of the last three German towns which still use trolleybuses. The SVE currently operates two lines using electric power:
101: Oberesslingen Lerchenacker Endstation – Esslingen railway station – Stuttgart-Obertürkheim station.
118: Esslingen Railway Station – Zollberg.
Apart from this around 50 taxis operate in the town.

===Car-Sharing===
In 1994 A car-sharing company opened a station in Esslingen.

===Rebuilding of bus/rail interchange===
An ambitious redevelopment project has been in progress since 2004 in the area near the railway station. The current phase of this project is a large redevelopment of the station forecourt costing about 7.4 million euros. The Baden-Württemberg State Environment and Transport ministry helped fund this with a grant of 4.9 million euros. During 2009 the Neckarstraße was diverted along unused land on the railway station and lengthened to the west of the site. The next phase, completed in November 2014, was a large-scale redevelopment of the station forecourt to create a bus and rail interchange.

==Hochschule Esslingen==
The city is home to the Esslingen University of Applied Sciences (). It is known for its mechanical engineering and automotive engineering courses, and also for its three international master&#x27;s programs (MBA in International Industrial Management, MEng in Automotive Systems, MEng in Design and Development in Automotive and Mechanical Engineering), which are organised by the Esslingen Graduate School and taught completely in English.

<doc id="185643" wikidata="Q5094295" url="?curid=185643" title="Chevaline">
<text>Chevaline () was a system to improve the penetrability of the warheads used by the British Polaris nuclear weapons system. Devised as an answer to the improved Soviet anti-ballistic missile defences around Moscow, the system increased the probability that at least one warhead would penetrate Moscow&#x27;s anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defences, something which the Royal Navy&#x27;s earlier UGM-27 Polaris re-entry vehicles (RVs) were thought to be unlikely to do.
Chevaline used a variety of penetration aids and decoys to offer so many indistinguishable targets that an opposing ABM system would be overwhelmed attempting to deal with them all, ensuring that enough warheads would get through an ABM defence to be a reasonable deterrent to a first strike. The project was highly secret, and survived in secrecy through four different governments before being revealed in 1980.

The system was in service from 1982 to 1996, when the Polaris A3T missiles it was fitted to were replaced with the Trident D5.

==Military and political requirements==

The origins of the Chevaline requirement grew from the conclusion of several British governments that in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack on the UK alone, as had been threatened in late 1950s by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Prime Minister Nikolai Bulganin it was unrealistic to expect that the US would retaliate against the Soviet Union and risk an attack on major American cities. That conclusion by successive British governments was the basis of their justification given to the British people for an independent nuclear retaliatory capability.

For some time this deterrent force had been based on the Royal Air Force&#x27;s V bomber force. This looked increasingly vulnerable in the face of ever-increasing Soviet Air Defence Forces, and various reports by the RAF suggested their bombers would be incapable of successfully delivering free-fall (&quot;gravity&quot;) bombs by 1960. This had been considered from the early 1950s and the planned solution was a move to the Blue Streak medium range ballistic missile, but this suffered extensive delays for a variety of reasons.

As it became clear Blue Streak would not be available by 1960, interim solutions were considered. Among many possibilities, the RAF eventually selected the Blue Steel standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still (hopefully) outside the range of the defensive fighters. This system provided marginal capability and a number of projected developments were considered as Blue Steel II, which increased both its range to improve the survivability of the bomber and speed to improve the survivability of the missile.

A better solution came along in the form of the US&#x27;s AGM-48 Skybolt missile. The US bomber force was facing the same sorts of problems as the British V bombers, and were attempting to solve it in a similar fashion, with a long-range standoff missile. In this case the missile had a projected range of just under . The distance from London to Moscow is about , so Skybolt would allow the V-bomber force to attack Russia from sites not far off the British coast, with complete impunity. Skybolt seemed like such a good solution that work on both Blue Steel II and Blue Streak were cancelled.

Skybolt development was cancelled in early 1962 and led to a major political row. Finally a compromise was reached later that year; the Nassau Agreement had the Royal Navy taking over the deterrent role with newly acquired Polaris missiles. This arrangement was formally outlined in the Polaris Sales Agreement.

One key part of the agreement was that the UK would develop their own warheads for the missiles, as the UK military and political establishments were rather worried about losing their own nuclear production and design capability. Having already put some effort into the Skybolt warhead, it was decided to adapt this design, based on the thermonuclear secondary of the US W59, matched to a primary trigger based on a wholly UK design developed from the Cleo device tested at the Pampas instead of the W58 used on US Navy missiles.

==The ABM problem==

Throughout this period both the US and USSR were working on anti-ballistic missile systems. Developing an ABM system was largely an engineering issue, requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour. Given that these items would be expensive, the ABM interceptor itself was likely to cost about the same as an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy&#x27;s stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount. This was a game the US was clearly willing to play, although it would seem the USSR was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries&#x27; respective economies.

The Soviets were confirmed as working on an ABM system in 1961 when they made their first successful exo-atmospheric interception of an ICBM. An American response was to develop &quot;Antelope&quot;, a system designed to overwhelm an ABM defence with decoys, or &quot;penaids&quot; (penetration aids). In the end the US abandoned Antelope because they could achieve the same ends simply by throwing additional warheads, which was becoming increasingly inexpensive with the introduction of MIRVs. With MIRV, a single missile could launch multiple warheads that separated in space, forcing the defender to use multiple ABMs to attack them. A single new ballistic missile would demand multiple ABMs to counter it, this cost-exchange ratio ultimately convincing the US that ABMs were infeasible.

This development left the British in a particularly bad position. Although the Polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines, this meant little if the warheads could not make it through the Soviet defences – especially if the Soviets were convinced of this. Although Polaris did have multiple warheads, they were not MIRV - all three were released on the same trajectory and remained fairly close together during atmospheric entry. This meant that all three could be attacked by a single ABM with a large warhead. A single with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads, making it conceivable that many of them might be destroyed by even a small number of ABMs. This meant the fleet could no longer guarantee the success of the deterrent&#x27;s objective – to threaten Soviet state power.

Something had to be done in order to maintain the relevance of the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent. Although developments in the ABM field had been watched throughout the 1960s, exactly what to do about the problem apparently remained a fairly low priority. In 1967 the US offered a newer version of the Polaris, the A3T design, which featured a &quot;hardened&quot; missile airframe intended to better protect it against ABMs. As the UK had not yet received their missiles, they agreed to use the A3T version as it required relatively few other changes.

=== KH.793===

In 1970 serious efforts to explore the ABM problem started. By this point the US and USSR had agreed in the ABM Treaty to deploy up to 100 ABMs at only two sites. MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM that both parties agreed to limit ABM deployment largely as a way of avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only good news for the UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks had to be able to credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defence around Moscow. Thus started project KH.793, a one-year project to identify potential solutions.

One option would be to build additional Polaris platforms and keep more of them at sea. Two &quot;Resolution&quot;s would throw 96 warheads and almost guarantee penetration, while three would make it a certainty. This would require a fleet of at least five submarines to keep two on station at all times, as well as larger crew complements, training and logistics support, and appeared to be the most expensive option.

Several &quot;low cost&quot; options were also explored. Among these were &quot;Topsy&quot;, the A3T missile the UK had already agreed to use. Another option was Antelope, which used hardened warheads along with penaids, although it reduced the payload to two warheads in order to save weight for the penaids. They also explored a &quot;superhardened&quot; version known as Super Antelope, a further improvement on the warhead that also used a manoeuvrable warhead &quot;bus&quot; to deploy the penaids further apart in space.

The Royal Navy preferred to upgrade to the Poseidon missile, increasing the number of warheads from three per missile to between ten and thirteen of a newer and lighter design. In this case a single &quot;Resolution&quot; could launch up to 208 warheads, guaranteeing that some would get through. This option also had the advantage of maintaining commonality with the US Navy, as well as offering greater range, and thus increasing the safety of the launch submarines.

The US also favoured the Poseidon, although for more technical reasons. They felt that while the decoy approach was useful against near-term ABMs deployed by the USSR, that it was considerably less useful against &quot;point defence&quot; type interceptors. This is because the decoys are so much lighter than warheads; when they started to hit the upper atmosphere the decoys would slow more than the warheads and thus &quot;declutter&quot;, allowing the warheads to be attacked. This would require a much faster-reacting radar and computer system than an ABM using a long-range interceptor, one that could safely wait until only a few moments before detonation, but this was by no means impossible and was part of the US&#x27;s own ABM systems.

As the UK had decided to produce its own warheads and bus, this option would require considerable development effort in order to produce a new MIRV bus of their own. Although in theory the UK might be able to use the US-designed bus, these options were being explored in the midst of the ABM Treaty, and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred. Some related options were explored, including &quot;Option M&quot; which used a simple &quot;de-MIRVed&quot; bus, &quot;Hybrid&quot; (or &quot;Stag&quot;) which put the newer Poseidon warheads on the existing Polaris A3T missiles, and &quot;Mini Poseidon&quot;, a similar adaptation with a smaller six-Poseidon-warhead payload on the A3T.

In the end the higher levels of the British political system decided against the urgings of their own Chiefs of Staff and went with the penaid approach on the existing A3T missile. This decision was made official late in 1973 by the Edward Heath administration, which changed the name from Super Antelope to Chevaline. The name &#x27;Chevaline&#x27; was the result of a telephone call to London Zoo from an official at the Ministry of Defence. Prompted by a request for a name-change from his boss, the Secretary of State for Defence, Lord Carrington, the official asked the zoo to &#x27;imagine an animal like a large antelope&#x27; and inquired whether there was such a beast. The zoo told him there was a South African creature called a Chevaline, and the official &#x27;thought that sounded rather good&#x27;. (The creature to which the zoo was probably referring was the Roan Antelope, &quot;Hippotragus equinus&quot; which is known in French as &#x27;Antilope chevaline&#x27;.)

Initially it was planned to make the project public, but a change of government in the 1974 elections ended these plans. A new review again concluded that the project should continue, even though the naval staff continued to be opposed. Full development started in January 1975.

==Development==
The project was carried out in extreme secrecy by a team consisting of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, and Hunting Engineering at Ampthill, Sperry Gyroscope at Bracknell, Lockheed Aerospace in the United States, and others, both in the US and the UK. The system was tested at the US Eastern Test Range, Cape Canaveral, and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests (Fallon in 1974 and Banon in 1976) at the Nevada Test Site. There were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the RV/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the Galosh warhead; and there were numerous missile tests at the Woomera Missile Range, Australia, to develop various aspects of the RVs, the PAC and decoys. Recent declassifications of official files show that more than half the total project costs were spent in the United States, with industry and government agencies.

Range of the &quot;Improved&quot; Chevaline system was 22% less than the &quot;Unimproved&quot; Polaris A3T, reduced from to . This was the source of continuing pressure on the development team from the Naval Staff, who had set the minimum requirement at , and who were deeply concerned at intelligence reports of improving Soviet anti-submarine warfare capabilities. Reduced missile range had the effect of reducing the sea-room in which the British submarines could hide. With Chevaline, the patrol area was limited to the north of and just around the GIUK gap, whereas previously they could operate within an area to the south of the Gap as well. This was a serious problem, because much of NATOs anti-submarine strategy was based on closing the Gap, with the implicit assumption that areas north of it would be fairly easy for Soviet submarines to operate within. If the Polaris fleet was forced to operate to the north of the line, or even within a limited distance of it, they would be lacking the protection of the bulk of the NATO forces, and potentially in the midst of a high concentration of enemy hunter-killer subs.

Efforts were made to reduce warhead weight by substituting a new, smaller, high-yielding thermonuclear primary tested at Fondutta and Quargel, and although these tests were deemed successful, the delays involved in preparing them for Chevaline were thought to risk further unacceptable delays to the in-service date planned, and they were not used. This thermonuclear primary was by then being referred to in official documents as a &quot;trigger device&quot; and some suspect that this new description was a sleight-of-hand to circumvent the pledge given by Prime Minister Wilson of &quot;no new generation of nuclear weapons&quot;. The thermonuclear (or fusion) secondary for Chevaline and known to AWRE by the codename Reggie, is known from these declassified documents to be recycled from the &quot;Unimproved&quot; Polaris A3T warhead.

==Further political developments==
The Chevaline project was kept secret by successive UK governments, both Labour and Conservative. This secrecy was maintained under Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson&#x27;s second term and James Callaghan. The project was finally revealed by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s then defence minister Francis Pym.

The reasons for revelation were both political and practical. The cost over-runs of the project were now so enormous (approximately £1 billion by 1979) that the secret inner-Cabinet spending approvals could not continue. The key decision to proceed had been taken in 1975, four years previously, and cancellation would be unlikely to save money at that point. Even if it were to be cancelled, a replacement would have to be ordered in any case. Shortly afterwards the Thatcher government decided that the successor system should be the Trident system and ordered the C4 variant.

The Naval Staff angst that had been a feature of the Chevaline project surfaced here too. For several reasons the Navy had not wanted Chevaline and had actively lobbied against it. Their preference for Poseidon was in large part based on commonality of equipment. Polaris was being phased out of use by the US Navy and supplies of spares and repair facilities were becoming unavailable. To keep the Polaris missile in use in the UK meant that some production lines had to be re-opened at great cost to supply a very small force. A missile common to both navies was desirable, and the Naval Staff strongly argued against Chevaline. At one point, several of their counterparts in the US Navy had encouraged them to seek congressional approval for such a proposal through a formal request from the Ministry of Defence. Although the papers will not be declassified for some time yet, it seems likely that the Naval Staff made the same case with Trident with some success when their influence was at its height after the Falklands War.

The US later decided to move primary development from the C4 to the larger Trident D5, a much more capable missile, but one that would not fit into the latest s, let alone the older . Their solution to this problem was to change the design of the &quot;Ohio&quot; class to allow for the larger D5. Thatcher, who was fully committed to Trident, decided to follow the same route and authorized the design of the to carry them. They agreed to a deal whereby the US and British combined missile stock is serviced at a single location at the US Navy facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, and from there missiles are issued to both US and British submarines. Only the warheads (added later to British missiles) are different.

Finally, recently published recollections from senior members of the development team are explicit in stating that Chevaline was not the best, or with hindsight, the cheapest choice the British could have made from the many options available. But the choices were never simple but overlaid with what was politically possible, what was in the best interests of UK industry and its scientific base. In the end, the alternatives were &quot;between Chevaline or nothing at all; a decision which could easily have meant withdrawal of the UK from the military political nuclear scene&quot; and that option was unthinkable to the military staffs and government alike.

==Description==
The response to the threat of interception by ABM-1 Galosh missiles was to deploy an upgraded or Improved Front End (IFE) to Polaris A3T using the Antelope/Super Antelope/Chevaline technology. The Chevaline solution was to decrease the number of warheads carried by the Polaris system from three to two, using the space and weight to carry numerous decoys, and increase the likelihood of warhead survival by substituting a new super-hardened thermonuclear primary for the warhead contained in a new super-hardened RV.

The IFE was built in two primary parts. One warhead was mounted directly to the front of the second stage, as had been the case for all three warheads in the original Polaris. The second part was the &quot;penetration aid carrier&quot;, or PAC, which carried the second warhead along with the various penetration aids. The PAC dispensed one RV but the principal purpose of its manoeuvring capability was to dispense the 27 decoys into a &#x27;threat tube&#x27; surrounding the RVs, which also had a &#x27;disguise&#x27; to match their radar appearance to the decoys. The system was not a MIRVing system because the target of both warheads was one location, about which the two warheads were spread, as in the earlier MRV system of Polaris A3T.

In the case of an attack on the USSR, even a single &quot;Resolution&quot; could have ensured the destruction of a significant portion of the Soviet command and control structure. Given all sixteen missiles launching successfully, an ABM system would be presented with 551 credible-looking targets to deal with. Given that the ABM treaty limited the USSR to 100 ABM interceptors, a &quot;hit&quot; was virtually guaranteed.

The &#x27;unimproved&#x27; British Polaris A3T carried three 200 kt warheads designated ET.317 in U.S. Mk-2 RVs, composed of a primary known as Jennie and a thermonuclear secondary known as Reggie. The integrated upgraded Polaris system was known as A3TK and carried two warheads in upgraded British-designed RVs. These warheads used the new Harriet primary with Reggie re-used from the ET.317 warhead, and their nuclear yield increased to 225 kt. This system was in service from 1982 to 1996, when it was replaced by Trident D5.

== Re-entry Body (ReB) ==

===Construction===
Whilst the fully assembled Chevaline ReB and a new warhead was of identical external shape, and balance to US Polaris RVs to minimise development costs and avoid the need for full-scale flight testing, the Chevaline ReB was unusual in using a new material known as 3-Dimensional Quartz Phenolic (3DQP), which was developed in the UK and subsequently used on US warheads. 3DQP is a phenolic-based material composed of a quartz cloth material woven into a seamless sock shape cloth impregnated with a phenolic resin and hot-pressed. The quartz material &#x27;hardens&#x27; the ReB protecting the nuclear warhead against high-energy neutrons emitted by exo-atmospheric anti-ballistic missile (ABM) bursts before re-entry. When cured, 3DQP can be machined in the same way as metals and is tough and fire-resistant.

===Manufacture===
A licence to manufacture 3DQP in the US was acquired and production was undertaken by AVCO, one of the two suppliers of US RVs, the other being General Electric. The first production examples of the Chevaline ReB were manufactured by AVCO, now part of Textron before production began in the UK at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Burghfield, now incorporated into the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, using quartz thread material obtained from France. 

Components for the Chevaline system were manufactured at the Royal Ordnance Factory (Cardiff), which in turn was renamed (along with ROF Burghfield) AWE Cardiff in 1987. The Beryllium facility (Project B) at Cardiff, as well as the other workshops at the site, manufactured high precision components relating to the PAC and the decoys for Chevaline, as well as in later years pre-production components and gauges for Trident, before being decommissioned and closed in the mid ‘90s when full production moved to Burghfield. 

Later, the supply of test samples of 3DQP to France without UK permission caused friction between the British Government and AVCO, and action in the US courts by the British government.

<text>Arnsberg (; ) is a town in the Hochsauerland county, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is the location of the Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg administration and one of the three local administration offices of the Hochsauerlandkreis district.

==Geography==

===Location===
Arnsberg is located in the north-east of the Sauerland in the Ruhr river valley. The river Ruhr meanders around the south of the old town of Arnsberg. The town is nearly completely encircled by forest, and the nature park &quot;Arnsberger Wald&quot; lies to the north&quot;.

Arnsberg is connected by Federal Motorway 46 (Autobahn 46) Brilon in the east and (using the Federal Motorway 445) Werl in the west. It is also connected by several railroad stations, which provide a connection to the major city Dortmund and the Ruhrgebiet. There is also a regional airport, located in the city district of Vosswinkel, which is exclusively used for small private aircraft.

The municipal territory spans a distance of up to from the southern to the northern limits.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
* Ense
* Möhnesee
* Warstein
* Meschede
* Sundern
* Balve
* Menden

===Subdivisions===
After the local government reforms of 1975 Arnsberg consists of 15 boroughs (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;):

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
Arnsberg was first mentioned in 789 in the Carolingian records (Urbar) as belonging to the abbey of Werden.

Arnsberg was the seat of the Counts of Arnsberg from around 1070 and received city rights in 1238. In 1368 the last of the Counts of Arnsberg, Count Gottfried IV, handed over the city and county to Kurköln as he had no heir.

They built a castle there whose remains can still be visited and are occasionally used for public celebrations.

In the 12th century, old Arnsberg became the seat of Westphalian jurisdiction (whose coat of arms is still used today by the Hochsauerlandkreis). Later, the city lost its independence and was subject to the Archbishops of Cologne.

=== 18th/19th Century ===
Arnsberg Castle was reconstructed by Johann Conrad Schlaun as a residential palace and hunting lodge for Elector Clemens August of Bavaria. It was destroyed in the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1769.

In 1794 the French attacked Cologne, so parts of the treasure of the Cologne Cathedral were brought to safety in Arnsberg, along with the relics of the Biblical Magi. In 1804, the treasure was returned to Cologne, as commemorated by a plaque in the Propsteikirche.

In 1816, Arnsberg came under Prussian rule and was made a local administrative centre.

=== World War Two ===
Neheim and Hüsten were merged in 1941.

During the Second World War, Arnsberg first suffered widespread destruction and catastrophic loss of lives when RAF Lancasters breached the dam of the Möhne Reservoir in the night of the 16 to 17 May 1943 (Operation Chastise). The nearby Abbey Himmelpforten was completely washed away.

Later, dozens of Arnsberg&#x27;s citizens were killed in several British air raids aimed at destroying the railway viaduct. The targets were finally destroyed on 19 March 1945 using a &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; bomb.

=== Contemporary history ===
The current city of Arnsberg was created in 1975 by merging 12 surrounding municipalities (Bachum, Breitenbruch, Herdringen, Holzen, Müschede, Niedereimer, Oeventrop, Rumbeck, Uentrop, Voßwinkel and Wennigloh) into one city.

Old Arnsberg itself and Neheim-Hüsten are the two main urban areas, while the other parts are mainly rural areas.

==Demographics==
===Religion===
Arnsberg&#x27;s population is mostly Roman Catholic. Arnsberg belongs to the Archdiocese of Paderborn. Catholic churches include the &quot;Propsteikirche&quot; or the &quot;Heilig-Kreuz Kirche&quot; and the &quot;Auferstehungskirche&quot;, which is a Protestant church. There is also a New Apostolic congregation.

In recent years Arnsberg&#x27;s Muslim minority grew considerably. The town has a mosque.

The cemeteries are mostly Catholic but there is also a Jewish cemetery.

==Arts and culture==
The Kunstverein Arnsberg operates in Arnsberg. Founded in 1987 and devoted to contemporary art, Kunstverein Arnsberg has presented solo exhibitions by artists including Georg Baselitz, Thomas Ruff, Karin Sander, Dan Perjovschi, Boris Mikhailov, Gregor Schneider, Erwin Wurm, the Turner Prize winner Susan Philipsz and the Marcel Duchamp Prize winner Laurent Grasso.

==Government==
===City arms===
The arms of the city depict a white eagle on a blue field. Earlier it was a white eagle on a red field, introduced in 1278 and as used by the counts of Arnsberg . In the 17th century the red was changed to blue, reflecting the Bavarian blue of the House of Wittelsbach.

<text>Motion control photography is a technique used in still and motion photography that enables precise control of, and optionally also allows repetition of, camera movements. It can be used to facilitate special effects photography. The process can involve filming several elements using the same camera motion, and then compositing the elements into a single image. Other effects are often used along with motion control, such as chroma key to aid the compositing. Motion control camera rigs are also used in still photography with or without compositing; for example in long exposures of moving vehicles. Today&#x27;s computer technology allows the programmed camera movement to be processed, such as having the move scaled up or down for different sized elements. Common applications of this process include shooting with miniatures, either to composite several miniatures or to composite miniatures with full-scale elements.

The process is also commonly used when duplication of an element which cannot be physically duplicated is required; motion control is the primary method of featuring multiple instances of the same actor in a shot that involves camera movement. For this technique, the camera typically films exactly the same motion in exactly the same location while the actor performs different parts. A blank take (with no actor in the shot) is sometimes also taken to give compositors a reference of what parts of the shot are different in each take. This, in common film-making language, is also known as shooting a &quot;plate&quot;.
In today&#x27;s film, the reference take is also useful for digital manipulation of the shots, or for adding digital elements. A simple duplication shot confines each &quot;copy&quot; of an element to one part of the screen. It is far more difficult to composite the shots when the duplicate elements cross paths, though digital technology has made this easier to achieve. Several basic camera tricks are sometimes utilized with this technique, such as having the hand of a body double enter a shot to interact with the actor while the duplicate&#x27;s arm is to be off-screen. For the sake of compositing, the background elements of the scene must remain identical between takes, requiring anything movable to be locked down; the blank reference take can aid in resolving any discrepancies between the other shots.

Similar technology in modern film allows for a camera to record its exact motion during a shot so that the motion can be duplicated by a computer in the creation of computer generated elements for the same shot.

==History==
Modelmaking for scenery has long been used in the film industry, but when a model is too small it often loses its illusion and becomes &quot;obviously a model&quot;. Solving this by building a larger model introduces a dilemma: larger models are more difficult to build and often too fragile to move smoothly. The solution is to move the camera, rather than the model, and the advent of compact lightweight 35mm cameras has made machine-controlled motion control feasible. Motion-control also requires control over other photographic elements, such as frame rates, focus, and shutter speeds. By changing the frame rates and the depth of field, models can seem to be much larger than they actually are, and the speed of the camera motion can be increased or decreased accordingly.

Early attempts at motion control came about when John Whitney pioneered several motion techniques using old anti-aircraft analog computers (Kerrison Predictor) connected to servos to control the motion of lights and lit targets. His film &quot;Catalog&quot; (1961) and his brother James Whitney&#x27;s film &quot;Lapis&quot; (1966) were both achieved with John&#x27;s pioneering motion control system. The 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; pioneered motion control in two respects. The film&#x27;s model photography was conducted with large mechanical rigs that enabled precise and repeatable camera and model motion. The film&#x27;s finale was created with mechanically controlled slit-scan photography, which required precise camera motion control during the exposure of single frames. 

The first large-scale application of motion control was in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), where a digitally controlled camera known as the Dykstraflex performed complex and repeatable motions around stationary spaceship models. This enabled a greater complexity in the spaceship-battle sequences, as separately filmed elements (spaceships, backgrounds, etc.) could be better coordinated with one another with greatly reduced error. The development of the Dykstraflex was led by John Dykstra, who had numerous contributors, including Alvah J. Miller and Jerry Jeffress. In 1978, Dykstra, Miller, and Jeffress won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.

In the UK The Moving Picture Company had the first practical motion control rig. Designed and built in-house in 1981, it used the IMC operating system to control its various axes of movement. Peter Truckel, MPC&#x27;s first in-house VFX supervisor, operated it for several years before leaving to pursue a career as a successful commercials director.

The simultaneous increase in power and affordability of computer-generated imagery in the 21st century, and the ability for Computer-generated imagery (CGI) specialists to duplicate even hand-held camera motion (see Match moving), initially made the use of motion control photography less common. However film producers and directors have come to realise the cost-saving benefit of using motion control to achieve the effects in a reliable and realistic way. CGI still struggles to be 100% photorealistic, and the time and cost to achieve photo-realistic shots far exceeds the cost of shooting the live action itself.

With the resurgence of 3D as a medium motion control has also an important role to play, especially in the production of 3D background plates on scaled-sets. Using high resolution still cameras, backgrounds can be easily shot for further use with live action and CGI character animation.

<doc id="185651" wikidata="Q7269653" url="?curid=185651" title="Qubilah Shabazz">
<text>Qubilah Bahiyah Shabazz (born December 25, 1960) is the second daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz. In 1965, she witnessed the assassination of her father by three gunmen. She was arrested in 1995 in connection with an alleged plot to kill Louis Farrakhan, by then the leader of the Nation of Islam who she believed was responsible for the assassination of her father. She has maintained her innocence. She accepted a plea agreement under which she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for her substance use disorders to avoid a prison sentence.

==Early years==
Shabazz was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1960. Her father named her after Kublai Khan. Photographer and film-maker Gordon Parks was her godfather.

In February 1965, when Qubilah was four years old, she roused her parents in the middle of the night with her screams: the family&#x27;s house had been set on fire. One week later, together with her mother and sisters, she witnessed the assassination of her father.

As a youth, Qubilah Shabazz attended a Quaker-run summer camp called &quot;Farm and Wilderness&quot; in Vermont. At age 11, she became a Quaker, converting from Islam. With her sisters, she joined Jack and Jill, a social club for the children of well-off African Americans. As a teenager, Shabazz attended the United Nations International School in Manhattan.

After high school, she enrolled at Princeton University but was uncomfortable there, feeling that the white students were shunning her and that the African-American students resented her apparent lack of interest in their efforts to force the university to divest its investments in South Africa. She left Princeton after two semesters and moved to Paris, where she studied at the Sorbonne and worked as a translator. In Paris, she met an Algerian man with whom she had a child, Malcolm, in 1984. Their relationship subsequently ended.

When Malcolm was a few months old, Qubilah Shabazz moved with him to Los Angeles. In 1986, they went to New York City, where they lived in a series of apartments in bad neighborhoods. Shabazz drifted from city to city and job to job, supporting herself by waiting tables, selling advertising for a directory, telemarketing, and proof-reading texts at a law firm. She began to drink heavily, and her mother and sisters often cared for Malcolm while Shabazz lived with various friends.

==Attempted murder of Louis Farrakhan==
For many years, Shabazz&#x27;s mother, Betty, harbored resentment toward the Nation of Islam—and Louis Farrakhan in particular—for what she felt was their role in the assassination of her husband. In a 1994 interview, her mother was asked whether Farrakhan &quot;had anything to do&quot; with Malcolm X&#x27;s death. She replied: &quot;Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was a badge of honor. Everybody talked about it, yes.&quot;

Shabazz began to obsess about Farrakhan. Like her mother, she believed he was responsible for killing her father. Now, she feared, he would kill her mother. In May 1994, she contacted Michael Fitzpatrick, a friend from high school, and asked if he would kill Farrakhan for her. She later told the FBI that she chose Fitzpatrick because &quot;I knew he was capable of doing it&quot;. However, Fitzpatrick became an FBI informant. He sometimes acted on their behalf as an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;. He had been arrested for drug possession shortly before Shabazz called him. He reported their conversation to the FBI. Fitzpatrick and Shabazz spoke frequently during June and July. She believed he was romantically interested in her. She told her neighbors that he had proposed marriage. Fitzpatrick encouraged her, allowing Malcolm to call him &quot;my dad&quot;. In September, Qubilah and her son moved to Minneapolis, where Fitzpatrick lived. Fitzpatrick asked for money and she gave him $250. When Shabazz tried to contact him, however, his roommates told her they had evicted him. When they finally spoke, she said she was &quot;leery&quot; and that she was &quot;afraid to have any involvement&quot;. She asked Fitzpatrick if he was a government informant, which he denied.

In January 1995, Shabazz was indicted on charges of using telephones and crossing state lines in the plot to kill Farrakhan. If convicted, she faced a possible sentence of 90 years in prison and fines in excess of $2 million. Farrakhan surprised Betty Shabazz when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted.

Shabazz accepted a plea agreement with respect to the charges on May 1. Under the terms of the plea, she was required to undergo psychological counseling and treatment for her substance use disorders, to attend school or become employed, and to avoid further legal trouble for two years. Provided that Shabazz satisfied these conditions, the indictment against her would be dropped.

Later that month, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah Shabazz&#x27;s legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Betty Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening.

==Death of Betty Shabazz and Malcolm Shabazz==
Shabazz moved to San Antonio to undergo treatment. She worked at a radio station owned by Percy Sutton, a family friend. She married in December 1996, but the marriage was over by the end of the following month.

For the duration of Shabazz&#x27;s treatment, her son Malcolm, then ten years old, was sent to live with her mother Betty in Yonkers, New York. Two years later, on June 1, 1997, Malcolm set a fire in his grandmother&#x27;s apartment. Betty Shabazz suffered burns over 80% of her body and died from her injuries three weeks later. Malcolm Shabazz pleaded guilty to the juvenile equivalents of arson and manslaughter and received a sentence of 18 months in juvenile detention.

Then, in 2013, at the age of 28, her son Malcolm died due to injuries sustained in a fight over a bill at a bar in Mexico City.

<text>The Mikoyan MiG-29 (; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a twin-engine fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union. Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1983.

While originally oriented towards combat against any enemy aircraft, many MiG-29s have been furnished as multirole fighters capable of performing a number of different operations, and are commonly outfitted to use a range of air-to-surface armaments and precision munitions. The MiG-29 has been manufactured in several major variants, including the multirole Mikoyan MiG-29M and the navalised Mikoyan MiG-29K; the most advanced member of the family to date is the Mikoyan MiG-35. Later models frequently feature improved engines, glass cockpits with HOTAS-compatible flight controls, modern radar and infrared search and track (IRST) sensors, and considerably increased fuel capacity; some aircraft have also been equipped for aerial refueling.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the militaries of multiple ex-Soviet republics have continued to operate the MiG-29, the largest of them being the Russian Aerospace Forces. The Russian Aerospace Forces wanted to upgrade its existing fleet to the modernised MiG-29SMT configuration, but financial difficulties have limited deliveries. The MiG-29 has also been a popular export aircraft; more than 30 nations either operate or have operated the aircraft. As of 2024 Flight Global estimates that 809 MiG-29s, of all types, are in service with air forces, making it the 5th most common active fighter.

==Development==

===Origins===
In the mid-1960s, the United States Air Force (USAF) encountered difficulties over the skies of Vietnam. Supersonic fighter bombers that had been optimized for low altitude bombing, like the F-105 Thunderchief, were found to be vulnerable to older MiG-17s and more advanced MiGs which were much more maneuverable. In order to regain the limited air superiority enjoyed over Vietnam, the US refocused on air combat using the F-4 Phantom multirole fighter, while the Soviet Union developed the MiG-23 in response. Towards the end of the 1960s, the USAF started the &quot;F-X&quot; program to produce a fighter dedicated to air superiority, which led to the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle being ordered for production in late 1969.

At the height of the Cold War, a Soviet response was necessary to avoid the possibility of the Americans gaining a serious technological advantage over the Soviets, thus the development of a new air superiority fighter became a priority. In 1969, the Soviet General Staff issued a requirement for a &quot;Perspektivnyy Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot; (&quot;PFI&quot;, roughly &quot;Advanced Frontline Fighter&quot;). Specifications were extremely ambitious, calling for long range, good short-field performance (including the ability to use austere runways), excellent agility, Mach 2+ speed, and heavy armament. The Russian aerodynamics institute TsAGI worked in collaboration with the Sukhoi design bureau on the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamics.
By 1971, however, Soviet studies determined the need for different types of fighters. The PFI program was supplemented with the &quot;Perspektivnyy Lyogkiy Frontovoy Istrebitel&quot; (&quot;LPFI&quot;, or &quot;Advanced Lightweight Tactical Fighter&quot;) program; the Soviet fighter force was planned to be approximately 33% PFI and 67% LPFI. PFI and LPFI paralleled the USAF&#x27;s decision that created the &quot;Lightweight Fighter&quot; program and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and Northrop YF-17. The PFI fighter was assigned to Sukhoi, resulting in the Sukhoi Su-27, while the lightweight fighter went to Mikoyan. Detailed design work on the resultant Mikoyan &quot;Product 9&quot;, designated &quot;MiG-29A&quot;, began in 1974, with the first flight taking place on 6 October 1977. The pre-production aircraft was first spotted by United States reconnaissance satellites in November of that year; it was dubbed &quot;Ram-L&quot; because it was observed at the Zhukovsky flight test center near the town of Ramenskoye.

The workload split between TPFI and LPFI became more apparent as the MiG-29 filtered into frontline service with the Soviet Air Forces (Russian: &quot;Voenno-Vozdushnye Sily&quot; [VVS]) in the mid-1980s. While the heavy, long range Su-27 was tasked with the more exotic and dangerous role of deep air-to-air sweeps of NATO high-value assets, the smaller MiG-29 directly replaced the MiG-23 in the frontal aviation role.

===Introduction and improvements===
In the West, the new fighter was given the NATO reporting name &quot;Fulcrum-A&quot; because the pre-production MiG-29A, which should have logically received this designation, remained unknown in the West at that time. The Soviet Union did not assign official names to most of its aircraft, although nicknames were common. Unusually, some Soviet pilots found the MiG-29&#x27;s NATO reporting name, &quot;&quot;, to be a flattering description of the aircraft&#x27;s intended purpose, and it is sometimes unofficially used in Russian service.

The MiG-29 was widely exported in downgraded versions, known as &quot;MiG-29 9-12A&quot; for Warsaw Pact and &quot;MiG-29 9-12B&quot; for non-Warsaw Pact nations, with less capable avionics and no capability for delivering nuclear weapons.

In the 1980s, Mikoyan developed the improved MiG-29S to use longer range R-27E air-to-air missiles. It added a dorsal &#x27;hump&#x27; to the upper fuselage to house a jamming system and some additional fuel capacity. The weapons load was increased to with airframe strengthening. These features were included in new-built fighters and upgrades to older MiG-29s.
Refined versions of the MiG-29 with improved avionics were fielded by the Soviet Union, but Mikoyan&#x27;s multirole variants, including a carrier-based version designated MiG-29K, were never produced in large numbers. Development of the MiG-29K carrier version was suspended for over a decade before being resumed; the type went into service with the Indian Navy&#x27;s INS &quot;Vikramaditya&quot;, and Russian Navy&#x27;s &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; class aircraft carrier. Mikoyan also developed improved versions MiG-29M and MiG-29SMT.

There have been several upgrade programmes conducted for the MiG-29. Common upgrades include the adoption of standard-compatible avionics, service life extensions to 4,000 flight hours, safety enhancements, greater combat capabilities and reliability.

===Replacement===
On 11 December 2013, Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin revealed that Russia was planning to build a new fighter to replace the MiG-29. The Sukhoi Su-27 and its derivatives were to be replaced by the Sukhoi Su-57, but a different design was needed to replace the lighter MiGs. A previous attempt to develop a MiG-29 replacement, the MiG 1.44 demonstrator, failed in the 1990s. The concept came up again in 2001 with interest from India, but they later opted for a variant of the Su-57. Air Force commanders have hinted at the possibility of a single-engine airframe that uses the Su-57&#x27;s engine, radar, and weapons primarily for Russian service. This has since been revealed to be the Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate.

==Design==
Sharing its origins in the original PFI requirements issued by TsAGI, the MiG-29 has broad aerodynamic similarities to the Sukhoi Su-27, but with some notable differences. The MiG-29 has a mid-mounted swept wing with blended leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) swept at around 40°; there are swept tailplanes and two vertical fins, mounted on booms outboard of the engines. Automatic slats are mounted on the leading edges of the wings; they are four-segment on early models and five-segment on some later variants. On the trailing edge, there are maneuvering flaps and wingtip ailerons.

The MiG-29 has hydraulic controls and a SAU-451 three-axis autopilot but, unlike the Su-27, no fly-by-wire control system. Nonetheless, it is very agile, with excellent instantaneous and sustained turn performance, high-alpha capability, and a general resistance to spins. The airframe consists primarily of aluminum with some composite materials, and is stressed for up to 9 g (88 m/s²) maneuvers. The controls have &quot;soft&quot; limiters to prevent the pilot from exceeding g and alpha limits, but the limiters can be disabled manually.

===Powerplant and range===


The MiG-29 has two widely spaced Klimov RD-33 turbofan engines, each rated at dry and in afterburner. The space between the engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability. The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have variable ramps to allow high-Mach speeds. Due to their relatively short combustor, the engines produce noticeably heavier smoke than their contemporaries. As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the main air inlet can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage can be used for takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris. Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed. However the latest variant of the family, the MiG-35, eliminated these dorsal louvers, and adopted the mesh screens design in the main intakes, similar to those fitted to the Su-27.

The MiG-29 has a ferry range of without external fuel tanks, and with external tanks. The internal fuel capacity of the original MiG-29 (Fulcrum-A) is distributed between six internal fuel tanks, four in the fuselage and one in each wing. The internal fuel capacity of the MiG-29 (Fulcrum-C) is due to a larger #1 fuselage tank. For longer flights, this can be supplemented by a centreline drop tank on the Fulcrum-A and two underwing drop tanks on later production batches. In addition, newer models have been fitted with port-side inflight refueling probes, allowing much longer flight times by using a probe-and-drogue system.

===Cockpit===

The cockpit features a conventional centre stick and left hand throttle controls. The pilot sits in a Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat.

The cockpit has conventional dials, with a head-up display (HUD) and a Shchel-3UM helmet mounted display, but no HOTAS (&quot;hands-on-throttle-and-stick&quot;) capability. Emphasis seems to have been placed on making the cockpit similar to the earlier MiG-23 and other Soviet aircraft for ease of conversion, rather than on ergonomics. Nonetheless, the MiG-29 does have substantially better visibility than most previous Soviet jet fighters, thanks to a high-mounted bubble canopy. Upgraded models introduce &quot;glass cockpits&quot; with modern liquid-crystal (LCD) multi-function displays (MFDs) and true HOTAS.

===Sensors===
The baseline MiG-29 9.12 has a Phazotron RLPK-29 radar fire control system which includes the N019 &quot;Sapfir 29&quot; look-down/shoot-down coherent pulse-Doppler radar and the Ts100.02-02 digital computer.
The N019 radar was not a new design, but rather a development of the Sapfir-23ML architecture used on the MiG-23ML. During the initial design specification period in the mid-1970s, Phazotron NIIR was tasked with producing a modern radar for the MiG-29. To speed development, Phazotron based its new design on work undertaken by NPO Istok on the experimental &quot;Soyuz&quot; radar program. Accordingly, the N019 was originally intended to have a flat planar array antenna and full digital signal processing, for a detection and tracking range of at least against a fighter-sized target. Prototype testing revealed this could not be attained in the required timeframe and still fit within the MiG-29&#x27;s nose. Rather than design a new radar, Phazotron reverted to a version of the Sapfir-23ML&#x27;s twisted-polarization cassegrain antenna and traditional analog signal processors, coupled with a new NII Argon-designed Ts100 digital computer to save time and cost. This produced a working radar system, but inherited the weak points of the earlier design, plaguing the MiG-29&#x27;s ability to detect and track airborne targets at ranges available with the R-27 and R-77 missiles.
The N019 was further compromised by Phazotron designer Adolf Tolkachev&#x27;s betrayal of the radar to the CIA, for which he was executed in 1986. In response to all of these problems, the Soviets hastily developed a modified N019M &quot;Topaz&quot; radar for the upgraded &quot;MiG-29S&quot; aircraft. However, &quot;VVS&quot; was reportedly still not satisfied with the performance of the system and demanded another upgrade. The latest upgraded aircraft, MiG-29M, offered the N010 &quot;Zhuk-M&quot;, which has a planar array antenna rather than a dish, improving range, and a much superior processing ability, with multiple-target engagement capability and compatibility with the Vympel R-77 (or RVV-AE).

===Armament===
Armament for the MiG-29 includes a single GSh-30-1 cannon in the port wing root. This originally had a 150-round magazine, which was reduced to 100 rounds in later variants, which only allows a few seconds of firing before running out of ammo. Original production MiG-29 aircraft cannot fire the cannon when carrying a centerline fuel tank as it blocks the shell ejection port. This was corrected in the MiG-29S and later versions.

Three pylons are provided under each wing (four in some variants), for a total of six (or eight). The inboard pylons can carry either a fuel tank, one &quot;Vympel&quot; R-27 (AA-10 &quot;Alamo&quot;) medium-range air-to-air missile, or unguided bombs or rockets. Some Soviet aircraft could carry a single nuclear bomb on the port inboard station. The outer pylons usually carry R-73 (AA-11 &quot;Archer&quot;) dogfight air to air missiles, although some users still retain the older R-60 (AA-8 &quot;Aphid&quot;). A single tank can be fitted to the centerline, between the engines.

The US has supplied AGM-88 HARM missiles to Ukraine. It appears that they are fired from MiG-29s. It was only disclosed after Russian forces showed footage of a tail fin from one of these missiles. U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl has said this: &quot;I would just point to two things. One, you know, a lot was made about the MiG-29 issue several months ago, not very much has been noticed about the sheer amount of spare parts and other things that we&#x27;ve done to help them actually put more of their own MiG-29s in the air and keep those that are in the air flying for a longer period of time. And then also, in recent PDA [Presidential Drawdown Authority] packages we&#x27;ve included a number of anti-radiation missiles that can be fired off of Ukrainian aircraft. They can have effects on Russian radars and other things.&quot; Soviet era aircraft don&#x27;t have the computer architecture to accept NATO standard weapons. The interface would be difficult; however with a &quot;crude modification&quot;, such as an e-tablet, it would be possible.

==Operational history==
While the MiG-29&#x27;s true capabilities could only be estimated from the time it first appeared In 1977 until the mid-1980s, a combination of persistent intelligence and increasing access afforded by the Soviet foreign sales effort allowed a true appreciation of its capabilities. Early MiG-29s were very agile aircraft, capable of rivaling the performance of contemporary F-18 and F-16 aircraft. However, their relatively low fuel capacity relegated them to short-range air defense missions. Lacking HOTAS and an inter-aircraft data link, and requiring a very intensive &quot;heads-down&quot; approach to operating cockpit controls, the early MiG-29 denied pilots the kind of situational awareness routinely enjoyed by pilots operating comparable US aircraft. Analysts and Western pilots who flew examples of the MiG-29 thought this likely prevented even very good pilots from harnessing the plane&#x27;s full combat capability. Later MiG-29s were upgraded to improve their capabilities. The Soviet Union exported MiG-29s to several countries. Because 4th-generation fighter aircraft require the pilots to have extensive training, air-defense infrastructure, and constant maintenance and upgrades, MiG-29s have had mixed operational history with different air forces.

===Soviet Union and successor states===
The MiG-29 was first publicly seen in the West when the Soviet Union displayed the aircraft in Finland on 2 July 1986. Two MiG-29s were also displayed at the Farnborough Airshow in Britain in September 1988. The following year, the aircraft conducted flying displays at the 1989 Paris Air Show where it was involved in a non-fatal crash during the first weekend of the show. The Paris Air Show display was only the second display of Soviet fighters at an international air show since the 1930s. Western observers were impressed by its apparent capability and exceptional agility. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, most of the MiG-29s entered service with the newly formed Russian Air Force.

====Russia====

In July 1993, two MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force collided in mid-air and crashed away from the public at the Royal International Air Tattoo. No one on the ground sustained any serious injuries, and the two pilots ejected and landed safely.
The Russian Air Force grounded all its MiG-29s following a crash in Siberia on 17 October 2008. Following a second crash with a MiG-29 in east Siberia in December 2008, Russian officials admitted that most MiG-29 fighters in the Russian Air Force were incapable of performing combat duties due to poor maintenance. The age of the aircraft was also an important factor as about 70% of the MiGs were considered to be too old to take to the skies. The Russian MiG-29s have not received updates since the collapse of the Soviet Union. On 4 February 2009, the Russian Air Force resumed flights with the MiG-29. However, in March 2009, 91 MiG-29s of the Russian Air Force required repair after inspections due to corrosion; approximately 100 MiGs were cleared to continue flying at the time. The Russian Aerospace Forces started an update of its early MiG-29s to the more current MiG-29SMT standard, but financial difficulties prevented delivery of more than three MiG-29 SMT upgrade to the Russian Aerospace Forces. Instead, the 35 MiG-29SMT/UBTs rejected by Algeria were bought by the Russian Aerospace Forces. Russia placed an order for 16 new-build MiG-29SMTs on 15 April 2014, with delivery expected by 2017.

On 4 June 2015, a MiG-29 crashed during training in Astrakhan. A month later, another MiG-29 crashed near the village of Kushchevskaya in the Krasnodar region with the pilot safely ejecting. A series of accidents in the Russian Aerospace Forces that happened in 2015 were caused mostly by overall increase of flights and training.

On 20 April 2008, Georgian officials claimed a Russian MiG-29 shot down a Georgian Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle and provided video footage from the ill-fated drone showing an apparent MiG-29 launching an air-to-air missile at it. Russia denies that the aircraft was theirs and says they did not have any pilots in the air that day. Abkhazia&#x27;s administration claimed its own forces shot down the drone with an L-39 aircraft &quot;because it was violating Abkhaz airspace and breaching ceasefire agreements.&quot; UN investigation concluded that the video was authentic and that the drone was shot down by a Russian MiG-29 or Su-27 using an R-73 heat seeking missile.

On 16 July 2014, a Ukrainian Su-25 was shot down, with Ukrainian officials stating that a Russian MiG-29 shot it down using a R-27T missile. Russia denied these allegations.

During the first half of September 2017, the Russian Aerospace Forces deployed some MiG-29SMT multirole combat aircraft to Khmeimim Airbase, near Latakia, in western Syria, becoming the first time the modernized version of the baseline Fulcrum jet was deployed to take part in the Syrian Air War. The MiG-29SMT were involved in bombing missions and secondary strategic bombers escort duties.

Two Russian MiG-29s operated by Wagner Group crashed near Sirte, Libya on 28 June 2020 and on 7 September 2020.

====Ukraine====

In April 2014, during the Russian invasion of Crimea, 45 Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29s and 4 L-39 combat trainers were reportedly captured by Russian forces at Belbek air base. Most of the planes appeared to be in inoperable condition. In May, Russian troops dismantled them and shipped them back to Ukraine. On 4 August 2014, the Ukrainian government stated that a number of them had been put back into service to fight in the war in the east of the country.

During the initial days of the war in Donbas in April 2014, the Ukrainian Air Force deployed some jet fighters over the Donetsk region to perform combat air patrols and show of force flights. Probably due to the limited number of jet fighters available, a MiG-29 belonging to the Ukrainian Falcons display team was spotted armed with a full air-to-air load and performing a low altitude fly by.

In the evening of 7 August 2014, a Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29MU1, bort number 02 Blue, was shot down by an antiaircraft missile fired by pro-Russian rebels near the town of Yenakievo, and exploded in midair. The pilot ejected safely.

On 17 August 2014, another Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29, bort number 53 White, tasked with air to ground duties against separatists&#x27; positions was shot down by pro-Russian rebels in the Luhansk region. The Ukrainian government confirmed the downing. The pilot ejected safely and was recovered by friendly forces.

As of 2018, the Lviv State Aircraft Repair Plant began domestically upgrading the MiG-29 to have multirole capability, known as the MiG-29MU2. Development was expected to be completed by 2019 and enter production in 2020. The first upgraded MiG-29 was delivered to the Ukrainian Air Force in July 2020. In August 2020, Ukraine began negotiations with Elbit Systems to help modernize the MiG-29 fleet.

On 29 May 2020, Ukrainian MiG-29s took part in the Bomber Task Force in Europe with American B-1B bombers for the first time in the Black Sea region. In September 2020, B-52 bombers from the 5th Bomb Wing conducted vital integration training with Ukrainian MiG-29s and Su-27s inside Ukraine&#x27;s airspace.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Su-27s and MiG-29s were used as air superiority fighters, with ten MiG-29s reported lost on the ground and in the air.
In August 2022, a senior U.S. defense official disclosed that the Ukrainians have integrated the AGM-88 HARM missile onto their &quot;MiG aircraft&quot; with video evidence of AGM-88 missiles fired by upgraded Ukrainian MiG-29s released by the Ukrainian Air Force few days later. For a weapon that relies on digital display to fire, the question of how it has been integrated into the MiG-29&#x27;s analogue displays remains unanswered. The footage shows a commercial GPS having been installed along with a tablet of some kind.

On 13 October 2022, a Ukrainian MiG-29 crashed during a combat mission. Its pilot is claimed to have destroyed a Shahed-136 drone with his cannon, and it is believed the debris from the drone collided with the aircraft and forced the pilot to eject. Ukrainian sources claim that the pilot shot down five drones and two cruise missiles shortly before the crash. The downed MiG-29 was wearing a livery similar to that of the Ukrainian Falcons display team. According to the Ukrainian State Bureau of Investigation: &quot;the jet collided with debris from a destroyed drone, which caused massive damage to it to the point where it crashed near a village in northeast Vinnytsia. The pilot managed to eject and is currently receiving treatment in the hospital.&quot;

On 20 September 2023, a Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 was struck by a ZALA Lancet drone at the Dolgintsevo air base near Kryvyi Rih. A second drone was used as a spotter, recording the first Lancet&#x27;s impact.

===Export===

====India====
India was the first international customer of the MiG-29, outside of the Warsaw Pact. The Indian Air Force (IAF) placed an order for 44 aircraft (40 single-seat MiG-29 9.12Bs and four twin-seat MiG-29UBs) in 1984, and the MiG-29 was officially inducted into the IAF in 1987. In 1989, an additional 26 aircraft were ordered, and 10 more advanced MiG-29 9.13s were bought in 1994. Since then, the aircraft has undergone a series of modifications with the addition of new avionics, subsystems, turbofan engines and radars.

Indian MiG-29s were used extensively during the 1999 Kargil War in Kashmir by the Indian Air Force to provide fighter escort for Mirage 2000s attacking targets with laser-guided bombs.

The MiG-29&#x27;s good operational record prompted India to sign a deal with Russia in 2005 and 2006 to upgrade all of its MiG-29s for US$888 million. Under the deal, the Indian MiGs were modified to be capable of deploying the R-77/RVV-AE (AA-12 &#x27;Adder&#x27;) air-to-air missile. The missiles had been tested in October 1998 and were integrated into the IAF&#x27;s MiG-29s. The IAF has also awarded the MiG Corporation another US$900 million contract to upgrade all of its 69 operational MiG-29s. These upgrades will include a new avionics kit, with the N019 radar being replaced by a Phazotron &quot;Zhuk-M&quot; radar. The aircraft is also being equipped to enhance beyond-visual-range combat ability and for air-to-air refuelling to increase endurance. In 2007, Russia also gave India&#x27;s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) a licence to manufacture 120 RD-33 series 3 turbofan engines for the upgrade. The upgrade will also include a new weapon control system, improved cockpit ergonomics, air-to-air missiles, high-accuracy air-to-ground missiles and guided bombs. The first six MiG-29s will be upgraded in Russia while the remaining 63 MiGs will be upgraded at the HAL facility in India. India also awarded a multi-million-dollar contract to Israel Aircraft Industries to provide avionics and subsystems for the upgrade.
In March 2009, the Indian Air Force expressed concern after 90 MiG-29s were grounded in Russia. After carrying out an extensive inspection, the IAF cleared all MiG-29s in its fleet as safe in March 2009. In a disclosure in Parliament, Defence Minister A. K. Antony said the MiG-29 is structurally flawed in that it has a tendency to develop cracks due to corrosion in the tail fin. Russia has shared this finding with India, which emerged after the crash of a Russian Air Force MiG-29 in December 2008. &quot;A repair scheme and preventive measures are in place and IAF has not encountered major problems concerning the issue&quot;, Antony said. Despite concerns of Russia&#x27;s grounding, India sent the first six of its 78 MiG-29s to Russia for upgrades in 2008. The upgrade program will fit the MiGs with a phased array radar (PESA) and inflight refuelling capability.

In January 2010, India and Russia signed a US$1.2 billion deal under which the Indian Navy would acquire 29 additional MiG-29Ks, bringing the total number of MiG-29Ks on order to 45. The MiG-29K entered service with the Indian Navy on 19 February 2010.
The upgrades to Indian MiG-29s will be to the MiG-29UPG standard. This version is similar to the SMT variant but differs by having a foreign-made avionics suite. The upgrade to latest MiG-29UPG standard is in process, which will include latest avionics, Zhuk-ME Radar, engine, weapon control systems, DRDO/DARE developed D-29 electronic warfare system greatly enhancing multirole capabilities and survivability. The first three aircraft were delivered in December 2012, over two years behind schedule.

In 2020, India planned an order of 21 MiG-29s at an affordable price. These aircraft will be manufactured from airframes built in late 1980s but never assembled. Mikoyan will upgrade these aircraft before delivery to the Indian Air Force. In the process, India becomes the last export customer of the original airframe of MiG-29. Russia has sent a commercial proposal for 21 MiG-29 aircraft to be refurbished for the Indian Air Force.

On 7 August 2024, IAF issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) from its Ministry of Defence to upgrade 24 MiG-29s to integrate HSLD Mk 2 bombs/missiles with a range of 180 km. This upgrade is to include additional hardware such as bomb racks on external hardpoints, and necessary software for the aircraft. The project shall be overseen by No. 11 Base Repair Depot (BRD) of the IAF. Subsequently, the entire MiG-29 fleet will be equipped with this in phases. The IAF has sought MoD for manufacturing the HSLD Mk II in India.

===== Crashes =====

The Indian Air Force and Navy has lost 20 and 5 of MiG-29s in crashes from 1989 to 2024, respectively. In total, the IAF and IN have purchased a total of 80 and 45 aircraft of their respective variants.

* On 8 May 2020, an IAF MiG-29 from the 223 Squadron crashed near Jalandhar in Punjab with its pilot ejected safely after the aircraft failed to respond. A court of inquiry has been ordered in the incident.
* On 2 September 2024, a MiG-29 (KBU-3112) of IAF&#x27;s 47 Squadron crashed during a night training mission in an unpopulated area near Uttarlai of Barmer district, Rajasthan due to technical reasons. The pilot ejected from the aircraft and there were no damage to life or property. The incident is under investigation.
* On 4 November 2024, a MiG-29 (KBU-711) of the 28 Squadron crashed near Agra during a routine training mission due to a &quot;system malfunction&quot;. The aircraft stalled and eventually entered a flat spin before the crash. The pilot ejected safely and no life or property damage were reported. A court of inquiry has been ordered in the incident. The pilot involved in the crash was of the rank Wing Commander. The aircraft was enroute from Adampur to Agra.

====Yugoslavia and Serbia====
Yugoslavia was the first European country outside the Soviet Union to operate the MiG-29. The country received 14 MiG-29 9.12As and two MiG-29UBs from the USSR in 1987 and 1988. The MiG-29s were put into service with the 127th Fighter Aviation Squadron, based at Batajnica Air Base, north of Belgrade, Serbia.

Yugoslav MiG-29s saw little combat during the breakup of Yugoslavia, and were used primarily for ground attacks. Several Antonov An-2 aircraft used by Croatia were destroyed on the ground at Čepin airfield near Osijek, Croatia in 1991 by a Yugoslav MiG-29, with no MiG-29 losses. At least two MiG-29s carried out an air strike on Banski Dvori, the official residence of the Croatian Government, on 7 October 1991.

The MiG-29s continued their service in the subsequent Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Because of the United Nations arms embargo against the country, the condition of the MiG-29s worsened as aircraft were not maintained according to rules and general overhaul scheduled for 1996 and 1997 was not conducted.

Six MiG-29s were shot down during the NATO intervention in the Kosovo War, four by USAF F-15s, one by a USAF F-16, and one by a Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16. However, one aircraft, according to its pilot, was hit by friendly fire from the ground. Another four were destroyed on the ground. One Argentine source claims that a MiG-29 shot down an F-16 on 26 March 1999, but this kill is disputed, as the F-16C in question was said to have crashed in the US that same day.
The Air Force of Serbia and Montenegro continued flying its remaining five MiG-29s at a very low rate after the war. In the spring of 2004, news appeared that MiG-29 operations had ceased, because the aircraft could not be maintained, but later the five remaining airframes were sent to Russia for overhaul. In July 2009, a Serbian Air Force MiG-29 crashed over Belgrade. The small Serbian MiG-29 fleet along with other jets were grounded for four months during the summer of 2014 due to a battery procurement issue.

In November 2016, Russia had agreed to donate six of its MiG-29s free of charge, if Serbia would pay the repair costs of $50 million for them. At the end of January 2017, Serbian defense minister Zoran Đorđević said that Belarus also agreed to donate eight of its MiG-29s to Serbia on a no-pay basis. In early October 2017, Russia completed the delivery of all the six MiG-29s. The aircraft were transferred to Serbia on board an Antonov An-124 transport aircraft. On 25 February 2019, Belarus formally handed four MiG-29s to the Serbian military during a ceremony held at the 558th Aircraft Repair Plant in Baranavichy. This increased the Serbian Air Force&#x27;s fleet to 14 MiG-29s. Serbia plans to spend about €180–230 million on modernization of its entire MiG-29 fleet. As of 2021, the Serbian Air Force operates 14 MiG-29s.

====Germany====
East Germany bought 24 MiG-29s (20 MiG-29As, four MiG-29UBs), which entered service in 1988–1989 in 1./JG3 &quot;Wladimir Komarow&quot; in Preschen in Brandenburg. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and reunification of Germany in October 1990, the MiG-29s and other aircraft of the East German &quot;Air Forces of the National People&#x27;s Army&quot; were integrated into the West German Luftwaffe. Initially the 1./JG3 kept its designation. In April 1991 both 1./JG3&#x27;s MiG-29 squadrons were reorganised into the MiG-29 test wing (&quot;&quot;Erprobungsgeschwader MiG-29&quot;), which became JG73 &quot;Steinhoff&quot;&quot; and was transferred to Laage near Rostock in June 1993.

The Federation of American Scientists claims the MiG-29 is equal to, or better than the F-15C in short aerial engagements because of the Helmet Mounted Weapons Sight (HMS) and better maneuverability at slow speeds. This was demonstrated when MiG-29s of the German Air Force participated in joint DACT exercises with US fighters. The HMS was a great help, allowing the Germans to achieve a lock on any target the pilot could see within the missile field of view, including those almost 45 degrees off boresight. However, the German pilots who flew the MiG-29 admitted that while the Fulcrum was more maneuverable at slow speeds than the F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-14 Tomcat, and F/A-18 Hornet and its Vympel R-73 dogfight missile system was superior to the AIM-9 Sidewinder of the time, in engagements that went into the beyond visual range arena, the German pilots found it difficult to multi-task locking and firing the MiG-29&#x27;s Vympel R-27 missile (German MiG-29s did not have access to the more advanced Vympel R-77 that equips more advanced MiG-29 versions) while trying to avoid the longer range and advanced search and track capabilities of the American fighters&#x27; radars and AIM-120 AMRAAM. The Germans also stated that the American fighters had the advantage in both night and bad weather combat conditions. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s assessment of the MiG-29 was that the Fulcrum was best used as a point defense interceptor over cities and military installations, not for fighter sweeps over hostile airspace. This assessment ultimately led Germany to not deploy its MiG-29s in the Kosovo War during Operation Allied Force, though Luftwaffe pilots who flew the MiG-29 admitted that even if they were permitted to fly combat missions over the former Yugoslavia they would have been hampered by the lack of NATO-specific communication tools and identification friend or foe systems.

Beginning in 1993, the German MiGs were stationed with JG73 &quot;Steinhoff&quot; in Laage near Rostock. During the service in the German Air Force, one MiG-29 (&quot;29+09&quot;) was destroyed in an accident on 25 June 1996 due to pilot error. By 2003, German Air Force pilots had flown over 30,000 hours in the MiG-29. In September 2003, 22 of the 23 remaining machines were sold to the Polish Air Force for the symbolic price of €1 per item. The last aircraft were transferred in August 2004. The 23rd MiG-29 (&quot;29+03&quot;) was put on display at Laage.

====Libya====
In 2020 it was reported that MiG-29 aircraft was flown by forces aligned with Khalifa Haftar in Libya. On 11 September 2020, United States Africa Command stated that two MiG-29s, operated by Russian speaking personnel, crashed in Libya due to unknown reasons, the first on 28 June 2020, the second on 7 September 2020. It was announced that MiG-29s and Su-24s are to be delivered to the Libyan Air Force from Russia.

====Peru====
The Peruvian Air Force acquired 21 MiG-29S fighters from Belarus in 1997, as part of a package that also included 18 Su-25 attack aircraft. The following year an additional 3 MiG-29 aircraft were acquired from Russia. At the same time, Peru contracted with Mikoyan to upgrade 8 aircraft to the MiG-29SMP standard, with an option to upgrade the remainder of the Peruvian inventory. The Peruvian MiG-29s are based at FAP Captain José Abelardo Quiñones González International Airport in northern Peru, equipping &quot;Escuadrón Aéreo&quot; 612 (Fighter Squadron 612 &quot;Fighting Roosters&quot;).

====Poland====
The first 12 MiG-29s delivered to Poland were nine MiG-29As and three MiG-29UBs in 1989–1990. The aircraft were based at Mińsk Mazowiecki and used by the 1st Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was reorganized in 2001 as &quot;1 Eskadra Lotnictwa Taktycznego&quot; (&quot;1. elt&quot;), or 1st Tactical Squadron (TS). In 1995–1996, 10 used examples were acquired from the Czech Republic (nine MiG-29As, one MiG-29UB). After the retirement of its MiG-23s in 1999, and MiG-21s in 2004, Poland was left for a time with only these 22 MiG-29s in the interceptor role.

Of the 22 MiG-29s Poland received from the German Air Force in 2004, a total of 14 were overhauled and taken into service. They were used to equip the 41st Tactical Squadron (&quot;41. elt&quot;), replacing its MiG-21s. As of 2008, Poland was the biggest NATO MiG-29 user. Poland had 31 active MiG-29s (25 MiG-29As, six MiG-29UBs) as of 2017. They are stationed with the 1st Tactical Squadron at the 23rd Air Base near Mińsk Mazowiecki and the 41st TS at the 22nd Air Base near Malbork.

There have been unconfirmed reports that Poland has at one point leased a MiG-29 from its own inventory to Israel for evaluation and the aircraft has since been returned to Poland, as suggested by photographs of a MiG-29 in Israeli use. Three Polish MiG-29As were reported in Israel for evaluation between April and May 1997 in the Negev Desert. On 7 September 2011, the Polish Air Force awarded a contract to the WZL 2 company to modernise its MiG-29 fleet to be compatible with Polish F-16s.

Four MiG-29s from 1. elt participated in the Baltic Air Policing mission in 2006, while 41. elt aircraft did so in 2008, 2010 and 2012. Polish MiG-29s played the aggressor role in the NATO Tactical Leadership Programme (TLP) joint training program in Albacete in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

On 18 December 2017, a MiG-29 crash-landed in a forest near the 23rd Air Base while performing a landing approach. The pilot did not eject, but survived the crash with minor injuries. This was the first crash of a MiG-29 during its nearly three decades long operational history in the Polish Air Force. On 6 July 2018, another MiG-29 crashed near Pasłęk, with its pilot dying in an ejection attempt. Technical issues are suspected to have played a role in the crash. Another crash followed on 4 March 2019. This time the pilot ejected and survived.

On 8 March 2022, Poland announced a willingness to transfer their operational fleet of MiG-29 aircraft to the US via the Ramstein Air Base, in exchange for aircraft of a similar role and operational capability, with the intent of transferring the MiG-29s to Ukraine to use in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On 16 March 2023, Polish President Andrzej Duda announced that Poland would transfer four operational MiG-29s to Ukraine, with the understanding that additional aircraft would be delivered after servicing and preparation. Poland is the first NATO country to provide Ukraine with fighter aircraft.

On 13 April, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius announced that Germany had approved the transfer of five MiG-29s to Ukraine. German approval was necessary because these aircraft belonged to the German Democratic Republic, which were then transferred to Poland in 2004.

====Iraq====
Iraq received a number of MiG-29 fighters and used them to engage Iranian equivalent opponents during the later stages of the Iran–Iraq War.

By August 1990, at the time of the Invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi Air Force had received 39 MiG-29 (9.12B) Fulcrum-As. Iraq was reportedly unsatisfied that they did not receive the R-73 and R-27T missiles that Coalition intelligence had assessed as a great threat, instead receiving R-60MK missiles. As a result, they did not order anymore aircraft. Iraq was reportedly able to modify their MiG-29s to carry both drop tanks and the TMV-002 Remora ECM pod.

MiG-29s saw combat in the 1991 Persian Gulf War with the Iraqi Air Force. Five MiG-29s were shot down by USAF F-15s. Some Russian sources reported that one British Panavia Tornado, &quot;ZA467&quot;, was shot down in northwestern Iraq by a MiG-29 UK sources claim this Tornado to have crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah. Other Iraqi air-to-air kills are reported in Russian sources, where the US claims other cases of combat damage, such as a B-52 which the US claims was hit by friendly fire, when an AGM-88 high-speed, anti-radiation missile (HARM) homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52&#x27;s tail gun; the bomber returned to base and was subsequently renamed &quot;In HARM&#x27;s Way&quot;. It is believed that an F-111 Aardvark was hit by a missile fired by a MiG-29 but it was able to return to base. A MiG-29 from the 4th or 5th TFS also had a less fortunate kill against a friendly aircraft, a MiG-23ML using a R-27R missile on the 17th of January, 1991. This case of fratricide was not the first of this type, but a MiG-29 of the 5th TFS shot down another MiG-29 of the same unit using an R-60MK in April of 1988, though the circumstances are not entirely known. 

Iraq&#x27;s original fleet of 37 MiG-29s was reduced to 12 after the Gulf War. One MiG-29 was damaged, and seven were reportedly flown to Iran. The remaining 12 aircraft were withdrawn from use in 1995 because the engines needed to be overhauled but Iraq could not send them off for that work.

After the American-led 2003 invasion of Iraq and disbandment of the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi Army in May of the same year, the remaining Soviet-made and Chinese-made fighters of the Iraqi Air Force had been decommissioned.

====Syria====
Syrian Arab Air Force MiG-29s have sometimes encountered Israeli fighter and reconnaissance aircraft. Two Israeli F-15Cs reportedly shot down two MiG-29As on 2 June 1989 under unclear circumstances.

Further reports claim that on 14 September 2001 two Syrian Air Force MiG-29s were shot down by two Israeli F-15Cs while the MiGs were intercepting an Israeli reconnaissance aircraft off the coast of Lebanon. However, both Syria and Israel deny that this occurred.

Syrian MiG-29s entered the Syrian Civil War in late October 2013, attacking Free Syrian Army insurgents with unguided rockets and bombs in Damascus.

A Syrian MiG-29SM crashed on 7 March 2020 near Shayrat Airbase. Marking the first crash of the plane in the Syrian Air Force since 2001. According to &quot;avia.pro&quot; the aircraft may have been shot down by MANPADS operated by the Syrian Opposition.

==== Malaysia ====
The Royal Malaysian Air Force operated 18 MiG-29N/NUB aircraft from 1995 to 2017 out of its air base in Kuantan. The aircraft were modified to have an improved engine and stronger airframe to meet Malaysian requirements.

In 2009, it was announced that the jets would be gradually phased out by the end of 2010 as a result of increasing maintenance costs, which would save approximately $76 million annually. The Malaysian defence ministry subsequently went back on its position and announced it would keep ten planes in service and only retire the remaining six. In 2013, it was announced that the MiG-29 fleet would be retired by 2015. However, delays with its Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program meant the jets were kept in service and set to be upgraded to extend their lifespan, but these plans ultimately did not materialise and they were finally retired in 2017.

One crashed in 1998 as a result of hydraulic and battery failures, and another in 2004 after its engine caught on fire after takeoff. Both pilots ejected and survived.

==== North Korea ====
The Korean People&#x27;s Air Force is believed to operate about 18 MiG-29 which are assigned to the 55th Air Regiment based at Sunchon Air Base. In addition to 13 MiG-29 (9.12B) Fulcrum-As and 2 Fulcrum-B trainers that were delivered in 1987, North Korea also became the only Cold War export customer and licensed manufacturer of the Fulcrum-C. Called the MiG-29S-13 (9.13B) Fulcrum-C, they were delivered to North Korea from the USSR/Russia between 1991 and 1992 in knock down parts. Only three S-13s were completed due to Russia refusing to supply more parts to North Korea. The first locally built Fulcrum-C flew on 15 April 1993. These were first encountered and photographed by the USAF in March 2003 when a pair of KPAF MiG-29s intercepted an USAF RC-135S Cobra Ball reconnaissance aircraft.

====Sudan====
There have been occasional claims regarding the use of Sudanese Air Force MiG-29s against insurgent forces in Darfur. However, whereas Mi-24 combat helicopters as well as Nanchang A-5 or, more recently, Su-25 ground-attack aircraft have been spotted and photographed on Darfurian air fields, no MiG-29s have been observed. On 10 May 2008, a Darfur rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) mounted an assault on the Sudanese capital. During this action, the JEM shot down a Sudanese Air Force MiG-29 with heavy machine gun fire while it was attacking a convoy of vehicles in the Khartoum suburb of Omdurman. The aircraft was piloted by a Russian mercenary. He was killed in action as his parachute did not open after ejecting. On 14 November 2008 Sudanese Ministry of Defence admitted that Sudan had received 12 MiG-29 from Russia. An anonymous Russian source claimed that the aircraft had been delivered before 2004.

During the brief 2012 South Sudan–Sudan border conflict, on 4 April 2012, Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) claimed the downing of a Sudanese MiG-29 using antiaircraft guns. The Sudan government denied the claim. On 16 April 2012, the SPLA issued a second claim about the downing of a Sudanese MiG-29. It was not clear if this second claim referred to the previous one.

On 15 April 2023, a Sudanese MiG-29 was captured on film firing missiles over Khartoum during a skirmish with paramilitary forces.

On 25 May 2023, a Sudanese MiG-29 was filmed being shot down by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) over Omdurman. The pilot ejected and survived, although he was wounded and captured.

====United States====
In 1997, the US purchased 21 Moldovan MiG-29 aircraft under the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. Fourteen were MiG-29S models, which are equipped with an active radar jammer in its spine and are capable of being armed with nuclear weapons. Part of the US&#x27; motive to purchase these aircraft was to prevent them from being sold to Iran. This purchase could also provide the tactical fighter communities of the USAF, the USN and the USMC with a working evaluation and data for the MiG-29, and possibly for use in dissimilar air combat training. Such information may prove valuable in any future conflicts and can aid in the design and testing of current and future weapons platforms. In late 1997, the MiGs were delivered to the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, though many of the former Moldovan MiG-29s are believed to have been scrapped. Some of these MiG-29s are currently on open display at Nellis AFB, Nevada; NAS Fallon, Nevada; Goodfellow AFB, Texas; and Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

====Others====
A Cuban MiG-29UB shot down two Cessna 337s belonging to the organisation Brothers to the Rescue in 1996, after the aircraft approached Cuban airspace.

According to some reports, in the 1999 Eritrean-Ethiopian War, a number of Eritrean MiG-29s were shot down by Ethiopian Su-27s piloted by Russian mercenaries. It was reported that local pilots were trained by instructors from those nations. There are also some other reports of Eritrean MiG-29s shooting down two Ethiopian MiG-21s, three MiG-23s. The claim that an Eritrean MiG-29 shot down an Ethiopian Su-25 was later debunked, since the missing Ethiopian Su-25TK was damaged in an accident in May 2000, is actually stored and used for spares at Bishoftu Air Base.

, Jane&#x27;s Information Group reported the Bangladesh Air Force (BAF) operated 8 MiG-29s (6B &amp; 2UB).

After the end of the 1994 civil war, newly reunified Yemen inherited several intact MiG-29s, bought by South Yemen a few months earlier. In 1995–1996, Yemen also received two additional jets from Kazakhstan. In 2001, a major arms deal including the purchase of up to 36 upgraded MiG-29s was signed, with deliveries starting in June 2002. Equipped with N019MP radar and an advanced fire control system, they became the most advanced combat aircraft in the Yemeni Air force arsenal. They are compatible with Kh-31P and Kh-29T guided air-to-ground missiles, as well as R-77 air-to-air missiles.

===Potential operators and failed bids===
Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Finland had a policy of splitting procurement of armaments between western, eastern and domestic suppliers. The MiG-29 was planned to replace the Finnish Air Force&#x27;s MiG-21 fighters up to 1988, with test flights having been done.

In the second half of the 1980s, the Soviet Union offered the MiG-29 to Libya. The offer was turned down, as the weapons system and radar of the MiG-29 were assessed as similar to those of the MiG-23MLD already in service with the Libyan Arab Air Force. The MiG-29&#x27;s price was also deemed much too high.

During 1989–1990, the Soviet Union delivered 49 helicopters and 125 aircraft after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan additionally requested the MiG-29 for the Afghan Air Force, although this was turned down.

In 1989, Zimbabwe ordered a squadron&#x27;s worth of MiG-29s to the USSR. Some Air Force of Zimbabwe personnel travelled to Russia for conversion courses, but in 1992 the deal was cancelled, as the geopolitical situation of the region was stabilising.

In December 2008, Russia moved to expand its military influence in the Middle East when it announced it was giving Lebanon 10 fighter jets, that would have been the most significant upgrade of Lebanon&#x27;s military since the civil war ended almost two decades before. A Russian defence ministry representative said it was giving secondhand MiG-29s to Lebanon for free. This was to be part of a defence cooperation deal that would have included Lebanese military personnel training in Russia. On 29 February 2010, Russia agreed to change the offer to 10 Mi-24 attack helicopters based on a Lebanese request.

In 2021 Russia offered the Argentine Air Force a batch of 15 MiG-29 fighters and another of Su-30 fighters with 12 units and seek also the sale of Yak-130 training jet and Mil Mi-17 helicopters.

;MiG-29 (Product 9.13) &#x27;Fulcrum-C&#x27;
:Update of the initial production version; entered service in 1986. NATO reporting name is &quot;Fulcrum-C&quot;. Variant possessed an enlarged dorsal spine to accommodate a larger No.1 fuel tank and the installation of the L-203BE Gardenyia-1 jammer that was lacking on the initial 9.12 version. This enlarged spine earned the 9.13 version and its successors the nickname of &quot;Fatback&quot;.

;MiG-29 (Product 9.13B) &#x27;Fulcrum-C&#x27;
:Export variant of the 9.13 provided to North Korea in semi-knocked down (SKD) kits and built in Panghyon between 1991 and 1992. Like the 9.13, it has the Gardenyia-1 jammer but has downgraded avionics and no IFF. Other sources say the Gardenyia was not delivered to North Korea.

;MiG-29S (Product 9.13S)
:The MiG-29S was an update of the original 9.13 model retaining the NATO reporting code &quot;Fulcrum-C&quot; and featured flight control system improvements; a total of four new computers provided better stability augmentation and controllability with an increase of 2° in angle of attack (AoA). An improved mechanical-hydraulic flight control system allowed for greater control surface deflections. The MiG-29S can carry under wing drop tanks and a centerline tank. The inboard underwing hardpoints allow a tandem pylon arrangement for carrying a larger payload of . Overall maximum gross weight was raised to . This version also included new avionics and the new Phazotron N019M radar and Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) to reduce dependence on ground support equipment. Development of this version was initiated due to multiple systems being compromised to the West by Phazotron engineer Adolf Tolkachev. This was the final version of the MiG-29 produced before the collapse of the Soviet Union and only limited numbers were produced.

=== Upgraded variants based on original airframe ===
;MiG-29S (Product 9.12S)
:Post Soviet upgrade for older 9.12 variants incorporating the changes developed for version 9.13S.

;MiG-29G/MiG-29GT
:East German MiG-29 / 29UB upgraded to NATO standards, with work done by MiG Aircraft Product Support GmbH (MAPS), a joint venture company form between MiG Moscow Aviation Production Association and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace in 1993.

;MiG-29AS/MiG-29UBS
:Slovak Air Force performed an upgrade on their MiG-29/-29UB for NATO compatibility. Work is done by RAC MiG and Western firms, starting from 2005. The aircraft now has navigation and communications systems from Rockwell Collins, an IFF system from BAE Systems, new glass cockpit features multi-function LC displays and digital processors and also fitted to be integrate with Western equipment in the future. However, the armaments of the aircraft remain unchanged. 12 out of 21 of the entire MiG-29 fleet were upgraded and had been delivered as of late February 2008.
;MiG-29 &quot;Sniper&quot;
:Upgrade planned for the Romanian Air Force by DASA, Aerostar and Elbit. DASA was responsible for program management, technical support and the test flight program (together with Elbit), Elbit was responsible for developing the avionics package, while Aerostar implemented the upgrades on the aircraft. The first flight occurred on 5 May 2000. The upgrades included the installation of a new modular multirole computer based on the MIL-STD-1553B data bus, upgraded Western avionics, new radio stations, hybrid navigation system composed of an inertial navigation system and coupled with GPS receiver, identification system, two MFCDs, a Head-Up Display equipped with UFCP front control panel, new RWR, new HOTAS and new ADC. The addition of a new radar and the integration of Western weapons while maintaining Russian ones were also expected. The program halted due to various reasons, along with the retiring of Romanian MiG-29s in 2003, the Romanian Government deciding to further invest in the MiG-21 LanceR program.
;MiG-29SMT (Product 9.17)
:The MiG-29SMT is an upgrade of first-generation MiG-29s (9.12 to 9.13) using enhancements on the MiG-29M. Additional fuel tanks in a further enlarged spine provide a maximum internal flight range of . The cockpit has an enhanced HOTAS design, two colour liquid crystal MFDs and two smaller monochrome LCDs. The MiG-29A lacked an advanced air-to-ground capability, thus the SMT upgrade adds the upgraded Zhuk-ME radar with air-to-ground radar detection and integrates air-to-ground guided weapons. It also has upgraded RD-33 ser.3 engines with afterburning thrust rated at each. The weapons load was increased to on six underwing and one ventral hardpoints, with similar weapon choices to the MiG-29M. It can also accommodate non-Russian origin avionics and weapons.
;MiG-29BM
:The MiG-29BM (probably Belarusian Modernised, possibly Bolyshaya Modernizaciya – large modernization) is an upgrade conducted by the ARZ-558 aircraft repair plant in Baranovichi, Belarus. It is a strike variant of the MiG-29 and the Belarusian counterpart to the Russian MiG-29SMT. It includes improvements to weapons, radar, as well as adding non-retractable air-air refueling ability. They entered service in 2003 and it is estimated, that ten or so were modernized to BM standard. The Bangladesh Air Force upgraded its MiG-29s similar to BM standard.

;MiG-29UBT (Product 9.51T)
:SMT standard upgrade for the MiG-29UB. Namely users, Algeria and Yemen.

;MiG-29UPG
:The UPG was a new modification intended for the MiG-29s used by the Indian Air Force. The Indian UPG version is similar to the SMT variant but differs by having a foreign-made avionics suite integrated within it. The weapons suite is the same as the SMT and K/KUB versions. It made its maiden flight on 4 February 2011. The version includes the new Zhuk-M radar, new avionics, an IFR probe, as well as new enhanced RD-33 Series 3 turbofan engines, and the DRDO/DARE D-29 Electronic Warfare System. The modernization is part of a $900 million contract to upgrade the 69 fighter fleet.

;MiG-29SMP / MiG-29UBP
:The SMP/UBP are upgrades for the Peruvian Air Force MiG-29 fleet. In August 2008 a contract of US$106 million was signed with RAC MiG for this custom SM upgrade of an initial batch of eight MiG-29, with a provision for upgrading all of Peru&#x27;s MiG-29s. The single-seat version is designated SMP, whereas the twin-seat version is designated UBP. It features an improved ECM suite, avionics, sensors, pilot interface, and a MIL-STD-1553 databus. The interfaces include improved IRST capabilities for enhanced passive detection and tracking as well as better off-boresight launch capabilities, one MFCD and HOTAS. The N019M1 radar, a heavily modified and upgraded digital version of the N019 radar, replaces the standard N010 Zhuk-M of the MiG-29SMT. The upgrade also includes a structural life-extension program (SLEP), overhauled and upgraded engines, and the addition of an in-flight refuelling probe.

;MiG-29MU1

Identical characteristics to MiG-29M, with a slightly reduced ferry range of .&lt;ref name=&quot;MiG-29M/M2_page&quot;&gt;MiG-29M / &quot;MiG-29M2.&quot; &quot;RAC MiG&quot;. Retrieved 1 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; RAC MiG presented in various air shows, including Fifth China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition (CIAAE 2004), Aero India 2005, MAKS 2005. It was once given designation MiG-29MRCA for marketing purpose and now evolved into the current MiG-35.
;MiG-29OVT
:The aircraft is one of the six pre-built MiG-29Ms before 1991, later received thrust vectoring engine and fly-by-wire technology. It served as a thrust-vectoring engine testbed and technology demonstrator in various air shows to show future improvement in the MiG-29M. It has identical avionics to the MiG-29M. The only difference in the cockpit layout is an additional switch to turn on vector thrust function. The two RD-133 thrust-vectoring engines, each features unique 3D rotating nozzles which can provide thrust vector deflection in all directions. However, despite its thrust-vectoring, other specifications were not officially emphasized. It is usually used as an aerobatic demonstrator and has been demonstrated along with the MiG-29M2 in various air shows around the world for potential export.
;MiG-29K (Product 9.31)

:Naval variant based on MiG-29M, the letter &quot;K&quot; stands for &quot;Korabelnogo bazirovaniya&quot; (deck-based). It features folding wings, arrestor gear, and reinforced landing gear. Originally intended for the &quot;Admiral Kuznetsov&quot; class aircraft carriers, it had received series production approval from the Russian Ministry of Defence but was grounded in 1992 due to shift in military doctrine and financial difficulties. The MiG Corporation restarted the program in 1999. On 20 January 2004, the Indian Navy signed a contract of 12 single-seat MiG-29K and four two-seat MiG-29KUB. Modifications were made for the Indian Navy requirement. Production MiG-29K and MiG-29KUB share a two-seater size canopy. The MiG-29K has radar absorbing coatings to reduce radar signature. Cockpit displays consist of wide HUD and three (seven on MiG-29KUB) colour LCD MFDs with a Topsight E helmet-mounted targeting system. It has a full range of weapons compatible with the MiG-29M and MiG-29SMT. NATO reporting code is &quot;Fulcrum-D&quot;.

;MiG-29KUB (Product 9.47)
:Identical characteristic to the MiG-29K but with tandem twin seat configuration. The design is to serve as trainer for MiG-29K pilot and is full combat capable. The first MiG-29KUB developed for the Indian Navy made its maiden flight at the Russian Zhukovsky aircraft test centre on 22 January 2007. NATO reporting code is &quot;Fulcrum-D&quot;.

===Former operators===
* – The Chadian Air Force received 3 MiG-29s from Ukraine in 2015. None operational as of 2024.
* – Received 18 MiG-29s and two MiG-29UB aircraft. Although six were capable of delivering nuclear weapons, the necessary equipment for this was removed as per the CFE treaty. All passed onto successor states.
* – Inherited nine MiG-29 and one MiG-29UB. All sold to Poland in 1995 in exchange for 11 W-3A Sokol helicopters. Replaced with Saab JAS 39 Gripen.
* – 24 absorbed into the West German Air Force upon reunification.
* – One crashed, one on display, 22 sold to Poland in 2003 for €22 ($).
* – 28 in inventory as of January 2011. Reportedly stored outside. The last fighter was retired in December 2010, at which point only 4 aircraft were still in operational condition. In 2011 the Hungarian government intended to sell six MiG-29 9.12 and two MiG-29UB aircraft. Replaced with JAS 39 Gripen but kept in reserve if needed. In October 2017, the Hungarian Air Force announced that 23 MiG-29s were to be auctioned off including engines and spare parts in November. The online auction had a reservation price of €8.7 million and failed to attract any bidders. This might have been because of an agreement between Hungary and Russia requiring the manufacturer&#x27;s (Russia&#x27;s) approval to transfer ownership of the aircraft.
* – Received 37 MiG-29s during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s era (MiG-29 9.12B and MiG-29UB); these were destroyed or written off and nine were reportedly flown to Iran.
* – Leased from Poland in 1997.
* - Kazakh Air and Air Defence Forces – 23 MiG-29s as of 2023. These were retired in 2023, put up for auction in October 2023, and reportedly sold in April 2024 to the US. It was speculated that these would be transferred to Ukraine as spare parts sources and/or decoys. In a later statement, the Kazakh state-owned weapons importer and exporter Kazspetexport denied such claims, saying that foreign companies were not allowed to bid.
* – Retired 16 MiG-29s in 2017 for lack of spare parts and engine problem. Replaced with Sukhoi Su-30.

They were officially withdrawn from service on 31 August 2022. Slovakia&#x27;s Foreign Minister Rastislav Káčer has said that his country is prepared to transfer their fleet of MiG-29s to Ukraine. He said: &quot;We have not yet handed [Ukraine] the MiG-29s. But we are ready to do it. We are talking with our NATO partners about how to do it,&quot; and such a package would involve &quot;several thousand&quot; missiles. Slovakia transferred the first four of its MiG-29 fighter jets, from 13 to be sent to Ukraine on 24 March 2023.

<doc id="185658" wikidata="Q313857" url="?curid=185658" title="Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona">
<text>Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (Juan Carlos Teresa Silverio Alfonso de Borbón y Battenberg; 20 June 1913 – 1 April 1993), was a claimant to the Spanish throne as Juan III. He was the third son and designated heir of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and Queen Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg. His father was replaced by the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. Juan&#x27;s son Juan Carlos I became King of Spain when Spain&#x27;s constitutional monarchy was restored in 1975.

==Early life==
Infante Juan was born at the Palace of San Ildefonso. His father was forced into exile when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed on 14 April 1931. Owing to the renunciations in 1933 of his brothers Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, Infante Juan became first in line to the defunct Spanish throne. He thus received the title Prince of Asturias while serving with the Royal Navy in Bombay.

In March 1935, he was appointed honorary sub-lieutenant and passed naval exams in gunnery and navigation, which would have entitled him to a lieutenant’s commission in the Royal Navy if he gave up his Spanish nationality. This, however, he refused to do.

==Marriage==
He met his future wife at a party hosted by Victor Emmanuel III of Italy on the day before his sister (Infanta Beatriz) was to be married. He married Princess María de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1910–2000), known in Spain as Doña María de las Mercedes de Borbón-Dos Sicilias y Orleans, in Rome on 12 October 1935.

Just before the birth of the Infante Juan Carlos, the Count of Barcelona decided to go hunting, with the doctor telling him and his wife that the future king would not be born for weeks. When he was told of the birth, he drove to the hospital so quickly that he broke an axle spring.

===Children===
They had four children:

*Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz (30 July 1936 – 8 January 2020), who married Luis Gomez-Acebo y de Estrada, Viscount de la Torre, on 6 May 1967, and had five children
*Juan Carlos I of Spain (born 5 January 1938), who married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark on 14 May 1962, and had three children
*Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria and Duchess of Hernani (born 6 March 1939), who married Don Carlos Zurita y Delgado on 12 October 1972, and had two children
*Infante Alfonso of Spain (3 October 1941 – 29 March 1956)

They lived in Cannes and Rome, and, with the outbreak of World War II, they moved to Lausanne to live with his mother, Victoria Eugenie. Afterwards, they resided at Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera. Together with their children Pilar and Juan Carlos, they took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece in 1954, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe. On this trip, Juan Carlos met the hosts&#x27; 15-year-old daughter, Sofia, his future wife, for the first time.

==Claim to the Spanish throne==

In 1931, Juan was subject to dynastic negotiations between the Alfonsists and the Carlists, concluded in so-called Pact of Territet, which was never implemented. Juan became heir apparent to the defunct Spanish throne after the renunciations of his two older brothers, Alfonso and Jaime, in 1933. To assert his claim to the throne, following his father&#x27;s death (in 1941) he used the title of Count of Barcelona, a sovereign title associated with the Spanish crown.

In 1936, his father sent him to participate in the Spanish Civil War but he was arrested near the French border, and sent back by General Emilio Mola.

On 19 March 1945, he announced a manifesto in Lausanne, demanding he replace Francisco Franco: 

When General Franco declared Spain a monarchy in 1947, he characterized it as a &quot;restoration&quot;. However, Franco was afraid that Juan would roll back the Spanish State because he favoured constitutional monarchy, which would restore parliamentary democracy. As a result, in 1969, Franco passed over Juan in favour of Juan&#x27;s son, Juan Carlos, who Franco believed would be more likely to continue the dictatorship after his death. Juan Carlos later surprised many by his support of democratising Spain. Franco and Juan did not have a good relationship, with the latter constantly pressing Franco to restore the monarchy. Relations soured further when Juan called Franco an &quot;illegitimate usurper&quot;.

Juan formally renounced his rights to the Spanish throne eight years after being displaced as recognised heir to the throne by Franco, and two years after his son, Juan Carlos, had become king. In return, his son officially granted him the title of Count of Barcelona, which he had claimed for so long.

After his death in 1993, he was buried with honours due a king, under the name &quot;Juan III&quot; (his title if he had become king) in the Royal Crypt of the monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, near Madrid. His wife survived him by seven years.

He was fond of the sea, and joined the Naval School at San Fernando, Cádiz, and had tattoos of a marine theme from his time in the British Royal Navy. He was appointed an honorary admiral of the Royal Navy on 31 July 1987.

<doc id="185663" wikidata="Q848539" url="?curid=185663" title="Division by zero">
<text>In mathematics, division by zero, division where the divisor (denominator) is zero, is a unique and problematic special case. Using fraction notation, the general example can be written as formula_1, where formula_2 is the dividend (numerator).

The usual definition of the quotient in elementary arithmetic is the number which yields the dividend when multiplied by the divisor. That is, formula_3 is equivalent to formula_4 By this definition, the quotient formula_5 is nonsensical, as the product formula_6 is always formula_7 rather than some other number formula_8 Following the ordinary rules of elementary algebra while allowing division by zero can create a mathematical fallacy, a subtle mistake leading to absurd results. To prevent this, the arithmetic of real numbers and more general numerical structures called fields leaves division by zero undefined, and situations where division by zero might occur must be treated with care. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression formula_9 is also undefined.

Calculus studies the behavior of functions in the limit as their input tends to some value. When a real function can be expressed as a fraction whose denominator tends to zero, the output of the function becomes arbitrarily large, and is said to &quot;tend to infinity&quot;, a type of mathematical singularity. For example, the reciprocal function, formula_10 tends to infinity as formula_11 tends to formula_12 When both the numerator and the denominator tend to zero at the same input, the expression is said to take an indeterminate form, as the resulting limit depends on the specific functions forming the fraction and cannot be determined from their separate limits.

As an alternative to the common convention of working with fields such as the real numbers and leaving division by zero undefined, it is possible to define the result of division by zero in other ways, resulting in different number systems. For example, the quotient formula_13 can be defined to equal zero; it can be defined to equal a new explicit point at infinity, sometimes denoted by the infinity symbol or it can be defined to result in signed infinity, with positive or negative sign depending on the sign of the dividend. In these number systems division by zero is no longer a special exception per se, but the point or points at infinity involve their own new types of exceptional behavior.

In computing, an error may result from an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the context and the type of number involved, dividing by zero may evaluate to positive or negative infinity, return a special not-a-number value, or crash the program, among other possibilities.

==Elementary arithmetic==
===The meaning of division===
The division formula_14 can be conceptually interpreted in several ways.

In &quot;quotitive division&quot;, the dividend formula_15 is imagined to be split up into parts of size formula_16 (the divisor), and the quotient formula_17 is the number of resulting parts. For example, imagine ten slices of bread are to be made into sandwiches, each requiring two slices of bread. A total of five sandwiches can be made Now imagine instead that zero slices of bread are required per sandwich (perhaps a lettuce wrap). Arbitrarily many such sandwiches can be made from ten slices of bread, as the bread is irrelevant.

The quotitive concept of division lends itself to calculation by repeated subtraction: dividing entails counting how many times the divisor can be subtracted before the dividend runs out. Because no finite number of subtractions of zero will ever exhaust a non-zero dividend, calculating division by zero in this way never terminates. Such an interminable division-by-zero algorithm is physically exhibited by some mechanical calculators.

In &quot;partitive division&quot;, the dividend formula_15 is imagined to be split into formula_16 parts, and the quotient formula_17 is the resulting size of each part. For example, imagine ten cookies are to be divided among two friends. Each friend will receive five cookies Now imagine instead that the ten cookies are to be divided among zero friends. How many cookies will each friend receive? Since there are no friends, this is an absurdity.
In another interpretation, the quotient formula_17 represents the ratio formula_22 For example, a cake recipe might call for ten cups of flour and two cups of sugar, a ratio of formula_23 or, proportionally, formula_24 To scale this recipe to larger or smaller quantities of cake, a ratio of flour to sugar proportional to formula_25 could be maintained, for instance one cup of flour and one-fifth cup of sugar, or fifty cups of flour and ten cups of sugar. Now imagine a sugar-free cake recipe calls for ten cups of flour and zero cups of sugar. The ratio formula_26 or proportionally formula_27 is perfectly sensible: it just means that the cake has no sugar. However, the question &quot;How many parts flour for each part sugar?&quot; still has no meaningful numerical answer.

A geometrical appearance of the division-as-ratio interpretation is the slope of a straight line in the Cartesian plane. The slope is defined to be the &quot;rise&quot; (change in vertical coordinate) divided by the &quot;run&quot; (change in horizontal coordinate) along the line. When this is written using the symmetrical ratio notation, a horizontal line has slope formula_28 and a vertical line has slope formula_29 However, if the slope is taken to be a single real number then a horizontal line has slope formula_30 while a vertical line has an undefined slope, since in real-number arithmetic the quotient formula_31 is undefined. The real-valued slope formula_32 of a line through the origin is the vertical coordinate of the intersection between the line and a vertical line at horizontal coordinate formula_33 dashed black in the figure. The vertical red and dashed black lines are parallel, so they have no intersection in the plane. Sometimes they are said to intersect at a point at infinity, and the ratio formula_34 is represented by a new number see below. Vertical lines are sometimes said to have an &quot;infinitely steep&quot; slope.

=== Inverse of multiplication ===
Division is the inverse of multiplication, meaning that multiplying and then dividing by the same non-zero quantity, or vice versa, leaves an original quantity unchanged; for example formula_35formula_36. Thus a division problem such as formula_37 can be solved by rewriting it as an equivalent equation involving multiplication, formula_38 where formula_39 represents the same unknown quantity, and then finding the value for which the statement is true; in this case the unknown quantity is formula_40 because formula_41 so therefore formula_42

An analogous problem involving division by zero, formula_43 requires determining an unknown quantity satisfying formula_44 However, any number multiplied by zero is zero rather than six, so there exists no number which can substitute for formula_39 to make a true statement.

When the problem is changed to formula_46 the equivalent multiplicative statement is in this case &quot;any&quot; value can be substituted for the unknown quantity to yield a true statement, so there is no single number which can be assigned as the quotient formula_47

Because of these difficulties, quotients where the divisor is zero are traditionally taken to be &quot;undefined&quot;, and division by zero is not allowed.

===Fallacies===

A compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that allowing it leads to fallacies. 

When working with numbers, it is easy to identify an illegal division by zero. For example:

:From formula_48 and formula_49 one gets formula_50 Cancelling from both sides yields formula_51, a false statement.

The fallacy here arises from the assumption that it is legitimate to cancel like any other number, whereas, in fact, doing so is a form of division by .

Using algebra, it is possible to disguise a division by zero to obtain an invalid proof. For example:

This is essentially the same fallacious computation as the previous numerical version, but the division by zero was obfuscated because we wrote as .

==Early attempts==
The &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; of Brahmagupta (c. 598–668) is the earliest text to treat zero as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero. According to Brahmagupta,

A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.

In 830, Mahāvīra unsuccessfully tried to correct the mistake Brahmagupta made in his book &quot;Ganita Sara Samgraha&quot;: &quot;A number remains unchanged when divided by zero.&quot;

Bhāskara II&#x27;s &quot;Līlāvatī&quot; (12th century) proposed that division by zero results in an infinite quantity,

A quantity divided by zero becomes a fraction the denominator of which is zero. This fraction is termed an infinite quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has zero for its divisor, there is no alteration, though many may be inserted or extracted; as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God when worlds are created or destroyed, though numerous orders of beings are absorbed or put forth.

Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to formula_52 is contained in Anglo-Irish philosopher George Berkeley&#x27;s criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in &quot;The Analyst&quot; (&quot;ghosts of departed quantities&quot;).

== Calculus ==

Calculus studies the behavior of functions using the concept of a limit, the value to which a function&#x27;s output tends as its input tends to some specific value. The notation formula_53 means that the value of the function formula_54 can be made arbitrarily close to formula_55 by choosing formula_11 sufficiently close to formula_57

In the case where the limit of the real function formula_54 increases without bound as formula_11 tends to formula_60 the function is not defined at formula_61 a type of mathematical singularity. Instead, the function is said to &quot;tend to infinity&quot;, denoted formula_62 and its graph has the line formula_63 as a vertical asymptote. While such a function is not formally defined for formula_64 and the infinity symbol formula_65 in this case does not represent any specific real number, such limits are informally said to &quot;equal infinity&quot;. If the value of the function decreases without bound, the function is said to &quot;tend to negative infinity&quot;, formula_66 In some cases a function tends to two different values when formula_11 tends to formula_68 from above and below ; such a function has two distinct one-sided limits.

A basic example of an infinite singularity is the reciprocal function, formula_69 which tends to positive or negative infinity as formula_11 tends to 

formula_71

In most cases, the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to the quotient of the limits of each function separately,

formula_72

However, when a function is constructed by dividing two functions whose separate limits are both equal to formula_73 then the limit of the result cannot be determined from the separate limits, so is said to take an indeterminate form, informally written formula_74 (Another indeterminate form, formula_75 results from dividing two functions whose limits both tend to infinity.) Such a limit may equal any real value, may tend to infinity, or may not converge at all, depending on the particular functions. For example, in 

formula_76 

the separate limits of the numerator and denominator are formula_7, so we have the indeterminate form formula_78, but simplifying the quotient first shows that the limit exists: 

formula_79

== Alternative number systems ==

===Extended real line===
The affinely extended real numbers are obtained from the real numbers formula_80 by adding two new numbers formula_81 and formula_82 read as &quot;positive infinity&quot; and &quot;negative infinity&quot; respectively, and representing points at infinity. With the addition of formula_83 the concept of a &quot;limit at infinity&quot; can be made to work like a finite limit. When dealing with both positive and negative extended real numbers, the expression formula_84 is usually left undefined. However, in contexts where only non-negative values are considered, it is often convenient to define formula_85.

===Projectively extended real line===
The set formula_86 is the projectively extended real line, which is a one-point compactification of the real line. Here formula_65 means an unsigned infinity or point at infinity, an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies formula_88, which is necessary in this context. In this structure, formula_89 can be defined for nonzero , and formula_90 when is not formula_65. It is the natural way to view the range of the tangent function and cotangent functions of trigonometry: approaches the single point at infinity as approaches either or from either direction.

This definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a field, and should not be expected to behave like one. For example, formula_92 is undefined in this extension of the real line.

===Riemann sphere===
The subject of complex analysis applies the concepts of calculus in the complex numbers. Of major importance in this subject is the extended complex numbers formula_93 the set of complex numbers with a single additional number appended, usually denoted by the infinity symbol formula_65 and representing a point at infinity, which is defined to be contained in every exterior domain, making those its topological neighborhoods.

This can intuitively be thought of as wrapping up the infinite edges of the complex plane and pinning them together at the single point formula_95 a one-point compactification, making the extended complex numbers topologically equivalent to a sphere. This equivalence can be extended to a metrical equivalence by mapping each complex number to a point on the sphere via inverse stereographic projection, with the resulting spherical distance applied as a new definition of distance between complex numbers; and in general the geometry of the sphere can be studied using complex arithmetic, and conversely complex arithmetic can be interpreted in terms of spherical geometry. As a consequence, the set of extended complex numbers is often called the Riemann sphere. The set is usually denoted by the symbol for the complex numbers decorated by an asterisk, overline, tilde, or circumflex, for example formula_96

In the extended complex numbers, for any nonzero complex number formula_97 ordinary complex arithmetic is extended by the additional rules formula_98 formula_99 formula_100 formula_101 formula_102 However, formula_9, formula_104, and formula_105 are left undefined.

==Higher mathematics==
The four basic operations – addition, subtraction, multiplication and division – as applied to whole numbers (positive integers), with some restrictions, in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply. For instance, to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another, the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of integers in order to incorporate the negative integers. Similarly, to support division of any integer by any other, the realm of numbers must expand to the rational numbers. During this gradual expansion of the number system, care is taken to ensure that the &quot;extended operations&quot;, when applied to the older numbers, do not produce different results. Loosely speaking, since division by zero has no meaning (is &quot;undefined&quot;) in the whole number setting, this remains true as the setting expands to the real or even complex numbers.

As the realm of numbers to which these operations can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in the realm of integers, subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers. Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, &quot;Why can&#x27;t we divide by zero?&quot;, becomes &quot;Why can&#x27;t a rational number have a zero denominator?&quot;. Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.

In the modern approach to constructing the field of real numbers, the rational numbers appear as an intermediate step in the development that is founded on set theory. First, the natural numbers (including zero) are established on an axiomatic basis such as Peano&#x27;s axiom system and then this is expanded to the ring of integers. The next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established, namely, addition, multiplication and the integers. Starting with the set of ordered pairs of integers, with , define a binary relation on this set by if and only if . This relation is shown to be an equivalence relation and its equivalence classes are then defined to be the rational numbers. It is in the formal proof that this relation is an equivalence relation that the requirement that the second coordinate is not zero is needed (for verifying transitivity).

Although division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures.

===Non-standard analysis===
In the hyperreal numbers, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero infinitesimals is possible. The same holds true in the surreal numbers.

===Distribution theory===
In distribution theory one can extend the function formula_106 to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using Cauchy principal values). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a &quot;value&quot; of this distribution at &quot;x&quot; = 0; a sophisticated answer refers to the singular support of the distribution.

===Linear algebra===
In matrix algebra, square or rectangular blocks of numbers are manipulated as though they were numbers themselves: matrices can be added and multiplied, and in some cases, a version of division also exists. Dividing by a matrix means, more precisely, multiplying by its inverse. Not all matrices have inverses. For example, a matrix containing only zeros is not invertible.

One can define a pseudo-division, by setting &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; = &quot;ab&quot;+, in which &quot;b&quot;+ represents the pseudoinverse of &quot;b&quot;. It can be proven that if &quot;b&quot;−1 exists, then &quot;b&quot;+ = &quot;b&quot;−1. If &quot;b&quot; equals 0, then b+ = 0.

===Abstract algebra===
In abstract algebra, the integers, the rational numbers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers can be abstracted to more general algebraic structures, such as a commutative ring, which is a mathematical structure where addition, subtraction, and multiplication behave as they do in the more familiar number systems, but division may not be defined. Adjoining a multiplicative inverses to a commutative ring is called localization. However, the localization of every commutative ring at zero is the trivial ring, where formula_107, so nontrivial commutative rings do not have inverses at zero, and thus division by zero is undefined for nontrivial commutative rings.

Nevertheless, any number system that forms a commutative ring can be extended to a structure called a wheel in which division by zero is always possible. However, the resulting mathematical structure is no longer a commutative ring, as multiplication no longer distributes over addition. Furthermore, in a wheel, division of an element by itself no longer results in the multiplicative identity element formula_108, and if the original system was an integral domain, the multiplication in the wheel no longer results in a cancellative semigroup.

The concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as rings and fields. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a skew field (which for this reason is called a division ring). However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring Z/6Z of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression formula_109 should be the solution &quot;x&quot; of the equation formula_110. But in the ring Z/6Z, 2 is a zero divisor. This equation has two distinct solutions, and , so the expression formula_109 is undefined.

In field theory, the expression formula_112 is only shorthand for the formal expression &quot;ab&quot;−1, where &quot;b&quot;−1 is the multiplicative inverse of &quot;b&quot;. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when &quot;b&quot; is zero. Modern texts, that define fields as a special type of ring, include the axiom for fields (or its equivalent) so that the zero ring is excluded from being a field. In the zero ring, division by zero is possible, which shows that the other field axioms are not sufficient to exclude division by zero in a field.

==Computer arithmetic==

=== Floating-point arithmetic ===

In computing, most numerical calculations are done with floating-point arithmetic, which since the 1980s has been standardized by the IEEE 754 specification. In IEEE floating-point arithmetic, numbers are represented using a sign (positive or negative), a fixed-precision significand and an integer exponent. Numbers whose exponent is too large to represent instead &quot;overflow&quot; to positive or negative infinity (+∞ or −∞), while numbers whose exponent is too small to represent instead &quot;underflow&quot; to positive or negative zero (+0 or −0). A NaN (not a number) value represents undefined results.

In IEEE arithmetic, division of 0/0 or ∞/∞ results in NaN, but otherwise division always produces a well-defined result. Dividing any non-zero number by positive zero (+0) results in an infinity of the same sign as the dividend. Dividing any non-zero number by negative zero (−0) results in an infinity of the opposite sign as the dividend. This definition preserves the sign of the result in case of arithmetic underflow.

For example, using single-precision IEEE arithmetic, if , then &quot;x&quot;/2 underflows to −0, and dividing 1 by this result produces 1/(&quot;x&quot;/2) = −∞. The exact result −2150 is too large to represent as a single-precision number, so an infinity of the same sign is used instead to indicate overflow.

=== Integer arithmetic ===
Integer division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. CPUs differ in behavior: for instance x86 processors trigger a hardware exception, while PowerPC processors silently generate an incorrect result for the division and continue, and ARM processors can either cause a hardware exception or return zero. Because of this inconsistency between platforms, the C and C++ programming languages consider the result of dividing by zero undefined behavior. In typical higher-level programming languages, such as Python, an exception is raised for attempted division by zero, which can be handled in another part of the program.

=== In proof assistants ===

Many proof assistants, such as Coq and Lean, define 1/0 = 0. This is due to the requirement that all functions are total. Such a definition does not create contradictions, as further manipulations (such as cancelling out) still require that the divisor is non-zero.

== Historical accidents ==
* On 21 September 1997, a division by zero error in the &quot;Remote Data Base Manager&quot; aboard USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; (CG-48) brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship&#x27;s propulsion system to fail.

<text>Boyacá () is one of the thirty-two departments of Colombia, and the remnant of Boyacá State, one of the original nine states of the &quot;United States of Colombia&quot;.

Boyacá is centrally located within Colombia, almost entirely within the mountains of the Eastern Cordillera to the border with Venezuela, although the western end of the department extends to the Magdalena River at the town of Puerto Boyacá. Boyacá borders to the north with the Department of Santander, to the northeast with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Norte de Santander, to the east with the departments of Arauca and Casanare. To the south, Boyacá borders the department of Cundinamarca and to the west with the Department of Antioquia covering a total area of . The capital of Boyacá is the city of Tunja.

Boyacá is known as &quot;The Land of Freedom&quot; because this region was the scene of a series of battles which led to Colombia&#x27;s independence from Spain. The first one took place on 25 July 1819 in the Pantano de Vargas and the final and decisive battle known as the Battle of Boyacá was fought on 7 August 1819 at Puente de Boyacá.

Boyacá is home to three universities: the Universidad Pedagógica y Tecnológica de Colombia (UPTC), the Universidad de Boyacá (UNIBOYACA), and the Saint Thomas Aquinas University.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Boyacá&quot; derived from the Chibcha word &quot;Bojacá&quot; which means &quot;Near the &quot;cacique&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Region of the royal mantle&quot;.

== History ==

The territory of present-day Boyaca was during the Pre-Columbian time the domain of the Muisca indigenous peoples. The Muisca under the chiefdom of the &quot;zaque&quot; of Hunza lived mainly by agriculture and mining gold and emeralds.

The first European to discover the area was the Spaniard Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada who conquered the northern Muisca living in the area led by last &quot;zaque&quot; Aquiminzaque and distributed the land in encomiendas and forced the indigenous people to work for him.

In 1539, Gonzalo Suárez Rendón, a Spanish conquistador, founded the city of Tunja and other sites where the indigenous people previously had their villages. Tunja became one of the main political and economic centers for the Spanish during the Viceroyalty of New Granada.

During the 19th century, Boyacá was battleground for numerous confrontations between the royalist and patriot armies led by Simón Bolívar during the Spanish colonies&#x27; war of independence from Spain. Two of the most decisive battles were the Battle of Boyacá and the Battle of Vargas Swamp (1819) won by the patriot forces against the royalists. In 1824 Gran Colombia created the Boyacá Department (Gran Colombia).

After the creation of the Granadine Confederation by 1858 the territory of now Boyaca became the Sovereign State of Boyacá. It was later rearranged in territory and administration and renamed as &quot;Department of Boyaca&quot; after a series of civil wars like the Colombian Civil War (1860–1862) and the Thousand Days War that struggled over a centralist or federalist system and political instability that changed to many constitutions (such as the Constitution of 1886), Boyaca finally acquired its current definition as territory.

== Geography ==

 Río Surba 

Boyacá is located in the Andean Region in central Colombia, over the Cordillera Oriental mountain range and covers a total area of 23,189 km2. It borders other Colombian departments as follows: to the north Santander and Norte de Santander, to the east Arauca and Casanare, to the south Cundinamarca and a small part of Meta, and to the west Antioquia and Caldas. It has a territorial dispute with Norte de Santander and Cundinamarca.

The department of Boyacá covers a small portion of the Middle Magdalena valley of the Magdalena River to the west, the Cordillera Oriental mountain range with altitudes of 5,380 m above sea level (Sierra Nevada del Cocuy with 25 snow peaks), flat highland plateaux, and another small portion of territory by the eastern Llanos plains. Among its most prominent geographical features are the Range of the Zorro, Serrania de las Quinchas and the Andean plateaus of Rusia, Guantivá, Pisba, Chontales and Rechiniga.

The Altiplano Cundiboyacense, shared with the department of Cundinamarca, is densely populated with numerous valleys. The southern part is the Bogotá savanna. Boyacá is subdivided into 123 municipalities.

Many rivers originate in Boyacá, the most important are the Chicamocha River and Arauca River and tributaries to other important rivers such as the Magdalena and Meta.

Boyacá also has numerous lakes which include Lake Tota, Lake Sochagota and Lake Fúquene, shared with the department of Cundinamarca, the artificial Chivor Reservoir and others.

== National parks ==

El Cocuy and Pisba National Parks are located in the northeast of Boyacá. Pisba National Park is shared with the department of Arauca. The flora and fauna sanctuary of Lake Iguaque is situated in the centre of the department. The most beautiful páramo in the world, Ocetá Páramo, is in northeast Boyacá.

=== Climate ===

The central area of the highlands has two rainy seasons; the first between April and June, and a second between October and November with an average of of rainfall per year. The rest of the year is considered to be the dry seasons with intermittent rainfall.

== Provinces and municipalities ==

There are 13 provinces and two special districts in the Boyacá Department, listed below with their 123 municipalities. The department also has 123 corregimientos, 185 police inspectorates and numerous towns and small villages spread throughout the territory.

Municipalities are also grouped into 45 notary circuits with 53 notaries public. One circuit main registry based in the capital of the department; Tunja and 13 other minor registries spread across the territory.

<doc id="185669" wikidata="Q1097775" url="?curid=185669" title="Compression artifact">
<text>A compression artifact (or artefact) is a noticeable distortion of media (including images, audio, and video) caused by the application of lossy compression. Lossy data compression involves discarding some of the media&#x27;s data so that it becomes small enough to be stored within the desired disk space or transmitted (&quot;streamed&quot;) within the available bandwidth (known as the data rate or bit rate). If the compressor cannot store enough data in the compressed version, the result is a loss of quality, or introduction of artifacts. The compression algorithm may not be intelligent enough to discriminate between distortions of little subjective importance and those objectionable to the user.

The most common digital compression artifacts are DCT blocks, caused by the discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm used in many digital media standards, such as JPEG, MP3, and MPEG video file formats. These compression artifacts appear when heavy compression is applied, and occur often in common digital media, such as DVDs, common computer file formats such as JPEG, MP3 and MPEG files, and some alternatives to the compact disc, such as Sony&#x27;s MiniDisc format. Uncompressed media (such as on Laserdiscs, Audio CDs, and WAV files) or losslessly compressed media (such as FLAC or PNG) do not suffer from compression artifacts.

The minimization of perceivable artifacts is a key goal in implementing a lossy compression algorithm. However, artifacts are occasionally &quot;intentionally&quot; produced for artistic purposes, a style known as glitch art or datamoshing.

Technically speaking, a compression artifact is a particular class of data error that is usually the consequence of quantization in lossy data compression. Where transform coding is used, it typically assumes the form of one of the basis functions of the coder&#x27;s transform space.

== Images ==

When performing block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding for quantization, as in JPEG-compressed images, several types of artifacts can appear.

* Ringing
* Contouring
* Posterizing
* Staircase noise (aliasing) along curving edges
* Blockiness in &quot;busy&quot; regions (block boundary artifacts, sometimes called (macro)blocking, quilting, or checkerboarding)

Other lossy algorithms, which use pattern matching to deduplicate similar symbols, are prone to introducing hard to detect errors in printed text. For example, the numbers &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; may get replaced. This has been observed to happen with JBIG2 in certain photocopier machines.

=== Block boundary artifacts ===
At low bit rates, any lossy block-based coding scheme introduces visible artifacts in pixel blocks and at block boundaries. These boundaries can be transform block boundaries, prediction block boundaries, or both, and may coincide with macroblock boundaries. The term &quot;macroblocking&quot; is commonly used regardless of the artifact&#x27;s cause. Other names include blocking, tiling, mosaicing, pixelating, quilting, and checkerboarding.

Block-artifacts are a result of the very principle of block transform coding. The transform (for example the discrete cosine transform) is applied to a block of pixels, and to achieve lossy compression, the transform coefficients of each block are quantized. The lower the bit rate, the more coarsely the coefficients are represented and the more coefficients are quantized to zero. Statistically, images have more low-frequency than high-frequency content, so it is the low-frequency content that remains after quantization, which results in blurry, low-resolution blocks. In the most extreme case only the DC-coefficient, that is the coefficient which represents the average color of a block, is retained, and the transform block is only a single color after reconstruction.

Because this quantization process is applied individually in each block, neighboring blocks quantize coefficients differently. This leads to discontinuities at the block boundaries. These are most visible in flat areas, where there is little detail to mask the effect.

=== Image artifact reduction ===
Various approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression effects, but to use standardized compression/decompression techniques and retain the benefits of compression (for instance, lower transmission and storage costs), many of these methods focus on &quot;post-processing&quot;—that is, processing images when received or viewed. No post-processing technique has been shown to improve image quality in all cases; consequently, none has garnered widespread acceptance, though some have been implemented and are in use in proprietary systems. Many photo editing programs, for instance, have proprietary JPEG artifact reduction algorithms built-in. Consumer equipment often calls this post-processing &quot;MPEG Noise Reduction&quot;.

Boundary artifact in JPEG can be turned into more pleasing &quot;grains&quot; not unlike those in high ISO photographic films. Instead of just multiplying the quantized coefficients with the quantisation step pertaining to the 2D-frequency, intelligent noise in the form of a random number in the interval can be added to the dequantized coefficient. This method can be added as an integral part to JPEG decompressors working on the trillions of existing and future JPEG images. As such it is not a &quot;post-processing&quot; technique.

The ringing issue can be reduced at encode time by overshooting the DCT values, clamping the rings away.

Posterization generally only happens at low quality, when the DC values are given too little importance. Tuning the quantization table helps.

== Video ==
When motion prediction is used, as in MPEG-1, MPEG-2 or MPEG-4, compression artifacts tend to remain on several generations of decompressed frames, and move with the optic flow of the image, leading to a peculiar effect, part way between a painting effect and &quot;grime&quot; that moves with objects in the scene.

Data errors in the compressed bit-stream, possibly due to transmission errors, can lead to errors similar to large quantization errors, or can disrupt the parsing of the data stream entirely for a short time, leading to &quot;break-up&quot; of the picture. Where gross errors have occurred in the bit-stream, decoders continue to apply updates to the damaged picture for a short interval, creating a &quot;ghost image&quot; effect, until receiving the next independently compressed frame. In MPEG picture coding, these are known as &quot;I-frames&quot;, with the &#x27;I&#x27; standing for &quot;intra&quot;. Until the next I-frame arrives, the decoder can perform error concealment.

=== Motion compensation block boundary artifacts ===
Block boundary discontinuities can occur at edges of motion compensation prediction blocks. In motion compensated video compression, the current picture is predicted by shifting blocks (macroblocks, partitions, or prediction units) of pixels from previously decoded frames. If two neighboring blocks use different motion vectors, there will be a discontinuity at the edge between the blocks.

=== Mosquito noise ===
Video compression artifacts include cumulative results of compression of the comprising still images, for instance ringing or other edge busyness in successive still images appear in sequence as a shimmering blur of dots around edges, called mosquito noise, as they resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object. The so-called &quot;mosquito noise&quot; is caused by the block-based discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression algorithm used in most video coding standards, such as the MPEG formats.

=== Video artifact reduction ===
The artifacts at block boundaries can be reduced by applying a deblocking filter. As in still image coding, it is possible to apply a deblocking filter to the decoder output as post-processing.

In motion-predicted video coding with a closed prediction loop, the encoder uses the decoder output as the prediction reference from which future frames are predicted. To that end, the encoder conceptually integrates a decoder. If this &quot;decoder&quot; performs a deblocking, the deblocked picture is then used as a reference picture for motion compensation, which improves coding efficiency by preventing a propagation of block artifacts across frames. This is referred to as an in-loop deblocking filter. Standards which specify an in-loop deblocking filter include VC-1, H.263 Annex J, H.264/AVC, and H.265/HEVC.

== Audio ==
Lossy audio compression typically works with a psychoacoustic model—a model of human hearing perception. Lossy audio formats typically involve the use of a time/frequency domain transform, such as a modified discrete cosine transform. With the psychoacoustic model, masking effects such as frequency masking and temporal masking are exploited, so that sounds that should be imperceptible are not recorded. For example, in general, human beings are unable to perceive a quiet tone played simultaneously with a similar but louder tone. A lossy compression technique might identify this quiet tone and attempt to remove it. Also, quantization noise can be &quot;hidden&quot; where they would be masked by more prominent sounds. With low compression, a conservative psy-model is used with small block sizes.

When the psychoacoustic model is inaccurate, when the transform block size is restrained, or when aggressive compression is used, this may result in compression artifacts. Compression artifacts in compressed audio typically show up as ringing, pre-echo, &quot;birdie artifacts&quot;, drop-outs, rattling, warbling, metallic ringing, an underwater feeling, hissing, or &quot;graininess&quot;.

An example of compression artifacts in audio is applause in a relatively highly compressed audio file (e.g. 96 kbit/sec MP3). In general, musical tones have repeating waveforms and more predictable variations in volume, whereas applause is essentially random, therefore hard to compress. A highly compressed track of applause may have &quot;metallic ringing&quot; and other compression artifacts.

== Artistic use ==
Compression artifacts may intentionally be used as a visual style, sometimes known as &quot;glitch art&quot;. Rosa Menkman&#x27;s glitch art makes use of compression artifacts, particularly the discrete cosine transform blocks (DCT blocks) found in most digital media data compression formats such as JPEG digital images and MP3 digital audio. In still images, an example is &quot;Jpegs&quot; by German photographer Thomas Ruff, which uses intentional JPEG artifacts as the basis of the picture&#x27;s style. 

In video art, one technique used is &quot;datamoshing&quot;, where two videos are interleaved so intermediate frames are interpolated from two separate sources. Another technique involves simply transcoding from one lossy video format to another, which exploits the difference in how the separate video codecs process motion and color information. The technique was pioneered by artists Bertrand Planes in collaboration with Christian Jacquemin in 2006 with DivXPrime, Sven König, Takeshi Murata, Jacques Perconte and Paul B. Davis in collaboration with Paperrad, and more recently used by David OReilly and within music videos for Chairlift and by Nabil Elderkin in the &quot;Welcome to Heartbreak&quot; music video for Kanye West.

There is also a genre of internet memes where often nonsensical images are purposefully heavily compressed sometimes multiple times for comedic effect. Images created using this technique are often referred to as &quot;deep fried.&quot;

<doc id="185674" wikidata="Q1579508" url="?curid=185674" title="Hans Florine">
<text>Hans Florine (born June 18, 1964) is an American rock climber, who holds the record for the number of ascents of Yosemite Valley&#x27;s El Capitan and is known for holding the speed record on &quot;The Nose&quot; of Yosemite’s El Capitan 8 different times. Hans&#x27; last speed record on The Nose was accomplished with Alex Honnold for climbing &quot;The Nose&quot; in 2:23:46 (2 hours, 23 minutes and 46 seconds), on June 17, 2012. In addition to climbing El Capitan over 175 times, Hans also holds the record for the number of ascents of &quot;The Nose&quot;, climbing it more than 111 times.

El Capitan is traditionally climbed in three to five days. &quot;The Nose&quot; route is and features 31 pitches of strenuous, exposed climbing. This translates to a rate of roughly 5 minutes per pitch.

Florine is well regarded in the climbing community, and pioneered many of the methods currently used in speed climbing.

==Climbing career==

Florine started climbing as a teenager in 1983, and began competing in bouldering and speed competitions by 1986 at a time when competition climbing was not popular. He found that by speed climbing in competitions he was able to earn some gear and a tiny bit of money to fund his climbing, and by climbing quickly he could simply get more climbing in.

In 1990 Hans Teamed up with Steve Schneider to Climb The Nose route in a record 8 hours and 6 minutes. Approximately one week later Dave Schultz and Peter Croft climbed The Nose in 6 hours and 40 minutes. The following Year, 1991, Hans teamed up with Andres Puhvel and they climbed The Nose in 6:01. Approximately one week later Schultz and Croft climbed The Nose in 4:48. The following year Hans met Peter Croft at a slide show and suggested they climb The Nose together, and so they did.

Hans broke &quot;The Nose&quot; speed record with Yuji Hirayama in 2002, with a time of 2:48:55. This was bested by German brothers Alexander Huber and Thomas Huber in 2007, however, Florine and Hirayama regained the record with a time of 2:43:33 just six months later. They improved again to set a time of 2:37:05 (2 hours, 37 minutes and 5 seconds), on October 12, 2008.

On July 30, 2005, Florine also completed a solo ascent of &quot;The Nose&quot; in just 11 hours and 41 minutes. Solo ascents are characterized by climbing by yourself while using a rope for protection, and require one person to do all the work.

In 2018 he broke both his legs during a training run up &quot;The Nose&quot; after a piece of protection popped out of a crack. He and his partner Abraham Shreve were rescued by Yosemite Search and Rescue the next day.

===Race against Pedro Hoffmeister===
On May 18, 2019, Florine and Pete &quot;Pedro&quot; Hoffmeister raced in a NIAD (&quot;Nose In A Day&quot; - 3000 feet of rock climbing in one day). The race was titled &quot;Super Local vs. Super Pro,&quot; and took place at The Columns, Skinner&#x27;s Butte Park, in Eugene, Oregon. Both climbers were coming back from devastating injuries. Hoffmeister had the advantage of knowing all of the routes. Florine did not know the routes. Hoffmeister won the race, climbing 3000 feet, 64 routes, in 2:05:55. Florine clocked 2:27:05.

===Notable ascents===

* &quot;The Nose&quot; of El Capitan: Former speed record with Alex Honnold, June 17, 2012. Time: 2:23:46 or 2:23:51

===Competition Climbing===
Florine has been climbing competitively since 1987. He has won 3 gold medals in X-Game speed climbing, in 1995, 1996 and 1997. He also won the US National championships at City Rock in Emeryville CA in 1990. He won two other national events in difficulty climbing, as well as 12 national titles in speed climbing. Hans won the first ever World Championships in Speed Climbing in Frankfurt Germany in 1991.

From 1991 until 1995 Hans was the Executive Director of The American Sport Climbing Federation. (ASCF) the ASCF was formed from a committee that was part of the American Alpine Club. Hans, along with Randy Hart organized and supported the first US Junior National Competition. The offshoot from that was the formation of the Junior Competitive Climbing Association, JCCA, which later eclipsed the ASCF, and effectively adopted it back in to form what later became https://usaclimbing.org/

<text>The Magnificat (Latin for &quot;[My soul] magnifies [the Lord]&quot;) is a canticle, also known as the Song of Mary or Canticle of Mary, and in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the Ode of the Theotokos (). Its Western name derives from the incipit of its Latin text. This most popular of all canticles falls within the liturgies of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church and the Anglican Communion. 

The text of the canticle is taken from the Gospel of Luke () where it is spoken by Mary upon the occasion of her Visitation to her cousin Elizabeth. In the narrative, after Mary greets Elizabeth, who is pregnant with John the Baptist, the latter moves within Elizabeth&#x27;s womb. Elizabeth praises Mary for her faith (using words partially reflected in the Hail Mary), and Mary responds with what is now known as the Magnificat. Some ancient authorities have Elizabeth, rather than Mary, speaking the Magnificat.

The Magnificat is one of the eight most ancient Christian hymns and perhaps the earliest Marian hymn. Within the whole of Christianity, the canticle is most frequently recited within the Liturgy of the Hours. In Western Christianity, the Magnificat is most often sung or recited during the main evening prayer service: Vespers in the Catholic and Lutheran churches, and Evening Prayer (or Evensong) in Anglicanism. The traditional form is found the &quot;Book of Common Prayer (1662)&quot; and in &quot;Common Worship&quot;, as well as the &quot;Book of Common Prayer (1928)&quot; and &quot;Book of Common Prayer (1979)&quot; of the Episcopal Church (United States). In Eastern Christianity, the Magnificat is always sung at Matins. The Magnificat may also be sung during worship services, especially in the Advent season during which these verses are traditionally read.

==Context==
Mary&#x27;s Magnificat, recorded only in Luke&#x27;s Gospel, is one of four hymns, distilled from a collection of early Jewish-Christian canticles, which complement the promise-fulfillment theme of Luke&#x27;s infancy narrative. These songs are Mary&#x27;s Magnificat; Zechariah&#x27;s Benedictus (1:67–79); the angels&#x27; &quot;Gloria in Excelsis Deo&quot; (2:13–14); and Simeon&#x27;s (2:28–32). In form and content, these four canticles are patterned on the &quot;hymns of praise&quot; in Israel&#x27;s Psalter. In structure, these songs reflect the compositions of pre-Christian contemporary Jewish hymnology. The first stanza displays graphically a characteristic feature of Hebrew poetry—synonymous parallelism—in ascribing praise to God: &quot;my soul&quot; mirrors &quot;my spirit&quot;; &quot;proclaims the greatness&quot; with &quot;has found gladness&quot;; &quot;of the Lord&quot; with &quot;in God my Savior.&quot; The balance of the opening two lines bursts out into a dual &quot;Magnificat&quot; of declaring the greatness of and finding delight in God. The third stanza again demonstrates parallelism, but in this instance, three contrasting parallels: the proud are reversed by the low estate, the mighty by those of low degree, and the rich by the hungry.

Although there is some scholarly discussion of whether the historical Mary herself actually proclaimed this canticle, Luke portrays her as the singer of this song of reversals and the interpreter of the contemporary events taking place. Mary symbolizes both ancient Israel and the Lucan faith-community as the author/singer of the &quot;Magnificat&quot;.

The canticle echoes several biblical passages, but the most pronounced allusions are to the Song of Hannah, from the Books of Samuel (). Scriptural echoes from the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings complement the main allusions to Hannah&#x27;s &quot;magnificat of rejoicing&quot;. Along with the &quot;Benedictus&quot;, as well as several Old Testament canticles, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is included in the Book of Odes, an ancient liturgical collection found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint.

As with other canticles and psalms, Western liturgical tradition usually adds the doxology known as Gloria Patri to the end of the Magnificat. This is not found in the original text.

==Structure==
In a style reminiscent of Old Testament poetry and song, Mary praises the Lord in alignment with this structure:

#Mary rejoices that she has the privilege of giving birth to the promised Messiah ().
#She glorifies God for His power, holiness, and mercy ().
#Mary looks forward to God transforming the world through the Messiah. The proud will be brought low, and the humble will be lifted up; the hungry will be fed, and the rich will go without ().
#Mary exalts God because He has been faithful to His promise to Abraham (; see God&#x27;s promise to Abraham in ).

===Greek===

The oldest (likely original) version of the &quot;Magnificat&quot; was written in Koine Greek.

: Μεγαλύνει ἡ ψυχή μου τὸν Κύριον καὶ ἠγαλλίασεν τὸ πνεῦμά μου ἐπὶ τῷ Θεῷ τῷ σωτῆρί μου,
: ὅτι ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ τὴν ταπείνωσιν τῆς δούλης αὐτοῦ. ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν μακαριοῦσίν με πᾶσαι αἱ γενεαί,
: ὅτι ἐποίησέν μοι μεγάλα ὁ δυνατός, καὶ ἅγιον τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὸ ἔλεος αὐτοῦ εἰς γενεὰς καὶ γενεὰς τοῖς φοβουμένοις αὐτόν.
: Ἐποίησεν κράτος ἐν βραχίονι αὐτοῦ, διεσκόρπισεν ὑπερηφάνους διανοίᾳ καρδίας αὐτῶν·
: καθεῖλεν δυνάστας ἀπὸ θρόνων καὶ ὕψωσεν ταπεινούς, πεινῶντας ἐνέπλησεν ἀγαθῶν καὶ πλουτοῦντας ἐξαπέστειλεν κενούς.
: ἀντελάβετο Ἰσραὴλ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ, μνησθῆναι ἐλέους, καθὼς ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν τῷ Αβραὰμ καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.

In Eastern Orthodox worship, the &quot;Ode of the Theotokos&quot; is accompanied by the following refrain sung between the verses (a sticheron) and a megalynarion, which is the second part of the &quot;Axion Estin&quot; hymn:
:Τὴν τιμιωτέραν τῶν Χερουβὶμ καὶ ἐνδοξοτέραν ἀσυγκρίτως τῶν Σεραφίμ, τὴν ἀδιαφθόρως Θεὸν Λόγον τεκοῦσαν, τὴν ὄντως Θεοτόκον, σὲ μεγαλύνομεν.
:(&#x27;You who are more to be honoured than the Cherubim and incomparably more glorious than the Seraphim, you who, uncorrupted, gave birth to God the Word, in reality the God-bearer, we exalt you.&#x27;)
Amharic

In the Oriental Orthodox Church Scripture of Ethiopia according to the &quot;Ye&#x27; Luqas Wongel,&quot; Gospel of Luqas (Luke):

46፤ ማርያምም እንዲህ አለች።

47፤ ነፍሴ ጌታን ታከብረዋለች፥ መንፈሴም በአምላኬ በመድኃኒቴ ሐሴት ታደርጋለች፤

48፤ የባሪያይቱን ውርደት ተመልክቶአልና። እነሆም፥ ከዛሬ ጀምሮ ትውልድ ሁሉ ብፅዕት ይሉኛል፤

49፤ ብርቱ የሆነ እርሱ በእኔ ታላቅ ሥራ አድርጎአልና፤ ስሙም ቅዱስ ነው።

50፤ ምሕረቱም ለሚፈሩት እስከ ትውልድና ትውልድ ይኖራል።

51፤ በክንዱ ኃይል አድርጎአል፤ ትዕቢተኞችን በልባቸው አሳብ በትኖአል፤

52፤ ገዥዎችን ከዙፋናቸው አዋርዶአል፤ ትሑታንንም ከፍ አድርጎአል፤

53፤ የተራቡትን በበጎ ነገር አጥግቦአል፤ ባለ ጠጎችንም ባዶአቸውን ሰዶአቸዋል።

54-55፤ ለአባቶቻችን እንደ ተናገረ፥ ለአብርሃምና ለዘሩ ለዘላለም ምሕረቱ ትዝ እያለው እስራኤልን ብላቴናውን ረድቶአል።

===Slavonic===
The translation of the hymn into Church Slavonic is as follows:

==Liturgical use==
The text forms a part of the daily office in the Catholic Vespers service, the Lutheran Vespers service, and the Anglican services of Evening Prayer, according to both the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and &quot;Common Worship&quot;. In the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; Evening Prayer service, it is usually paired with the . The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; allows for an alternative to the &quot;Magnificat&quot;—the &quot;Cantate Domino&quot;, Psalm 98—and some Anglican rubrics allow for a wider selection of canticles, but the &quot;Magnificat&quot; and remain the most popular. In Anglican, Lutheran, and Catholic services, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is generally followed by the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;. It is also commonly used among Lutherans at the Feast of the Visitation (July 2).

In Eastern Orthodox liturgical practice, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is always sung during the Matins service before the &quot;Irmos&quot; of the ninth ode of the canon (except on greater feasts of the Lord or the Theotokos, where the magnificat is excluded completely). After each biblical verse, i.e. as a sticheron, the following megalynarion or troparion is sung:

More honourable than the Cherubim, and more glorious beyond compare than the Seraphim, without corruption thou gavest birth to God the Word: true Theotokos, we magnify thee.

As a canticle, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; has frequently been set to music. Most compositions were originally intended for liturgical use, especially for Vesper services and celebrations of the Visitation, but some are also performed in concert.

==Indulgence==
In the Catholic Church, the &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; of 2004 provides for partial indulgence.

==Musical settings==

As the Magnificat is part of the sung Vespers, many composers, beginning in the Renaissance, set the words to music, for example Claudio Monteverdi in his &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; (1610). Henry Dumont, André Campra (1713), Antoine-Esprit Blanchard (1741), Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 10 settings (H.72, H.73, H.74, H.75, H.76, H.77, H.78, H.79, H.80, H.81), François Giroust (12 settings), Vivaldi composed a setting of the Latin text for soloists, choir, and orchestra, as did Johann Sebastian Bach in his Magnificat (1723, rev. 1733). Other notable examples include C.P.E. Bach&#x27;s Magnificat and two extant settings by Jan Dismas Zelenka (ZWV 106 is missing).

Anton Bruckner composed a Magnificat for soloists, choir, orchestra, and organ. Rachmaninoff and, more recently, John Rutter also composed a setting, inserting additions into the text.

Dieter Schnebel wrote a Magnificat in 1996/97 for small choir (schola), percussion and additional instruments ad libitum. Arvo Pärt composed a setting for choir a cappella. Kim André Arnesen&#x27;s Magnificat for choir, strings, piano, and organ premiered in 2010. The Taizé Community have also composed an ostinato setting of the text.

Together with the , the Magnificat is a regular part of the Anglican Evensong. The &quot;Mag and Nunc&quot; has been set by many composers – such as Thomas Tallis, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Herbert Sumsion, Charles Wood and John Tavener – of Anglican church music, often for choir a cappella or choir and organ. Since the canticles are sung every day at some cathedrals, Charles Villiers Stanford wrote a Magnificat in every major key, and Herbert Howells published 18 settings over his career, including the &quot;Collegium Regale&quot; setting and the &quot;Magnificat and Nunc dimittis&quot; for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

An Eastern Orthodox setting of the Magnificat (text in Latin and English) is to be found in the 2011 &quot;All-night Vigil&quot; (Section 11) by the English composer Clive Strutt.

Maria Luise Thurmair wrote in 1954 the lyrics for a popular German ecumenical hymn based on the Magnificat, &quot;Den Herren will ich loben&quot;, set to a 1613 melody by Melchior Teschner (that of Valet will ich dir geben). Timothy Dudley-Smith wrote &quot;Tell Out, My Soul&quot;, a popular paraphrase of the Magnificat, in 1962. Krzysztof Penderecki composed an extended Magnificat for the 1200th anniversary of the Salzburg Cathedral in 1974, for bass soloist, men&#x27;s and boys&#x27; voices, two mixed choirs and orchestra.

The oratorio &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot; composed in 2016 by Peter Reulein on a libretto by Helmut Schlegel includes the full Latin text of the Magnificat, expanded by writings of Clare of Assisi, Francis of Assisi and Pope Francis.

==Society and politics==
In Nicaragua, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is a favorite prayer among many peasants and is often carried as a sacramental. During the Somoza years, &quot;campesinos&quot; were required to carry proof of having voted for Somoza; this document was mockingly referred to as a &quot;Magnificat&quot;.

During the British Raj, Anglican Archbishop William Temple joked to evangelist Jack Winslow, who was sympathetic to Indian independence, that singing the Magnificat would make him look even more like a revolutionary than wearing home-spun Indian clothing already did.

<doc id="185684" wikidata="Q181469" url="?curid=185684" title="Galleon">
<text>Galleons were large, multi-decked sailing ships developed in Spain and Portugal and first used as armed cargo carriers by Europeans from the 16th to 18th centuries during the Age of Sail and were the principal vessels drafted for use as warships until the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the mid-17th century. Galleons generally carried three or more masts with a lateen fore-and-aft rig on the rear masts, were carvel built with a prominent squared off raised stern, and used square-rigged sail plans on their fore-mast and main-masts.

Such ships played a major role in commerce in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and were often drafted into use as auxiliary naval war vessels—indeed, they were the mainstay of contending fleets through most of the 150 years of the Age of Exploration—before the Anglo-Dutch wars made purpose-built warships dominant at sea during the remainder of the Age of Sail.

==Terminology==
The word galleon has had differing meanings at different points in its history and in different regions. The term is thought to originate from &quot;gallioni&quot; (alternatively &quot;galeanni&quot;), Venetian oared vessels that were used in rivers in the fifteenth century. The galleons of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were fully developed sailing ships. This descriptive name was used notably in Spain, Portugal and Venice. However, inconsistency can be found, for example, in the use of &quot;galleon&quot; by the notaries who worked in the Basque shipbuilding region of northern Spain. Though most of the ships from this region were &quot;naos&quot;, some were &quot;galeones&quot;, but the two terms can be found being used as if they were interchangeable by some of the writers of the documents in the contemporary archives. 

It is thought that the seamen of the Basque country of northern Spain were clear on the differences between a &quot;nao&quot; and a &quot;galeón&quot;, but what those distinguishing features were is not apparent to modern historians. A hypothesis has been put forward that the differences are more in the underwater hull shapesomething which cannot be discerned in contemporary illustrations.

The terminological inconsistency of Basque-built ships continues into the present day. Archival research on the Red Bay wreck 24M has identified, with reasonable confidence, this ship to have been &quot;San Juan&quot; of Pasajes. She is described 26 times in six different contemporary documents with at least three different authors as a &quot;nao&quot;, and not once as a &quot;galeón&quot;. However, published archaeological work repeatedly refers to this ship as a galleon.

Outside of the Iberian peninsula, the term &quot;galleon&quot; was not often used. For instance, though English shipwrights certainly built galleon-type vessels, they simply referred to them as &quot;ships&quot;. In present-day usage, these types are referred to as galleons, with the term &quot;race-built galleon&quot; being applied to those with lower upper-works. In Holland, a &quot;pinnas&quot; was a galleon-type ship and in the Baltic, &quot;kravel&quot; was used (a term connected with their carvel construction).

==History==

During the 16th century, a lowering of the carrack&#x27;s forecastle and elongation of the hull gave the ocean-going ships an unprecedented level of stability in the water, and reduced wind resistance at the front, leading to a faster, more maneuverable vessel. The galleon differed from the carrack and other older types primarily by being longer, lower and narrower, with a square tuck stern instead of a round tuck, and by having a snout or head projecting forward from the bows below the level of the forecastle. While carracks could be very large for the time, with some Portuguese carracks over 1,000 tons, galleons were generally smaller, usually under 500 tons although some Manila galleons were to reach a displacement of 2,000 tons. With the introduction of the galleon in Portuguese India Armadas during the first quarter of the 16th century, carracks&#x27; armament was reduced as they became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why the Portuguese carracks were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the &quot;São João Baptista&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Botafogo&quot;, &quot;Spitfire&quot;), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns. Friar Manuel Homem says that this galleon mounted 366 bronze pieces of artillery, including the ones that garrisoned the high castles of stern and bow. 

Carracks were usually lightly armed and used for transporting cargo in all the fleets of other Western European states, while galleons were stronger, more heavily armed, and also cheaper to build for the same displacement (five galleons could cost around the same as three carracks) and were therefore a much better investment for use as heavily armed cargo ships or warships. Galleons&#x27; design changed and improved through the application of various innovations, and they were particularly linked with the military capabilities of the Atlantic sea powers. It was the captains of the Spanish navy, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and Álvaro de Bazán, who designed the definitive long and relatively narrow hulled galleon in the 1550s. 

The galleon was powered entirely by wind, using sails carried on three or four masts, with a lateen sail continuing to be used on the last (usually third and fourth) masts. They were used in both military and trade applications, most famously in the Spanish treasure fleet, and the Manila galleons. While carracks played the leading role in early global explorations, galleons also played a part in the 16th and 17th centuries. In fact, galleons were so versatile that a single vessel might be refitted for wartime and peacetime roles several times during its lifespan. The galleon was the prototype of all square-rigged ships with three or more masts for over two and a half centuries, including the later full-rigged ship.

The principal warships of the opposing English and Spanish fleets in the 1588 confrontation of the Spanish Armada and in the 1589 confrontation of the English Armada were galleons, with the modified English race-built galleons developed by John Hawkins proving their great utility in combat, while the capacious Spanish galleons, designed primarily as transports, showed great endurance in the battles and in the long and stormy return home.

==Construction==


Galleons were constructed from oak (for the keel), pine (for the masts) and various hardwoods for hull and decking. Hulls were usually carvel-built. The expenses involved in galleon construction were enormous. Hundreds of expert tradesmen (including carpenters, pitch-melters, blacksmiths, coopers, shipwrights, etc.) worked for months before a galleon was seaworthy. To cover the expense, galleons were often funded by groups of wealthy businessmen who pooled resources for a new ship. Therefore, most galleons were originally consigned for trade, although those captured by rival states were usually put into military service.

The most common gun used aboard a galleon was the demi-culverin, although gun sizes up to demi-cannon were possible.

Because of the long periods often spent at sea and poor conditions on board, many of the crew often perished during the voyage; therefore advanced rigging systems were developed so that the vessel could be sailed home by an active sailing crew a fraction of the size aboard at departure.

==Distinguishing features==


The most distinguishing features of the galleon include the long, prominent beak or beakhead followed by a foremast and mainmast, both noticeably taller than the single or double lateen-rigged mizzenmasts with their sloped lateen-rig yards, and below those the square quarter gallery at the stern. On average with three masts, in larger galleons, a fourth mast was added, usually another lateen-rigged mizzen, called the bonaventure mizzen.

==The oldest English drawings==

The oldest known scale drawings in England are in a manuscript called &quot;Fragments of Ancient Shipwrightry&quot; made in about 1586 by Mathew Baker, a master shipwright. This manuscript, held at the Pepysian Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge, provides an authentic reference for the size and shape of typical English galleons built during this period. Based on these plans, the Science Museum, London has built a 1:48 scale model ship that is an exemplar of galleons of this era.

==Notable galleons==

* &quot;Adler von Lübeck&quot;, the largest ship of its day when launched in 1566.
* &quot;Dainty&quot;, ship with which Sir Richard Hawkins sought to emulate the circumnavigation voyage of his cousin Francis Drake. She was captured by the Spanish in the action of Atacames Bay in 1594 and served in the Spanish Navy in the South American Pacific for several years.
* &quot;Revenge&quot;, a galleon built in 1577, the flagship of Sir Francis Drake in the Battle of the Spanish Armada in 1588, was captured by a Spanish fleet off Flores in the Azores in 1591 and sank while being sailed back to Spain.
* &quot;Triumph&quot;, the largest Elizabethan galleon; flagship of Sir Martin Frobisher in the Battle of the Spanish Armada.
* &quot;Galeon Adalucia&quot;, a replica galleon built in Spain in 2014.
* &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, the ship in which Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe 1577–1580.
* &quot;La Galga&quot;, the Assateague Spanish galleon that was shipwrecked in 1794; according to legend, the ancestors of the now famous Chincoteague ponies swam ashore from its hold.
* &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Concepción&quot;, a Spanish galleon, known to her crew as &quot;Cacafuego&quot; for her strong cannon. She was captured by Sir Francis Drake in 1578 and all her treasures were brought to England. She was holding treasures mined in one year by the Spanish in the Americas.
* &quot;Padre Eterno&quot;, a Portuguese galleon launched in 1663. She was considered to be the biggest ship of her time, carrying 144 pieces of artillery with a displacement up to 2,000 tons.
* &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; (originally called Date Maru, 伊達丸 in Japanese). She crossed the Pacific Ocean from Japan to New Spain in 1614. She was of the Spanish galleon type, known in Japan as Nanban-Sen (南蛮船).
* &quot;San Salvador&quot;, flagship vessel in Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo&#x27;s 1542 exploration of present-day California in the United States.
* &quot;Santa Luzia&quot;, a Portuguese galleon known for defeating a Dutch squadron single-handedly twice in 1650.
* &quot;Santa Teresa&quot;, a Portuguese galleon, the flagship of Admiral Lope de Hoces at the Battle of the Downs, in 1639.
* &quot;São João Baptista&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Botafogo&quot;, the most powerful warship in the world at the time when launched (1534) by the Portuguese; became famous during the Conquest of Tunis (1535), where it was commanded by Luís of Portugal, Duke of Beja.
* &quot;São Martinho&quot;, a Portuguese galleon, the flagship of Duke of Medina Sidonia, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armada.
* &quot;Vasa&quot;, the only original galleon to be preserved. She sank in 1628 and was raised in 1961 for preservation as a museum ship.
* &quot;Ark Raleigh&quot; was designed and built by Sir Walter Raleigh. She was later chosen by Lord Howard, admiral of the fleet to be the flagship of the English fleet in the fight against the Spanish Armada in 1588 and was summarily renamed &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.
* &quot;San Pelayo&quot;, the large 906-ton galleon, which served as the flagship of Pedro Menéndez de Avilés during his expedition to establish St. Augustine, Florida in 1565. The vessel was so large it could not enter St. Augustine&#x27;s harbor, so Menendez ordered it offloaded and sent it back to Hispaniola. At a later date her crew mutinied and sailed to Europe where the ship wrecked off the coast of Denmark.
* The Manila galleons, Spanish trading ships that sailed once or twice per year across the Pacific Ocean between Manila in the Philippines and Acapulco in New Spain (now Mexico); (1565–1815).

<doc id="185689" wikidata="Q1850311" url="?curid=185689" title="Sunday roast">
<text>A Sunday roast or roast dinner is a British dish, traditionally consumed on Sunday. It consists of roasted meat, roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes, and accompaniments such as Yorkshire pudding, stuffing, gravy, and may include condiments such as apple sauce, mint sauce, redcurrant sauce, mustard, cranberry or Horseradish sauce. A range of vegetables can be served, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, parsnips, or peas, which can be boiled, steamed, or roasted alongside the meat and potatoes. 

The Sunday roast&#x27;s prominence in British culture is such that in a UK poll in 2012 it was ranked second in a list of things people love about Britain. Other names for this meal include &quot;Sunday lunch&quot;, &quot;Sunday dinner&quot;, &quot;roast dinner,&quot; and &quot;full roast&quot;. The meal is often described as a less grand version of a traditional Christmas dinner.

Besides being served in its original homelands, the tradition of a Sunday roast lunch or dinner has been a major influence on food cultures in the English-speaking world, particularly in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand. A South African Sunday roast normally comprises roast pork, beef, lamb or chicken, roast potatoes or mashed potatoes, and various vegetables like cauliflower-broccoli cheese, creamed spinach, green beans, carrots, peas, beetroot, and sweet potato. It is also fairly common to serve rice and gravy or pap and tomato gravy in South Africa instead of Yorkshire pudding.

==Origin==
The Sunday roast originated in the British Isles, particularly Yorkshire, as a meal to be eaten after the church service on Sunday. Eating a large meal following church services is common to most of Europe, but the Sunday roast variant developed unique to the British Isles. On Sundays, all types of meat and dairy produce are allowed to be eaten; this is unlike Fridays, where many Christians of the Roman Catholic, Anglican and Methodist denominations traditionally abstain from eating meats and instead eat fish. Likewise, it is traditional for Anglicans and English Catholics to fast before Sunday services, with a larger meal to break the fast afterwards. These Christian religious rules created several traditional dishes in the United Kingdom.
* Only eating fish on Friday resulted in a British tradition of &#x27;fish Fridays&#x27;, which is still common in fish and chip shops and restaurants across the United Kingdom on Fridays; particularly during Lent.
* To mark the end of not being able to eat meat, the Sunday roast was created as a mark of celebration.

There are two historical points on the origins of the modern Sunday roast. 

* In the late 1700s, during the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom, families would place a cut of meat into the oven as they got ready for church. They would then add in vegetables such as potatoes, turnips and parsnips before going to church on a Sunday morning. When they returned from the church, the dinner was all but ready. The juices from the meat and vegetables were used to make a stock or gravy to pour on top of the dinner.

* The second opinion holds that the Sunday roast dates back to medieval times, when the village serfs served the squire for six days a week. Then, on the Sunday, after the morning church service, serfs would assemble in a field and practise their battle techniques and were rewarded with a feast of oxen roasted on a spit.

==Typical elements==

===Meat===

Typical meats used for a Sunday roast are chicken, lamb, pork, or roast beef, although seasonally duck, goose, gammon, turkey, or (rarely) other game birds may be used.

===Vegetables===
Sunday roasts can be served with a range of boiled, steamed and/or roasted vegetables. The vegetables served vary seasonally and regionally, but will usually include roast potatoes, roasted in meat dripping or vegetable oil, and also gravy made from juices released by the roasting meat, perhaps supplemented by one or more stock cubes, gravy browning/thickening, roux or corn flour.

The potatoes can be cooked around the meat itself, absorbing the juices and fat directly (as in a traditional Cornish under-roast). However, many cooks prefer to cook the potatoes and the Yorkshire pudding in a hotter oven than that used for the joint and so remove the meat beforehand to rest and &quot;settle&quot; in a warm place.

Other vegetables served with roast dinner can include mashed swede or turnips, roast parsnips, boiled or steamed cabbage, broccoli, green beans, and boiled carrots and peas. It is also not uncommon for vegetable dishes—such as cauliflower cheese and stewed red cabbage to be served alongside the more usual assortment of plainly-cooked seasonal vegetables.

===Accompaniments===
Common traditional accompaniments include:

* &quot;beef&quot;: Yorkshire pudding, suet pudding; English mustard, gravy sauce or horseradish sauce. Roast beef with Yorkshire pudding accompanied by &quot;roast potatoes, vegetables, and horseradish sauce&quot; is considered by &quot;National Geographic&quot; as the national dish of England.
* &quot;pork&quot;: crackling and sage-and-onion stuffing; apple sauce or English mustard.
* &quot;lamb&quot;: mint sauce or jelly or redcurrant jelly.
* &quot;chicken&quot;: sausages or sausage meat, stuffing, bread sauce, apple sauce, cranberry sauce or redcurrant jelly.

<doc id="185691" wikidata="Q154792" url="?curid=185691" title="Orlando di Lasso">
<text>Orlando di Lasso (various other names; probably – 14 June 1594) was a composer of the late Renaissance. The chief representative of the mature polyphonic style in the Franco-Flemish school, Lassus stands with William Byrd, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and Tomás Luis de Victoria as one of the leading composers of the later Renaissance. Immensely prolific, his music varies considerably in style and genres, which gave him unprecedented popularity throughout Europe.

==Name==
Lasso&#x27;s name appears in many forms, often changed depending on the place in which his music was being performed or published. In addition to Orlando di Lasso, variations include Orlande de Lassus, Roland de Lassus, Orlandus Lassus, Orlande de Lattre and Roland de Lattre.

Since these various spellings or translations of the same name have been known and accepted for centuries, and since there is no evidence that he stated a preference, none of them can be considered incorrect.

== Life and career==

Orlando de Lasso was born in Mons in the County of Hainaut, Habsburg Netherlands (modern-day Belgium). Information about his early years is scanty, although some uncorroborated stories have survived, the most famous of which is that he was kidnapped three times because of the singular beauty of his singing voice. At the age of twelve, he left the Low Countries with Ferrante Gonzaga and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l&#x27;Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style.

He then worked as a singer and a composer for Costantino Castrioto in Naples in the early 1550s, and his first works are presumed to date from this time. Next he moved to Rome, where he worked for Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who maintained a household there, and in 1553, he became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, the ecumenical mother church of Rome and a spectacularly prestigious post indeed for a man only twenty-one years old. However, he stayed there for only a year. (Palestrina would assume this post a year later, in 1555.)

No solid evidence survives for his whereabouts in 1554, but there are contemporary claims that he traveled in France and England. In 1555 he returned to the Low Countries and had his early works published in Antwerp (1555–1556). In 1556 he joined the court of Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria, who was consciously attempting to create a musical establishment on a par with the major courts in Italy. Lasso was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He evidently was happy in Munich and decided to settle there. In 1558 he married Regina Wäckinger, the daughter of a maid of honor of the Duchess. They had two sons, both of whom became composers, and his daughter married the painter Hans von Aachen. By 1563 Lasso had been appointed &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;, succeeding Ludwig Daser in the post. Lasso remained in the service of Albrecht V and his heir, Wilhelm V, for the rest of his life.

By the 1560s Lasso had become quite famous, and composers began to go to Munich to study with him. Andrea Gabrieli went there in 1562, and possibly remained in the chapel for a year. Giovanni Gabrieli also possibly studied with him in the 1570s. His renown had spread outside strictly musical circles, for in 1570 Emperor Maximilian II conferred nobility upon him, a rare circumstance for a composer. Pope Gregory XIII knighted him and in 1571, and again in 1573, the king of France, Charles IX, invited him to visit. Some of these kings and aristocrats attempted to woo him away from Munich with more attractive offers, but Lasso was evidently more interested in the stability of his position, and the splendid performance opportunities of Albrecht&#x27;s court, than in financial gain. &quot;I do not want to leave my house, my garden, and the other good things in Munich&quot;, he wrote to the Duke of Electorate of Saxony in 1580, upon receiving an offer for a position in Dresden.

In the late 1570s and 1580s Lasso made several visits to Italy, where he encountered the most modern styles and trends. In Ferrara, the center of avant-garde activity, he doubtless heard the madrigals being composed for the d&#x27;Este court. However, his own style remained conservative and became simpler and more refined as he aged. In the 1590s his health began to decline, and he went to a doctor named Thomas Mermann for treatment of what was called &quot;melancholia hypocondriaca&quot;, but he was still able to compose as well as travel occasionally. His final work was often considered one of his best pieces: an exquisite set of twenty-one &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot; known as the &quot;Lagrime di San Pietro&quot; (&quot;Tears of St. Peter&quot;), which he dedicated to Pope Clement VIII, and which was published posthumously in 1595. Lasso died in Munich on 14 June 1594, the same day that his employer decided to dismiss him for economic reasons. He never saw the letter. He was buried in Munich in the Alter Franziskaner Friedhof, a cemetery that was cleared of gravestones in 1789 and is now the site of Max-Joseph-Platz.

== Music and influence ==

One of the most prolific, versatile, and universal composers of the late Renaissance, Lasso wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 motets, 175 Italian madrigals and villanellas, 150 French chansons, and 90 German lieder. No strictly instrumental music by Lasso is known to survive, or ever to have existed: an interesting omission for a composer otherwise so wide-ranging and prolific, during an age when instrumental music was becoming an ever-more prominent means of expression, all over Europe. The German music publisher Adam Berg dedicated 5 volumes of his &quot;Patrocinium musicum&quot; (published from 1573–1580) to Lasso&#x27;s music.

=== Sacred music ===
Lasso remained Catholic during this age of religious discord, though this neither hindered him in writing worldly secular songs nor in employing music originally to racy texts in his Magnificats and masses employing parody technique. Nevertheless, the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which under Jesuit influence was reaching a peak in Bavaria in the late sixteenth century, had a demonstrable impact on Lasso&#x27;s late work, including the liturgical music for the Roman Rite, the burgeoning number of Magnificats, the settings of the Catholic Ulenberg Psalter (1588), and especially the great penitential cycle of spiritual madrigals, the Lagrime di San Pietro (1594).

==== Masses ====
Almost 60 masses have survived complete; most of them are parody masses using as melodic source material secular works written by himself or other composers. Technically impressive, they are nevertheless the most conservative part of his output. He usually conformed the style of the mass to the style of the source material, which ranged from Gregorian chant to contemporary madrigals, but always maintained an expressive and reverent character in the final product.

Several of his masses are based on extremely secular French chansons; some of the source materials were outright obscene. &quot;Entre vous filles de quinze ans&quot;, &quot;Oh you fifteen-year old girls&quot;, by Jacob Clemens non Papa, gave him source material for his 1581 &quot;Missa entre vous filles&quot;, probably the most scandalous of the lot. This practice was not only accepted but encouraged by his employer, which can be confirmed by evidence from their correspondence, much of which has survived.

In addition to his traditional imitation masses, he wrote a considerable quantity of &quot;missae breves&quot;, &quot;brief masses&quot;, syllabic short masses meant for brief services (for example, on days when Duke Albrecht went hunting: evidently he did not want to be detained by long-winded polyphonic music). The most extreme of these is a work actually known as the &quot;Jäger Mass&quot; (&quot;Missa venatorum&quot;)—the &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Mass&quot;.

Some of his masses show influence from the Venetian School, particularly in their use of polychoral techniques (for example, in the eight-voice &quot;Missa osculetur me&quot;, based on his own motet). Three of his masses are for double choir, and they may have been influential on the Venetians themselves; after all, Andrea Gabrieli visited Lasso in Munich in 1562, and many of Lasso&#x27;s works were published in Venice. Even though Lasso used the contemporary, sonorous Venetian style, his harmonic language remained conservative in these works: he adapted the texture of the Venetians to his own artistic ends.

==== Motets and other sacred music ====
Lasso is one of the composers of a style known as &quot;musica reservata&quot;—a term which has survived in many contemporary references, many of them seemingly contradictory. The exact meaning of the term is a matter of fierce debate, though a rough consensus among musicologists is that it involves intensely expressive setting of text and chromaticism, and that it may have referred to music specifically written for connoisseurs. A famous composition by Lasso representative of this style is his series of 12 motets entitled &quot;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&quot;, in a wildly chromatic idiom which anticipates the work of Gesualdo; some of the chord progressions in this piece were not to be heard again until the 20th century.

Lasso wrote four settings of the Passion, one for each of the Evangelists, St. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. All are for &quot;a cappella&quot; voices. He sets the words of Christ and the narration of the Evangelist as chant, while setting the passages for groups polyphonically.

As a composer of motets, Lasso was one of the most diverse and prodigious of the entire Renaissance. His output varies from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he showed a sense of humor not often associated with sacred music: for example, one of his motets satirizes poor singers (his setting of &quot;Super flumina Babylonis&quot;, for five voices) which includes stuttering, stopping and starting, and general confusion; it is related in concept if not in style to Mozart&#x27;s &quot;A Musical Joke&quot;. Many of his motets were composed for ceremonial occasions, as could be expected of a court composer who was required to provide music for visits of dignitaries, weddings, treaties and other events of state. But it was as a composer of religious motets that Lasso achieved his widest and most lasting fame.

Lasso&#x27;s 1584 setting of the seven Penitential Psalms of David (), ordered by King Charles IX of France, is one of the most famous collections of psalm settings of the entire Renaissance. According to George T. Ferris, it was claimed by some that he ordered them as an expiation of his soul after the massacre of St. Bartholomew of the Huguenots. The counterpoint is free, avoiding the pervasive imitation of the Netherlanders such as Gombert, and occasionally using expressive devices foreign to Palestrina. As elsewhere, Lasso strives for emotional impact, and uses a variety of texture and care in text-setting towards that end. The penultimate piece in the collection, his setting of the &quot;De profundis&quot; (Psalm 129/130), is considered by many scholars to be one of the high-water marks of Renaissance polyphony, ranking alongside the two settings of the same text by Josquin des Prez.

Among his other liturgical compositions are hymns, canticles (including over 100 Magnificats), responsories for Holy Week, Passions, Lamentations, and some independent pieces for major feasts.

=== Secular music ===
Lasso wrote in all the prominent secular forms of the time. In the preface to his collection of German songs, Lasso lists his secular works: Italian madrigals and French chansons, German and Dutch songs. He is probably the only Renaissance composer to write prolifically in five languages – Latin in addition to those mentioned above – and he wrote with equal fluency in each. Many of his songs became hugely popular, circulating widely in Europe. In these various secular songs, he conforms to the manner of the country of origin while still showing his characteristic originality, wit, and terseness of statement.

==== Madrigals ====
In his madrigals, many of which he wrote during his stay in Rome, his style is clear and concise, and he wrote tunes which were easily memorable; he also &quot;signed&quot; his work by frequently using the word &#x27;lasso&#x27; (and often setting with the solfège syllables la-sol, i.e. A-G in the key of C). His choice of poetry varied widely, from Petrarch for his more serious work to the lightest verse for some of his amusing canzonettas.

Lasso often preferred cyclic madrigals, i.e. settings of multiple poems in a group as a set of related pieces of music. For example, his fourth book of madrigals for five voices begins with a complete sestina by Petrarch, continues with two-part sonnets, and concludes with another sestina: therefore the entire book can be heard as a unified composition with each madrigal a subsidiary part.

==== Chansons ====
Another form which Lasso cultivated was the French chanson, of which he wrote about 150. Most of them date from the 1550s, but he continued to write them even when he was in Germany: his last productions in this genre come from the 1580s. They were enormously popular in Europe, and of all his works, they were the most widely arranged for instruments such as lute and keyboard. Most were collected in the 1570s and 1580s in three publications: one by Petrus Phalesius the Elder in 1571, and two by Le Roy and Ballard in 1576 and 1584. Stylistically, they ranged from the dignified and serious, to playful, bawdy, and amorous compositions, as well as drinking songs suited to taverns. Lasso followed the polished, lyrical style of Sermisy rather than the programmatic style of Clément Janequin for his writing.

One of the most famous of Lasso&#x27;s drinking songs was used by Shakespeare in Henry IV, Part II. English words are fitted to (as &quot;Monsieur Mingo&quot;) and sung by the drunken Justice Silence, in Act V, Scene iii.

==== German lieder ====
A third type of secular composition by Lasso was the German Lied. Most of these he evidently intended for a different audience, since they are considerably different in tone and style from either the chansons or madrigals; in addition, he wrote them later in life, with none appearing until 1567, when he was already well-established at Munich. Many are on religious subjects, although light and comic verse is represented as well. He also wrote drinking songs in German, and contrasting with his parallel work in the genre of the chanson, he also wrote songs on the unfortunate aspects of overindulgence.
==== Dutch songs ====
In the preface to his collection of German songs, Lasso states that he had composed Dutch songs. However, no Dutch song has been preserved.

<text>Civil religion, also referred to as a civic religion, is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public rituals, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion. Countries described as having a civil religion include France and the United States. As a concept, it originated in French political thought and became a major topic for U.S. sociologists since its use by Robert Bellah in 1960. 

==Origin of term==
Jean-Jacques Rousseau coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the state by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, Rousseau outlines the simple dogmas of the civil religion:
# deity
# afterlife
# the reward of virtue and the punishment of vice
# the exclusion of religious intolerance
The Italian historian Emilio Gentile has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a political religion.

==Sociology of religion==

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by leaders within that society. It is somewhat less than an establishment of religion, since established churches have official clergy and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:
*the invocation of God(s) in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of religious texts on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation&#x27;s wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*founding myths and other national myths
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term civil religion or civic religion to refer to ritual expressions of patriotism of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain patriotic holidays;
*reciting oaths of allegiance (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the United States, Bahamas, the Philippines, and South Korea);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified mythologized tales of national founders and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also romantic nationalism);
*monuments commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of reverence for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group, the national constitution, or the monarch or head of state;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of civil religion substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch&#x27;s coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying &quot;I do solemnly swear...&quot; (customarily followed by &quot;so help me God&quot;, although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying &quot;I do solemnly affirm...&quot; (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the Pharaoh or the Chinese Emperor were considered manifestations of a Divinity. Tribal world-view was often Pantheistic, the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian polis was a secular polytheism focused on the Olympian Gods and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian Ecclesia deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that Socrates worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor Augustus officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical paganism. Greek and Roman religion were essentially local in character; the Roman Empire attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a syncretistic identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman pantheon. In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the &quot;Ara Pacis&quot;, the Altar of Peace, showing the Emperor and his family worshiping the gods. He also encouraged the publication of works such as Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Æneid&quot;, which depicted &quot;pious Æneas&quot;, the legendary ancestor of Rome, as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as Livy told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the Imperial cult, the worship of the &quot;genius&quot; of the Emperor.

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase &quot;civil religion&quot; was first discussed extensively by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his 1762 treatise &quot;The Social Contract&quot;. Rousseau defined &quot;civil religion&quot; as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which virtue is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in religious tolerance. He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries. Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals&#x27; religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments. For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue. Some scholars critiqued and accused Rousseau&#x27;s civil religion of inspiring figurative &quot;self worship&quot; amongst citizenry.

Wallace studies Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.

==Examples==
===Australia===
Writing in 1965 on the fiftieth anniversary of the 1915 Landing at Anzac Cove, Australian historian Geoffrey Serle noted: &quot;Two generations of Australians have had it drummed in from rostrum and pulpit that we became a nation on 25 April 1915 or at least during the First World War.&quot; This date is now commemorated as Anzac Day.

Michael Gladwin has argued that for Australians Anzac Day &quot;functions as a kind of alternative religion, or &#x27;civil religion&#x27;, with its own sense of the mystical, transcendent and divine&quot;, while Carolyn Holbrook has observed that after 1990 Anzac Day commemoration was &quot;repackaged&quot; as a protean &quot;story of national genesis&quot; that could flexibly accommodate a wide spectrum of Australians. According to Gladwin, &quot;The emphasis of Anzac Day is no longer on military skills but rather values of unpretentious courage, endurance, sacrifice in the midst of suffering, and mateship. Anzac Day provides universally recognised symbols and rituals to enshrine transcendent elements of Australia&#x27;s historical experience, making it a quasi-religion, or at least a &#x27;civil religion&#x27;.&quot;

===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France&#x27;s case, Baylac argues, the French government
===Soviet Union===

The Soviet Union made Marxism–Leninism into a civil religion, with sacred texts and many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars. The Lenin icons were put into storage when communism fell in 1991. The Stalin statues had been removed in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under Vladimir Putin in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful. For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray &quot;the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country&#x27;s rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies.&quot;

===United States===

Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of nationalism. Sociologists report that its &quot;feast days&quot; are Thanksgiving, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans. The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies &quot;a modern cult of the dead&quot; and says that it &quot;affirms the civil religious tenets&quot;.

====American Revolution====

The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational American civil religion that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation&#x27;s birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge, Bunker Hill), rituals (Boston Tea Party), emblems (the new flag), sacred holidays (July 4) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights).

Although God is not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States of America, mention is specifically made of &quot;Nature&#x27;s God&quot; in the opening sentence of the Declaration of Independence.

====Historiography====

In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as Robert N. Bellah and Martin E. Marty studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of cultural anthropology. Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of &quot;religion in general&quot; without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish &quot;priestly&quot; and &quot;prophetic&quot; roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the &quot;public theology&quot;. In the 1967 essay &quot;Civil Religion in America&quot;, Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is &quot;an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation&quot;. Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging &quot;national self-worship&quot; and calling for &quot;the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged&quot;. Bellah identified the American Revolution, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist Robert Bellah. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America&#x27;s unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God&#x27;s will on earth. George Washington was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the Founding Fathers have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through Memorial Day rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.

===Asia===
India and China have civil religions.

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of &quot;Judeo-Christian ethics&quot;, a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.

Some scholars have argued that the American flag can be seen as a main totem of a national cult, while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion. Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the &quot;political religion&quot; of each American.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1988 was the 33rd edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 30 April 1988 in the RDS Simmonscourt Pavilion in Dublin, Ireland and presented by Pat Kenny and Michelle Rocca. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ), the contest was held in Ireland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Hold Me Now&quot; by Johnny Logan.

Twenty-two countries submitted entries to participate, however ultimately rescinded its entry after its selected song was determined to have been performed several years&#x27; prior to the contest, breaking the contest rules. The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Atilla Şereftuğ, written by Nella Martinetti and performed by Céline Dion. It was Switzerland&#x27;s second contest win, and remains the last winning song to be performed in French. The , , and rounded out the top five positions, with the UK achieving its eleventh runner-up placing, while placed last for the sixth time, receiving &quot;nul points&quot; for the second time.

==Location==

The 1988 contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;, performed by Johnny Logan. It was the third time that Ireland had hosted the contest, following the and events also held in Dublin.

The selected venue was the Simmonscourt Pavilion of the Royal Dublin Society, a multi-purpose venue situated in the Ballsbridge area of the city, which had previously hosted the 1981 contest. Space for approximately 1,500 people in the audience was expected following construction of the stage and other technical aspects.

==Participating countries==

The same twenty-two countries which had participated the submitted entries for the 1988 contest, with the draw to determine the running order of the 1988 contest held on 11 December 1987. However, a number of weeks before the event, it was discovered that the song selected to represent , &quot;, written by John Vickers and Aristos Moschovakis and sung by Yiannis Dimitrou, had previously competed in the under the title &quot;, and was therefore ineligible to compete at Eurovision. The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) subsequently announced on 12 March 1988 that it had nullified the selection of &quot;&quot; as the Cypriot entry; as the rules of the 1988 Cypriot selection did not provide for a second-placed song to be declared, and as there was not enough time to stage a second selection process to determine a replacement entry, CyBC was ultimately unable to participate in the contest.

Several of the artists which competed in this year&#x27;s contest had performed in previous editions of the event. &#x27;s Tommy Körberg had competed in the ; the duo Hot Eyes, also known as Kirsten and Søren, represented for a third time, following appearances at the and contests; the group MFÖ returned for after also competing in 1985; &#x27;s Dora competed again her previous entry; and &#x27;s Yardena Arazi returned to compete as a solo artist, after previously representing her country as part of the group Chocolate Menta Mastik in , and co-hosting the held in Jerusalem. Additionally, &#x27;s Boulevard had previously performed as the backing group for the previous year&#x27;s Finnish entrant Vicky Rosti, and among Yardena Arazi&#x27;s backing vocalists was Yehuda Tamir and , members of the Israeli group Milk and Honey which had won the .

A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. All entries were accompanied by the orchestra, except for and , who were accompanied solely by backing track. In the case of the Italian entry, their backing track featured the contest&#x27;s first, and only, fade-out ending.

==Production==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1988 was produced by the Irish public broadcaster (RTÉ). Liam Miller served as executive producer, Declan Lowney served as director, Paula Farrell and Michael Grogan served as designers, and Noel Kelehan served as musical director, leading the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Frank Naef as executive supervisor. The presenters of the contest were broadcaster Pat Kenny and television announcer and Miss Ireland 1980 Michelle Rocca; the duo were announced by RTÉ in February 1988 following auditions held in the previous weeks. It was the first time since that more than one person had presented the contest.

Several technical innovations and improvements were introduced to the contest for the first time, spearheaded by executive producer Liam Miller and director Declan Lowney, who were eager to make the contest more to a younger audience. The traditional physical scoreboard was replaced by a computer-generated version, displayed on two video walls constructed on either side of the stage. These video walls also displayed the performances and footage of the artists in the green room during the voting sequence, allowing the audience in the arena to see the televised footage within the venue for the first time. A modern feel was also implemented within the stage design by Paula Farrell and Michael Grogan, and the graphic design by Maria Quigley, aspects which had already been modernised for the previous year&#x27;s edition. The stage, at over 40 metres in length, was the largest ever built for the contest at that point, and took up almost a third of the 18,000m2 space within the Simmonscourt Pavilion. The stage design, which created an illusion of depth, alongside tight camera shots of the audience and creative lighting use, resulted in an overall impression that the contest was being held in a vast and packed arena, rather than the modest space of the Simmonscourt Pavilion.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 25 April 1988. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals, comprising a 15-minute stage call and 35-minute performance, were held on 25 and 26 April, followed by a press conference for each delegation and the accredited press. Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals were held on 27 and 28 April, with a 10-minute stage call and 25 minutes for performances. On 28 April, the contest venue received a visit from the Taoiseach Charles Haughey.
 Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, held in the afternoon and evening of 29 April and in the afternoon of 30 April; the second of these rehearsals was filmed as a production stand-by in case the live event was disrupted, with a live audience present. During the contest week, &#x27;s Tommy Körberg had been suffering from a throat infection; although he was able to perform during the event-proper, for the 29 April evening dress rehearsal the songwriter of the Swedish entry Py Bäckman performed the entry in his stead.

==Format==
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

The results of the 1988 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, who were all required to be members of the public with no connection to the music industry, split evenly between men and women and across four age groups: 15–25; 26–35; 36–45; and 46–60. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing. The jury composition and voting process was modified slightly compared to the 1987 contest, due to the increase in the number of participating countries in recent years, expanding from eleven members who awarded between one and five votes for each song.

As established at the , in the event that two or more countries finished in first place with the same number of points, the artists representing these countries would perform their entries again, and the juries in all countries not involved in the tie-break would determine the winner, with each country&#x27;s jury selecting their favourite of the entries by a show of hands of all jurors. If after all countries had determined their favourites and there was still a tie for first place, the countries involved in this tie would be declared joint winners.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 30 April 1988 at 20:00 (IST) with a duration of 2 hours and 50 minutes. Had Cyprus participated as planned, the country had been drawn to perform in position number two.

The contest was opened by a video montage highlighting ancient Celtic structures, items and mythology pertaining to prehistoric Ireland, transitioning to footage of modern-day Ireland and Dublin. This was followed by a performance of the previous year&#x27;s winning entry, &quot;Hold Me Now&quot;, by Johnny Logan. The interval act was the Irish rock group Hothouse Flowers, with a music video of their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;; the group&#x27;s lead singer Liam Ó Maonlaí also appeared on stage before the music video played to explain the meaning behind the songfirst in Irish, then in Englishwhile playing the piano. The music video, featuring performances of the song by the band in eleven European countries, received funding from the European Economic Community as part of the organisation&#x27;s goal of advancing European integration. The trophy awarded to the winners was presented at the end of the broadcast by Johnny Logan.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Atilla Şereftuğ, written by Nella Martinetti and performed by Céline Dion. It was Switzerland&#x27;s second Eurovision win, following their victory at the in 1956. It also remains the last time that a song in the French language has won. The finished in second place for the eleventh time, while finished in last place for the sixth time, and achieved its second &quot;nul points&quot; result.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1988 contest are listed below.

* Guðrún Skúladóttir
* John Skehan
* Andreas Diesen
* Maud Uppling
* Colin Berry
* Miša Molk

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

The 1988 contest has become notable for its tense voting sequence right until the final jury announced its points. With three countries left to vote the United Kingdom had a fifteen-point lead over Switzerland, however this gap was closed to only five points going into the final jury. When the Yugoslav jury awarded Switzerland 6 points, it appeared that victory was within reach for the UK as the camera cut to a crestfallen Céline Dion in the green room; however the British entry would ultimately receive no points from Yugoslavia, leading Switzerland to win the contest by one point. It remains one of the closest margins of victory, and the closest result since , when there was a four-way tie for first place. It also marked the second time that the UK had come in second place with only one point separating it from the winner, following the .

===12 points===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Denmark, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia received the maximum score of 12 points from three of the voting countries, the Netherlands received two sets of 12 points, and France, Ireland, Norway and Sweden each received one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths within the venue. 33 commentary booths were constructed for the event, and it was expected that the contest would be relayed by over 40 television and radio broadcasters, with an estimated audience of 600 million viewers. The contest was also reportedly broadcast in the countries of Eastern Europe via Intervision, and in Australia and South Korea.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

== Legacy ==

This contest is notable as being considered a launchpad to global notability and success for two of the competing artists, namely Switzerland&#x27;s winning artist Céline Dion and &#x27;s Lara Fabian.

While Dion had been known in her native Canada and in France before the contest, and although her Eurovision winning song was not a big success in singles charts across Europe, winning the contest did provide a sizeable boost to her global platform, and reportedly allowed for her manager and future husband René Angélil to successfully renegotiate to increase the budget four-fold for her first English-language album, &quot;Unison&quot;. This album subsequently went on to sell over four million copies following its release in 1990, and has since been certified gold in France and the UK, platinum in the United States, and seven-times platinum in Canada. Dion performed the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;, at the , which would go on to become her first global hit, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US in addition to hitting the top 20 in Norway, Ireland and France. Dion has since become one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, with more than 200 million total global album sales.

Belgian-born Fabian subsequently moved to Quebec in the years after the contest, where she embarked on a career in French-speaking North America, gaining success with her self-titled debut album in 1991 and breaking through further with follow-up album &quot;Carpe diem&quot; in 1994. English-language success would soon follow, with the release of the album &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; and her first English-language single &quot;I Will Love Again&quot;, which charted within the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the magazine&#x27;s Dance Club Songs chart, in 2000. With over 20 million album sales worldwide, Fabian is considered the best-selling Belgian-born female artist of all time and among the best-selling Belgian-born artists in general.

&quot;&quot; was subsequently nominated in 2005 to compete in &quot;&quot;, a special broadcast to determine the contest&#x27;s most popular entry of its first 50 years as part of the contest&#x27;s anniversary celebrations. One of 14 entries chosen to compete, &quot;&quot; ultimately finished in tenth place.

Some hours after Johnny Logan won the 1980 contest, the head of Irish broadcaster, (RTÉ), Brian MacLochlainn announced that they would take on the responsibility of hosting the 1981 contest. This ended up taking the 1981 contest, for the second time in the event&#x27;s history, to Dublin, the capital of Ireland, the last time being ten years earlier in 1971.

== Participating countries ==

By October 1980, it looked as though 21 countries were planning to take part, the largest number so far, but declared that they were no longer interested. This year marked the début of in the contest, who finished in sixth place. Returning to the contest was , absent from the previous year&#x27;s event due a clash of dates with the Yom HaZikaron holiday which prevented them from defending their victories in 1978 and 1979. They finished seventh. also returned to the competition after a five-year absence. decided not to enter due to lack of interest, while declined to take part after their debut entry the year before. Morocco&#x27;s king, Hassan II, &quot;reportedly withdrew Rabat&#x27;s participation from the contest the following year, saying that the country will never participate again&quot;. The draw for the running order took place on 14 November 1980, with it being confirmed that there were a total of 20 entrants.

Of the performers, many previous contestants returned to the contest this year. Notably, Jean-Claude Pascal, who had won the contest for , although could only manage 11th place this time. Peter, Sue and Marc returned for the fourth time, after representing , , and . Performing again for Switzerland, they remain the only act to sing in four different languages (French, English, German, and this time, Italian). Other returnees were Marty Brem who had represented part of Blue Danube, Tommy Seebach who had represented –with Debbie Cameron providing him backing vocals in 1979–, and Björn Skifs who had represented . Cheryl Baker, a member of Bucks Fizz, had represented the as part of Co-Co, while Sheeba, a member of Maxi, had represented as a solo artist. In addition, Ismeta Dervoz, who had represented as part of Ambasadori, and Anita Skorgan, who had represented and , provided backing vocals for the same country.

The contest took place under heavy guard at the 1,600 seat Simmonscourt Pavilion of the RDS, which was normally used for agricultural and horse shows. The set was the largest ever seen in the contest so far, being 150 feet across, 80 feet deep and 30 feet high. Over 250 armed soldiers and police were on hand to protect against any likely political demonstrations, with the British entrants being under constant guard during their time in Dublin due to threats from the IRA. This included an evacuation of the participants&#x27; hotel at one point due to a bomb scare. The security measures were reported on British news reports on the day of the contest.

Rehearsals at the Pavilion began on 31 March with each act allowed 30 minutes with the orchestra, continuing up until the day of the contest, which ended with a dress rehearsal at 16:30. On 1 April, the Irish Tourist Board held a reception for the contest at Jurys Hotel, Dublin.
The presenter on this occasion was Doireann Ni Bhriain, who was well known in Ireland at the time as a television presenter and for the current affairs radio show &quot;Women Today&quot;. She was chosen for her fluency in Irish and English as well as having studied French and Spanish, which she spoke with some ease. She had also worked on the 1971 contest as an interpreter in the RTE press office. The director was Ian McGarry, while Noel Kelehan was the chief conductor of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, which comprised 46 musicians.

It cost RTÉ £530,000 to stage the show, although this included £110,000 from the EBU. From this, the Irish Government expected to make around £2,000,000 from tourism as a result of staging the show. It was expected that the worldwide audience would be some 500 million with 30 countries broadcasting the event, including countries such as Hong Kong, the Soviet Union, the United Arab Emirates, and for the first time, Egypt.

Each song was introduced by a filmed &#x27;postcard&#x27;, framed by an animated identification of the nation&#x27;s location. Unlike previous films used in 1970 and 1976 that had also featured the performing artist, the 1981 films prominently included the authors and composers alongside the performing artist.

== Contest overview ==
The interval act was traditional Irish band Planxty, who performed the lengthy piece &quot;Timedance&quot;, which depicted Irish music through the ages. The accompanying dancers were from Dublin City Ballet. This is seen as a precursor to &quot;Riverdance&quot;, which became famous after its performance in 1994. The song, which was written by Bill Whelan, went on to be released as a Planxty single and became a No.3 hit in the Irish charts.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1980 was the 25th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in The Hague, Netherlands, and was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NOS), which agreed to stage the event after the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), who won in both and , declined to host the event for a second successive year. The contest was held at the on 19 April 1980 and was hosted by Dutch actress Marlous Fluitsma, although each song was introduced by a presenter appointed by each participating broadcaster (in some cases, this was the same person providing the commentary).

Nineteen countries took part this year, with and the previous year&#x27;s winner deciding not to participate, and returning. , notably, made its only appearance in the contest.

The winner was with the song &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;, sung by Johnny Logan and written by Shay Healy.

==Location==

The Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which won the festival in 1979, renounced its rights to host the event on 13 August 1979. The resignation in turn was the result of failed negotiations between the broadcaster and the Israeli parliament, after lawmakers did not authorize extra budget allocations for another international production hosted by IBA in a short space of time.

However, some days later rumours emerged that the resignation was actually the result of a controversy related to the date of the contest which had been provisionally confirmed for 19 April 1980, coinciding with the Yom HaZikaron holiday. The issue itself became controversial in Israel, thanks to a translation error in several documents sent by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to IBA at the end of 1979, when negotiations regarding the holding of the contest would begin. However, IBA tried to negotiate several times with the EBU the possibility of changing the date. However, none of them were fruitful and on 10 December 1979, the Israeli withdrawal was confirmed, following confirmation that the date chosen for the competition was 19 April 1980.

Following these incidents the EBU apologised to IBA, but even with their arguments, the date of the competition could not be changed, since the schedule for the participating broadcasters was tight and many of them already had their participation plans and programming schedules set up. This caused an atypical situation, because it was the only time in history that the country that had won the previous year could not defend its title.

Upon learning of the decision taken by the IBA, the EBU sent a public apology, claiming that &quot;the lack of employees with knowledge of the Hebrew language has placed it in a strained situation&quot;. The issue was resolved when the Israeli broadcaster publicly accepted the apologies and confirmed that regardless of what happened in the 1980 contest, they would return in 1981.

Many years later, Yair Lapid, son of the late Tommy Lapid who was the general director of the IBA at the time, told in his father&#x27;s biography, &quot;that when his father discovered that holding the contest for two years in a row by IBA could result in unexpected bankruptcy. In December 1979, when this argument was presented to the another broadcasters, only NOS immediately accepted&quot;.

As news arrived, the EBU triggered emergency protocol and invited the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as reserve host broadcaster. Something that had already happened four other times (, , , and ). However, despite the good will, the BBC this time alleging the same financial problems that delayed the edition of ended up not taking over production. The third option was (TVE), due to the fact that the Spanish song had come in second place the previous year. However, along the period of Spanish transition to democracy already started, TVE also declined, despite the fact that the tourism board of the was already working in a bid with the Convention Center of Torremolinos as the event&#x27;s venue, trying to harness the area&#x27;s touristic potential.

With negative responses from the reserve options, the EBU and IBA decided to offer the contest to any of the other fifteen broadcasters who had participated in the previous year&#x27;s contest. Fourteen of them also gave negative responses to the situation, as no one expected Israel to give up. The situation only calmed down at the end of 1979, when (NOS) confirmed the date of the competition and its location, which was decided on 23 October. As it accepted the responsibility with little time to organize and produce the contest, with a small budget and reusing practically the same structure used four years earlier, the Dutch broadcaster host spent just NLG 900.000 to hold the event.

==Production==
As in and , the stage design was the work of Roland de Groot. The main platform was decorated with a five-step staircase and three curved horizontal panels, in front of which participants performed their songs. The technique included a series of geometric elements suspended by cables that accompanied each performance, transforming into totally different images accompanied by colored lights that also changed with each song. The overall costs to organize the contest costs NLG 1.5 million.

Given the short time for production, the Dutch art team ended up opting to recycle several elements from the 1976 contest stage, but with different uses. They chose to rescue several pieces from sets from other productions by the broadcaster, a warehouse and also a scrapyard, observing the conditions of use. Recycling also involved the contest&#x27;s visual identity, in the same way that the opening video was a reissue of the one used four years earlier.

== Participating countries ==

After Israel announced its absence, Morocco entered into the contest instead for its only ever participation. Monaco also withdrew from the contest, and would not return until 2004.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Paola del Medico had represented , Katja Ebstein had represented and , and Maggie MacNeal had represented the as part of Mouth and MacNeal.

==Format==
The venue that had hosted the , the , was again chosen to stage the contest. 
Because of the limited budget and time available, NOS decided to recycle several elements of the 1976 production such as several opening video sequences and many pieces and elements that were being used in other broadcaster shows since then. Again, Roland de Groot took charge of the design. As with the 1977 and 1978 contests, there were no pre-filmed postcards between the songs, with a guest presenter appointed by each participating broadcaster introducing the entries. Apart from this, the presenter, Marlous Fluitsma practically presented the contest almost entirely in Dutch, with exceptions in the protocol parts and in the voting where she used French and English according to tradition. Thus, the broadcaster host spent only US$725,000 on staging the show. At least 300 journalists have covered the event.

=== Song presenters ===
Each of the 19 contestants was presented by a presenter from that country appointed by each participating broadcaster. Each of the songs was introduced in the same language as the song was performed, with the exception of the Irish introduction, which was made in Irish, whereas the song was performed in English. The British presenter was incorrectly identified in the onscreen caption as &#x27;Noel Edmunds&#x27; and the Finnish presenter as &#x27;Heikki Haarma&#x27;.

== Contest overview ==
During the live interval act performance of &quot;San Fernando&quot; by The Dutch Rhythm Steel and Show Band with the Lee Jackson dancers, Hans van Willigenburg intercut brief interviews with some of the participants backstage in the green room, speaking to the singers from Germany, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, and the Netherlands, each in their own language.

Australian-born Johnny Logan, representing his parents&#x27; country , was ultimately crowned the winner with the song &quot;What&#x27;s Another Year&quot;. This was Ireland&#x27;s second victory in the competition, having previously won in with &quot;All Kinds of Everything&quot;, coincidentally also held on Dutch soil. It was also the first time that a male solo artist (albeit with backing vocals) had won the contest since Udo Jürgens won for .

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1980 contest are listed below.

* Bent Evold
* Arne Weise
* Ray Moore

== Detailed voting results ==
The scoring system implemented in 1975 remained the same; each country had a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs. However this year for the first time, spokespersons were required to declare their scores in ascending order, 1,2,3 etc. This change made for the added excitement of waiting for each country to award their highest 12 points at the end of each voting round.

For the voting sequence, Marlous Fluitsma used a different telephone to speak to each of the nineteen jury spokespersons, although the phones were simply props and were not connected.

=== 12 points ===
Below is a summary of all 12 points in the final:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. The contest was also reportedly broadcast in Cyprus, Israel, Iceland, and Jordan; in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; and in Cuba, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates, with an estimated audience of 450 million viewers. The contest was reportedly broadcast via radio in countries including Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1979 was the 24th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Jerusalem, Israel, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot; by Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the contest was held at the Menachem Ussishkin auditorium of the International Convention Centre on 31 March 1979, and was hosted by Israeli television presenter Daniel Pe&#x27;er and singer Yardena Arazi. This was the first time that the Eurovision Song Contest was held outside Europe.

Nineteen countries participated in the contest, with deciding not to participate after Arab countries had pressured it into not participating in a contest held in Israel. , which had missed the 1977 and 1978 contests, also did not take part in or broadcast the contest this year for political reasons, despite an earlier public poll in which almost 100,000 people supported a Yugoslav return to the contest.

For the second year in a row, won with the song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, performed by the Israeli group Milk and Honey featuring Gali Atari.

== Location ==

The Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) staged the contest at the Menachem Ussishkin auditorium of the International Convention Centre, also called in Jerusalem, following its win at the with the song &quot;A-Ba-Ni-Bi&quot; performed by Izhar Cohen and Alphabeta. The venue, inside the largest convention center in the Middle East, seats an audience of 3,104 and traditionally hosts other musical events.

== Participating countries ==

Initially, (TRT) intended to participate in the contest. would have appeared 11th on stage (between Israel and France), represented by the song &quot;&quot; performed by Maria Rita Epik and 21. Peron. However TRT later ended up withdrawing from the contest following pressure from Arab states, who objected to a predominantly Muslim country taking part in a contest held in Israel.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Peter, Sue and Marc had represented and ; Xandra had represented the along with Andres Holten and as Sandra Reemer; and Anita Skorgan had represented . In addition, Anne-Marie David representing France, had won the contest for .

== Production ==
The contest was organised and broadcast by the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The event was produced by Alex Gilady, directed by Yossi Zemach, musically directed by Izhak Graziani who conducted the IBA Symphony Orchestra, and overseen by the EBU with scrutineer Frank Naef. Since Israeli Television had yet to broadcast in colour at that point (except for a few special occasions), the production had to borrow cameras from the BBC – the same had happened when RTÉ had hosted the in Dublin. The 24th contest&#x27;s logo featured a combination of a G-clef, the IBA logo, and the names of all participating countries in order of appearance. The IBA Symphony Orchestra played the music of each song, except for the Italian entry, which did not use the orchestra. This was the only contest where the orchestra was composed of 39 musicians.

The stage concept was designed by Dov Ben David. On stage there was a moving symbol which was based on the IBA logo (which was built like a lamp with 3 concentric rings) using a small projected model. The event showcased stage decorations of several types of flora which represent the Land of Israel, and a film of Jerusalem&#x27;s varied ancient, modern and religious scenery. The left side of the stage where the presentation was held, was decorated with prickly pear cactus, date, pomegranate, and orange plants. The film which opened the programme and repeated over its closing credits, screened Jerusalem&#x27;s biblical and medieval monuments sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam with residents and visitors who frequent them while its opening and concluding images showcased the city&#x27;s cultural and governmental institutions along with different types of people outside the ancient walls.

This year, the postcards between each song featured mime artists rather than the participating singers. The mime artists featured were the Yoram Boker Mime Group, and included some of Israel&#x27;s leading mime artists, among them Ezra Dagan and Hanoch Rozen. The group performed on a background of illustrations created by Dudu Geva and Yochanan Lakitzevitz, that featured landmarks and typical landscapes of the respective countries.

== Format ==

The following tables reflect the confirmed, verified scores, which were adjusted after the live broadcast. During the voting announcement, mistakes kept appearing as some spokespersons gave multiple votes of the same amount to two countries. Importantantly, due to a misunderstanding by the presenter Yardena Arazi, Spain appeared to award 10 points to both Portugal and Israel and these scores were added to the scoreboard. After the programme, verification confirmed that Portugal should only have received six points, leaving the total Portuguese score reduced by four points to 64.

The intermission between the songs and the voting was presented by a performance of the Shalom &#x27;79 Dancing Ensemble, who performed a variety of Israeli folk dances. The performance was directed by the ensemble&#x27;s manager and choreographer Gavri Levy.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1979 contest are listed below.
* Ivo Niehe
* Sven Lindahl
* Colin Berry

== Detailed voting results ==

Each participating broadcaster assembled a jury who awarded 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 point(s) for their top ten songs. This was the last year in which the points were announced via order of appearance, as opposed to order of preference. From the next year&#x27;s contest onwards, the points were announced in ascending order instead. This has remained in place ever since.

The voting was extremely close. Israel gained a good lead in the early stages of the voting, but Spain eventually caught up and took a good lead themselves. At the close of the penultimate jury&#x27;s votes, Israel were one point behind Spain, and only the Spanish jury had yet to give their votes. Spain ended up giving Israel 10 points, causing the crowd to erupt into enormous cheers.

=== 12 points ===
Below is a summary of all 12 points in the final:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Hong Kong, Iceland, and Romania. The contest was not broadcast in Yugoslavia for the first time since 1960, as the nation had no diplomatic ties with Israel. Estimates ranged from 200 to 500 million viewers were reported prior to the contest. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="185704" wikidata="Q636309" url="?curid=185704" title="Fret">
<text>A fret is any of the thin strips of material, usually metal wire, inserted laterally at specific positions along the neck or fretboard of a stringed instrument. Frets usually extend across the full width of the neck. On some historical instruments and non-European instruments, frets are made of pieces of string tied around the neck.

Frets divide the neck into fixed segments at intervals related to a musical framework. On instruments such as guitars, each fret represents one semitone in the standard western system, in which one octave is divided into twelve semitones. 

&quot;Fret&quot; is often used as a verb, meaning simply &quot;to press down the string behind a fret&quot;. &quot;Fretting&quot; often refers to the frets and/or their system of placement.

== Explanation ==
Pressing the string against the fret reduces the vibrating length of the string to that between the bridge and the next fret between the fretting finger and the bridge. This is damped if the string were stopped with the soft fingertip on a fretless fingerboard.

Frets make it much easier for a player to achieve an acceptable standard of intonation since the frets determine the positions for the correct notes. Furthermore, a fretted fingerboard makes it easier to play chords accurately.

A disadvantage of frets is that they restrict pitches to the temperament defined by the fret positions. A player may still influence intonation, however, by pulling the string to the side to increase string tension and raise the pitch. This technique (commonly called &quot;bending&quot;) is often used by electric guitarists of all genres, and is an important part of sitar playing. On instruments with frets that are thicker off the fingerboard, string tension and pitch vary with finger pressure behind the fret. Sometimes a player can pull the string toward the bridge or nut, thus lowering or raising the string tension and pitch. However, except for instruments that accommodate extensive string pulling, like the sitar, much less influence on intonation is possible than on unfretted instruments.

=== Equal temperament ===
Since the intonation of most modern western fretted instruments is equal tempered, the ratio of the distances of two consecutive frets to the bridge is formula_1 (the twelfth root of two), or approximately 1.059463. Theoretically, the twelfth fret should divide the string in two exact halves. To compensate for the increase in string tension when the string is pressed against the frets, the bridge position is adjusted slightly so the 12th fret plays exactly in tune.

Many instruments&#x27; frets are not spaced according to the semitones of equal temperament.

==== Examples ====
Some examples are:

* Appalachian dulcimer with frets in a diatonic scale;
* the Turkish Saz with frets spaced according to the Makam system of Turkish folk music;
* the Arabic buzuq with frets spaced according to the Arabic maqam system;
* the Persian setar and tar with frets spaced according to the Persian Dastgah system;
* the Turkish tanbur with as many as 5 frets per semitone, to cover all of the commas of the Turkish Makam system.

== Variations ==
Fan frets (also fanned frets, slanted frets), or multi-scale: while frets are generally perpendicular to the instrument&#x27;s neck centerline and parallel to each other, on a &quot;fanned&quot; fretboard, the frets are angled (spread like a fan) with only one center fret perpendicular to the neck&#x27;s centerline. This gives the lower-pitched strings more length and the higher strings shorter length (comparable to a piano or a harp where heavier strings have different lengths). The idea is to give more accurate tuning and deeper bass. Some think that fanned frets might be more ergonomic. Fanned frets first appeared on the 16th-century Orpharion, a variant of the cittern, tuned like a lute. John Starrett revived the idea in the late seventies on his innovative instrument, the Starrboard. Rickenbacker employed a slanted fret, but it was not multi scale, or fanned. Novax Guitars among others offers such guitars today. The appearance of angled frets on these modern instruments belies the antiquity of this technique.

Scalloped fretboard: Scalloping involves removing some of the wood between some or all of the fret. This is intended to allow a lighter touch for more precise fingering, while easing bends or vibratos (since there&#x27;s no contact between the fingertips and the wooden surface of the fingerboard). It has some popularity with musicians playing heavy metal music, although the concept can also be seen in ancient instruments such as the sitar. Scalloped fretboards have not found widespread popularity because tonally accurate play requires a much lighter fretting hand than most guitarists can achieve, and often significantly heavier strings as well.

Fat frets: on older guitars (especially the Fender Stratocaster), frets were typically made out of thin wire, and some electric guitar players replaced that with thicker wire, for &quot;fat frets&quot; or &quot;jumbo frets&quot;. Fat frets make bending easier, and they change the feel of the guitar. As well, large frets, offering more metal, remain playable much longer than thin frets. A side effect of a thicker fret is a less precise note, since the string is held over a wider surface, causing a slight inaccuracy of pitch, which increases in significance as frets wear.

== Semi-fretted instruments ==
It is also possible to find semi-fretted instruments; examples include the Malagasy &quot;kabosy&quot; and the Afghan Rubab. Semi-fretted versions of guitars and other fretted string instruments, however, are usually one-off, custom adaptations made for players who want to combine elements of both types of sound. One arrangement is for the frets to extend only part of the way along the neck so that the higher notes can be played with the smooth expression possible with a fretless fingerboard. Another approach is the use of frets that extend only partway across the fretboard so that some courses of strings are fretted and others fretless, for example Ryszard Latecki&#x27;s Latar.

==Fret intonation==
Instruments with straight frets like guitars require a special compensation on the saddle and nut. Every time a string is fretted it is also stretched, and as it stretches the string rises in pitch, making all fretted tones sound sharp. When the saddle is positioned properly, however, the fretted tones all sound sharp to the same degree as long as the distances between the frets are correct. With the right nut compensation, the pitch of the unfretted string can be raised by the same amount. As a result, when the tension of the strings is lowered, the pitches of all notes, both fretted and unfretted, become correct.

==Fret wear==
On instruments equipped with steel strings, such as folk guitars and electric guitars, frets are eventually bound to wear down as the strings cut grooves into them. When this happens, the instrument may need refretting (the frets are removed and replaced) or, in less severe cases, &quot;fret dressing&quot; (the frets are leveled, polished, and possibly recrowned).
Often, a few fret dressings can be performed on a guitar before it requires complete refretting.

Tied gut frets, used on instruments such as the lute or viol, wear quickly, and must be replaced regularly.

==Fret buzz==
Fret buzz is one of the many undesirable phenomena that can occur on a guitar or similar stringed instrument. Fret buzz occurs when the vibrating part of one or more strings physically strikes the frets that are higher than the fretted note (or open note). This causes a &quot;buzzing&quot; sound on the guitar that can range from a small annoyance, to severe enough to dampen the note and greatly reduce sustain. Sometimes, fret buzz can be so minimal that there is only a small change in the tone (timbre) of the note, without any noticeable buzzing. Fret buzz can be caused by different things:

* Low action
* Improperly installed fretbars
* Strings too loose
* Improper relief of guitar neck

Fret buzz is evident in some famous recordings; an example is &quot;Friends&quot; by Led Zeppelin (although this example is undoubtedly caused by alternate open tunings that reduce string tension). In some songs, such as &quot;My Last Serenade&quot; by Killswitch Engage, the guitars are tuned to Dropped C and the low tension of the strings is used to create fret buzz by the bass player in order to create a dirty sound.

==History==

It is not known when frets were first used. An early example from about the 3rd century C.E. was discovered in 1907 in the Niya ruins in Xinjiang, China, a broken lute&#x27;s neck with two gut frets intact. The neck and pegbox of the lute are similar to the lute painted on the wall in the Dingjiazha Tomb No. 5 (384–441 A.D.), which also has frets. Buddhist artworks from the 6th-10th centuries C.E. in the Mogao Caves (558-907 C.E.) and Yulin Caves (618-907 C.E.) appear to have frets. Some long lutes in the Utrecht Psalter () in France also appear fretted, as do citoles from Spain in the Cantigas de Santa Maria ().

<text>Captain Frederick Marryat (10 July 1792 – 9 August 1848) was a Royal Navy officer and novelist. He is noted today as an early pioneer of nautical fiction, particularly for his semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Mr Midshipman Easy&quot; (1836). He is remembered also for his children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot; (1847). In addition, he developed a widely used system of maritime flag signalling, known as Marryat&#x27;s Code.

==Early life and naval career==
Marryat was born at Great George Street in Westminster, London. His father was Joseph Marryat, a &quot;merchant prince&quot; and member of Parliament, as well as slave owner and anti-abolitionist, and his mother was Charlotte, &quot;née&quot; von Geyer. As a youth, Marryat tried to run away to sea several times before he was permitted to enter the Royal Navy in 1806 as a midshipman aboard , a frigate commanded by Lord Cochrane, who later served as inspiration for Marryat and other authors.

Marryat&#x27;s time aboard the &quot;Imperieuse&quot; included action off the Gironde, the rescue of a fellow midshipman who had fallen overboard, captures of many ships off the Mediterranean coast of Spain, and capture of the castle of Montgat. The &quot;Imperieuse&quot; shifted to operations in the Scheldt in 1809, where Marryat contracted malaria; he returned to England on the 74-gun HMS &quot;Victorious&quot;. After recuperating, he returned to the Mediterranean in the 74-gun HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; and again saved a shipmate by leaping into the sea after him. He sailed as a passenger to Bermuda in the 64-gun HMS &quot;Atlas&quot;, and from there to Halifax, Nova Scotia on the schooner HMS &quot;Chubb&quot;, where he joined the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Aeolus&quot; on 27 April 1811.

A few months later, Marryat earned distinction again by leading the effort to cut away the &quot;Aeolus&quot; mainyard to save the ship during a storm. He saved one of the crew from the sea. Shortly after, he moved to the frigate HMS &quot;Spartan&quot;, participating in the capture of a number of American ships during the War of 1812. On 26 December 1812, he was promoted to lieutenant, and as such served in the sloop HMS &quot;Espiegle&quot; and in . Marryat led four barges from the &quot;Newcastle&quot; on a raid against Orleans, Massachusetts on 19 December 1814, the last combat in New England during the war. Though initially, Marryat cut out an American schooner and three sloops, he managed to escape with just one sloop. The local militia avoided casualties while killing one Royal marine. Marryat was promoted to commander on 13 June 1815, just as the war ended.

===After the war===
Marryat turned to scientific studies after the war. He invented a lifeboat, which earned him a gold medal from the Royal Humane Society and the nickname &quot;Lifeboat&quot;. He developed a practical, widely used system of maritime flag signalling, known as Marryat&#x27;s Code, based on his experience in the Napoleonic Wars escorting merchant ships in convoys. He also described a new gastropod genus &quot;Cyclostrema&quot; with the type species &quot;Cyclostrema cancellatum&quot;.

In 1819, Marryat married Catherine Shairp. They had four sons and seven daughters together, including Florence, a prolific novelist; Emilia, who became a writer of moralist adventure novels in her father&#x27;s vein and wrote a biography of him; and Augusta, who also wrote adventure fiction.
In 1820, Marryat commanded the sloop HMS &quot;Beaver&quot; and temporarily commanded HMS &quot;Rosario&quot; in order to carry despatches to England announcing the death of Napoleon on Saint Helena. He also took the opportunity to make a sketch of Napoleon&#x27;s body on his deathbed; this was later published as a lithograph. His artistic skills were modest, but he made numerous sketches of shipboard life above and below deck.

In 1823, Marryat was appointed to HMS &quot;Larne&quot; and took part in an expedition against Burma in 1824, which resulted in large losses from disease. He was promoted to command the 28-gun HMS &quot;Tees&quot;, which gave him the rank of post-captain. By 1826 he was back in England and that year donated two Burmese artifacts to the British Museum, in an unsuccessful effort to be selected as a trustee. In 1829, he was commanding the frigate HMS &quot;Ariadne&quot; on a search for shoals around the Madeira and Canary Islands. This was an uninspiring exercise. As his first novel &quot;The Naval Officer&quot; had just been published, he decided to resign his commission in November 1830 and take up writing full-time.

==Literary career==
From 1832 to 1835, Marryat edited &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot;. Additionally, he kept writing novels; his biggest success came with &quot;Mr Midshipman Easy&quot; in 1836. He lived in Brussels for a year, travelled in Canada and the United States, and moved to London in 1839, where he was in the literary circle of Charles Dickens and others. He was in North America in 1837 when rebellion broke out in Lower Canada, and served with the expeditionary force sent to suppress it.

Marryat was named a Fellow of the Royal Society in recognition of his lifeboat, signals system and other achievements. In 1843, he moved to a farm at Manor Cottage, Langham in Norfolk. He died there in 1848. His daughter Florence Marryat later became known as a writer and actress. His son Francis Samuel Marryat completed his father&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Little Savage&quot;.

Marryat&#x27;s novels are typical of their time, with concerns of family connections and social status often overshadowing the naval action. He based much of his fiction on his 25 years&#x27; experience at sea. Among those who admired his works were Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Ernest Hemingway. As the first nautical novels, they served as models for 20th century works by C. S. Forester and Patrick O&#x27;Brian. These also were set in the time of Nelson and told of young men rising through the ranks due to their successes as naval officers.

Marryat was also known for short writings on nautical subjects. These short stories, plays, pieces of travel journalism, and essays were published in &quot;The Metropolitan Magazine&quot;, and many were later collected in book form as &quot;Olla Podrida&quot;. 

Marryat&#x27;s 1839 Gothic novel &quot;The Phantom Ship&quot; contained &quot;The White Wolf of the Hartz Mountains&quot;. This featured the first female werewolf to appear in a short story.

In 1839, Marryat also published his &quot;Diary in America&quot;, a travelogue that reflects his criticisms of American culture and society. The book and the author were both subject to acts of violence. The book and Marryat&#x27;s effigy were each burned in public.

Controversy arose among Marryat&#x27;s readers. Some criticized him for careless writing, others admired his vivacity about life at sea. His later novels were generally for the children&#x27;s market, including his most famous novel today: &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot;, published in 1847 and set in the countryside round the village of Sway, Hampshire.

The works of Marryat are considered by the maritime historians of today to be a reliable source on the operation and characteristics of the sailing vessels of his time.

==Works==
==Family connections==
Marryat&#x27;s niece Augusta Sophia Marryat married Sir Henry Young, who served as Governor of South Australia and Tasmania. A suburb, Marryatville, and the town of Port Augusta were named after her. Augusta&#x27;s brother Charles Marryat was the first Anglican Dean of Adelaide.

<doc id="185713" wikidata="Q214082" url="?curid=185713" title="Skeptical Inquirer">
<text>Skeptical Inquirer (S.I.) is a bimonthly American general-audience magazine published by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) with the subtitle &quot;The Magazine for Science and Reason&quot;. The magazine initially focused on investigating claims of the paranormal, but evolved and expanded to address other pseudoscientific topics that are antithetical to critical thinking and science. Notable skeptics have credited the magazine in influencing their development of scientific skepticism. In the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot;, the most frequent letters of appreciation come from educators.

== History ==

The magazine was originally titled &quot;The Zetetic&quot; (from the Greek meaning &quot;skeptical seeker&quot; or &quot;inquiring skeptic&quot;), and was originally edited by Marcello Truzzi. About a year after its inception a schism developed between the editor Truzzi and the rest of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). CSICOP was more &quot;firmly opposed to nonsense, more willing to go on the offensive and to attack supernatural claims&quot; while Truzzi wanted science and pseudoscience to exist &quot;happily together&quot;. Founder Paul Kurtz strongly believed &quot;it&#x27;s important that, when claims of the paranormal get wide public attention and belief, the skeptical position also get media attention&quot;. Truzzi resigned to start &quot;The Zetetic Scholar&quot; and CSICOP changed the magazine&#x27;s name to &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; and hired Kendrick Frazier as the new editor.

The first issue of S.I. was Fall/Winter 1976. In 1995, S.I. changed format from digest size to a standard magazine size, increased the publication frequency from quarterly to bimonthly, and added newsstand circulation in addition to subscription.

In 2013, writer and skeptic Daniel Loxton posited that if &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; was not the first skeptical publication, it is yet considered the birth of modern skepticism&#x27; (at least for the English-speaking world)&quot; because CSICOP organized &quot;this scholarship collectively [and] comprised a distinct field of study&quot;, and was the first to establish &quot;best practices... specialist experts... buildings... periodicals and professional writers and researchers&quot;.

Barry Karr is the executive director of CSI and &quot;Skeptical Inquirer.&quot; In June 2023, Stephen Hupp, a professor in the Department of Psychology at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, was named as the magazine&#x27;s editor. Hupp replaced Stuart Vyse, who was the interim editor in November 2022 following the passing of Kendrick Frazier.

== Focus ==

The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry functions as a scientific society and, upon editorial acceptance, publishes articles from independent scientists and investigators in the &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;. Published topics have included fringe science, pseudoscience, paranormalism, psychic phenomena, astrology, ufology, homeopathy, and New Age, as well as articles on politics, general science, cyberterrorism, and others. Writing for &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1982&quot;,&quot; cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter said that the purpose of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; was to &quot;combat nonsense&quot; with articles in English that require no special knowledge or expertise, only &quot;curiosity about truth&quot;.

Loxton, writing in 2013 about the mission and goals of the skeptical movement, countered the idea that people no longer wanted to read about the paranormal, and recommended getting back to S.I.&#x27;s basics. Paul Kurtz in 2009 seemed to share this sentiment and stated that the organization would still research some paranormal subjects as they have expertise in this area, but they would begin to investigate other areas. &quot;CSICOP has reached an historic juncture: the recognition that there is a critical need to change our direction&quot;, Kurtz wrote. While editor Kendrick Frazier did expand the scope of the magazine to include more topics on subjects that attacked science or critical thinking—such as climate change denialism, conspiracy theories and the influence of the alternative medicine movement—Frazier also noted that &quot;paranormal beliefs are still widespread&quot;, and quoted surveys that state that the public, given a list of ten general paranormal topics, will select four as topics they believe in. While the general skeptic community believes that we should not waste more time debunking the paranormal, topics long ago discredited, Frazier says &quot;millions of Americans accept them today&quot;. Even with such long odds against &quot;an organized paranormal lobby, a magical marketing machine&quot;, Loxton implores skeptics to continue researching, writing and publishing: &quot;We can&#x27;t win any ultimate victory over superstition or ignorance, but we can do a lot of good if we fight hard enough.&quot;

The January/February 2023 issue featured an article by Craig Foster that examined &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; Vol. 1, no. 1 comparing it to the current publication, and found that &quot;1976 principles of skepticism&quot; still resonate forty-six years later &quot;The Truzzi and Kurtz editorials are so consistent with contemporary skepticism, I think &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; could reprint them today, without dates, and readers wouldn&#x27;t find them peculiar.&quot; Furthermore &quot;The only out-of-place sentiment seems to be imagining the journal as an exchange between skeptics and paranormal promotors&quot;

== Reception and influence ==

Science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson said &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; is his favorite magazine and it tells him what people are currently &quot;misthinking&quot; about. In his 2017 book, Bill Nye recommended S.I. to his readers as a magazine that &quot;promote[s] the aggressive form of critical thinking needed to immunize us to fakery&quot;. Eric Zorn wrote that S.I. &quot;remains a favorite of those of us who can, in fact, handle the truth&quot;.

Several notable skeptics have described the magazine as influential to the early stages of their development as scientific skeptics. In 1995, Perry DeAngelis and Steven Novella were friends that played &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; together until DeAngelis noticed a &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine on the table in Novella&#x27;s condo. DeAngelis, also an avid reader of the magazine, pointed out the back page to Novella and said &quot;What is missing?&quot; DeAngelis stated that what was missing was a Connecticut skeptic group, he said &quot;we should do this&quot; to which Novella agreed. They started the New England Skeptical Society and eventually the Skeptic&#x27;s Guide to the Universe (SGU) podcast.

Writing for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Douglas Hofstadter asked the question, why would &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; succeed when the only people who read it are people who do not believe in the paranormal? The answer, he says, lies in the back of the magazine in the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; section. &quot;Many people write in to say how vital the magazine has been to them, their friends and their students. High school teachers are among the most frequent writers of thank-you notes to the magazine&#x27;s editors, but I have also seen enthusiastic letters from members of the clergy, radio talk-show hosts and people in many other professions.&quot;

Daniel Loxton, in his essay &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; about discovering &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine as a freshman at his University writes... 

=== Levy and Olynyk art project ===

Inspired by the four decades of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine, an exhibition titled &quot;Some Provocations from Skeptical Inquirers&quot; by artists Ellen Levy and Patricia Olynyk, was held at the Baruch College Mishkin Gallery in February 2016. Reviewer Eileen G&#x27;Sell wrote that the artists &quot;plumb the depths of the murky ontological sea that is empirical belief.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, reviewer William Corwin stated that the artwork represented &quot;this built-in confrontation between fact and fiction (which) was the basis of the Skeptical Inquirer itself and its playful willingness to consider the most unlikely phenomena.&quot;

<doc id="185720" wikidata="Q19866" url="?curid=185720" title="Reanimation (Linkin Park album)">
<text>Reanimation (typeset as [REAИIMATIOИ]) is the first remix album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on July 30, 2002, through Warner Bros. Records, as a follow-up to their 2000 debut studio album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. Recorded during the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; tour, it features remixes of songs from &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, including the album&#x27;s bonus tracks. It was produced by Mike Shinoda and mixed by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent. It is the fourth best selling remix album of all time.

==Release and promotion==

===Singles===
&quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot;, the remix of &quot;Points of Authority&quot; by Jay Gordon of Orgy, was released as the first and only official single from &quot;Reanimation&quot;. The single also features B-sides &quot;H! Vltg3&quot;, the remix of &quot;High Voltage&quot; by Evidence and DJ Babu featuring additional vocals by Pharoahe Monch, as well as a remix of &quot;By Myself&quot;, entitled &quot;Buy Myself&quot;, by American musician Marilyn Manson.

&quot;Enth E Nd&quot;, &quot;Frgt/10&quot;, &quot;Songs from Reanimation&quot; and &quot;My&lt;Dsmbr&quot; were released as radio promotional singles.

===Music videos===
The official video for &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot; depicts an animated battle between robots, ruled by the heads of Linkin Park members, and an alien race.

MTV2 made videos for each song of the album for its playback of the album on &quot;MTV:Playback&quot; which aired only a few times. These include: &quot;Opening&quot; (a girl going to bed), &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot; (the US flag up to 1:05, then a motorcycle chase), &quot;Enth E Nd&quot; (Mike Shinoda, KutMasta Kurt and Motion Man performing their respective parts and verses in the back of a car. This was the only video to show the actual performers of the song), &quot;[Chali]&quot; (the girl in bed and shots of her room), &quot;Frgt/10&quot; (the girl from the &quot;Opening&quot; doing graffiti in a town while evading the police chopper), &quot;P5hng Me A*wy&quot; (a cannibal at work), &quot;Plc. 4 Mie Hæd&quot; (the girl singing to the song), &quot;X-Ecutioner Style&quot; (a cartoon boy walking around town, singing Chester&#x27;s &quot;Shut Up&quot; parts), &quot;H! Vltg3&quot; (a night in the life of a man), &quot;[Riff Raff]&quot; (the girl in bed), &quot;Wth&gt;You&quot; (very quick montage of Mugshots of people in sync with the song), &quot;Ntr\Mssion&quot; (the girl in bed), &quot;Ppr:Kut&quot; (shots of people&#x27;s reactions to an unexpected loud noise while listening to music; Joe Hahn made a cameo appearance in this video), &quot;Rnw@y&quot; (a woman with a Mohawk in town, running in each chorus of the song), My&lt;Dsmbr (a man obviously lives on the beach and does some amusements in an amusement park), &quot;[Stef]&quot; (the girl in bed), &quot;By_Myslf&quot; (a woman in a forest), &quot;Kyur4 th Ich&quot; (people breakdancing, Joe Hahn made another appearance as his cameo), &quot;1Stp Klosr&quot; (depicts a failing relationship), and &quot;Krwlng&quot; (animation of a white stick man).

Only the MTV2 videos of &quot;Frgt/10&quot; and &quot;Kyur4 th Ich&quot; were officially released on the DVD-A edition of the album, along with the official &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot; video. The videos of &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot;, &quot;Enth E Nd&quot;, &quot;Frgt/10&quot;, and &quot;Kyur4 th Ich&quot; were the only videos to be considered &quot;official&quot;.

=== Editions ===
&quot;Reanimation&quot;&#x27;s standard edition came in a digipak case with 20 tracks. The Japanese edition included &quot;Buy Myself&quot; as a bonus track. The iTunes release, in addition to &quot;Buy Myself&quot;, also included live recordings of &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;My December&quot;, originally released as B-sides for &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; respectively.

Also released was a DVD-A version with surround sound and music videos for &quot;Pts.Of.Athrty&quot;, &quot;Frgt/10&quot;, and &quot;Kyur4 Th Ich&quot;. Linkin Park Underground 1.0 members received the DVD-A edition for free as a Christmas gift.

A test release of a DualDisc version was sold in Boston and Seattle only. This edition contained the album on one side of the disc and special content on the other. It never progressed beyond the test run and thus the DualDisc edition is difficult to obtain.

The entire album was later re-released in 2020 on CD, vinyl and digital format as part of the 20th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, with &quot;Buy Myself&quot; also released as part of the boxset&#x27;s &quot;B-Side Rarities&quot; collection.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Reanimation&quot; was met with mixed reviews from critics. It helped the many underground hip hop artists that it featured reach a larger audience, as well as changing the nature of the work so significantly (restructuring songs, adding or substantially changing verses, and adding several guest artists) that it could be considered an entirely new album. The album received an average score of 60 from Metacritic. Reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considered the album &quot;a welcome step in the right direction,&quot; and he praised &quot;Reanimation&quot; for attempting to break new ground. Will Hermes of &quot;Spin&quot; found that &quot;ultimate, the set is a little schizo&quot; finding it &quot;channels enough rap-rock frisson to make it more than just a between-albums snack.&quot;

The album reached a peak position of #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and stayed on the list for 33 straight weeks. It sold 270,000 copies in its debut week., and nearly two million overall. It became the fourth best-selling remix album of all time.

==In popular culture==
At the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, British ice dancers Sinead and John Kerr skated to &quot;Krwlng&quot;.

In 2011, magician Dynamo walked across the Thames River. This was shown during his TV show &quot;Dynamo: Magician Impossible&quot; while the song &quot;Krwlng&quot; played over it.

==Track listing==


===iTunes===
The videos for &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot;, &quot;Frgt/10&quot; and &quot;Kyur4 Th Ich&quot; are the only videos of Reanimation to be available for purchase on iTunes.

===DVD-Audio===
Contains the complete album mixed in 5.1 surround sound, along with the music videos for &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot;, &quot;Frgt/10&quot;, and &quot;Kyur4 th Ich&quot;, as well as the making of &quot;Pts.OF.Athrty&quot; feature. This is only available in a DVD-Audio format. It plays in most DVD players and DVD-A compatible DVD players. This version was originally distributed to members of the Linkin Park Underground, who signed up before November 10, 2002, for free. It was also made into a DualDisc format which contained the CD version on one side and the DVD-Audio on the other.

===DualDisc version===
This album was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc has the standard album on one side, and the DVD-Audio track listing on the second side. The DualDisc version was not reissued after the test market run.

===Outtakes===
Remixes were also crafted by Tricky, Prince Paul, DJ Z-Trip, and Team Sleep (&quot;My December&quot;).

Tracks 1, 4, 9, 10, 12, 15, and 16 do not contain elements of a song on the standard edition of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. Tracks 9 and 15 are remixes of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; B-sides, while the rest were created specifically for &quot;Reanimation&quot;.

<text>Advertising slogans are short phrases used in advertising campaigns to generate publicity and unify a company&#x27;s marketing strategy. The phrases may be used to attract attention to a distinctive product feature or reinforce a company&#x27;s brand.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
According to the 1913 &quot;Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, a derives from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;&quot;, a battle cry. Its contemporary definition denotes a distinctive advertising motto or advertising phrase used by any entity to convey a purpose or ideal. This is also known as a catchphrase. Taglines, or tags, are American terms describing brief public communications to promote certain products and services. In the UK, they are called &quot;end lines&quot; or &quot;straplines.&quot; In Japan, advertising slogans are called or .

==Format==
Most corporate advertisements are short, memorable phrases, often between three and five words. Slogans adopt different tones to convey different meanings. For example, funny slogans can enliven conversation and increase memorability. Slogans often unify diverse corporate advertising pieces across different mediums. Slogans may be accompanied by logos, brand names, or musical jingles.

==History==
In August 1859, Thomas Beecham, founder of the British firm Beechams, created a slogan for Beecham&#x27;s Pills: &quot;Beechams Pills: Worth a guinea a box&quot;, which is considered to be the world&#x27;s first advertising slogan, helping the company become a global brand. The phrase, which first appeared in a Beechams advertisement in the &quot;St Helens Intelligencer&quot;, was first said to be uttered by a satisfied lady purchaser from St Helens, Lancashire, the founder&#x27;s home town.

==Use==
Some slogans are created for long term corporate identity processes, while others are interested in specific limited-time campaigns. However, since some ideas resonate with the public with persistence, many advertising slogans retain their influence even after general use is discontinued. If an advertising slogan enters into the public vernacular, word-of-mouth communication may increase consumer awareness of the product and extend an ad campaign&#x27;s lifespan, or cause a company to adopt it for long term advertising and identity.

Slogans that associate emotional responses or evoke recollections of memories increase their likelihood of being adopted by the public and shared. Additionally, by linking a slogan to a commonplace discussion topic (e.g. stress, food, traffic), consumers will recall the slogan more often and associate the corporation with their personal experiences.

If a slogan is adopted by the public, it can have a notable influence on everyday social interaction. Slogans can serve as connection points between community members as individuals share pithy taglines in conversation. In contrast, if an individual is unaware of a popular slogan or tagline, they can be socially excluded from conversation and disengage from the discussion.

===Social control===
Advertising slogans as a system of social control include devices similar to watchwords, catchwords, and mottoes. The use of slogans may be examined insofar as the slogans elicit unconscious and unintentional responses.

==The ongoing argument==
Quantifying the effects of an effective, or ineffective, ad campaign can prove challenging to scholars. Critics argue taglines are a self-gratifying, unnecessary form of corporate branding that is neither memorable nor pithy. However, proponents argue if taglines enter everyday public discourse, the company&#x27;s market influence could exponentially increase.

==Functional slogans==
A marketing slogan can play a part in the interplay between rival companies. A functional slogan usually:
* states product benefits (or brand benefits) for users (or potential buyers)
* implies a distinction between it and other firms&#x27; products—with constraints
* makes a simple, concise, clearly defined, and appropriate statement
* is either witty, or has a distinct &quot;personality&quot;
* gives a credible impression of a brand or product
* makes the consumer experience an emotion; or, creates a need or desire 
* is hard to forget—it adheres to one&#x27;s memory

The business sloganeering process communicates the value of a product or service to customers, to sell the product or service. It is a business function for attracting customers.

<doc id="185730" wikidata="Q19858" url="?curid=185730" title="Meteora (album)">
<text>Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on March 25, 2003, through Warner Bros. Records, following &quot;Reanimation&quot;, a collaboration album which featured remixes of songs included on their 2000 debut studio album &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. The album was produced by the band alongside Don Gilmore. The title &quot;Meteora&quot; is taken from the Greek Orthodox monasteries originally bearing the name. &quot;Meteora&quot; has a similar sound to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, as described by critics, and the album took almost a year to be recorded. It is the first Linkin Park studio album to feature bassist Dave &quot;Phoenix&quot; Farrell after he rejoined the band in 2000 following his temporary touring with other bands.

&quot;Meteora&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 810,000 copies in its first week. Linkin Park released singles from &quot;Meteora&quot; for over a year, including &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;From the Inside&quot;, and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;. “Lying from You” was released in March 2004 as a promotional single. &quot;Meteora&quot; received generally positive reviews, although some critics felt the album&#x27;s style was too similar to its predecessor.

&quot;Meteora&quot; has sold around 16 million copies worldwide, making it the 8th best-selling album of the 21st century. It is certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was ranked number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums of the 2000s. Some songs from the album were remixed with some of Jay-Z&#x27;s songs for the EP &quot;Collision Course&quot; (2004). &quot;Session&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards.

In February 2023, it was announced that the band would release a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Meteora&quot; on April 7, 2023. They released a previously never-before-heard outtake from the album titled &quot;Lost&quot; as the lead single of the reissue.

==Writing and recording==
In 2000, Linkin Park worked with music producer Don Gilmore to record and release their debut album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. Initial writing for a second album dated back to early 2001, while still touring in support of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. The band had written around eighty different demos during their Hybrid Theory World Tour and LP Underground Tour, within the span of just eight months. Rough song ideas written then would find its way to the final album; notably 
the intro for &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;. Lead singer Chester Bennington recorded guitar notes for it, but found it too folk rock sounding. However, bandmates Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn reworked it, adding effects to it, and then played it backwards, molding it into something the band was happy with. As explained by Shinoda: &quot;Since I reversed it, it was playing 4-3-2-1. The chord progression was reversed. Then I cut it into four pieces, and I played it 1-2-3-4. And that&#x27;s why it has that sweeping sound.&quot;

Prior to releasing a second album, the band instead chose to release a remix album, &quot;Reanimation&quot;, in 2002, produced by Shinoda. The experience led the band to want to co-produce their second album, while still working with Gilmore, hoping to expand on the sound of &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; with more experimental ideas. In early 2002, after the touring, the writing continued in Mike&#x27;s home studio, pre-production of the album began there. The band worked in pairs during the writing process, whereas Shinoda was always involved in all the songs. The recording of the songs mainly used Pro Tools, whereas the band used the traditional method of writing, in main studio. In June, pre-production terminated and the band headed for main production. The band finalized Don Gilmore as their producer. When &quot;Reanimation&quot; was released, the band had started to write the main content. Drummer Rob Bourdon spent eight hours a day in the studio for the recording of the album. By August, the band entered NRG Studios as Bennington also began writing songs with the band.

Linkin Park had finished rough versions of many songs before entering the studio to begin recording. They spent the time in the studio to create the sound for the album and write the lyrics. By October, the drum recordings were completed and guitar parts were introduced. By the middle of October, the bass parts were introduced. The scratching and sampling parts by Hahn were introduced just a month before the deadline. The song &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; featured live strings arranged by David Campbell; the song had been worked on by Shinoda for five or six years. The vocal recordings began on a song after all the instruments were finished for it. The band went to New York for mixing with Andy Wallace, where the album was finished in December 2002.

==Composition and themes==
Lyrically, the album contains elements including depressing emotions, anger, and recovery. Explaining to MTV, Bennington said: &quot;We don&#x27;t talk about situations, we talk about the emotions behind the situations. Mike and I are two different people, so we can&#x27;t sing about the same things, but we both know about frustration and anger and loneliness and love and happiness, and we can relate on that level.&quot; In the same interview, Shinoda explained it as: &quot;What we really wanted to do was just push ourselves and push each other to really find new ways to be creative.&quot; He continued: &quot;We wanted each sample that was in each song to be something that might perk your ear – something that you might not have ever heard before.&quot;

In a promotional interview, Rob Bourdon stated: &quot;We wanted a group of songs that would sit well together because we wanted to make a record that you could pop into your CD player and, from beginning to end, there would never be a spot where you start daydreaming.&quot;

In titling the album, Mike said that &quot;Meteora was a word that caught my attention because it sounded huge.&quot; Dave, Joe, and Chester elaborated that just like how Meteora, the rock formation in Greece, is very epic, dramatic, and has great energy, the band wanted the album to have that same feeling.

Genre-wise, the album is categorized as nu metal, rap metal, rap rock, alternative rock and alternative metal, with elements of pop, electronica and hip-hop.

==Promotion==
The promotion for the album began well ahead of its release, as pictures of the band recording were distributed to the media. To support the album, there were many photo shoots of the band on October 29 at the Ambassador Hotel, where the band took a break from recording the album for two days, for designing the cover art of the album. &quot;The Flem&quot; and &quot;Delta&quot; helped the band for the art works, for the album as well as for the singles spawned by it. A TV commercial for the album was premiered on January 1, 2003.

&quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; was released as the lead single and premiered on US radio on February 24, 2003. Being released a month before the album release, it influenced the album sales performance worldwide. The second single off the album was &quot;Faint&quot;, released before the band started its world tour. The third single &quot;Numb&quot; was released when Linkin Park performed it live in Madrid. &quot;From the Inside&quot; was released as the fourth single off the album before the North American leg of the world tour. &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was released while the band was in Indonesia. The album was released with various limited edition content for promotional purposes.

There is a special edition of &quot;Meteora&quot;, which includes the &quot;Making of &quot;Meteora&quot;&quot; DVD documentary. The special-edition package was packaged in a blue tinted case with the blue &quot;Meteora&quot; cover that can be found in some parts of Asia, United States, and more commonly in India. An alternate Indian version contains an alternate DVD and alternative cover that is packaged in a slimline case with the disc in original packaging. The &quot;Tour Edition&quot; of &quot;Meteora&quot; is packaged in a two disc set. The second disc, which is a Video CD, has the music videos for &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;. The tour edition is packaged in a standard Compact Disc case, rather than their trademark digipak case. The album was also released on a very limited quantity of vinyl records (spread across two LPs) under Warner Brothers. These are coveted by collectors and fetch high prices at auction. In 2014, Linkin Park released a demo version of Shinoda singing the song, on their 14th annual fan club CD, LPU XIV.

The band promoted the album with their Meteora World Tour and various other supporting tours. The world tour was supported by Hoobastank, P.O.D. and Story of the Year. The band played shows at &quot;Pellissier Building and Wiltern Theatre&quot; on the day before the album release and on the release date. The shows were called &quot;&#x27;Meteora&#x27; Release Show&quot;. The European leg was cancelled because Chester was having severe back and abdominal pains. As a result, half of the music video of &quot;Numb&quot; was shot in Los Angeles and the Czech Republic. The album was also promoted by the Projekt Revolution festival. A live album was released in support of the album titled &quot;Live in Texas&quot;. Linkin Park played various special shows worldwide, including &quot;Reading Ireland&quot;, as well as performing during the Kerrang! Awards, &quot;Livid&quot;, &quot;X-103&#x27;s Not So Silent Night&quot;, &quot;The End&#x27;s Deck The Hall Ball&quot; and &quot;KROQ Almost Acoustic X-Mas&quot;, in promotion of the album.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Meteora&quot; received generally positive reviews, although critics noted that the album&#x27;s musical style was similar to its predecessor, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (2000). The overall Metacritic score is 62.
&quot;E! Online&quot; rated it A, and expected it to &quot;shoot straight for the stars&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+, calling it a &quot;thunderously hooky album that seamlessly blends the group&#x27;s disparate sonic elements into radio-friendly perfection.&quot; &quot;Dot Music&quot; described it as a &quot;guaranteed source of ubiquitous radio hits&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the band &quot;squeezed the last remaining life out of this nearly extinct formula&quot;. &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; described &quot;Meteora&quot; as &quot;a ready-made crowdpleaser&quot;. The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; said it had &quot;massive commercial appeal&quot; but left the reviewer &quot;underwhelmed&quot;.

Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as &quot;nothing more and nothing less than a &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; part 2.&quot;, but added that the band &quot;has discipline and editing skills, keeping this record at a tight 36 minutes and 41 seconds, a move that makes it considerably more listenable than its peers... since they know where to focus their energy, something that many nu-metal bands simply do not.&quot; &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; writer Damrod criticized the album as being too similar to &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, but praised the album&#x27;s production quality and catchiness, stating &quot;the songs just invade your brain&quot;.

&quot;Blender&quot; described it as &quot;harder, denser, uglier&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; described it as &quot;less an artistic endeavor than an exercise in target marketing.&quot;

===Accolades===
The song &quot;Session&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2004. Single from the album &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; won Best Rock Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Video but won MTV Viewer&#x27;s Choice.
==Commercial performance==
In its first week, &quot;Meteora&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album sold 810,400 copies in the US and 36,700 in Canada its first week of release. In its second week, it sold an additional 265,000 copies in the US and stayed at the top for another week. As of June 2014, the album has sold 6.2 million copies in the US, and around 16 million copies worldwide. The album was ranked number 36 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Hot 200 Albums of the Decade&quot;.

As of April 2023, the album has sold 8.55 million equivalent album units and 6.49 million in pure album sales in the US.

==20th anniversary edition==
In January 2023, the band started teasing the 20th anniversary of &quot;Meteora&quot; by updating their website, featuring a countdown to February 1, where it was speculated that they would be announcing something related to their second album. By the time that the countdown concluded, the website was updated again in the style of an interactive game that progressed every day up until the announcement of &quot;Lost&quot;, on February 6, to commemorate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The previously unreleased track was released on February 10 as the lead single alongside the official announcement of the 20th anniversary reissue. A second single, also previously unreleased, entitled &quot;Fighting Myself&quot; was released on March 24. The 20th anniversary reissue was released on April 7.

The 20th anniversary super deluxe edition of &quot;Meteora&quot;, promoted as &quot;Meteora20&quot;, features the original tracklist; an extended release of &quot;Live in Texas&quot;, featuring tracks previously omitted from the CD release; a previously unreleased live performance at Nottingham, England in 2003, titled &quot;Live in Nottingham 2003&quot;; previously released demos for the Linkin Park Underground fan club, titled &quot;LPU Rarities 2.0&quot;; previously released live recordings, titled &quot;Live Rarities 2003–2004&quot;; previously unreleased demos, titled &quot;Lost Demos&quot;; and three DVDs: the first disc feature the previously released &quot;The Making of Meteora&quot; and &quot;The Art of Meteora&quot; documentaries, along with a new documentary titled &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, while the second and third discs feature previously unreleased live performances from 2003 and 2004 respectively. The Deluxe CD features the original Andy Wallace mix of &quot;Lost&quot;, called &quot;Lost (2002 Mix)&quot;, as the 14th track of the first disc, after &quot;Numb&quot;.

&quot;Lost Demos&quot; was later released on vinyl for Record Store Day Black Friday 2023.

<doc id="185732" wikidata="Q578430" url="?curid=185732" title="Quantum decoherence">
<text>Quantum decoherence is the loss of quantum coherence. Quantum decoherence has been studied to understand how quantum systems convert to systems that can be explained by classical mechanics. Beginning out of attempts to extend the understanding of quantum mechanics, the theory has developed in several directions and experimental studies have confirmed some of the key issues. Quantum computing relies on quantum coherence and is one of the primary practical applications of the concept.

==Concept==
In quantum mechanics, physical systems are described by a mathematical representation called a quantum state. Probabilities for the outcomes of experiments upon a system are calculated by applying the Born rule to the quantum state describing that system. Quantum states are either &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;mixed&quot;; pure states are also known as &quot;wavefunctions&quot;. Assigning a pure state to a quantum system implies certainty about the outcome of some measurement on that system, i.e., that there exists a measurement for which one of the possible outcomes will occur with probability 1. In the absence of outside forces or interactions, a quantum state evolves unitarily over time. Consequently, a pure quantum state remains pure. However, if the system is not perfectly isolated, for example during a measurement, coherence is shared with the environment and appears to be lost with time ─ a process called quantum decoherence or environmental decoherence. The quantum coherence is not lost but rather mixed with many more degrees of freedom in the environment, analogous to the way energy appears to be lost during friction in classical mechanics when it actually has produced heat in the environment.

Decoherence can be viewed as the loss of information from a system into the environment (often modeled as a heat bath), since every system is loosely coupled with the energetic state of its surroundings. Viewed in isolation, the system&#x27;s dynamics are non-unitary (although the combined system plus environment evolves in a unitary fashion). Thus the dynamics of the system alone are irreversible. As with any coupling, entanglements are generated between the system and environment. These have the effect of sharing quantum information with—or transferring it to—the surroundings.

==History and interpretation==
===Relation to interpretation of quantum mechanics===
An interpretation of quantum mechanics is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of quantum physics might correspond to experienced reality. Decoherence calculations can be done in any interpretation of quantum mechanics, since those calculations are an application of the standard mathematical tools of quantum theory. However, the subject of decoherence has been closely related to the problem of interpretation throughout its history.

Decoherence has been used to understand the possibility of the collapse of the wave function in quantum mechanics. Decoherence does not generate &quot;actual&quot; wave-function collapse. It only provides a framework for &quot;apparent&quot; wave-function collapse, as the components of a quantum system entangle with other quantum systems within the same environment. That is, components of the wave function are decoupled from a coherent system and acquire phases from their immediate surroundings. A total superposition of the global or universal wavefunction still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an interpretational issue.

With respect to the measurement problem, decoherence provides an explanation for the transition of the system to a mixture of states that seem to correspond to those states observers perceive. Moreover, observation indicates that this mixture looks like a proper quantum ensemble in a measurement situation, as the measurements lead to the &quot;realization&quot; of precisely one state in the &quot;ensemble&quot;.

The philosophical views of Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr have often been grouped together as the &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot;, despite significant divergences between them on important points. In 1955, Heisenberg suggested that the interaction of a system with its surrounding environment would eliminate quantum interference effects. However, Heisenberg did not provide a detailed account of how this might transpire, nor did he make explicit the importance of entanglement in the process.

===Origin of the concepts===
Nevill Mott&#x27;s solution to the iconic Mott problem in 1929 is considered in retrospect to be the first quantum decoherence work. It was cited by the first modern theoretical treatment.

Although he did not use the term, the concept of quantum decoherence was first introduced in 1951 by the American physicist David Bohm, who called it the &quot;destruction of interference in the process of measurement&quot;. Bohm later used decoherence to handle the measurement process in the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum theory.

The significance of decoherence was further highlighted in 1970 by the German physicist H. Dieter Zeh, and it has been a subject of active research since the 1980s. Decoherence has been developed into a complete framework, but there is controversy as to whether it solves the measurement problem, as the founders of decoherence theory admit in their seminal papers.

The study of decoherence as a proper subject began in 1970, with H. Dieter Zeh&#x27;s paper &quot;On the Interpretation of Measurement in Quantum Theory&quot;. Zeh regarded the wavefunction as a physical entity, rather than a calculational device or a compendium of statistical information (as is typical for Copenhagen-type interpretations), and he proposed that it should evolve unitarily, in accord with the Schrödinger equation, at all times. Zeh was initially unaware of Hugh Everett III&#x27;s earlier work, which also proposed a universal wavefunction evolving unitarily; he revised his paper to reference Everett after learning of Everett&#x27;s &quot;relative-state interpretation&quot; through an article by Bryce DeWitt. (DeWitt was the one who termed Everett&#x27;s proposal the many-worlds interpretation, by which name it is commonly known.) For Zeh, the question of how to interpret quantum mechanics was of key importance, and an interpretation along the lines of Everett&#x27;s was the most natural. Partly because of a general disinterest among physicists for interpretational questions, Zeh&#x27;s work remained comparatively neglected until the early 1980s, when two papers by Wojciech Zurek invigorated the subject. Unlike Zeh&#x27;s publications, Zurek&#x27;s articles were fairly agnostic about interpretation, focusing instead on specific problems of density-matrix dynamics. Zurek&#x27;s interest in decoherence stemmed from furthering Bohr&#x27;s analysis of the double-slit experiment in his reply to the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox, work he had undertaken with Bill Wootters, and he has since argued that decoherence brings a kind of rapprochement between Everettian and Copenhagen-type views.

Decoherence does not claim to provide a mechanism for some actual wave-function collapse; rather it puts forth a reasonable framework for the appearance of wave-function collapse. The quantum nature of the system is simply entangled into the environment so that a total superposition of the wave function still exists, but exists—at least for all practical purposes—beyond the realm of measurement. By definition, the claim that a merged but unmeasurable wave function still exists cannot be proven experimentally. Decoherence is needed to understand why a quantum system begins to obey classical probability rules after interacting with its environment (due to the suppression of the interference terms when applying Born&#x27;s probability rules to the system).

Criticism of the adequacy of decoherence theory to solve the measurement problem has been expressed by Anthony Leggett.

==Mechanisms==
To examine how decoherence operates, an &quot;intuitive&quot; model is presented below. The model requires some familiarity with quantum theory basics. Analogies are made between visualizable classical phase spaces and Hilbert spaces. A more rigorous derivation in Dirac notation shows how decoherence destroys interference effects and the &quot;quantum nature&quot; of systems. Next, the density matrix approach is presented for perspective.

===Phase-space picture===
An &quot;N&quot;-particle system can be represented in non-relativistic quantum mechanics by a wave function formula_1, where each &quot;xi&quot; is a point in 3-dimensional space. This has analogies with the classical phase space. A classical phase space contains a real-valued function in 6&quot;N&quot; dimensions (each particle contributes 3 spatial coordinates and 3 momenta). In this case a &quot;quantum&quot; phase space, on the other hand, involves a complex-valued function on a 3&quot;N&quot;-dimensional space. The position and momenta are represented by operators that do not commute, and formula_2 lives in the mathematical structure of a Hilbert space. Aside from these differences, however, the rough analogy holds.

Different previously isolated, non-interacting systems occupy different phase spaces. Alternatively we can say that they occupy different lower-dimensional subspaces in the phase space of the joint system. The &quot;effective&quot; dimensionality of a system&#x27;s phase space is the number of &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; present, which—in non-relativistic models—is 6 times the number of a system&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; particles. For a macroscopic system this will be a very large dimensionality. When two systems (the environment being one system) start to interact, though, their associated state vectors are no longer constrained to the subspaces. Instead the combined state vector time-evolves a path through the &quot;larger volume&quot;, whose dimensionality is the sum of the dimensions of the two subspaces. The extent to which two vectors interfere with each other is a measure of how &quot;close&quot; they are to each other (formally, their overlap or Hilbert space multiplies together) in the phase space. When a system couples to an external environment, the dimensionality of, and hence &quot;volume&quot; available to, the joint state vector increases enormously. Each environmental degree of freedom contributes an extra dimension.

The original system&#x27;s wave function can be expanded in many different ways as a sum of elements in a quantum superposition. Each expansion corresponds to a projection of the wave vector onto a basis. The basis can be chosen at will. Choosing an expansion where the resulting basis elements interact with the environment in an element-specific way, such elements will—with overwhelming probability—be rapidly separated from each other by their natural unitary time evolution along their own independent paths. After a very short interaction, there is almost no chance of further interference. The process is effectively irreversible. The different elements effectively become &quot;lost&quot; from each other in the expanded phase space created by coupling with the environment. In phase space, this decoupling is monitored through the Wigner quasi-probability distribution. The original elements are said to have &quot;decohered&quot;. The environment has effectively selected out those expansions or decompositions of the original state vector that decohere (or lose phase coherence) with each other. This is called &quot;environmentally-induced superselection&quot;, or einselection. The decohered elements of the system no longer exhibit quantum interference between each other, as in a double-slit experiment. Any elements that decohere from each other via environmental interactions are said to be quantum-entangled with the environment. The converse is not true: not all entangled states are decohered from each other.

Any measuring device or apparatus acts as an environment, since at some stage along the measuring chain, it has to be large enough to be read by humans. It must possess a very large number of hidden degrees of freedom. In effect, the interactions may be considered to be quantum measurements. As a result of an interaction, the wave functions of the system and the measuring device become entangled with each other. Decoherence happens when different portions of the system&#x27;s wave function become entangled in different ways with the measuring device. For two einselected elements of the entangled system&#x27;s state to interfere, both the original system and the measuring in both elements device must significantly overlap, in the scalar product sense. If the measuring device has many degrees of freedom, it is &quot;very&quot; unlikely for this to happen.

As a consequence, the system behaves as a classical statistical ensemble of the different elements rather than as a single coherent quantum superposition of them. From the perspective of each ensemble member&#x27;s measuring device, the system appears to have irreversibly collapsed onto a state with a precise value for the measured attributes, relative to that element. This provides one explanation of how the Born rule coefficients effectively act as probabilities as per the measurement postulate constituting a solution to the quantum measurement problem.

===Dirac notation===
Using Dirac notation, let the system initially be in the state

: formula_3

where the formula_4s form an einselected basis (&quot;environmentally induced selected eigenbasis&quot;), and let the environment initially be in the state formula_5. The vector basis of the combination of the system and the environment consists of the tensor products of the basis vectors of the two subsystems. Thus, before any interaction between the two subsystems, the joint state can be written as

: formula_6

where formula_7 is shorthand for the tensor product formula_8. There are two extremes in the way the system can interact with its environment: either (1) the system loses its distinct identity and merges with the environment (e.g. photons in a cold, dark cavity get converted into molecular excitations within the cavity walls), or (2) the system is not disturbed at all, even though the environment is disturbed (e.g. the idealized non-disturbing measurement). In general, an interaction is a mixture of these two extremes that we examine.

====System absorbed by environment====
If the environment absorbs the system, each element of the total system&#x27;s basis interacts with the environment such that

: formula_9 evolves into formula_10

and so

: formula_11 evolves into formula_12

The unitarity of time evolution demands that the total state basis remains orthonormal, i.e. the scalar or inner products of the basis vectors must vanish, since formula_13:

: formula_14

This orthonormality of the environment states is the defining characteristic required for einselection.

====System not disturbed by environment====
In an idealized measurement, the system disturbs the environment, but is itself undisturbed by the environment. In this case, each element of the basis interacts with the environment such that

: formula_7 evolves into the product formula_16

and so

: formula_11 evolves into formula_18

In this case, unitarity demands that

: formula_19

where formula_20 was used. &quot;Additionally&quot;, decoherence requires, by virtue of the large number of hidden degrees of freedom in the environment, that

: formula_21

As before, this is the defining characteristic for decoherence to become einselection. The approximation becomes more exact as the number of environmental degrees of freedom affected increases.

Note that if the system basis formula_4 were not an einselected basis, then the last condition is trivial, since the disturbed environment is not a function of formula_23, and we have the trivial disturbed environment basis formula_24. This would correspond to the system basis being degenerate with respect to the environmentally defined measurement observable. For a complex environmental interaction (which would be expected for a typical macroscale interaction) a non-einselected basis would be hard to define.

===Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical probabilities===
The utility of decoherence lies in its application to the analysis of probabilities, before and after environmental interaction, and in particular to the vanishing of quantum interference terms after decoherence has occurred. If we ask what is the probability of observing the system making a transition from formula_2 to formula_26 &quot;before&quot; formula_2 has interacted with its environment, then application of the Born probability rule states that the transition probability is the squared modulus of the scalar product of the two states:

:formula_28

where formula_29, formula_30, and formula_31 etc.

The above expansion of the transition probability has terms that involve formula_32; these can be thought of as representing &quot;interference&quot; between the different basis elements or quantum alternatives. This is a purely quantum effect and represents the non-additivity of the probabilities of quantum alternatives.

To calculate the probability of observing the system making a quantum leap from formula_2 to formula_26 &quot;after&quot; formula_2 has interacted with its environment, then application of the Born probability rule states that we must sum over all the relevant possible states formula_36 of the environment &quot;before&quot; squaring the modulus:

: formula_37

The internal summation vanishes when we apply the decoherence/einselection condition formula_38, and the formula simplifies to

: formula_39

If we compare this with the formula we derived before the environment introduced decoherence, we can see that the effect of decoherence has been to move the summation sign formula_40 from inside of the modulus sign to outside. As a result, all the cross- or quantum interference-terms

: formula_41

have vanished from the transition-probability calculation. The decoherence has irreversibly converted quantum behaviour (additive probability amplitudes) to classical behaviour (additive probabilities). 
However, Ballentine shows that the significant impact of decoherence to reduce interference need not have significance for the transition of quantum systems to classical limits.

In terms of density matrices, the loss of interference effects corresponds to the diagonalization of the &quot;environmentally traced-over&quot; density matrix.

=== Density-matrix approach ===
The effect of decoherence on density matrices is essentially the decay or rapid vanishing of the off-diagonal elements of the partial trace of the joint system&#x27;s density matrix, i.e. the trace, with respect to &quot;any&quot; environmental basis, of the density matrix of the combined system &quot;and&quot; its environment. The decoherence irreversibly converts the &quot;averaged&quot; or &quot;environmentally traced-over&quot; density matrix from a pure state to a reduced mixture; it is this that gives the &quot;appearance&quot; of wave-function collapse. Again, this is called &quot;environmentally induced superselection&quot;, or einselection. The advantage of taking the partial trace is that this procedure is indifferent to the environmental basis chosen.

Initially, the density matrix of the combined system can be denoted as

: formula_42

where formula_5 is the state of the environment.
Then if the transition happens before any interaction takes place between the system and the environment, the environment subsystem has no part and can be traced out, leaving the reduced density matrix for the system:

: formula_44

Now the transition probability will be given as

: formula_45

where formula_29, formula_47, and formula_31 etc.

Now the case when transition takes place after the interaction of the system with the environment. The combined density matrix will be

: formula_49

To get the reduced density matrix of the system, we trace out the environment and employ the decoherence/einselection condition and see that the off-diagonal terms vanish (a result obtained by Erich Joos and H. D. Zeh in 1985):

: formula_50

Similarly, the final reduced density matrix after the transition will be

: formula_51

The transition probability will then be given as

: formula_52

which has no contribution from the interference terms

: formula_53

The density-matrix approach has been combined with the Bohmian approach to yield a &quot;reduced-trajectory approach&quot;, taking into account the system reduced density matrix and the influence of the environment.

===Operator-sum representation===
Consider a system &quot;S&quot; and environment (bath) &quot;B&quot;, which are closed and can be treated quantum-mechanically. Let formula_54 and formula_55 be the system&#x27;s and bath&#x27;s Hilbert spaces respectively. Then the Hamiltonian for the combined system is

: formula_56

where formula_57 are the system and bath Hamiltonians respectively, formula_58 is the interaction Hamiltonian between the system and bath, and formula_59 are the identity operators on the system and bath Hilbert spaces respectively. The time-evolution of the density operator of this closed system is unitary and, as such, is given by

: formula_60

where the unitary operator is formula_61. If the system and bath are not entangled initially, then we can write formula_62. Therefore, the evolution of the system becomes

: formula_63

The system–bath interaction Hamiltonian can be written in a general form as

: formula_64

where formula_65 is the operator acting on the combined system–bath Hilbert space, and formula_66 are the operators that act on the system and bath respectively. This coupling of the system and bath is the cause of decoherence in the system alone. To see this, a partial trace is performed over the bath to give a description of the system alone:

: formula_67

formula_68 is called the &quot;reduced density matrix&quot; and gives information about the system only. If the bath is written in terms of its set of orthogonal basis kets, that is, if it has been initially diagonalized, then formula_69. Computing the partial trace with respect to this (computational) basis gives

: formula_70

where formula_71 are defined as the &quot;Kraus operators&quot; and are represented as (the index formula_72 combines indices formula_73 and formula_74):

: formula_75

This is known as the &quot;operator-sum representation&quot; (OSR). A condition on the Kraus operators can be obtained by using the fact that formula_76; this then gives

: formula_77

This restriction determines whether decoherence will occur or not in the OSR. In particular, when there is more than one term present in the sum for formula_68, then the dynamics of the system will be non-unitary, and hence decoherence will take place.

===Semigroup approach===
A more general consideration for the existence of decoherence in a quantum system is given by the &quot;master equation&quot;, which determines how the density matrix of the &quot;system alone&quot; evolves in time (see also the Belavkin equation for the evolution under continuous measurement). This uses the Schrödinger picture, where evolution of the &quot;state&quot; (represented by its density matrix) is considered. The master equation is

: formula_79

where formula_80 is the system Hamiltonian formula_81 along with a (possible) unitary contribution formula_82 from the bath, and formula_83 is the &quot;Lindblad decohering term&quot;. The Lindblad decohering term is represented as
: formula_84

The formula_85 are basis operators for the &quot;M&quot;-dimensional space of bounded operators that act on the system Hilbert space formula_54 and are the &quot;error generators&quot;. The matrix elements formula_87 represent the elements of a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix; they characterize the decohering processes and, as such, are called the &quot;noise parameters&quot;. The semigroup approach is particularly nice, because it distinguishes between the unitary and decohering (non-unitary) processes, which is not the case with the OSR. In particular, the non-unitary dynamics are represented by formula_83, whereas the unitary dynamics of the state are represented by the usual Heisenberg commutator. Note that when formula_89, the dynamical evolution of the system is unitary. The conditions for the evolution of the system density matrix to be described by the master equation are:
# the evolution of the system density matrix is determined by a one-parameter semigroup
# the evolution is &quot;completely positive&quot; (i.e. probabilities are preserved)
# the system and bath density matrices are &quot;initially&quot; decoupled

==Non-unitary modelling examples==
Decoherence can be modelled as a non-unitary process by which a system couples with its environment (although the combined system plus environment evolves in a unitary fashion). Thus the dynamics of the system alone, treated in isolation, are non-unitary and, as such, are represented by irreversible transformations acting on the system&#x27;s Hilbert space formula_90. Since the system&#x27;s dynamics are represented by irreversible representations, then any information present in the quantum system can be lost to the environment or heat bath. Alternatively, the decay of quantum information caused by the coupling of the system to the environment is referred to as decoherence. Thus decoherence is the process by which information of a quantum system is altered by the system&#x27;s interaction with its environment (which form a closed system), hence creating an entanglement between the system and heat bath (environment). As such, since the system is entangled with its environment in some unknown way, a description of the system by itself cannot be made without also referring to the environment (i.e. without also describing the state of the environment).

===Rotational decoherence===
Consider a system of &quot;N&quot; qubits that is coupled to a bath symmetrically. Suppose this system of &quot;N&quot; qubits undergoes a rotation around the formula_91 formula_92 eigenstates of formula_93. Then under such a rotation, a random phase formula_26 will be created between the eigenstates formula_95, formula_96 of formula_93. Thus these basis qubits formula_95 and formula_96 will transform in the following way:

: formula_100

This transformation is performed by the rotation operator

: formula_101

Since any qubit in this space can be expressed in terms of the basis qubits, then all such qubits will be transformed under this rotation. Consider the formula_74th qubit in a pure state formula_103 where formula_104. Before application of the rotation this state is:

:formula_105.

This state will decohere, since it is not ‘encoded’ with (dependent upon) the dephasing factor formula_106. This can be seen by examining the density matrix averaged over the random phase formula_26:

: formula_108,

where formula_109 is a probability measure of the random phase, formula_26. Although not entirely necessary, let us assume for simplicity that this is given by the Gaussian distribution, &quot;i.e.&quot; formula_111, where formula_112 represents the spread of the random phase. Then the density matrix computed as above is

:formula_113.

Observe that the off-diagonal elements—the coherence terms—decay as the spread of the random phase, formula_112, increases over time (which is a realistic expectation). Thus the density matrices for each qubit of the system become indistinguishable over time. This means that no measurement can distinguish between the qubits, thus creating decoherence between the various qubit states. In particular, this dephasing process causes the qubits to collapse to one of the pure states in formula_115. This is why this type of decoherence process is called collective dephasing, because the &quot;mutual&quot; phases between &quot;all&quot; qubits of the &quot;N&quot;-qubit system are destroyed.

===Depolarizing===
Depolarizing is a non-unitary transformation on a quantum system which maps pure states to mixed states. This is a non-unitary process because any transformation that reverses this process will map states out of their respective Hilbert space thus not preserving positivity (i.e. the original probabilities are mapped to negative probabilities, which is not allowed). The 2-dimensional case of such a transformation would consist of mapping pure states on the surface of the Bloch sphere to mixed states within the Bloch sphere. This would contract the Bloch sphere by some finite amount and the reverse process would expand the Bloch sphere, which cannot happen.

===Dissipation===

Dissipation is a decohering process by which the populations of quantum states are changed due to entanglement with a bath. An example of this would be a quantum system that can exchange its energy with a bath through the interaction Hamiltonian. If the system is not in its ground state and the bath is at a temperature lower than that of the system&#x27;s, then the system will give off energy to the bath, and thus higher-energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian will decohere to the ground state after cooling and, as such, will all be non-degenerate. Since the states are no longer degenerate, they are not distinguishable, and thus this process is irreversible (non-unitary).

==Timescales==
Decoherence represents an extremely fast process for macroscopic objects, since these are interacting with many microscopic objects, with an enormous number of degrees of freedom in their natural environment. The process is needed if we are to understand why we tend not to observe quantum behavior in everyday macroscopic objects and why we do see classical fields emerge from the properties of the interaction between matter and radiation for large amounts of matter. The time taken for off-diagonal components of the density matrix to effectively vanish is called the decoherence time. It is typically extremely short for everyday, macroscale processes. A modern basis-independent definition of the decoherence time relies on the short-time behavior of the fidelity between the initial and the time-dependent state or, equivalently, the decay of the purity.

==Mathematical details==
Assume for the moment that the system in question consists of a subsystem &quot;A&quot; being studied and the &quot;environment&quot; formula_116, and the total Hilbert space is the tensor product of a Hilbert space formula_117 describing &quot;A&quot; and a Hilbert space formula_118 describing formula_116, that is,

:formula_120

This is a reasonably good approximation in the case where &quot;A&quot; and formula_116 are relatively independent (e.g. there is nothing like parts of &quot;A&quot; mixing with parts of formula_116 or conversely). The point is, the interaction with the environment is for all practical purposes unavoidable (e.g. even a single excited atom in a vacuum would emit a photon, which would then go off). Let&#x27;s say this interaction is described by a unitary transformation &quot;U&quot; acting upon formula_123. Assume that the initial state of the environment is formula_124, and the initial state of &quot;A&quot; is the superposition state

: formula_125

where formula_126 and formula_127 are orthogonal, and there is no entanglement initially. Also, choose an orthonormal basis formula_128 for formula_117. (This could be a &quot;continuously indexed basis&quot; or a mixture of continuous and discrete indexes, in which case we would have to use a rigged Hilbert space and be more careful about what we mean by orthonormal, but that&#x27;s an inessential detail for expository purposes.) Then, we can expand

: formula_130

and

: formula_131

uniquely as

: formula_132

and

: formula_133

respectively. One thing to realize is that the environment contains a huge number of degrees of freedom, a good number of them interacting with each other all the time. This makes the following assumption reasonable in a handwaving way, which can be shown to be true in some simple toy models. Assume that there exists a basis for formula_118 such that formula_135 and formula_136 are all approximately orthogonal to a good degree if &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot; and the same thing for formula_137 and formula_138 and also for formula_135 and formula_138 for any &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; (the decoherence property).

This often turns out to be true (as a reasonable conjecture) in the position basis because how &quot;A&quot; interacts with the environment would often depend critically upon the position of the objects in &quot;A&quot;. Then, if we take the partial trace over the environment, we would find the density state is approximately described by

:formula_141

that is, we have a diagonal mixed state, there is no constructive or destructive interference, and the &quot;probabilities&quot; add up classically. The time it takes for &quot;U&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) (the unitary operator as a function of time) to display the decoherence property is called the decoherence time.

==Experimental observations==

===Quantitative measurement===
The decoherence rate depends on a number of factors, including temperature or uncertainty in position, and many experiments have tried to measure it depending on the external environment.

The process of a quantum superposition gradually obliterated by decoherence was quantitatively measured for the first time by Serge Haroche and his co-workers at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris in 1996. Their approach involved sending individual rubidium atoms, each in a superposition of two states, through a microwave-filled cavity. The two quantum states both cause shifts in the phase of the microwave field, but by different amounts, so that the field itself is also put into a superposition of two states. Due to photon scattering on cavity-mirror imperfection, the cavity field loses phase coherence to the environment. Haroche and his colleagues measured the resulting decoherence via correlations between the states of pairs of atoms sent through the cavity with various time delays between the atoms.

In July 2011, researchers from University of British Columbia and University of California, Santa Barbara showed that applying high magnetic fields to single molecule magnets suppressed two of three known sources of decoherence. They were able to measure the dependence of decoherence on temperature and magnetic field strength.

== Prevention ==

===Concept===
Decoherence causes the system to lose its quantumness, which invalidates the superposition principle and turns &#x27;quantum&#x27; to &#x27;classical&#x27;. It is a major challenge in quantum computing.

A real quantum system inevitably meets the surrounding environment, the interaction shows up as noise in physical process. It&#x27;s extremely sensitive to environmental noise. Electromagnetic fields, temperature fluctuations, and other external perturbations, as well as measurement, lead to decoherence.

Decoherence is a challenge for the practical realization of quantum computers, since such machines are expected to rely heavily on the undisturbed evolution of quantum coherences. They require that the coherence of states be preserved and that decoherence be managed, in order to actually perform quantum computation. Because of decoherence, we need to finish the quantum process before the qubit state is decayed.

The physical quantity coherence time is defined as the time that the quantum state holds its superposition principle.

The purpose of against decoherence is to extend the coherence time of quantum systems. It will improve the stability of the computing of information.

=== Methods and Tools ===
Researchers have developed many methods and tools to mitigate or eliminate the negative influences from decoherence. Several typical ways are listed below.

==== Isolation from Environment ====
The most basic and direct way to reduce decoherence is to prevent the quantum system from interacting with the environment by any type of isolation. Here are some typical examples of isolation methods.

* High Vacuum: Placing qubits in an ultra-high vacuum environment to minimize interaction with air molecules.
* Cryogenic Cooling: Operating quantum systems at extremely low temperatures to reduce thermal vibrations and noise.
* Electromagnetic Shielding: Enclosing quantum systems in materials that block external electromagnetic fields - such as mu-metal or superconducting materials - reduces decoherence caused by unwanted electromagnetic interference.
* Shielding Cosmic Rays: In August 2020 scientists reported that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays may substantially limit the coherence times of qubits if they aren&#x27;t shielded adequately which may be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers in the future.
* Better Materials: Fabricating qubits from special materials, like highly pure or isotopically enriched ones, to minimize intrinsic noise of the material, including noise from defects or nuclear spins.
* Circuit Design: Optimizing the coherence ability when designing the construction of quantum circuits, similar to the concern in classical circuits.
* Mechanical and Optical Isolation: Using equipment like vibration isolation tables and acoustic isolation materials, reducing sources of mechanical noise, and shielding against external light—common in physical experiments.

==== Quantum Error Correction (QEC) ====

One of the most powerful tools for combating quantum decoherence is Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC schemes encode quantum information redundantly across multiple physical qubits, allowing for the detection and correction of errors without directly measuring the quantum state. These QEC protocols rely on the assumption that errors affect only a small fraction of qubits at any given time, enabling the detection and correction of errors through redundant encoding. Here are some representative QEC protocols.

* Shor Code: One of the first quantum error correction codes, it encodes a single qubit into nine physical qubits to protect against both bit-flip and phase-flip errors.

* Steane Code: A 7-qubit code that provides error correction for arbitrary errors.

* Surface Codes: A more scalable error correction code that uses a 2D lattice of qubits with high threshold for errors.

* Bosonic Codes: A type of quantum error-correcting code designed specifically to protect quantum information in continuous-variable systems.

However, QEC comes at a significant cost: it requires a large number of physical qubits to encode a single logical qubit, and fault-tolerant error correction methods introduce additional computational overhead.

==== Dynamical Decoupling ====
Dynamical Decoupling (DD) is another typical quantum control technique used against decoherence, especially for systems that are coupled to noisy environments. DD involves applying an external sequence of control pulses to the quantum system at strategically timed intervals to average out environmental interactions. This technique effectively manipulates the irreversible component of quantum systems interact with surrounding environment by the external controllable interactions. Dynamical decoupling has been experimentally demonstrated in various systems, including trapped ions and superconducting qubits. Here are some examples of representative sequences.

* Spin Echo (SE): SE is the consisting of a single π-pulse, which inverts the state of system.

* Periodic Dynamical Decoupling (PDD): Appling control pulse periodically, PDD averages out the influence of the environment and decoupling the qubit.

* Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) Sequence: CPMG is an extension of SE. It applies a series of π-pulses.

<text>The Harmony toolkit is a free software widget toolkit that aimed to be API compatible with the then non-GPL licensed Qt widget toolkit. The QPL license that Qt used was free only if the program was not sold for profit and if its source code was freely available. It was later released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

In addition to source compatibility with Qt, the Harmony project also aimed to add functionality such as multi-threaded applications and pluggable themes, features that Qt itself later added.

The GNU Project launched the Harmony project, and also the GNOME desktop project, to counter the perceived problem that the free software KDE desktop was gaining popularity but was requiring that people install non GPL licensed software. In July 1997 the GNU Project called for volunteers for a Qt replacement in GNU&#x27;s Bulletin and listed it as a top priority task on its website.

Development ceased at the end of 2000, when Qt was released under the GPL, removing the perceived need for the Harmony Project to exist. In January 2009 Qt itself was made available under the GNU LGPL, along with the previous license options.

<text>A jazz scale is any musical scale used in jazz. Many &quot;jazz scales&quot; are common scales drawn from Western European classical music, including the diatonic, whole-tone, octatonic (or diminished), and the modes of the ascending melodic minor. All of these scales were commonly used by late nineteenth and early twentieth-century composers such as Rimsky-Korsakov, Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky, often in ways that directly anticipate jazz practice. Some jazz scales, such as the eight-note bebop scales, add additional chromatic passing tones to the familiar seven-note diatonic scales.

== Theory ==

One important feature of jazz is what theorists call &quot;the principles of chord-scale compatibility&quot;: the idea that a sequence of chords will generate a sequence of compatible scales. In classical major-mode harmony, chords typically belong to the same scale. For example, a ii–V–I progression in C major will typically use only the notes of the C diatonic collection. In jazz, a four-chord progression may use four different scales, often as the result of chordal alterations.

For instance, in C major, a jazz musician may alter the V chord, G7 (G–B–D–F), with a flattened fifth, producing the chord G75 (G–B–D–F). An improviser might then choose a scale containing these four notes, such as the G whole tone scale, the G octatonic scale, or a mode of either D or A melodic minor ascending. In each case, the scale contains the chord tones G–B–D–F and is said to be compatible with it. This notion of &quot;chord scale compatibility&quot; marks a fundamental difference between jazz harmony and traditional classical practice.

An avoid note is a note in a jazz scale that is considered, in jazz theory and practice, too dissonant to be emphasised against the underlying chord, and so is either avoided, used as a passing tone or chromatically altered. For example, in major-key harmony the 4th, and thus the 11th, is an avoid note and is therefore either treated as a passing tone or is augmented (raised a semitone). Avoid notes are often a minor second (or a minor ninth) above a chord tone or a perfect fourth above the root of the chord.

[One] can get a good sense of the difference between classical and non-classical harmony from looking at how they deal with dissonances. Classical treats all notes that don&#x27;t belong to the chord (i.e., the triad) as potential dissonances to be resolved. ... Non-classical harmony just tells you which note in the scale to avoid [&quot;what is sometimes called an avoid-note&quot;] (because it&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; dissonant), meaning that all the others are okay.

==Modes of the major scale==

The number of scales available to improvising musicians continues to expand. As modern techniques and musical constructions appear, jazz players find the ones they can put into compositions or use as material for melodic exploration. Prominent examples are the seven modes of the diatonic major scale and added-note scales.

Compare each of the modes to the major scale for clues as to the subtle differences between them. Ionian is based on the 1st degree of the major scale, Dorian on the 2nd, Phrygian on the 3rd, etc.

==Bebop scales==
Bebop scales add a single chromatic passing tone to the seven-note major scale (Ionian and Mixolydian modes). The added passing tone creates an eight-note scale that fits rhythmically evenly within a measure of 8 eighth notes, thus making it useful in practicing. When an eighth note bebop scale run starts on the beat from a chord tone (i.e. the root, third, fifth or seventh) the other chord notes will also fall on the beat. As a result, all of the nonchord tones will fall on upbeats.

There are two commonly used types of bebop scale:

# The dominant bebop scale, which adds a chromatic passing tone between the 7th and the root.
#: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 8/4
 c4^\markup { Bebop dominant scale on C } d e f g a bes b! c
&lt;/score&gt;
# The major bebop scale, which adds a chromatic passing tone between the 5th and 6th notes.
#: &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble \time 8/4
 c4^\markup { Bebop major scale on C } d e f g gis a b c
&lt;/score&gt;

==Modes of the melodic minor scale==
A great deal of modern jazz harmony arises from the modes of the ascending form of the melodic minor scale, also known as the &quot;jazz melodic minor scale&quot;. This scale is essentially a diatonic major scale with a lowered third, for example A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A. As with any other scale, the modes are derived from playing the scale from different root notes, causing a series of jazz scales to emerge.


==Diminished scale==
Sometimes called the &quot;octatonic scale&quot; because it contains eight tones, the diminished scale is composed of a series of alternating half and whole steps. There are two types of diminished scales, one starts with a half step and the other starts with a whole step. The two scales are modes of one another.

Because of the repetition of the interval pattern after only two notes, each note in the scale can be the root in another symmetric diminished scale. For example, the C diminished scale of the half-step-first type, has the same notes as the half-step-first E diminished scale as well as the whole-step-first D diminished scale. All three are composed of the same eight pitches: C–D–E–E–F–G–A–B–C.

Because of the symmetry of the diminished scale, there are only three distinct diminished scales (shown to the right). The others are all modes of these three.

==Whole tone scale==

The whole tone scale, consisting exclusively of whole steps, is often used on V75 chords. Since they are symmetrical, there are only two distinct whole tone scales.
==Pentatonic scales==

Two pentatonic scales common to jazz are the &quot;major pentatonic scale&quot; and the &quot;minor pentatonic scale&quot;. They are both modes of one another.

The major pentatonic scale begins with a major scale and omits the fourth and the seventh scale degrees. The minor pentatonic scale uses the same notes as the major pentatonic scale, but begins on the sixth scale degree of the corresponding major scale. In this nomenclature, minor is employed in the sense of relative key, as the diatonic A minor scale is the relative minor of the diatonic C major scale.

Jazz improvisers, particularly bassist and guitarist, use these scales in a number of interesting ways. For example, over Bmaj711, one can use a major pentatonic based on the 2nd scale degree of B (C–D–E–G–A) to imply 9–3–11–13–7, respectively. Similarly, over a fully altered F7 chord, one can use the same major pentatonic, this time based on the tritone (C–D–E–G–A) to imply 5–13–7–9–9, respectively.

==Blues scale==
The term &quot;blues scale&quot; refers to several different scales with differing numbers of pitches and related characteristics. The six-note blues scale consists of the minor pentatonic scale plus a chromatic passing tone between the 4 and 5. This added note can be spelled as either 5 or 4. Guitarists often mix the major and minor pentatonics together along with the blues scale.

Another common blues scale has nine notes (shown to the right). Winthrop Sargeant defines this scale as &quot;a definite series of tones within an octave used as the basis of a musical composition,&quot; compiled instead from multiple compositions and improvisations (according to Stearns: &quot;a great many jazz records&quot;) and is hypothesized as displaying the influence of African music. The E and B are blue notes.
==Harmonic minor scale==

The harmonic minor scale is also of value to many improvisors, as it provides an alternative color for many common chords and chord progressions. The A harmonic minor scale can be used on the chords of a piece in A minor, especially on the minor ii–V–i chord progression.

One of the most common uses of the harmonic minor scale is its fifth mode (phrygian dominant scale), which is a frequently used over dominant chords.

==Altered dominant scale==

The altered dominant scale, also called the altered scale, is so named because all the scale members that can be altered relative to the basic dominant scale (the Mixolydian mode), without losing the dominant quality, are altered. The scale includes both altered fifths (5 and 5) and both altered ninths (9 and 9).

*Starting on G, it contains the notes: G, A, B, C, D, E and F.
*Starting on C, it contains the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A and B.

The altered fifths coincide enharmonically with the 11 and the 13 which would also be considered altered relative to their Mixolydian forms. The tonic, major third (as a diminished fourth), and dominant seventh are retained as essential to the dominant quality.

The scale can also be understood as a mode of the ascending melodic minor scale starting from the 7th scale degree. For a G7 chord, the A melodic minor scale starting from G produces the G altered dominant scale.

This scale is also called the &quot;super-Locrian scale&quot;, as it is indeed reminiscent of a Locrian scale with a 4, but it is usually regarded as that of major quality. Another name for this scale is the diminished whole-tone scale due to its resemblance to the lower part of the diminished scale and the upper part of the whole tone scale.

<doc id="185741" wikidata="Q2420955" url="?curid=185741" title="Sami Al-Arian">
<text>Sami Amin Al-Arian (; born January 14, 1958) is a Kuwaiti-born political activist of Palestinian origin who was a computer engineering professor at University of South Florida. During the Clinton administration and Bush administration, he was invited to the White House. He actively campaigned for the Bush presidential campaign in the United States presidential election in 2000.

After a contentious interview with Bill O&#x27;Reilly on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; following the September 11 attacks, Al-Arian&#x27;s tenure at University of South Florida came under public scrutiny.

He was indicted in February 2003 on 17 counts under the Patriot Act. A jury acquitted him on 8 counts and deadlocked on the remaining 9 counts. He later struck a plea bargain and admitted to one of the remaining charges in exchange for being released and deported by April 2007. However, as his release date approached, a federal prosecutor in Virginia demanded he testify before a grand jury in a separate case, which he refused to do, claiming it would violate his plea deal. He was held under house arrest in Northern Virginia from 2008 until 2014 when federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss charges against him.

Al-Arian&#x27;s activities and connections became a factor in multiple political campaigns, including the 2004 United States Senate election in Florida and the 2010 United States Senate election in California.

He was deported to Turkey on February 4, 2015.

==Early life and education==
===Kuwait and Egypt===
Al-Arian was born on January 14, 1958, in Kuwait. His parents, Amin and Laila Al-Arian, were Palestinian refugees who left after the creation of Israel in 1948. After the 1948 Palestine war, Amin had to leave behind the family soap factory in Jaffa and flee towards the Gaza Strip&#x27;s refugee camps. Amin&#x27;s family migrated to Kuwait in 1957 where Sami Al-Arian was born. Under Kuwaiti law, his parents had legal resident status but he was not eligible for citizenship. In 1966, his family left Kuwait and went back to Egypt. He received his primary and secondary education at Cairo, Egypt. He left Egypt in 1975, and returned in 1979 for a visit when he married Nahla Al-Najjar.

===United States===
Sponsored by his father, Sami went to America for education. In 1975, Al-Arian came to the United States to study engineering at Southern Illinois University. In 1978, he graduated with a major in Electrical Sciences and Systems Engineering. At North Carolina State University, he earned his master&#x27;s degree in 1980 and doctorate in 1985. He worked with Professor Dharma P. Agrawal on physical failures and fault models of CMOS circuits.

==Tenured at University of South Florida==
He moved to Temple Terrace after he was hired as an assistant professor to teach computer engineering at University of South Florida (USF) on January 22, 1986. He was granted permanent resident status for United States in March 1989. He was promoted from an assistant professor to an associate professor with tenure. He received many accolades relating to teaching including the Jerome Krivanek Distinguished Teacher Award in 1993 and a salary raise based on merit grades via the Teaching Incentive Program in 1994.

==Activism==
===Community involvement and WISE===
He was very involved in the local community. He served as an imam for a local mosque and as a charter officer for the local religious school. In 1992, he hosted a local cable-access show — &quot;Peace be upon you&quot;.

Al-Arian criticized the peace process led by Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and advocated support for the Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation during the 1980s and early 1990s. On October 20, 1988, Al-Arian established the Islamic Concern Project, which included a committee devoted to raising charity for Palestine. In 1990–91, his continued involvement in promoting dialogue between the West and Middle East led to the creation of World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), which served as a think tank that promoted public policy initiatives. WISE and University of South Florida formally agreed to cooperate on March 11, 1992. WISE published journals, supported graduate student education, and held seminars between American and Middle Eastern scholars.

===Emerson film and investigation===
Steve Emerson published a film in November 1994 that accused WISE as a terrorist front organization which Al-Arian vehemently denied. In May 1995, Michael Fechter of the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; expanded on Emerson&#x27;s film. Sami Al-Arian&#x27;s daughter, Laila Al-Arian, lambasted Emerson and the Tribune for publishing photographs of their home, school, and family car. In November 1995, federal agents investigating &quot;violations of perjury and immigration laws&quot; searched Sami Al-Arian&#x27;s home for six hours to seize bank statements dating as far back as 1986, airline passes, telephone bills, AAA travel maps, family videotapes, audiotapes, and computer disks. A three-month independent inquiry was led by prominent Tampa lawyer and former USF President William Reece Smith that involved hundreds of documents and 59 interviews. The investigation reported in May 1996 that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; to support the allegation that Al-Arian or WISE supported terrorism. The report went on to conclude that University of South Florida officials acted appropriately in collaborating with WISE. The 99-page report was lauded by USF President Betty Castor for its &quot;comprehensive, thoughtful, and detailed analysis&quot;. In June 1996, Florida universities Chancellor Charles Reed also said their investigation found no links between WISE and terror organizations.

In May 1996, Villanova University canceled a seminar that involved many speakers including Al-Arian after the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) complained about the possibility of riots. The Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), the United States&#x27;s largest association of Middle East scholars, approved a resolution that rebuked ADL for &quot;creating an atmosphere of intimidation that resulted in the cancellation of an academic event&quot;. USF placed Al-Arian on paid administrative leave in May 1996 pending the outcome of a federal investigation which had an indefinite time frame. Students complained in August 1997 after a graduation requirement course taught by Al-Arian was cancelled. After consultation with authorities who brought no charges after a three-year federal investigation, USF decided to reinstate him in August 1998.

===Citizenship===
He applied for U.S. citizenship in January 1994. Although he was informed that he passed all of the requirements to obtain citizenship in September 1994, he was neither granted nor denied citizenship. Federal law requires notification within 120 days after the citizenship examination. In October 1995, he filed suit for a judge to award him citizenship directly. His petition for citizenship was denied in March 1996 for allegedly unlawfully voting in a 1994 Hillsborough County local election.

===Mazen Al-Najjar===
Sami Al-Arian&#x27;s brother-in-law Mazen Al-Najjar was jailed for nearly five years, accused of having links to Palestinian terrorists. In May 1997, Al-Najjar was incarcerated in Miami, Florida without charge and was held in jail indefinitely on the basis of secret evidence. Although Judge McHugh found Al-Najjar to be a respected member of a community, McHugh denied bail on the basis of secret evidence in May 1997. In May 2000, U.S. district judge John A. Leonard ordered a rehearing because Al-Najjar&#x27;s right to due process had been violated when the government did not cede evidence in order for Al-Najjar to defend himself. During the first day of the rehearing in August 2000, the government called Al-Arian to testify. Several legal analysts and Al-Arian were convinced that Al-Arian, not Al-Najjar, was the focus of the Al-Najjar&#x27;s court case. On the advice of his attorney, Al-Arian cited the 5th Amendment to 99 of 102 questions. Because Al-Najjar was a Palestinian born in Gaza during Egyptian control of the region, Al-Najjar essentially had no citizenship anywhere and the allegations that he was connected to terrorists had ruined attempts to find a country to take him, his wife, and three young daughters. Al-Najjar was released in December 2000 after a judge ruled the government had no evidence to continue holding him. He overstayed his US student visa, and was deported in August 2002.

===Political involvement===
Inspired by Al-Najjar&#x27;s predicament, Al-Arian co-founded the Tampa Bay Coalition for Peace and Justice, which focused on the use of secret evidence and other civil rights issues in Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. In 2000, Al-Arian co-founded and led the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom. &quot;Newsweek&quot; named him as a &quot;premier civil rights activist&quot; for his efforts to repeal the use of secret evidence in trials.

Al-Arian visited the White House four times from 1997 to 2001.

During the 2000 presidential election, Al-Arian contacted Al Gore&#x27;s campaign and Bush&#x27;s campaign to address the use of secret evidence to detain U.S. citizens without charge. Al-Arian met Bush during a campaign stop at the Florida Strawberry Festival to demonstrate against the Clinton administration&#x27;s use of secret evidence. After presidential debates in which Bush decried the use of secret evidence as a form of racial profiling against Arab-Americans, Al-Arian began campaigning for Bush as the candidate most likely to end discrimination. During the White House briefing that announced Bush as the winner of the election, Al-Arian received a spot in the front row for his voter outreach efforts in Florida. On June 20, 2001, Al-Arian joined 160 Muslim-American activists in a White House briefing with Bush senior adviser Karl Rove. But in a separate White House event on June 28, his son Abdullah – a congressional intern – made national headlines when he was escorted out by Secret Service without explanation. Twenty four Muslim community leaders walked out also to protest Abdullah&#x27;s ejection. The Secret Service later apologized for the incident citing &quot;confusion by one of its guards&quot;. President Bush personally apologized in a letter to Nahla and thanked the family for their charitable contributions to the Muslim communities around the world.

The Tampa Bay Muslim Alliance (TBMA) and Al-Arian had helped the resettlement of 50 families fleeing from the Bosnian War. Al-Arian and other leaders of TBMA condemned the September 11 attacks in the immediate aftermath. Al-Arian encouraged the nation to pursue those responsible but simultaneously discouraged acts of war that might impact innocent people. He discouraged radio talk show hosts from spreading hate-filled rhetoric and called for national unity. Al-Arian led the local Muslim community in organizing a blood drive in solidarity with the victims of September 11.

Al-Arian had opposed the War in Iraq and has spoken at a rally against the war. He has also been critical of neoconservatism and the Zionist movement.

===Education===
Al-Arian co-founded the Islamic Academy of Florida. After his criminal indictment, the school dissolved itself in 2004, with the new American Youth Academy using the former Islamic Academy buildings and equipment, with most of the students remaining.

==O&#x27;Reilly controversy==
===Television interview===
On September 26, 2001, Al-Arian was invited to appear on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; to discuss Arab-American reactions to the 9/11 attacks. O&#x27;Reilly never addressed the reactions of Arab-Americans and confronted Al-Arian with a 1988 recording of him shouting &quot;death to Israel&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly ended his interview by calling for the Central Intelligence Agency to shadow Al-Arian. USF spokesman Michael Reich said that &quot;O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s comments were nothing but speculation.&quot; The O&#x27;Reilly interview caused Al-Arian to receive death threats from throughout the country.

===Academic freedom===
In October 2001, USF president Judy Genshaft placed Al-Arian on paid administrative leave and prohibited Al-Arian from entering USF property because she believed Al-Arian&#x27;s presence would compromise campus security. During winter recess when students and faculty were on leave in December 2001, Genshaft and the USF Board of Trustees declared their intention to fire Al-Arian from teaching at USF because of academic disruption and problems for campus safety. The Faculty Senate President Gregory Paveza condemned the intention to fire as underhanded because the professors did not have their voices heard. The faculty adviser to the Board of Trustees resigned in protest of the firing. The Faculty Senate held an emergency meeting in January 2002 in which they approved by a wide majority a resolution that condemned the firing as an assault on academic freedom. United Faculty of Florida, the faculty union representing USF professors, voted to throw its full support behind Al-Arian and condemned the university for exaggerating security concerns.

CNN did an interview with Al-Arian in January 2002 in which Al-Arian accused the university of allowing those who make death threats to dictate the limits of academic freedom. Florida Governor Jeb Bush entered into the fray when he offered support for Genshaft&#x27;s decision for Al-Arian&#x27;s dismissal. An editorial from &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Bush and the university&#x27;s handling of the case as an affront to freedom of speech. In late January, several student organizations at USF rallied on campus to protest Genshaft&#x27;s firing of Al-Arian. At the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Lakeland in February 2002, Al-Arian discussed the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and answered questions from the community regarding his USF quandary. Roy Weatherford, the President of the USF Faculty Union, lambasted the decision to fire Al-Arian in front of Genshaft in a faculty summit in March 2002. Following the summit, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) revealed that it was conducting an investigation on Genshaft to determine if she had violated academic freedom. In late April 2002, AAUP investigators reported that Genshaft was wavering on her decision to fire Al-Arian, especially if the university was officially censured. AAUP investigators went on to conclude that Genshaft&#x27;s decision to place Al-Arian on paid administrative leave rather than suspension reflected her lack of faith in legal advice that green-lighted Al-Arian&#x27;s firing. USF denied the report and denied that AAUP&#x27;s decision for censure would factor in Al-Arian&#x27;s firing.

The largest national teachers&#x27; union, American Federation of Teachers, called on Genshaft in July 2002 to protect academic freedom by the reinstatement of Al-Arian. AAUP&#x27;s investigating committee determined USF&#x27;s premise for Al-Arian&#x27;s removal was &quot;insubstantial&quot; and cited &quot;grave issues of academic freedom and due process&quot;. Civil libertarians and professors nationwide condemned USF for willingly capitulating to post-9/11 hysteria. Former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent Vincent Cannistraro publicly rebuked allegations against Al-Arian and testified in a civil disposition that Al-Arian had no ties to illegal organizations.

The investments of the Genshaft Family Foundation (GFF) in corporate bonds of the Industrial Development Bank of Israel came under scrutiny in September 2002. Several internet petitions also cited Genshaft&#x27;s Jewish faith to raise support against Al-Arian. Genshaft denied knowing about the corporate bonds and said her decisions were neither affected by her investments nor her religion in the Al Arian case. John Esposito, a prominent scholar of Middle East, cancelled his USF speech in October 2002 to protest Genshaft&#x27;s contraventions on academic freedom.

Because Genshaft feared the punitive lawsuits if she fired Al-Arian, Genshaft continued to pursue the Al-Arian&#x27;s dismissal through an unusual step in which she asked Hillsborough Circuit Court to determine whether firing Al-Arian would violate Al-Arian&#x27;s First Amendment rights. District Court judge Susan Bucklew dismissed Genshaft&#x27;s case in December 2002. After Al-Arian filed a grievance contending that Genshaft broke the union contract by disciplining Al-Arian, Genshaft reversed course and affirmed Al-Arian was never disciplined. But a week after a federal indictment on Al-Arian, Genshaft fired him on February 27, 2003, by using the indictment as legal cover to protect the university from any ensuing lawsuit.

===Loftus lawsuit===
In March 2002, John Loftus compounded on O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s accusations by citing anonymous sources and filing a lawsuit that claimed Al-Arian used state-regulated organizations to launder money. Al-Arian&#x27;s defense team derided the lawsuit as a publicity seeking stunt and suggested Loftus needed mental treatment. Loftus&#x27;s lawsuit was summarily dismissed by the judge for failing to adequately show how Loftus was personally injured by Al-Arian&#x27;s alleged activities.

==Indictment==
===Indictment===
After one of the Justice Department&#x27;s longest-running and most controversial terrorism investigations, federal prosecutors filed an indictment on February 21, 2003, which charged Al-Arian with racketeering for Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Al-Arian was indicted with co-defendants Ghassan Ballut, Hatim Fariz, and Sameeh Hammoudeh. Attorney General John Ashcroft hailed the vastly expanded powers of the Patriot Act as fundamental to the indictment. Arab American groups condemned the indictment as persecution for Al-Arian&#x27;s advocacy of Palestinian causes. Local community activists, Iraq war protesters, and Muslim-Americans held demonstrations regularly on Al-Arian&#x27;s affair in the weeks following the indictment. Al-Arian labeled his arrest a consequence of post-9/11 hysteria at a public pronouncement in front of a courthouse rally by his supporters.

In the wake of the indictment of Al-Arian, he became a major issue in the 2004 United States Senate election in Florida. Former USF president Castor, running for Senate, was attacked in the Democratic primary election by opponent Congressman Peter Deutsch and an allied 527 group and in the general election by opponent former HUD Secretary Mel Martinez for not denoucing or firing Al-Arian.

===Trial===
Al-Arian&#x27;s five-month, 13-day trial began with frenzied attention from national media outlets. The prosecution&#x27;s case was built largely on FBI wiretaps and fax transmissions gathered between 1994 and the time of Mr. Al-Arian&#x27;s arrest in 2003. The surveillance included roughly 20,000 hours of dialogue from 472,000 wiretapped telephone conversations on 18 tapped lines gathered from 1994 to 2003. While such wiretaps taken by the intelligence arm of the FBI are usually kept secret from federal criminal investigators, provisions in the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allow their use in certain trials dealing with terrorism. At the end of the prosecution&#x27;s case, Al-Arian&#x27;s lawyers chose not to present any witnesses in his defense and rested without offering a defense, hoping to leave the burden of proof squarely on the government&#x27;s shoulders. The trial concluded in November 2005. After 13 days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Al-Arian in December on 8 of 17 counts and deadlocked on the remaining nine. Two co-defendants were acquitted of all charges and another co-defendant was also acquitted on majority of his charges. The verdict was seen as a major embarrassment to the government&#x27;s prosecution and to the Patriot Act.

At trial, the prosecution accused Al-Arian of aiding Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), which the Clinton administration issued an executive order declaring the PIJ a &quot;specially designated terrorist&quot; organization in 1995. The executive order barred &quot;making or receiving contributions, funds, goods or services&quot; to benefit the PIJ. Federal prosecutors also presented several transcripts of phone calls, but none involved any discussion of an attack against the U.S. or reflected advance knowledge of attacks in the Middle East.

In April 2005, the faculty union United Faculty of Florida passed resolutions to send a representative to Al-Arian&#x27;s trial and to express support for Al-Arian&#x27;s constitutional right to a fair trial with fair treatment of prisoners.

===Plea agreement===
On February 28, 2006, Al-Arian signed a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to contribute services to or for the benefit of the PIJ, a Specially Designated Terrorist organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. In return, the U.S. Attorney: a) agreed to dismiss the other eight remaining charges in the superseding indictment; b) agreed not to charge Al-Arian with any other crimes known to the government at the time of the execution of the agreement; c) agreed not to enter any recommendation as to the imposition or amount of a fine; d) agreed with Al-Arian that an appropriate sentence would be 46–57 months in prison; and e) covenanted that if no adverse information were received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted, the U.S. would recommend that Al-Arian receive a sentence &quot;at the low end of the applicable guideline range, as calculated by the Court&quot;. As part of the deal, Al-Arian agreed to be deported once his prison sentence ended. The plea agreement provided that it was &quot;limited to the Office of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida and the Counterterrorism Section of the Department of Justice, and cannot bind other federal, state, or local prosecuting authorities.&quot; It also provided that it &quot;constitutes the entire agreement between the government and [Al-Arian] ... and no other promises, agreements, or representations exist or have been made to [Al-Arian]&quot;. The district court judge asked Al-Arian whether he had been promised anything else by anyone to induce his guilty plea, and he said that he had not. The plea agreement was unsealed and accepted by Judge James S. Moody on April 17, 2006. The count carried a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. Al-Arian remained in custody pending his sentencing and deportation. The deal came after 11 years of Federal Bureau of Investigation investigations, wiretaps and searches, and three and a half years of trial preparation, time Al-Arian spent in jail, most of it in solitary confinement.

Supporters of Al-Arian said the agreement was reached in part to end his family&#x27;s suffering and to reunite them.

===Sentencing===
Judge Moody sentenced al-Arian to the maximum 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release on May 1, 2006, and gave him credit for time served. Prosecutors said al-Arian would serve the balance of 19 months, and then be deported. In his ruling, Moody harshly criticized al-Arian. Al-Arian went on a 62-day hunger strike to protest the ruling.

Amnesty International demanded his immediate release and called for an investigation on his treatment in prison. It deemed his pre-trial detention conditions to be &quot;gratuitously punitive&quot; and &quot;inconsistent with international standards for humane treatment&quot;. In a 2007 letter to Ashcroft, the human rights organization went on to declare that his &quot;unacceptably harsh and punitive&quot; abuse by prison guards was &quot;based, at least in part, on his political background.&quot;

==Civil and criminal contempt prosecutions; 2006–present==
Al-Arian was subpoenaed three times to testify in terrorism-related investigations before Virginia federal grand juries between 2006 and 2008. Each time, he refused to testify. He challenged the initial subpoena in four different federal courts, each of which held that he was in fact required to testify. He was imprisoned for 13 months for civil contempt for failing to testify in compliance with the first subpoena.

===Grand jury subpoenas, refusal to testify, civil contempt, and hunger strikes===
In May 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a subpoena to Al-Arian to testify before a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, in an investigation into the alleged financing of terror by the Herndon, Virginia-based International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT). The subpoena was served on Al-Arian in October 2006. He sought to quash it on the assertion that his plea agreement prevented his being forced to testify before the Virginia grand jury. He said the government had agreed that he would not be required to cooperate with it in any manner, though that specific agreement was not reflected in the written plea agreement. In a verbal agreement that he says appears in court transcripts, federal prosecutors agreed he would not have to testify in Virginia. Second, Al-Arian also said he refused to testify because he believed &quot;his life would be in danger if he testified.&quot; Third, Al-Arian claimed he has no information that could further the investigation. Fourth, Al-Arian said he would not testify because he felt IIIT was inappropriately charged. When called before the grand jury on October 19, Al-Arian refused to answer questions about IIIT.

A Virginia District Court held that he had no legal basis to refuse to testify. The court held him in civil contempt, and imprisoned him on November 16, 2006, for contempt of court, with the days served for civil contempt not counting towards the days of imprisonment he had remaining on his guilty conspiracy plea. He appealed the Virginia District Court decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court&#x27;s ruling. Thirteen months later, on December 14, 2007, the Virginia District Court lifted its contempt order, starting the clock ticking again on his days-served on his conspiracy guilty plea sentence. A Florida District Court also held that the plea agreement was not ambiguous, and did not prevent the government from issuing a subpoena requiring him to testify before a grand jury. Al-Arian, who is diabetic, began a 60-day hunger strike on January 22, 2007, to &quot;protest continued government harassment.&quot; By March 20, 2007, the Al-Arian had gone from . Al-Arian appealed the Florida District Court decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court on January 25, 2008. It pointed out that the plea agreement did not contain any mention of whether Al-Arian would be compelled to testify in front of a grand jury in the future. It also noted that the agreement said it reflected all promises and agreements between Al-Arian and the government, and that this accorded with Al-Arian&#x27;s statement, when questioned by the trial court judge, that there were no promises or inducements made to him other than those reflected in the written agreement. Furthermore, the court observed that the plea agreement only spoke to the issue of the government prosecuting Al-Arian for crimes known to the office at the time of the agreement, but did not immunize Al-Arian from future subpoenas. The court therefore held the plea agreement to be clear, unambiguous, and to not grant Al-Arian immunity from the grand jury subpoena. The Justice Department issued its third subpoena later that month.

In March 2008 he began another hunger strike, to protest his subpoena. He ended his hunger strike two months later. A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this case were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.

===Criminal contempt proceedings; house arrest; deportation===
On June 26, 2008, he was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia on two counts of criminal contempt, for unlawfully and willfully refusing court orders that he testify as a grand jury witness on October 16, 2007, and March 20, 2008. On September 2, 2008, he was released from custody and put under house arrest at his daughter Laila&#x27;s residence in Northern Virginia, where he was monitored electronically while he awaited trial on criminal contempt charges.

At a January 2009 hearing to schedule his trial, his attorneys filed documents saying Al-Arian &quot;did cooperate and answer questions on IIIT&quot; for federal prosecutors. Attorneys alleged Virginia prosecutors are &quot;ultimately not interested in IIIT ... but want to revisit the Tampa trial.&quot; In a motion filed on March 4, 2009, prosecutors in Virginia acknowledged that when Al-Arian took the plea deal in early 2006, prosecutors in Tampa believed that it exempted him from testifying in other cases. This affirms sworn declarations submitted to the court by Al-Arian&#x27;s Florida trial attorneys, Bill Moffitt and Linda Moreno.

On March 9, 2010, Judge Leonie Brinkema postponed the criminal contempt trial, pending a motion by defense attorneys to dismiss the charges in the case. While under federal law, Al-Arian could not be jailed for more than 18 months for civil contempt, the law does not have a time limit for criminal contempt. On June 27, 2014, Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon D. Kromberg moved to dismiss the indictment, but because the case has dragged on so long they decided to drop the case and begin proceedings to deport Al-Arian.

On February 4, 2015, Al-Arian was deported from the United States to Turkey. He was flown on a commercial flight from Dulles International Airport from Herndon, Virginia to Turkey. In a statement released by his former attorney, Jonathan Turley, Al-Arian said in part, &quot;After 40 years, my time in the U.S. has come to an end.&quot; He added, &quot;But despite the long and arduous ordeal and hardships suffered by my family, I leave with no bitterness or resentment in my heart whatsoever. In fact, I&#x27;m very grateful for the opportunities and experiences afforded to me and my family in this country, and for the friendships we&#x27;ve cultivated over the decades. These are lifelong connections that could never be affected by distance.&quot;

In 2017, Al-Arian founded the Center for Islam and Global Affairs (CIGA) at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University (IZU) in Istanbul, Turkey, which he directs.

In 2024, the New York Police Department and Mayor Eric Adams stated that Al-Arian posted on Twitter a photo of his wife at the 2024 Columbia University pro-Palestinian campus occupation. Adams cited the posting as evidence of non Columbia-affiliated individuals training and providing tactics to students to escalate their protests.

==Personal life==
He is married to Nahla Al-Najjar, and they have five children. Nahla was born in 1960. His son Abdullah Al-Arian was an intern for U.S. Representative David E. Bonior in 2001. Al-Arian&#x27;s eldest daughter, Laila Al-Arian, is a producer for &quot;Al Jazeera English&quot; in Washington, D.C., and a freelance journalist and contributor to the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;.

===Film===
&quot;USA vs. Al-Arian&quot; is a 2007 documentary film by Norwegian director Line Halvorsen about Al-Arian and his family during and after his trial from his family&#x27;s point of view, and a commentary on the U.S. justice system under the Patriot Act. The documentary was hosted by two MPs and screened in the Norwegian parliament.

<doc id="185748" wikidata="Q423350" url="?curid=185748" title="Metalloprotein">
<text>Metalloprotein is a generic term for a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor. A large proportion of all proteins are part of this category. For instance, at least 1000 human proteins (out of ~20,000) contain zinc-binding protein domains although there may be up to 3000 human zinc metalloproteins.

==Abundance==
It is estimated that approximately half of all proteins contain a metal. In another estimate, about one quarter to one third of all proteins are proposed to require metals to carry out their functions. Thus, metalloproteins have many different functions in cells, such as storage and transport of proteins, enzymes and signal transduction proteins, or infectious diseases. The abundance of metal binding proteins may be inherent to the amino acids that proteins use, as even artificial proteins without evolutionary history will readily bind metals.

Most metals in the human body are bound to proteins. For instance, the relatively high concentration of iron in the human body is mostly due to the iron in hemoglobin.
==Coordination chemistry principles==
In metalloproteins, metal ions are usually coordinated by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur centers belonging to amino acid residues of the protein. These donor groups are often provided by side-chains on the amino acid residues. Especially important are the imidazole substituent in histidine residues, thiolate substituents in cysteine residues, and carboxylate groups provided by aspartate. Given the diversity of the metalloproteome, virtually all amino acid residues have been shown to bind metal centers. The peptide backbone also provides donor groups; these include deprotonated amides and the amide carbonyl oxygen centers. Lead(II) binding in natural and artificial proteins has been reviewed.

In addition to donor groups that are provided by amino acid residues, many organic cofactors function as ligands. Perhaps most famous are the tetradentate N4 macrocyclic ligands incorporated into the heme protein. Inorganic ligands such as sulfide and oxide are also common.

== Storage and transport metalloproteins ==
These are the second stage product of protein hydrolysis obtained by treatment with slightly stronger acids and alkalies.

=== Oxygen carriers ===
Hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrier in humans, has four subunits in which the iron(II) ion is coordinated by the planar macrocyclic ligand protoporphyrin IX (PIX) and the imidazole nitrogen atom of a histidine residue. The sixth coordination site contains a water molecule or a dioxygen molecule. By contrast the protein myoglobin, found in muscle cells, has only one such unit. The active site is located in a hydrophobic pocket. This is important as without it the iron(II) would be irreversibly oxidized to iron(III). The equilibrium constant for the formation of HbO2 is such that oxygen is taken up or released depending on the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs or in muscle. In hemoglobin the four subunits show a cooperativity effect that allows for easy oxygen transfer from hemoglobin to myoglobin.

In both hemoglobin and myoglobin it is sometimes incorrectly stated that the oxygenated species contains iron(III). It is now known that the diamagnetic nature of these species is because the iron(II) atom is in the low-spin state. In oxyhemoglobin the iron atom is located in the plane of the porphyrin ring, but in the paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin the iron atom lies above the plane of the ring. This change in spin state is a cooperative effect due to the higher crystal field splitting and smaller ionic radius of Fe2+ in the oxyhemoglobin moiety.

Hemerythrin is another iron-containing oxygen carrier. The oxygen binding site is a binuclear iron center. The iron atoms are coordinated to the protein through the carboxylate side chains of a glutamate and aspartate and five histidine residues. The uptake of O2 by hemerythrin is accompanied by two-electron oxidation of the reduced binuclear center to produce bound peroxide (OOH−). The mechanism of oxygen uptake and release have been worked out in detail.

Hemocyanins carry oxygen in the blood of most mollusks, and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab. They are second only to hemoglobin in biological popularity of use in oxygen transport. On oxygenation the two copper(I) atoms at the active site are oxidized to copper(II) and the dioxygen molecules are reduced to peroxide, .

Chlorocruorin (as the larger carrier erythrocruorin) is an oxygen-binding hemeprotein present in the blood plasma of many annelids, particularly certain marine polychaetes.

=== Cytochromes ===

Oxidation and reduction reactions are not common in organic chemistry as few organic molecules can act as oxidizing or reducing agents. Iron(II), on the other hand, can easily be oxidized to iron(III). This functionality is used in cytochromes, which function as electron-transfer vectors. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids. The iron atom in most cytochromes is contained in a heme group. The differences between those cytochromes lies in the different side-chains. For instance cytochrome a has a heme a prosthetic group and cytochrome b has a heme b prosthetic group. These differences result in different Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potentials such that various cytochromes are involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes perform the function of inserting an oxygen atom into a C−H bond, an oxidation reaction.

=== Rubredoxin ===
Rubredoxin is an electron-carrier found in sulfur-metabolizing bacteria and archaea. The active site contains an iron ion coordinated by the sulfur atoms of four cysteine residues forming an almost regular tetrahedron. Rubredoxins perform one-electron transfer processes. The oxidation state of the iron atom changes between the +2 and +3 states. In both oxidation states the metal is high spin, which helps to minimize structural changes.

=== Plastocyanin ===
Plastocyanin is one of the family of blue copper proteins that are involved in electron transfer reactions. The copper-binding site is described as distorted trigonal pyramidal. The trigonal plane of the pyramidal base is composed of two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from separate histidines and a sulfur (S1) from a cysteine. Sulfur (S2) from an axial methionine forms the apex. The distortion occurs in the bond lengths between the copper and sulfur ligands. The Cu−S1 contact is shorter (207 pm) than Cu−S2 (282 pm).
The elongated Cu−S2 bonding destabilizes the Cu(II) form and increases the redox potential of the protein. The blue color (597 nm peak absorption) is due to the Cu−S1 bond where S(pπ) to Cu(d&quot;x&quot;2−&quot;y&quot;2) charge transfer occurs.

In the reduced form of plastocyanin, His-87 will become protonated with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 4.4. Protonation prevents it acting as a ligand and the copper site geometry becomes trigonal planar.

===Metal-ion storage and transfer===

====Iron====

Iron is stored as iron(III) in ferritin. The exact nature of the binding site has not yet been determined. The iron appears to be present as a hydrolysis product such as FeO(OH). Iron is transported by transferrin whose binding site consists of two tyrosines, one aspartic acid and one histidine. The human body has no controlled mechanism for excretion of iron. This can lead to iron overload problems in patients treated with blood transfusions, as, for instance, with β-thalassemia. Iron is actually excreted in urine and is also concentrated in bile which is excreted in feces.

==== Copper ====
Ceruloplasmin is the major copper-carrying protein in the blood. Ceruloplasmin exhibits oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of Fe(II) into Fe(III), therefore assisting in its transport in the blood plasma in association with transferrin, which can carry iron only in the Fe(III) state.

====Calcium====

Osteopontin is involved in mineralization in the extracellular matrices of bones and teeth.

== Metalloenzymes ==
Metalloenzymes all have one feature in common, namely that the metal ion is bound to the protein with one labile coordination site. As with all enzymes, the shape of the active site is crucial. The metal ion is usually located in a pocket whose shape fits the substrate. The metal ion catalyzes reactions that are difficult to achieve in organic chemistry.

=== Carbonic anhydrase ===

In aqueous solution, carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid
:CO2 + H2O H2CO3
This reaction is very slow in the absence of a catalyst, but quite fast in the presence of the hydroxide ion
:CO2 + OH− 
A reaction similar to this is almost instantaneous with carbonic anhydrase. The structure of the active site in carbonic anhydrases is well known from a number of crystal structures. It consists of a zinc ion coordinated by three imidazole nitrogen atoms from three histidine units. The fourth coordination site is occupied by a water molecule. The coordination sphere of the zinc ion is approximately tetrahedral. The positively-charged zinc ion polarizes the coordinated water molecule, and nucleophilic attack by the negatively-charged hydroxide portion on carbon dioxide proceeds rapidly. The catalytic cycle produces the bicarbonate ion and the hydrogen ion as the equilibrium:
:H2CO3 + H+
favouring dissociation of carbonic acid at biological pH values.

=== Vitamin B12-dependent enzymes ===
The cobalt-containing Vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin) catalyzes the transfer of methyl (−CH3) groups between two molecules, which involves the breaking of C−C bonds, a process that is energetically expensive in organic reactions. The metal ion lowers the activation energy for the process by forming a transient Co−CH3 bond. The structure of the coenzyme was famously determined by Dorothy Hodgkin and co-workers, for which she received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It consists of a cobalt(II) ion coordinated to four nitrogen atoms of a corrin ring and a fifth nitrogen atom from an imidazole group. In the resting state there is a Co−C sigma bond with the 5′ carbon atom of adenosine. This is a naturally occurring organometallic compound, which explains its function in &quot;trans&quot;-methylation reactions, such as the reaction carried out by methionine synthase.

=== Nitrogenase (nitrogen fixation) ===

The fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is an energy-intensive process, as it involves breaking the very stable triple bond between the nitrogen atoms. The nitrogenases catalyze the process. One such enzyme occurs in &quot;Rhizobium&quot; bacteria. There are three components to its action: a molybdenum atom at the active site, iron–sulfur clusters that are involved in transporting the electrons needed to reduce the nitrogen, and an abundant energy source in the form of magnesium ATP. This last is provided by a mutualistic symbiosis between the bacteria and a host plant, often a legume. The reaction may be written symbolically as
:N2 + 16 MgATP + 8 e− → 2 NH3 + 16 MgADP +16 Pi + H2
where Pi stands for inorganic phosphate. The precise structure of the active site has been difficult to determine. It appears to contain a MoFe7S8 cluster that is able to bind the dinitrogen molecule and, presumably, enable the reduction process to begin. The electrons are transported by the associated &quot;P&quot; cluster, which contains two cubical Fe4S4 clusters joined by sulfur bridges.

=== Superoxide dismutase ===

The superoxide ion, is generated in biological systems by reduction of molecular oxygen. It has an unpaired electron, so it behaves as a free radical. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. These properties render the superoxide ion very toxic and are deployed to advantage by phagocytes to kill invading microorganisms. Otherwise, the superoxide ion must be destroyed before it does unwanted damage in a cell. The superoxide dismutase enzymes perform this function very efficiently.

The formal oxidation state of the oxygen atoms is −. In solutions at neutral pH, the superoxide ion disproportionates to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.
:2  + 2 H+ → O2 + H2O2
In biology this type of reaction is called a dismutation reaction. It involves both oxidation and reduction of superoxide ions. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) group of enzymes increase the rate of reaction to near the diffusion-limited rate. The key to the action of these enzymes is a metal ion with variable oxidation state that can act either as an oxidizing agent or as a reducing agent.
:Oxidation: M(&quot;n&quot;+1)+ + → M&quot;n&quot;+ + O2
:Reduction: M&quot;n&quot;+ + + 2 H+ → M(&quot;n&quot;+1)+ + H2O2.

In human SOD, the active metal is copper, as Cu(II) or Cu(I), coordinated tetrahedrally by four histidine residues. This enzyme also contains zinc ions for stabilization and is activated by copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS). Other isozymes may contain iron, manganese or nickel. The activity of Ni-SOD involves nickel(III), an unusual oxidation state for this element. The active site nickel geometry cycles from square planar Ni(II), with thiolate (Cys2 and Cys6) and backbone nitrogen (His1 and Cys2) ligands, to square pyramidal Ni(III) with an added axial His1 side chain ligand.

=== Chlorophyll-containing proteins ===
Chlorophyll plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. It contains a magnesium enclosed in a chlorin ring. However, the magnesium ion is not directly involved in the photosynthetic function and can be replaced by other divalent ions with little loss of activity. Rather, the photon is absorbed by the chlorin ring, whose electronic structure is well-adapted for this purpose.

Initially, the absorption of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the Q band. The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state in which there are two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.

=== Hydrogenase ===

Hydrogenases are subclassified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron–iron hydrogenase, nickel–iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase.
All hydrogenases catalyze reversible H2 uptake, but while the [FeFe] and [NiFe] hydrogenases are true redox catalysts, driving H2 oxidation and H+ reduction
:H2 2 H+ + 2 e−
the [Fe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible heterolytic cleavage of H2.
:H2 H+ + H−
=== Ribozyme and deoxyribozyme ===
Since discovery of ribozymes by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman in the early 1980s, ribozymes have been shown to be a distinct class of metalloenzymes. Many ribozymes require metal ions in their active sites for chemical catalysis; hence they are called metalloenzymes. Additionally, metal ions are essential for structural stabilization of ribozymes. Group I intron is the most studied ribozyme which has three metals participating in catalysis. Other known ribozymes include group II intron, RNase P, and several small viral ribozymes (such as hammerhead, hairpin, HDV, and VS) and the large subunit of ribosomes. Several classes of ribozymes have been described.

Deoxyribozymes, also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, are artificial DNA-based catalysts that were first produced in 1994. Almost all DNAzymes require metal ions. Although ribozymes mostly catalyze cleavage of RNA substrates, a variety of reactions can be catalyzed by DNAzymes including RNA/DNA cleavage, RNA/DNA ligation, amino acid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and carbon–carbon bond formation. Yet, DNAzymes that catalyze RNA cleavage reaction are the most extensively explored ones. 10-23 DNAzyme, discovered in 1997, is one of the most studied catalytic DNAs with clinical applications as a therapeutic agent. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific).

== Signal-transduction metalloproteins ==

=== Calmodulin ===
Calmodulin is an example of a signal-transduction protein. It is a small protein that contains four EF-hand motifs, each of which is able to bind a Ca2+ ion.

In an EF-hand loop protein domain, the calcium ion is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration. Six glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues involved in the binding are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of the polypeptide chain. At position 12, there is a glutamate or aspartate ligand that behaves as a bidentate ligand, providing two oxygen atoms. The ninth residue in the loop is necessarily glycine due to the conformational requirements of the backbone. The coordination sphere of the calcium ion contains only carboxylate oxygen atoms and no nitrogen atoms. This is consistent with the hard nature of the calcium ion.

The protein has two approximately symmetrical domains, separated by a flexible &quot;hinge&quot; region. Binding of calcium causes a conformational change to occur in the protein. Calmodulin participates in an intracellular signaling system by acting as a diffusible second messenger to the initial stimuli.

=== Troponin ===
In both cardiac and skeletal muscles, muscular force production is controlled primarily by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. In general, when calcium rises, the muscles contract and, when calcium falls, the muscles relax. Troponin, along with actin and tropomyosin, is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force.

=== Transcription factors ===
Many transcription factors contain a structure known as a zinc finger, a structural module in which a region of protein folds around a zinc ion. The zinc does not directly contact the DNA that these proteins bind to. Instead, the cofactor is essential for the stability of the tightly folded protein chain. In these proteins, the zinc ion is usually coordinated by pairs of cysteine and histidine side-chains.

== Other metalloenzymes ==
There are two types of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase: one contains iron and molybdenum, the other contains iron and nickel. Parallels and differences in catalytic strategies have been reviewed.

Pb2+ (lead) can replace Ca2+ (calcium) as, for example, with calmodulin or Zn2+ (zinc) as with metallocarboxypeptidases.

Some other metalloenzymes are given in the following table, according to the metal involved.

<doc id="185763" wikidata="Q10582" url="?curid=185763" title="Norma (constellation)">
<text>Norma is a small constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere between Ara and Lupus, one of twelve drawn up in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille and one of several depicting scientific instruments. Its name is Latin for normal, referring to a right angle, and is variously considered to represent a rule, a carpenter&#x27;s square, a set square or a level. It remains one of the 88 modern constellations.

Four of Norma&#x27;s brighter stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in the field of faint stars. Gamma2 Normae is the brightest star with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. Mu Normae is one of the most luminous stars known, with a luminosity between a quarter million and one million times that of the Sun. Four star systems are known to harbour planets. The Milky Way, particularly the Norma Arm of the galaxy, passes through Norma, and the constellation contains eight open clusters visible to observers with binoculars. The constellation also hosts Abell 3627, also called the Norma Cluster, one of the most massive galaxy clusters known.

==History==
Norma was introduced in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name &quot;l’Équerre et la Règle&quot;, &quot;the Square and Rule&quot;, after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille portrayed the constellations of Norma, Circinus and Triangulum Australe, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor&#x27;s level in a set of draughtsman instruments, in his 1756 map of the southern stars. The level was dangling from the apex of a triangle, leading some astronomers to conclude he was renaming &quot;l’Équerre et la Règle&quot; to &quot;le Niveau&quot;, &quot;the level&quot;. In any case, the constellation&#x27;s name had been shortened and Latinised by Lacaille to &quot;Norma&quot; by 1763.

==Characteristics==
Norma is bordered by Scorpius to the north, Lupus to the northwest, Circinus to the west, Triangulum Australe to the south and Ara to the east. Covering 165.3 square degrees and 0.401% of the night sky, it ranks 74th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Nor&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of ten segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −42.27° and −60.44°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 29°N.

==Features==

===Stars===

Lacaille charted and designated ten stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Mu in 1756, however his Alpha Normae was transferred into Scorpius and left unnamed by Francis Baily, before being named N Scorpii by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who felt its brightness warranted recognition. Though Beta Normae was depicted on his star chart, it was inadvertently left out of Lacaille&#x27;s 1763 catalogue, was likewise transferred to Scorpio by Baily and named H Scorpii by Gould. Norma&#x27;s brightest star, Gamma2 Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Overall, there are 44 stars within the constellation&#x27;s borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.
The four main stars—Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and Eta—make up a square in this region of faint stars. Gamma1 and Gamma2 Normae are an optical double, and not a true binary star system. Located 129 ± 1 light-years away from Earth, Gamma2 Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III around 2 to 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. It has swollen to a diameter 10 times that of the Sun and shines with 45 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. It also is half of a close optical double, with a magnitude 10 companion star related by line of sight only. Gamma1 Normae is a yellow-white supergiant, located much further away at around 1500 light-years from Earth. Epsilon Normae is a spectroscopic binary, with two blue-white main sequence stars of almost equal mass and spectral type (B3V) orbiting each other every 3.26 days. There is a third star separated by 22 arcseconds, which has a magnitude of 7.5 and is likely a smaller B-type main sequence star of spectral type B9V. The system is 530 ± 20 light-years distant from Earth, Eta Normae is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III with an apparent magnitude of 4.65. It shines with a luminosity approximately 66 times that of the Sun.

Iota1 Normae is a multiple star system. The AB (mag 5.2 and 5.76) pair orbit each other with a period of 26.9 years; they are 2.77 and 2.71 times as massive as the Sun respectively. The pair are 128 ± 6 light-years distant from Earth. A third component is a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G8V with an apparent magnitude of 8.02.

Mu Normae is a remote blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7Iab, one of the most luminous stars known, but is partially obscured by distance and cosmic dust. Uncertainties regarding its distance leave open the possibility that Mu Normae could be between 250,000 and one million times as luminous and up to 60 times as massive as the Sun, though it is more likely to have around 500,000 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity and 40 times its mass. It is suspected of being an Alpha Cygni variable, with a magnitude range of 4.87–4.98. QU Normae is another hot blue-white star that is a variable, ranging from magnitude 5.27 to 5.41 over 4.8 days. Lying near Eta Normae is R Normae, a Mira variable. Its visual magnitude range is 6.5–13.9 and its average period is 507.5 days. Located halfway between Eta Normae and Gamma Circini is T Normae, another Mira variable. It ranges from magnitude 6.2 to 13.6, with a period of 244 days. S Normae is a well-known Cepheid variable with a magnitude range of 6.12–6.77 and a period of 9.75411 days. It is located at the centre of the open cluster NGC 6087. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8-G0Ib that is 6.3 times as massive as the Sun. A binary, it has a 2.4 solar mass () companion that is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V. A binary system composed of two wolf-rayet stars, colloquially called Apep, has been identified as a possible progenitor of a long gamma-ray burst. Located around 8000 light-years distant, it would be the first such in the Milky Way.

IM Normae is one of only ten recurrent novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20 times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0 km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-ray source with a period of 6.67 hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.
=== Exoplanets ===
Four star systems are known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164 light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4 days. Announced in 2004, it was the first planet discovered by the HARPS spectrograph. HD 148156 is a star 168 ± 7 light-years distant. Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was found to have a roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9 AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20 days. HD 142415 is approximately 113 light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days.

===Deep-sky objects===

Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects such as star clusters, including eight open clusters visible through binoculars. NGC 6087 is the brightest of the open clusters in Norma with a magnitude of 5.4. It lies in the southeastern corner of the constellation between Alpha Centauri and Zeta Arae. Thought to be around 100 million years old, it is about 3300 light-years away and is around 14 light-years in diameter. Its brightest member is the Cepheid variable S Normae. A rich background star field makes it less distinct, though around 36 member stars are visible though a 10 cm telescope at 150x magnification. Located 0.4° north of Kappa Normae is NGC 6067, which has an integrated magnitude of 5.6 though it is indistinct as it lies in a rich star field. It is thought to be around 102 million years old, and contain 891 solar masses. Two Cepheid variables—QZ Normae and V340 Normae—have been identified as members of the cluster. Fainter open clusters include NGC 6134 with a combined magnitude of 7.2 and located 4000 light-years away from Earth, the spread-out NGC 6167 of magnitude 6.7, NGC 6115 near Gamma Normae, NGC 6031 and NGC 5999.
Located around 4900 light-years distant is Shapley 1 (or PK 329+02.1), a planetary nebula better known as the &quot;Fine-Ring Nebula&quot;. Appearing ring-shaped, it is thought that it actually is cylindrical and oriented directly at Earth. Around 8700 years old, it lies about five degrees west-northwest of Gamma1 Normae. Its integrated magnitude is 13.6 and its mean surface brightness is 13.9. The central star is a white dwarf of magnitude 14.03. Mz 1 is a bipolar planetary nebula, thought to be an hourglass shape tilted at an angle to observers on Earth, some 3500 light-years distant. Mz 3—known as the Ant Nebula as it resembles an ant—has a complex appearance, with at least four outflow jets and two large lobes visible.

Approximately 200 million light-years from Earth with a redshift of 0.016 is Abell 3627; also called the Norma Cluster, it is one of the most massive galaxy clusters known to exist, at ten times the average cluster mass. Abell 3627 is thus theorized to be the Great Attractor, a massive object that is pulling the Local Group, the Virgo Supercluster, and the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster towards its location at 600–1000 kilometres per second.

==Meteor shower==
The relatively weak meteor shower Gamma Normids (GNO), which is typically active from March 7 to 23, peaking on March 15, has its radiant near Gamma2 Normae.
== Galactic Arm ==

The Norma Arm is a minor galactic arm named after Norma for lying in its background.

<text>Ross McElwee is an American documentary filmmaker known for his autobiographical films about his family and personal life, usually interwoven with an episodic journey that intersects with larger political or philosophical issues. His humorous and often self-deprecating films refer to cultural aspects of his Southern upbringing. He received the Career Award at the 2007 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.

==Early life and education==
Ross McElwee grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, in a traditional Southern family.
His father was a surgeon and appears often as a figure in McElwee&#x27;s early films. McElwee later attended Brown University, where he studied under novelist John Hawkes, and graduated in 1971 with a degree in creative writing. While at Brown, he also cross-registered in still photography courses at Rhode Island School of Design.

After graduating, McElwee lived for a year in Brittany, France, where he worked for a while as a wedding photographer&#x27;s assistant. Upon returning to the US, he was admitted into MIT&#x27;s new graduate filmmaking program and graduated in 1977 with an M.S. While at MIT, he studied under documentarians Richard Leacock and Ed Pincus, both pioneers of the cinéma vérité movement, with whom he refined his first-person narrative approach. &quot;It was a new way of making films, to eliminate the film crew. You lose some technical polish, but it&#x27;s much more intimate and less intimidating to your subjects. It allows you to shoot with the autonomy and flexibility of a photojournalist.&quot;

==Career==
McElwee&#x27;s film career began in his hometown, Charlotte, North Carolina, where he found summer employment as a studio cameraman for local evening news, housewife helper shows, and &quot;gospel hour&quot; programs. Later, he freelanced as second cameraman for documentarians D.A. Pennebaker, and later for John Marshall in Namibia. McElwee started filming and producing his own documentaries in 1976.

McElwee began teaching filmmaking at Harvard University in 1986; he was a professor of the practice of filmmaking in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies.

McElwee has made ten feature-length documentaries and several shorter films. Most of his films were shot in his homeland, the American South, among them &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; (1986), &quot;Time Indefinite&quot;, &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, and &quot;Bright Leaves&quot;. He collaborated with his wife, Marilyn Levine, on &quot;Something to do with the Wall&quot;. His 2011 film, &quot;Photographic Memory&quot;, breaks new ground in its fully digital process and in its open development and production structure.

==Recognition==
&quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; won numerous awards, including Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival.
It was cited by the National Board of Film Critics as one of the five best films of 1986.
&quot;Time Indefinite&quot; won a best film award in several festivals and was distributed theatrically throughout the U.S. &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News &quot;premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast nationally over PBS&#x27; &quot;Frontline&quot;.

McElwee&#x27;s films have been included in the festivals of Cannes, Berlin, London, Venice, Vienna, Rotterdam, Florence, and Sydney.
Retrospectives include the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of the Moving Image in New York. Retrospectives have also been held in Paris, Tehran, Moscow, Seoul, Lisbon, and Quito. McElwee has received fellowships and grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the American Film Institute.
He has twice been awarded fellowships in filmmaking by the National Endowment for the Arts. &quot;Sherman&#x27;s March&quot; was chosen for preservation by the Library of Congress National Film Registry in 2000 as an &quot;historically significant American motion picture&quot;.

McElwee&#x27;s film &quot;Bright Leaves&quot; premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s Directors&#x27; Fortnight, and was nominated for Best Documentary of 2004 by both the Directors Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America. .

&quot;In Paraguay&quot; premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008. McElwee returned to Venice in 2011 to present the premier of &quot;Photographic Memory.&quot;

<text>A crucible is a container in which metals or other substances may be melted or subjected to very high temperatures. Although crucibles have historically tended to be made out of clay, they can be made from any material that withstands temperatures high enough to melt or otherwise alter its contents.

==History==

===Typology and chronology===
The form of the crucible has varied through time, with designs reflecting the process for which they are used, as well as regional variation. The earliest crucible forms derive from the sixth/fifth millennium B.C. in Eastern Europe and Iran.

===Chalcolithic===
Crucibles used for copper smelting were generally wide shallow vessels made from clay that lacks refractory properties which is similar to the types of clay used in other ceramics of the time. During the Chalcolithic period, crucibles were heated from the top by using blowpipes. Ceramic crucibles from this time had slight modifications to their designs such as handles, knobs or pouring spouts allowing them to be more easily handled and poured. Early examples of this practice can be seen in Feinan, Jordan. These crucibles have added handles to allow for better manipulation, however, due to the poor preservation of the crucibles there is no evidence of a pouring spout. The main purpose of the crucible during this period was to keep the ore in the area where the heat was concentrated to separate it from impurities before shaping.

A crucible furnace dating to 2300–1900 BC for bronze casting has been found at a religious precinct of Kerma.

===Iron Age===
The use of crucibles in the Iron Age remains very similar to that of the Bronze Age with copper and tin smelting being used to produce bronze. The Iron Age crucible designs remain the same as the Bronze Age.

The Roman period shows technical innovations, with crucibles for new methods used to produce new alloys. The smelting and melting process also changed with both the heating technique and the crucible design. The crucible changed into rounded or pointed bottom vessels with a more conical shape; these were heated from below, unlike prehistoric types which were irregular in shape and were heated from above. These designs gave greater stability within the charcoal. These crucibles in some cases have thinner walls and have more refractory properties.

During the Roman period a new process of metalworking started, cementation, used in the production of brass. This process involves the combination of a metal and a gas to produce an alloy. Brass is made by mixing solid copper metal with zinc oxide or carbonate which comes in the form of calamine or smithsonite. This is heated to about 900 °C, the zinc oxide vaporizes into a gas, and the zinc gas bonds with the molten copper. This reaction has to take place in a part-closed or closed container otherwise the zinc vapor would escape before it can react with the copper. Cementation crucibles, therefore, have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible. The crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles. The conical shape and smallmouth allowed the lid to be added. These small crucibles are seen in Colonia Ulpia Trajana (modern-day Xanten), Germany, where the crucibles are around 4 cm in size, however, these are small examples. There are examples of larger vessels such as cooking pots and amphorae being used for cementation to process larger amounts of brass; since the reaction takes place at low temperatures lower fired ceramics could be used. The ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel. Cementation vessels are mass-produced due to crucibles having to be broken open to remove the brass once the reaction has finished as in most cases the lid would have baked hard to the vessel or the brass might have adhered to the vessel walls.

===Medieval period===

Smelting and melting of copper and its alloys such as leaded bronze was done in crucibles similar to those of the Roman period which have thinner walls and flat bases to sit within the furnaces. The technology for this type of smelting started to change at the end of the medieval period with the introduction of new tempering material for the ceramic crucibles. Some of these copper alloy crucibles were used in the making of bells. Bell foundry crucibles had to be larger at about 60 cm. These later medieval crucibles were a more mass-produced product.

The cementation process, which was lost from the end of the Roman to the early medieval period, continued in the same way with brass. Brass production increased during the medieval period due to a better understanding of the technology behind it. Furthermore, the process for carrying out cementation for brass did not change greatly until the 19th century. 

However, during this period a vast and highly important technological innovation happened using the cementation process, the production of crucible steel. Steel production using iron and carbon works similarly to brass, with the iron metal being mixed with carbon to produce steel. The first examples of cementation steel are wootz steel from India, where the crucibles were filled with good quality low-carbon wrought iron and carbon in the form of organics such as leaves, wood, etc. However, no charcoal was used within the crucible. These early crucibles would only produce a small amount of steel as they would have to be broken once the process has finished.

By the late medieval period, steel production had moved from India to modern-day Uzbekistan, where new materials were being used in the production of steel crucibles; for example, Mullite crucibles were introduced. These were sandy clay crucibles which had been formed around a fabric tube. These crucibles were used in the same way as other cementation vessels but with a hole in the top of the vessel to allow pressure to escape.

===Post-medieval===

At the end of the medieval era and into the post-medieval era, new types of crucible designs and processes started. Smelting and melting crucibles types started to become more limited in designs which are produced by a few specialists. The main types used during the post-medieval period are the Hessian crucibles which were made in the Hesse region in Germany. These are triangular vessels made on a wheel or within a mold using high alumina clay and tempered with pure quartz sand. Furthermore, another specialized crucible which was made at the same time was that of a graphite crucible from southern Germany. These had a very similar design to that of the triangular crucibles from Hesse but they also occur in conical forms. These crucibles were traded all across Europe and the New World.

The refining of methods during the medieval and post-medieval periods led to the invention of the cupel which resembles a small egg cup, made of ceramic or bone ash which was used to separate base metals from noble metals. This process is known as cupellation. Cupellation started long before the post-medieval period; however, the first vessels made to carry out this process started in the 16th century. Another vessel used for the same process is a scorifier, which is similar to a cupel but slightly larger and removes the lead and leaves the noble metals behind. Cupels and scorifiers were mass-produced as after each reduction the vessels would have absorbed all of the lead and become fully saturated. These vessels were also used in the process of metallurgical assay where the noble metals are removed from a coin or a weight of metal to determine the amount of the noble metals within the object.

==Modern-day uses==

Crucibles are used in the laboratory to contain chemical compounds when they are heated to extremely high temperatures. Crucibles are available in several sizes and typically come with a correspondingly-sized lid. When heated over a flame, the crucible is often held inside a pipeclay triangle which itself is held on top of a tripod.

Crucibles and their covers are made of heat-resistant materials, usually porcelain, alumina or an inert metal. One of the earliest uses of platinum was to make crucibles. Ceramics such as alumina, zirconia, and especially magnesia will tolerate the highest temperatures. However, chemical reactions with the material in the crucible must be kept in mind; the emergence of melting point-lowering eutectic systems is an especially important consideration. More recently, metals such as nickel and zirconium have been used. The lids are typically loose-fitting in order to allow gases to escape during the heating of a sample inside. Crucibles and their lids can come in high form and low form shapes and in various sizes, but rather small 10 to 15 ml size porcelain crucibles are commonly used for gravimetric chemical analysis. These smaller crucibles and their covers made of porcelain are quite cheap when sold in large quantities to laboratories, and the crucibles are sometimes disposed of after use in precise quantitative chemical analysis. There is usually a large mark-up when they are sold individually in hobby shops.

In the area of chemical analysis, crucibles are used in quantitative gravimetric chemical analysis (analysis by measuring mass of an analyte or its derivative). Common crucible use may be as follows. A residue or precipitate in a chemical analysis method can be collected or filtered from some sample or solution on special &quot;ashless&quot; filter paper. The crucible and lid to be used are pre-weighed very accurately on an analytical balance. After some possible washing and/or pre-drying of this filtrate, the residue on the filter paper can be placed in the crucible and fired (heated at very high temperature) until all the volatiles and moisture are driven out of the sample residue in the crucible. The &quot;ashless&quot; filter paper is completely burned up in this process. The crucible with the sample and lid is allowed to cool in a desiccator. The crucible and lid with the sample inside are weighed very accurately again only after it has completely cooled to room temperature (higher temperature would cause air currents around the balance giving inaccurate results). The mass of the empty, pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible.

A crucible with a bottom perforated with small holes which are designed specifically for use in filtration, especially for gravimetric analysis as just described, is called a Gooch crucible after its inventor, Frank Austin Gooch.

For completely accurate results, the crucible is handled with clean tongs because fingerprints can add a weighable mass to the crucible. Porcelain crucibles are hygroscopic, i. e. they absorb a bit of weighable moisture from the air. For this reason, the porcelain crucible and lid is also pre-fired (pre-heating to high temperature) to constant mass before the pre-weighing. This determines the mass of the completely dry crucible and lid. At least two firings, coolings, and weighings resulting in exactly the same mass are needed to confirm the constant (completely dry) mass of the crucible and lid and similarly again for the crucible, lid, and sample residue inside. Since the mass of every crucible and lid is different, the pre-firing/pre-weighing must be done for every new crucible/lid used. The desiccator contains desiccant to absorb moisture from the air inside, so the air inside will be completely dry.

<text>Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman (born Elizabeth Jane Cochran; May 5, 1864 – January 27, 1922), better known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days in emulation of Jules Verne&#x27;s fictional character Phileas Fogg, and for an exposé in which she worked undercover to report on a mental institution from within. She pioneered her field and launched a new kind of investigative journalism.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Jane Cochran was born May 5, 1864, in Cochran&#x27;s Mills, now part of Burrell Township, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. Her father, Michael Cochran, born about 1810, started as a laborer and mill worker before buying the local mill and most of the land surrounding his family farmhouse. He later became a merchant, postmaster, and associate justice at Cochran&#x27;s Mills (named after him) in Pennsylvania. Michael married twice. He had 10 children with his first wife, Catherine Murphy, and five more children, including Elizabeth, his thirteenth daughter, with his second wife, Mary Jane Kennedy. Michael Cochran died in 1870, when Elizabeth was 6.

As a young girl, Elizabeth often was called &quot;Pink&quot; because she so frequently wore that color. As she became a teenager, she wanted to portray herself as more sophisticated, and she dropped the nickname and changed her surname to Cochrane. In 1879, she enrolled at Indiana Normal School (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) for one term but was forced to drop out due to lack of funds. In 1880, Cochrane&#x27;s mother moved her family to Allegheny City, which was later annexed by the City of Pittsburgh.

==Career==
===&quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot;===
In 1885, a column in the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot; titled &quot;What Girls Are Good For&quot; stated that girls were principally for birthing children and keeping house. This prompted Elizabeth to write a response under the pseudonym &quot;Lonely Orphan Girl&quot;. The editor, George Madden, was impressed with her passion and ran an advertisement asking the author to identify herself. When Cochran introduced herself to the editor, he offered her the opportunity to write a piece for the newspaper, again under the pseudonym &quot;Lonely Orphan Girl&quot;. Her first article for the &quot;Dispatch&quot;, titled &quot;The Girl Puzzle&quot;, argued that not all women would marry and that what was needed were better jobs for women. 

Her second article, &quot;Mad Marriages&quot;, was about how divorce affected women. In it, she argued for reform of divorce laws. &quot;Mad Marriages&quot; was published under the byline of Nellie Bly, rather than &quot;Lonely Orphan Girl&quot; because, at the time, it was customary for female journalists to use pen names to conceal their gender so that readers would not discredit them. The editor chose &quot;Nellie Bly&quot;, after the African-American title character in the popular song &quot;Nelly Bly&quot; by Stephen Foster. Cochrane originally intended that her pseudonym be &quot;Nelly Bly&quot;, but her editor wrote &quot;Nellie&quot; by mistake, and the error stuck. Madden was impressed again and offered her a full-time job.

As a writer, Nellie Bly focused her early work for the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot; on the lives of working women, writing a series of investigative articles on female factory workers. However, the newspaper soon received complaints from factory owners about her writing, and she was reassigned to women&#x27;s pages to cover fashion, society, and gardening, the usual role for female journalists, and she became dissatisfied. Still only 21, she was determined &quot;to do something no girl has done before.&quot; She then traveled to Mexico to serve as a foreign correspondent, spending nearly half a year reporting on the lives and customs of the Mexican people. Her dispatches later were published in book form as &quot;Six Months in Mexico.&quot; In one report, she protested the imprisonment of a local journalist for criticizing the Mexican government, then a dictatorship under Porfirio Díaz. When Mexican authorities learned of Bly&#x27;s report, they threatened her with arrest, prompting her to flee the country. Safely home, she accused Díaz of being a tyrannical czar suppressing the Mexican people and controlling the press.

===Asylum exposé===


Burdened again with theater and arts reporting, Bly left the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot; in 1887 for New York City. Bly faced rejection after rejection as news editors would not consider hiring a woman. Penniless after four months, she talked her way into the offices of Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;New York World&quot;, and took an undercover assignment for which she agreed to feign insanity to investigate reports of and neglect at the Women&#x27;s Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell&#x27;s Island, now named Roosevelt Island.

It was not easy for Bly to be admitted to the asylum: she first decided to check herself into a boarding house called &quot;Temporary Homes for Females&quot;. She stayed up all night to give herself the wide-eyed look of a disturbed woman and began making accusations that the other boarders were insane. Bly told the assistant matron: &quot;There are so many crazy people about, and one can never tell what they will do.&quot; She refused to go to bed and eventually scared so many of the other boarders that the police were called to take her to the nearby courthouse. Once examined by a police officer, a judge, and a doctor, Bly was taken to Bellevue Hospital for a few days, then after evaluation was sent by boat to Blackwell&#x27;s Island.

Committed to the asylum, Bly experienced the deplorable conditions firsthand. After ten days, the asylum released Bly at &quot;The World&quot;″s behest. Her report, published October 9, 1887 and later in book form as &quot;Ten Days in a Mad-House&quot;, caused a sensation, prompted the asylum to implement reforms, and brought her lasting fame. Nellie Bly had a significant impact on American culture and shed light on the experiences of marginalized women beyond the bounds of the asylum as she ushered in the era of stunt girl journalism.

In 1893, Bly used the celebrity status she had gained from her asylum reporting skills to schedule an exclusive interview with the allegedly insane serial killer Lizzie Halliday. 
Biographer Brooke Kroeger argues:
:Her two-part series in October 1887 was a sensation, effectively launching the decade of &quot;stunt&quot; or &quot;detective&quot; reporting, a clear precursor to investigative journalism and one of Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s innovations that helped give &quot;New Journalism&quot; of the 1880s and 1890s its moniker. The employment of &quot;stunt girls&quot; has often been dismissed as a circulation-boosting gimmick of the sensationalist press. However, the genre also provided women with their first collective opportunity to demonstrate that, as a class, they had the skills necessary for the highest level of general reporting. The stunt girls, with Bly as their prototype, were the first women to enter the journalistic mainstream in the twentieth century.

===Around the world and general impact===

In 1888, Bly suggested to her editor at the &quot;New York World&quot; that she take a trip around the world, attempting to turn the fictional &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1873) into fact for the first time. A year later, at 9:40 a.m. on November 14, 1889, and with two days&#x27; notice, she boarded the &quot;Augusta Victoria&quot;, a steamer of the Hamburg America Line, and began her 24,898 mile (40,070 kilometer) journey.

To sustain interest in the story, the &quot;World&quot; organized a &quot;Nellie Bly Guessing Match&quot; in which readers were asked to estimate Bly&#x27;s arrival time to the second, with the Grand Prize consisting at first of a trip to Europe and, later on, spending money for the trip. During her travels around the world, Bly went through England, France (where she met Jules Verne in Amiens), Brindisi, the Suez Canal, Colombo (in Ceylon), the Straits Settlements of Penang and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan.

Just over seventy-two days after her initial departure, Bly arrived in New York on January 25, 1890, completing her circumnavigation of the globe. She had traveled alone for almost the entire journey. Bly was not the only woman attempting to circumnavigate for newspaper sensation, a competitor named Elizabeth Bisland Wetmore was also attempting the journey in the opposite direction, for the Cosmopolitan. Ultimately, Bly triumphed over Bisland. Bly&#x27;s journey was a world record, though it only stood for a few months, until George Francis Train completed the journey in 67 days.

===Novelist===
After the fanfare of her trip around the world, Bly quit reporting and took a lucrative job writing serial novels for publisher Norman Munro&#x27;s weekly &quot;New York Family Story Paper.&quot; The first chapters of &quot;Eva The Adventuress,&quot; based on the real-life trial of Eva Hamilton, appeared in print before Bly returned to New York. Between 1889 and 1895 she wrote eleven novels. As few copies of the paper survived, these novels were thought lost until 2021, when author David Blixt announced the discovery of 11 lost novels in Munro&#x27;s British weekly &quot;The London Story Paper.&quot; In 1893, though still writing novels, she returned to reporting for the &quot;World&quot;.

===Later work===

In 1895, Bly married millionaire manufacturer Robert Seaman. Bly was 31 and Seaman was 73 when they married. Due to her husband&#x27;s failing health, she left journalism and succeeded her husband as head of the Iron Clad Manufacturing Co., which made steel containers such as milk cans and boilers. Seaman died in 1904.

That same year, Iron Clad began manufacturing the steel barrel that was the model for the 55-gallon oil drum still in widespread use in the United States. There have been claims that Bly invented the barrel, but the inventor was registered as Henry Wehrhahn (U.S. Patents 808,327 and 808,413).

Bly was also an inventor in her own right, receiving for a novel milk can and for a stacking garbage can, both under her married name of Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman. For a time, she was one of the leading women industrialists in the United States. But her negligence, and embezzlement by a factory manager, resulted in the Iron Clad Manufacturing Co. going bankrupt.

According to biographer Brooke Kroeger:

Back in reporting, she covered the Woman Suffrage Procession of 1913 for the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. Her article&#x27;s headline was &quot;Suffragists Are Men&#x27;s Superiors&quot; and in its text she accurately predicted that women in the United States would be given the right to vote in 1920.

Bly wrote stories on Europe&#x27;s Eastern Front during World War I. Bly was the first woman and one of the first foreigners to visit the war zone between Serbia and Austria. She was arrested when she was mistaken for a British spy.

==Death==
On January 27, 1922, Bly died of pneumonia at St. Mark&#x27;s Hospital, New York City, aged 57. She was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==

===Honors===
In 1998, Bly was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Bly was one of four journalists honored with a US postage stamp in a &quot;Women in Journalism&quot; set in 2002.

In 2019, the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation put out an open call for artists to create a Nellie Bly Memorial art installation on Roosevelt Island. The winning proposal, &quot;The Girl Puzzle&quot; by Amanda Matthews, was announced on October 16, 2019. &quot;The Girl Puzzle&quot; opened to the public in December 2021.

The New York Press Club confers an annual Nellie Bly Cub Reporter journalism award to acknowledge the best journalistic effort by an individual with three years or fewer of professional experience. In 2020, it was awarded to Claudia Irizarry Aponte, of &quot;THE CITY.&quot;

===Theater===
Bly was the subject of the 1946 Broadway musical &quot;Nellie Bly&quot; by Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Heusen. The show ran for 16 performances.

During the 1990s, playwright Lynn Schrichte wrote and toured &quot;Did You Lie, Nellie Bly?&quot;, a one-woman show about Bly.

An opera based on 10 Days in a Madhouse premiered in Philadelphia, PA in September 2023. The music was by Rene Orth and the libretto by Hannah Moscovitch.

===Film and television===
Bly has been portrayed in the films &quot;The Adventures of Nellie Bly&quot; (1981), &quot;10 Days in a Madhouse&quot; (2015), and &quot;Escaping the Madhouse: The Nellie Bly Story&quot; (2019). In 2019, the Center for Investigative Reporting released &quot;Nellie Bly Makes the News&quot;, a short animated biographical film. A fictionalized version of Bly as a mouse named Nellie Brie appears as a central character in the animated children&#x27;s film &quot;An American Tail: The Mystery of the Night Monster&quot;. The character of Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson) in &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot; is inspired by Bly&#x27;s experience in the asylum. Bly was a subject of Season 2 Episode 5 of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in which First Lady Abbey Bartlet dedicates a memorial in Pennsylvania in honor of Nellie Bly and convinces the president to mention her and other female historic figures during his weekly radio address. On May 5, 2015, the Google search engine produced an interactive &quot;Google Doodle&quot; for Bly; for the &quot;Google Doodle&quot; Karen O wrote, composed, and recorded an original song about Bly, and Katy Wu created an animation set to Karen O&#x27;s music.

===Audio drama===

Nellie&#x27;s story was adapted into a Doctor Who audio drama by Big Finish Productions, released on September 8, 2021. &quot;The Perils of Nellie Bly&quot; was the second story in a three story box set, and was written by Sarah Ward.

===Literature===
Bly has been featured as the protagonist of novels by David Blixt, Marshall Goldberg, Dan Jorgensen, Carol McCleary, Pearry Reginald Teo, Maya Rodale, Christine Converse and Louisa Treger David Blixt also appeared on a March 10, 2021, episode of the podcast Broads You Should Know as a Nellie Bly expert.

A fictionalized account of Bly&#x27;s around-the-world trip was used in the 2010 comic book &quot;Julie Walker Is The Phantom&quot; published by Moonstone Books (Story: Elizabeth Massie, art: Paul Daly, colors: Stephen Downer).

Bly is one of 100 women featured in the first version of the book &quot;Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls&quot; written by Elena Favilli &amp; Francesca Cavallo.

===Eponyms and namesakes===
The board game &quot;Round the World with Nellie Bly&quot; created in 1890 is named in recognition of her trip.

The Nellie Bly Amusement Park in Brooklyn, New York City, was named after her, taking as its theme &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. The park reopened in 2007 under new management, renamed &quot;Adventurers Amusement Park&quot;.

A large species of tarantula from Ecuador, &quot;Pamphobeteus nellieblyae&quot; Sherwood &quot;et al.&quot;, 2022, was named in her honour by arachnologists.

A fireboat named &quot;Nellie Bly&quot; operated in Toronto, Canada, in the first decade of the 20th century. From early in the twentieth century until 1961, the Pennsylvania Railroad operated an express train named the &quot;Nellie Bly&quot; on a route between New York and Atlantic City, bypassing Philadelphia.

<doc id="185783" wikidata="Q7805006" url="?curid=185783" title="Time Indefinite">
<text>Time Indefinite is an autobiographical 1993 documentary film directed by Ross McElwee. It explores themes of grief, mortality, and the convenient disconnection of watching life through a camera lens.

The title comes from a passage from the Bible mentioned by a visiting Jehovah&#x27;s Witness. McElwee is filming the interaction and focused on adjusting the exposure to try to catch the play of light over the man&#x27;s face; distracted, he &quot;hears&quot; the phrase about 30 seconds after the man says it and understands it to refer to the unpredictable imminence of death.

==Synopsis==

In the film, director Ross McElwee gets married, finally putting an end to his family&#x27;s worrying; his grandmother dies; his wife Marilyn has a miscarriage; and his father, a medical doctor, dies suddenly within a week of McElwee&#x27;s wife&#x27;s miscarriage. His mother had died of cancer ten years earlier and so McElwee returns to his father&#x27;s house, where his father&#x27;s housekeeper ministers to him about Christianity and faith.

McElwee goes to visit his friend Charleen, who is now living alone in a new apartment. She had lived on an island in an old two-story house abandoned by the U.S. Army; she and her husband worked to restore it and lived together there for years before becoming estranged. Charleen then lived there alone, but on returning home from a trip she finds that her husband has set fire to the house and died downstairs at the grand piano in an arson/suicide. Charleen has her husband&#x27;s cremated remains in a bag inside a box and tries to get rid of them but can&#x27;t bring herself to do it.

McElwee&#x27;s brother is a successful doctor; on a visit to his brother&#x27;s practice, Ross talks with his brother about their father&#x27;s death, which took them both by surprise. Ross&#x27;s brother receives a patient who has a large malignant tumor on her breast; the woman has had the tumor for years without seeking medical help. Ross&#x27;s brother takes a slide of the tumor for his files; it has spread across much of her chest and is both multifaceted and multicolored. Ross incorporates his brother&#x27;s interview with the woman—and the slide his brother takes—into his film, musing in voiceover about motivation and fatality and marvelling at the power of denial.

Eventually Ross abandons the film, only to continue it later: his wife is pregnant. The pregnancy comes to term and Ross and Marilyn go with their baby son to visit Charleen, who criticizes them for bringing children into such a hostile and unpredictable world but speaks to the passion that drives life and procreation. Ross and Marilyn dote on their son and seem largely unbothered by the criticism.

<text>The Rhein-Sieg-Kreis () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the south of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Rheinisch-Bergischer Kreis, Oberbergischer Kreis, Altenkirchen, Neuwied, Ahrweiler, Euskirchen, Rhein-Erft-Kreis, the urban district of Cologne. The federal city of Bonn is nearly completely surrounded by the district.

==History==
The district as known today was created in 1969, during the reorganization of the districts in North Rhine-Westphalia, by merging Sieg District with the District of Bonn (from which Bonn itself was separated in 1887 to become an urban district). Sieg District was created in 1825.

==Geography==

Geographically Rhein-Sieg District covers the valley of the river Sieg and also, since the merger with the District of Bonn, that of the Rhine around Bonn, as well an area in the most easterly part of the Eifel.

== Politics ==

Municipal elections are held every five years, in which the district administrator () and district council () of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis are chosen. The last election took place on 13 September 2020.

=== District council ===
The district council consists of 86 seats, half of which are chosen directly in 43 constituencies. The remaining 43 seats are distributed via party lists, resulting in a proportional representation.

On 3 November 2020, the Christian Democrats and the Greens announced their coalition agreement, renewing their 21-year governance.

=== District administrator ===
The district administrator is Sebastian Schuster. The Christian Democrat received 53.18% of the vote.

===Coat of arms===
The red lion is the symbol of the dukes of Berg, who owned a large part of the district. The black cross in the shield is the symbol of Cologne, because another part of the district was owned by the bishops of Cologne. The yellow sword is the symbol of Saint Michael, the patron of the mighty Michaelsberg Abbey in Siegburg.

==Demographics==

<doc id="185793" wikidata="Q211830" url="?curid=185793" title="Emeritus">
<text>Emeritus (; female version: emerita) is an honorary title granted to someone who retires from a position of distinction, most commonly an academic faculty position, but is allowed to continue using the previous title, as in &quot;professor emeritus&quot;.

In some cases, the term is conferred automatically upon all persons who retire at a given rank, but in others, it remains a mark of distinguished service awarded selectively on retirement. It is also used when a person of distinction in a profession retires or hands over the position, enabling their former rank to be retained in their title. The term &quot;emeritus&quot; does not necessarily signify that a person has relinquished all the duties of their former position, and they may continue to exercise some of them.

In descriptions of deceased professors emeriti listed at U.S. universities, the title &quot;emeritus&quot; is replaced by an indication of the years of their appointments, except in obituaries, where it may be used to indicate their status at the time of death.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Emeritus&quot; (past participle of Latin , meaning &#x27;complete one&#x27;s service&#x27;) is a compound of the Latin prefix (variant of ) meaning &#x27;out of, from&#x27; and (source of &#x27;merit&#x27;) meaning &#x27;to serve, earn&#x27;. The word is attested since the early 17th century with the meaning &#x27;having served out one&#x27;s time, having done sufficient service&#x27;. The Latin feminine equivalent, &quot;emerita&quot; (), is also sometimes used, although in English the word &quot;emeritus&quot; is often unmarked for gender.

==In academia==
A tenured full professor who retires from an educational institution in good standing may be given the title &quot;professor emeritus&quot;. The title &quot;professor emerita&quot; is sometimes used for women. In most systems and institutions, the rank is bestowed on all professors who have retired in good standing, while at others, it needs a special act or vote. Professors emeriti may, depending on local circumstances, retain office space or other privileges. The adjective may be placed before or after the title (e.g., &quot;professor emeritus&quot; or &quot;emeritus professor&quot;).

==Other uses==
When a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, the word &quot;emeritus&quot; is added to their former title, i.e., &quot;Archbishop Emeritus of ...&quot;. The term &quot;Bishop Emeritus&quot; of a particular see can apply to several people, if the first lives long enough. The title was applied to the Bishop of Rome, &quot;Pope Emeritus&quot; Benedict XVI, on his retirement. In Community of Christ, the status of emeritus is occasionally granted to senior officials upon retirement. 

In Judaism, &quot;emeritus&quot; is often a title granted to long-serving rabbis of synagogues or other Jewish institutions. In some cases, the title is also granted to chazzans. Rabbi &quot;Emeritus&quot; or Cantor &quot;Emeritus&quot; is largely an honorific title. 

Since 2001, the honorary title of president pro tempore emeritus has been given to a senator of the minority party who has previously served as president pro tempore of the United States Senate.

It is also used in business and nonprofit organizations to denote perpetual status of the founder of an organization or individuals who made significant contributions to the institution. Phil Knight, for example, is the co-founder of Nike, and after decades of being the CEO, he is now the chairman emeritus of the company.

Following her decision to retire from Democratic leadership, the House Steering and Policy Committee voted to grant Nancy Pelosi the title of &quot;Speaker Emerita&quot; in recognition of her service as Speaker of the House, while newly elected Speaker Mike Johnson referred to his ousted predecessor Kevin McCarthy as &quot;Speaker Emeritus&quot;.

Cabinet of Singapore also adopted the use of emeritus and so far it has been conferred to Senior Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong in 2011, when he and then-Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew both stepped down from the upcoming cabinet as part of the party&#x27;s renewal process. Goh retired from politics in 2020, though his title as an emeritus was kept intact.
