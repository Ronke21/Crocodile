<text>David Henry Hwang (born August 11, 1957) is an American playwright, librettist, screenwriter, and theater professor at Columbia University in New York City. He has won three Obie Awards for his plays &quot;FOB&quot;, &quot;Golden Child&quot;, and &quot;Yellow Face&quot;. He has one Tony Award (&quot;M. Butterfly&quot;) and two other nominations (&quot;Golden Child&quot; and &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;). Three of his works (&quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Yellow Face&quot;, and &quot;Soft Power&quot;) have been finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

==Early life==
He was born in 1957 in Los Angeles, California, to Henry Yuan Hwang, the founder of Far East National Bank, and Dorothy Hwang, a piano teacher. The oldest of three children, he has two younger sisters. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from Stanford University in 1979 and attended the Yale School of Drama between 1980 and 1981, taking literature classes. He left once workshopping of new plays began, since he already had a play being produced in New York. His first play was produced at the Okada House dormitory (named Junipero House at the time) at Stanford University after he briefly studied playwriting with Sam Shepard and María Irene Fornés. In summer 1978, he studied playwriting with Sam Shepard and attended Padua Hills Playwrights Festival, both of which led him to write his first plays such as &quot;FOB&quot;.

==Career==
===Trilogy of Chinese America===
Hwang&#x27;s early plays concerned the role of the Chinese American and Asian American in the contemporary world. His first play, &quot;FOB&quot;, explores the contrasts and conflicts between established Asian Americans and &quot;Fresh Off the Boat&quot; new immigrants. The play was developed by the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center and premiered in 1980 Off-Broadway at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. In 1981 it won an Obie Award for Best New American Play. Papp produced four more of Hwang&#x27;s plays, including two in 1981: &quot;The Dance and the Railroad&quot;, which tells the story of a former Chinese opera star working as a coolie laborer in the 19th-century American West, and &quot;Family Devotions&quot;, a darkly comic take on the effects of Western religion on a Chinese-American family. This was nominated for the Drama Desk Award. Those three plays added up to what the author described as a &quot;Trilogy of Chinese America.&quot;

===Branching out / national success===
After this, Papp also produced the show &quot;Sound and Beauty&quot;, the omnibus title to two Hwang one-act plays set in Japan. At this time, Hwang started to work on projects for the small screen. A television movie, &quot;Blind Alleys&quot;, written by Hwang and Frederic Kimball and starring Pat Morita and Cloris Leachman, was produced in 1985 and followed a television version of &quot;The Dance and the Railroad&quot;.

His next play &quot;Rich Relations&quot;, was his first full-length to feature non-Asian characters. It premiered at the Second Stage Theatre in New York.

Hwang&#x27;s best-known play was &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, which premiered on Broadway in 1988. The play is a deconstruction of Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, alluding to news reports of the 20th-century relationship between French diplomat Bernard Boursicot and Shi Pei Pu, a male Chinese opera singer. Shi purportedly convinced Boursicot that he was a woman throughout their twenty-year relationship. The play won numerous awards for Best Play: a Tony Award (which Hwang was the first Asian American to win), the Drama Desk Award, the John Gassner Award, and the Outer Critics Circle Award. It was the first of three of his works to become a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

===Work post-&quot;Butterfly&quot;===
The success of &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; prompted Hwang&#x27;s interests in many other different directions, including work for opera, film, and the musical theatre. Hwang became a frequent collaborator as a librettist with the world-renowned composer Philip Glass.

One of &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;&#x27;s Broadway producers, David Geffen, oversaw a film version of the play, which was directed by David Cronenberg. Hwang also wrote an original script, &quot;Golden Gate&quot;, which was produced by American Playhouse. Hwang wrote an early draft of a screenplay based upon A. S. Byatt&#x27;s Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;&quot;, which was originally scheduled to be directed by Sydney Pollack. Years later, director/playwright Neil LaBute and Laura Jones would collaborate on the script for a 2002 film.

Throughout the 1990s, Hwang continued to write for the stage, including short plays for the famed Humana Festival at the Actors Theatre of Louisville. His full-length &quot;Golden Child&quot;, received its world premiere at South Coast Repertory in 1996. &quot;Golden Child&quot; was later produced in New York City. It won a 1997 Obie Award for playwriting for Hwang&#x27;s 1996 off-Broadway production. In 1998 it was produced on Broadway, and was nominated that year for a Tony Award for Best Play.

===Return to Broadway===
In the new millennium, Hwang had two Broadway successes back-to-back. He was asked by director Robert Falls to help co-write the book for the musical &quot;Aida&quot; (based upon the opera by Giuseppe Verdi). In an earlier version, it had failed in regional theatre tryouts. Hwang and Falls re-wrote a significant portion of the book (by Linda Woolverton). &quot;Aida&quot; (with music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice) opened in 2000 and proved highly profitable.

His next project was a radical revision of Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, II, and Joseph Fields&#x27; musical &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;. Although successful when introduced in the 1950s and early 1960s, it had become dated. The Civil Rights Movement and other cultural changes had disrupted continuing stereotypical portrayals of Asian American communities. Though it had never been a full critical success, the work inspired another generation of Asian Americans to re-imagine this musical. It was adapted from the novel &quot;The Flower Drum Song&quot; by C. Y. Lee, and tells the culture clash encountered by a Chinese family living in San Francisco.

The Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization allowed Hwang to significantly rework the plot, while retaining character names and songs. His 2002 version —both an homage to the original and a modern re-thinking— won him his third Tony nomination. Though &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; is often called the first musical with an all-Asian cast, the original production had cast many non-Asians in leading roles, including Caucasians and an African-American (Juanita Hall). But the 2002 revival was produced with an all-Asian cast of actor-singers, and it toured nationally.

===Back to The Public===

Hwang&#x27;s 2007 play &quot;Yellow Face&quot; relates to his play &quot;Face Value&quot;, which closed in previews on Broadway in the early 1990s. He wrote it in response to a controversy about the casting of Jonathan Pryce in an Eurasian role in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;. &quot;Face Value&quot;, which included music and lyrics for a musical-within-a-play by Hwang, lost millions of dollars. It was a stumbling block in the careers of Hwang and producer Stuart Ostrow.

In &quot;Yellow Face&quot;, Hwang wrote a semi-autobiographical play, featuring him as the main character in a media farce about mistaken racial identity. This had been also an important element in &quot;Face Value&quot;.

&quot;Yellow Face&quot; premiered in Los Angeles in 2007 at the Mark Taper Forum as a co-production with East West Players. It moved Off-Broadway to the Joseph Papp Public Theater, an important venue for Hwang&#x27;s earlier work. It enjoyed an extended run at the Papp, and won Hwang his third Obie Award for Playwriting. The play was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Hwang also wrote a new short play, &quot;The Great Helmsman&quot; for the Papp&#x27;s night of plays: &quot;Ten&quot;.

===Opera===
Hwang has continued to work steadily in the world of opera and musical theatre, and has written for children&#x27;s theatre as well. Hwang co-wrote the English-language libretto for an operatic adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; with music (and part of the libretto) by the Korean composer Unsuk Chin. It received its world premiere at the Bavarian State Opera in 2007 and was released on DVD in 2008.

Hwang wrote the libretto to Howard Shore&#x27;s opera &quot;The Fly&quot;, based on David Cronenberg&#x27;s 1986 film of the same name. The opera premiered on July 2, 2008, at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, France, with Cronenberg as director and Plácido Domingo conducting.

Hwang wrote the libretto for &quot;Tarzan&quot;, a musical based on a film by Walt Disney Pictures, which was produced on Broadway.

Hwang also collaborated on the multi-media event &quot;Icarus at the Edge of Time&quot;, adapted from Brian Greene&#x27;s novel of the same name. It featured music by Philip Glass and a film by &quot;Al and Al.&quot; The piece premiered as part of the World Science Festival.

After its major success at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre, Hwang&#x27;s play, &quot;Chinglish&quot;, quickly made its way to Broadway in October 2011. It won the Joseph Jefferson Award. &quot;Chinglish&quot; was largely inspired by Hwang&#x27;s frequent visits to China and his observations of interactions between Chinese and American people. Ticket sales of &quot;Chinglish&quot; were conservative.

Hwang&#x27;s short play &quot;A Very DNA Reunion&quot; was written for the evening of plays &quot;The DNA Trail&quot;, which was conceived by Jamil Khoury and premiered at the historic Chicago Temple Building.

===Since 2010===
Hwang worked on a theatrical commission for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and Arena Stage in Washington, DC. This was a musical version of Aimee Mann&#x27;s album &quot;The Forgotten Arm&quot;, with Mann and Paul Bryant. He also worked on screenplays for DreamWorks Animation and directors Justin Lin and Jonathan Caouette. In 2013, a production of &quot;Yellow Face&quot; premiered on YouTube. It was directed and adapted by Jeff Liu, and featured Sab Shimono among other actors.

In 2014 two new Hwang plays were premiered. The first, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, about the life of Bruce Lee, premiered as part of his residency at the Signature Theatre Off-Broadway. The play opened February 24, 2014 in a production directed by Leigh Silverman, and featuring Cole Horibe, who had gained fame in the TV series, &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. The second was &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, one of many plays included in &quot;The Mysteries&quot;, a re-telling of Bible stories. Conceived by Ed Sylvanus Iskander, &quot;The Mysteries&quot; also featured the work of playwrights Craig Lucas, Dael Orlandersmith, Jose Rivera, and Jeff Whitty.

In 2014, Hwang joined the Playwriting Faculty of the Columbia University School of the Arts Theatre Program. He was appointed the director of the Playwriting Concentration and will serve as an Associate Professor of Theatre in Playwriting. Hilton Als of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; has described him as &quot;the most successful Chinese American playwright this country has produced.&quot;

In 2016, Hwang became a writer and consulting producer of the Golden Globe-winning television series &quot;The Affair&quot; and in 1993 wrote a song &quot;Solo&quot; in association with Prince.

In the fall of 2016, the San Francisco Opera premiered &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber,&quot; an opera by Hwang and Bright Sheng, based on the eighteenth-century Chinese novel of the same name. In the summer of 2016, Hwang became the chair of the board of the American Theatre Wing.

In the Spring of 2018, Hwang&#x27;s &quot;Soft Power&quot; premiered at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The music and additional lyrics are by Jeanine Tesori. Its cast is largely Asian. It transferred to Off-Broadway at the Public Theater in September 2019 (previews). In May 2020, it was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, making Hwang the first person to be a three-time finalist without winning.

==Honors/recognition==
Hwang has been awarded numerous grants, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Guggenheim Fellowship and Rockefeller Foundations, the New York State Council on the Arts, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. He has been honored with awards from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Association for Asian Pacific American Artists, the Museum of Chinese in the Americas, the East West Players, the Organization of Chinese Americans, the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, the Center for Migration Studies, the Asian American Resource Workshop, the China Institute, and the New York Foundation for the Arts. In 1998, the nation&#x27;s oldest Asian American theatre company, the East West Players, christened its new mainstage The David Henry Hwang Theatre. Hwang was featured in an autobiographical series by Boise State University with a summary of his early work, as part of the &quot;Western Writers Series&quot;, written by Douglas Street. In 2011, Hwang received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a Grand Master of American Theater. In 2012, he was awarded the William Inge Award for Distinguished Achievement in the American Theatre, the Asia Society Cultural Achievement Award, the China Institute Blue Cloud Award, and the Steinberg Distinguished Playwright Award. In 2014, he received the Doris Duke Artist Award. In 2015, he received the 2015 ISPA Distinguished Artist Award.

Mr. Hwang sits on the boards of the Dramatists Guild, Young Playwrights Inc., and the Museum Of Chinese in the Americas (MOCA). He conducts interviews on arts-related topics for the national PBS cable television show &quot;Asian America&quot;. From 1994 to 2001, he served by appointment of President Bill Clinton on the President&#x27;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.

Hwang holds honorary degrees from Columbia College Chicago (1998), the American Conservatory Theater (2000), Lehigh University (2011), University of Southern California (2013), and State University of New York at Purchase (2015).

In 2012, Hwang was named a Fellow of United States Artists.

In 2015, Hwang was named a Ford Foundation &quot;Art of Change&quot; Fellow.

In 2018, Hwang earned induction into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Henry Yuan Hwang==
Hwang served on the board of directors for Far East National Bank founded by his father Henry Yuan Hwang. In 1999, American regulators investigated some of the bank&#x27;s transactions with Chinese banks as possible funding for illegal campaign contributions, Chinese espionage, and other possibilities, but the results were inconclusive. In 1989, Hwang&#x27;s father hired then-Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley as a consultant who received a loan from the bank, helping it secure $2 million from city funds. When this became a major scandal in the city, however, Bradley returned his $18,000 in payments, and resigned from the consulting work. Hwang addresses his father&#x27;s controversies in his semi-autobiographical 2007 play &quot;Yellow Face&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hwang was married to Ophelia Chong from 1985 until their divorce in 1989. In 1993, he married actress Kathryn Layng. They have two children together.

In November 2015, Hwang was the victim of a stabbing near his home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The assailant stabbed Hwang in the neck, severing his vertebral artery, before running from the scene. Hwang was seriously injured and underwent surgery before being discharged from the hospital. The attack appeared to be random, as nothing was taken; the assailant was never found. Hwang wrote about the experience in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The stabbing also inspired a semi-autobiographical portion of &quot;Soft Power&quot;, in which the lead character, also named David Henry Hwang, is the victim of a random stabbing.

Hwang endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

<text>Gish Jen (born Lillian Jen; () August 12, 1955) is a contemporary American writer and speaker.

==Early life and education==

Gish Jen is a second-generation Chinese American. Her parents emigrated from China in the 1940s; her mother was from Shanghai and her father was from Yixing. Born in Long Island, New York, she grew up in Queens, then Yonkers, then Scarsdale. Her birth name is Lillian, but during her high school years she acquired the nickname Gish, named for actress Lillian Gish.

She graduated from Harvard University in 1977 with a BA in English, and later attended Stanford Business School (1979–1980), but dropped out in favor of the University of Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, where she earned her MFA in fiction in 1983.

==Fiction==
Five of her short stories have been reprinted in &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;. Her piece &quot;Birthmates&quot;, was selected as one of &quot;The Best American Short Stories of The Century&quot; by John Updike. Her works include five novels: &quot;Typical American&quot;, &quot;Mona in the Promised Land&quot;, &quot;The Love Wife&quot;, &quot;World and Town&quot; and &quot;The Resisters&quot;. She has also written two collections of short fiction, &quot;Who&#x27;s Irish?&quot;, and &quot;Thank You, Mr. Nixon&quot;.

Her first novel, &quot;Typical American,&quot; was nominated for a National Books Critics&#x27; Circle Award. Her second novel, &quot;Mona in the Promised Land,&quot; features a Chinese-American adolescent who converts to Judaism. &quot;The Love Wife&quot;, her third novel, portrays an Asian American family with interracial parents and both biological and adopted children.

Her fourth novel, &quot;World and Town,&quot; portrays a fragile America, its small towns challenged by globalization, development, fundamentalism, and immigration, as well as the ripples sent out by 9/11. &quot;World and Town&quot; won the 2011 Massachusetts Book Prize in fiction and was nominated for the 2012 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.

Her fifth novel, &quot;The Resisters&quot;, was released in February 2020 and is a post-automation, feminist baseball dystopia. Set in the not-so-distant future, most jobs are now automated, much seacoast land is under water due to climate change, and the Internet and various social apps have been replaced by one all-seeing Alexa-like sentient Internet. The story centers around a &quot;surplus&quot; family with a prodigy pitching daughter where baseball becomes their field of resistance to an autocratic America. A related short story (&quot;Tell Me Everything&quot;) was commissioned by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as part of their Privacy Project and published January 5, 2020. Audible commissioned a novella spin-off called &quot;I, Autohouse&quot; as part of its Audible Originals series.

Jen&#x27;s second story collection, &quot;Thank You, Mr. Nixon&quot;, was published by Knopf on February 1, 2022. It consists of eleven interconnected stories that span the 50 years since Nixon&#x27;s historic visit to China and meeting with Chairman Mao. The tenth story in the collection, &quot;No More Maybe&quot;, was published in the March 19, 2018 edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and the final story in the collection, &quot;Detective Dog&quot;, was published in the November 22, 2021 edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and takes place in COVID-ravaged New York City. &quot;Detective Dog&quot; was selected for the &quot;Best American Short Stories of 2022&quot;.

==Nonfiction==
In 2013 Jen published her first non-fiction book, entitled &quot;Tiger Writing: Art, Culture, and the Interdependent Self&quot;. Based on the Massey Lectures that Jen delivered at Harvard in 2012, &quot;Tiger Writing&quot; explores East–West differences in self construction, and how these affect art and especially literature.

Jen&#x27;s second work of non-fiction is &quot;The Girl at the Baggage Claim: Explaining the East-West Culture Gap,&quot; published in February 2017. This is a provocative study of the different ideas Easterners and Westerners have about the self and society and what this means for current debates in art, education, geopolitics, and business. Drawing on stories and personal anecdotes, as well as recent research in cultural psychology, Jen reveals how this difference shapes what we perceive, remember, say, do, and make – in short, how it shapes everything from our ideas about copying and talking in class to the difference between Apple and Alibaba.

Jen has also published numerous pieces in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, among others. In response to the 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, Jen penned an op-ed for the &quot;Times&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
In 2009, Princeton&#x27;s Elaine Showalter devoted much attention to Jen in her survey of American women writers, &quot;A Jury of Her Peers: American Women Writers From Anne Bradstreet to Annie Proulx.&quot; In an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Showalter elaborated, including Jen in a list of eight top authors, and pointing out that Jen&#x27;s &quot;vision of a multicultural America goes well beyond the angry rants or despairing projections of Roth, DeLillo, McCarthy or other finalists in the Great American Novel competition.&quot; In 2012, Junot Diaz concurred, calling Jen &quot;the Great American Novelist we&#x27;re always hearing about.&quot; And in 2000, in a millennial edition of &quot;The Times Magazine&quot; in the UK, in which figures were asked to name their successors in the 21st century, John Updike picked Jen.

&quot;Thank You, Mr. Nixon&quot; was longlisted for the inaugural Carol Shields Prize for Fiction in 2023.

<doc id="180279" wikidata="Q48013" url="?curid=180279" title="Ounce">
<text>The ounce () is any of several different units of mass, weight, or volume and is derived almost unchanged from the , an Ancient Roman unit of measurement.

The avoirdupois ounce (exactly ) is avoirdupois pound; this is the United States customary and British imperial ounce. It is primarily used in the United States.

Although the avoirdupois ounce is the mass measure used for most purposes, the &#x27;troy ounce&#x27; of exactly is used instead for the mass of precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc.

The term &#x27;ounce&#x27; is also used in other contexts:
* The ounce-force is a measure of force (see below).
* The fluid ounce is a measure of volume.

Historically, a variety of different ounces measuring mass or volume were used in different jurisdictions by different trades and at different times in history.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ounce&quot; derives from the Ancient Roman (meaning: a twelfth), a unit in the Ancient Roman units of measurement weighing about 27.4 grams or 96.7% of an avoirdupois ounce, that was one-twelfth () of the Roman pound (). This in turn comes from Latin (&#x27;one&#x27;), and thus originally meant simply &#x27;unit&#x27;. The term &quot;uncia&quot; was borrowed twice: first into Old English as or from an unattested Vulgar Latin form with &quot;ts&quot; for &quot;c&quot; before &quot;i&quot; (palatalization), which survives in modern English as &quot;inch&quot;, and a second time into Middle English through Anglo-Norman and Middle French (), yielding English &quot;ounce&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;oz&quot; came later from the Italian cognate , pronounced (now , pronounced ).

== Definitions ==
Historically, in different parts of the world, at different points in time, and for different applications, the ounce (or its translation) has referred to broadly similar but still slightly different standards of mass.

=== Currently in use ===

==== International avoirdupois ounce ====
The international avoirdupois ounce (abbreviated oz) is defined as exactly 28.349523125 g under the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, signed by the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations.

In the avoirdupois system, sixteen ounces make up an avoirdupois pound, and the avoirdupois pound is defined as 7000 grains; one avoirdupois ounce is therefore equal to 437.5 grains.

The ounce is still a standard unit in the United States. In the United Kingdom it ceased to be an independent unit of measure in 2000, but may still be seen as a general indicator of portion sizes in burger and steak restaurants.

==== International troy ounce ====

A troy ounce (abbreviated oz t) is equal to 480 grains. Consequently, the international troy ounce is equal to exactly 31.1034768 grams. There are 12 troy ounces in the now obsolete troy pound.

Today, the troy ounce is used only to express the mass of precious metals such as gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium or silver. Bullion coins are the most common products produced and marketed in troy ounces, but precious metal bars also exist in gram and kilogram (kg) sizes. (A kilogram bullion bar contains .)

For historical measurement of gold,
* a fine ounce is a troy ounce of pure gold content in a gold bar, computed as fineness multiplied by gross weight
* a standard ounce is a troy ounce of 22 carat gold, 91.66% pure (an 11 to 1 proportion of gold to alloy material)

==== Metric ounces ====
Some countries have redefined their ounces in the metric system. For example, the German apothecaries&#x27; ounce of 30 grams is very close to the previously widespread Nuremberg ounce, but the divisions and multiples come out in metric.

In 1820, the Dutch redefined their ounce (in Dutch, &quot;ons&quot;) as 100 grams. In 1937 the IJkwet of the Netherlands officially abolished the term, but it is still commonly used. 
Dutch amendments to the metric system, such as an &quot;ons&quot; or 100 grams, has been inherited, adopted, and taught in Indonesia beginning in elementary school. It is also listed as standard usage in Indonesia&#x27;s national dictionary, the &quot;Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia&quot;, and the government&#x27;s official elementary-school curriculum.

=== Historical ===

==== Apothecaries&#x27; ounce ====
The apothecaries&#x27; ounce (abbreviated ℥) equivalent to the troy ounce, was formerly used by apothecaries, and is thus obsolete.

==== Maria Theresa ounce ====
&quot;Maria Theresa ounce&quot; was once introduced in Ethiopia and some European countries, which was equal to the weight of one Maria Theresa thaler, or 28.0668 g. Both the weight and the value are the definition of one &quot;birr&quot;, still in use in present-day Ethiopia and formerly in Eritrea.

==== Spanish ounce ====

The Spanish pound () was 460 g. The Spanish ounce (Spanish ) was of a pound, i.e. 28.75 g. It was further subdivided into 16 (each 1.8 grams). For pharmaceutical use, the Greek was used, subdividing the Spanish ounce into 8 (3.6 grams), due to being equivalent to of an avoirdupois ounce. In either case, it could be further subdivided into grains, each one 49.9 milligrams.

==== Tower ounce ==== 
The Tower ounce of was a fraction of the tower pound used in the English mints, the principal one being in the Tower of London. It dates back to the Anglo-Saxon coinage weight standard. It was abolished in favour of the Troy ounce by Henry VIII in 1527.

==Ounce-force==

An ounce-force is of a pound-force, or about . It is defined as the force exerted by a mass of one avoirdupois ounce under standard gravity (at the surface of the earth, its weight).

The &quot;ounce&quot; in &quot;ounce-force&quot; is equivalent to an avoirdupois ounce; ounce-force is a measurement of force using avoirdupois ounces. It is customarily not identified or differentiated. The term has limited use in engineering calculations to simplify unit conversions between mass, force, and acceleration systems of calculations.

==Fluid ounce==

A fluid ounce (abbreviated fl oz, fl. oz. or oz. fl.) is a unit of volume. An imperial fluid ounce is defined in British law as exactly 28.4130625 millilitres, while a US customary fluid ounce is exactly 29.5735295625 mL, and a US food labelling fluid ounce is 30 mL. The fluid ounce is sometimes referred to simply as an &quot;ounce&quot; in contexts where its use is implicit, such as bartending.

== Other uses ==

=== Fabric weight ===
Ounces are also used to express the &quot;weight&quot;, or more accurately the areal density, of a textile fabric in North America, Asia, or the UK, as in &quot;16 oz denim&quot;. The number refers to the weight in ounces of a given amount of fabric, either a yard of a given width, or a square yard, where the depth of the fabric is a fabric-specific constant.

=== Copper layer thickness of a printed circuit board ===
The most common unit of measure for the copper thickness on a printed circuit board (PCB) is ounces (oz), as in mass. It is the resulting thickness when the mass of copper is pressed flat and spread evenly over a one-square-foot area. 1 oz will roughly equal 34.7 μm.

<doc id="180280" wikidata="Q281833" url="?curid=180280" title="Taira no Kiyomori">
<text>was a military leader and &quot;kugyō&quot; of the late Heian period of Japan. He established the first samurai-dominated administrative government in the history of Japan.

==Early life==
Kiyomori was born in Japan, in 1118 as the first son of Taira no Tadamori. His mother, Gion no Nyogo, was wife of Tadamori and a palace servant according to &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;.

== Family ==
Father: Taira no Tadamori&lt;br&gt;Mother: Gion no Nyogo (d. 1147)&lt;br&gt;Concubine(s): Taira no Tokiko&lt;br&gt;Children:
* Taira no Shigemori
* Taira no Munemori
* Taira no Tomomori
* Taira no Tokuko
* Taira no Shigehira

==Career==
After the death of his father in 1153, Kiyomori assumed control of the Taira clan and ambitiously entered the political realm, in which he had previously only held a minor post. Before that though, in 1156, he and Minamoto no Yoshitomo, head of the Minamoto clan, suppressed the rebels in the Hōgen Rebellion. This established the Taira and Minamoto as the top samurai clans in Kyoto. However, this caused the allies to become bitter rivals which culminated four years later during the Heiji Rebellion in 1160. Kiyomori, emerging victorious with Yoshitomo (whose two eldest sons were killed), was now the head of the single most powerful warrior clan in imperial capital Kyoto. However, his clan&#x27;s power and influence in the provinces at this time is a matter of debate. Kiyomori showed mercy and exiled a few of Yoshitomo&#x27;s surviving sons, including Yoritomo, Noriyori, and Yoshitsune – a benevolence that would turn out to be the Taira clan&#x27;s downfall later on.

Due to his status as the head of the sole remaining warrior clan in imperial court, Kiyomori was in a unique position to manipulate the court rivalry between the retired emperor, Go-Shirakawa, and his son, Emperor Nijō. Because of this manipulation, Kiyomori was able to climb the ranks of government, though the majority of his promotions as well as the success of his family in gaining ranks and titles at court was due to Shirakawa&#x27;s patronage. This culminated in 1167, when Kiyomori became the first courtier of a warrior family to be appointed &quot;daijō-daijin&quot;, chief minister of the government, and the &quot;de facto&quot; administrator of the imperial government. As was the norm, he soon relinquished the position and leadership of the Taira clan, with the goal of maintaining the social and political prestige of having attained the highest office in the land, but being free of the attendant duties. This had been a common practice for many years in the highest levels of ancient Japanese government and in doing so Kiyomori was asserting what he felt was his strong position in the Kyoto government. However, many of the courtiers from traditional civil (non-warrior) noble families were less than pleased with both Kiyomori&#x27;s attainment of power, and how he comported himself with regard to other high ranking courtiers.

In 1171, Kiyomori arranged a marriage between his daughter Tokuko and Emperor Takakura. Their first son, the future Emperor Antoku, was born in 1178. The next year, in 1179, Kiyomori staged a coup d&#x27;état forcing the resignation of his rivals from all government posts and subsequently banishing them. He then filled the open government positions with his allies and relatives, and imprisoned (house arrest) the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa. Finally, in 1180 Kiyomori forced Emperor Takakura to abdicate and give Prince Tokihito the throne, who then became Emperor Antoku.

With the exertion of Taira power and wealth and Kiyomori&#x27;s new monopoly on authority, many of his allies, most of the provincial samurai, and even members of his own clan turned against him. Prince Mochihito, brother of Emperor Takakura, called on Kiyomori&#x27;s old rivals of the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira, beginning the Genpei War in the middle of 1180. Kiyomori died early the next year from sickness, leaving his son Munemori to preside over the downfall and destruction of the Taira at the hands of the Minamoto in 1185.

&quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; states that as he lay dying, Kiyomori&#x27;s fever was so high that anyone who attempted to even get near him would be burned by the heat.
The rapid rise of certain notable figures to prominence, as well as their decline, have been popularly attributed to Dakiniten. A certain anecdote regarding the military leader Taira no Kiyomori found in the &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot; (one of a number of variants of the &quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;) claims that Kiyomori once shot an arrow at a fox during a hunt. The fox then transformed into a woman who promised to grant Kiyomori whatever he wanted in exchange for her life. Kiyomori, realizing this woman is none other than the goddess Kiko Tennō (貴狐天王, lit. &quot;Venerable Fox Deva-King&quot;, i.e. Dakiniten), spared her life. He subsequently became a devotee of the goddess, despite his awareness that the benefits obtained through the Dakiniten rite (吒天の法, &quot;Daten no hō&quot;) would not be passed on to his progeny. The story thus attributes both Kiyomori&#x27;s rise in power and the subsequent fall of his clan to his performance of the Dakiniten ritual.

==Cultural references==

Taira no Kiyomori is the main character in the Kamakura period epic, the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot;.

The Daiei Film production of Kenji Mizoguchi&#x27;s 1955 film &quot;Shin Heike Monogatari&quot; (variously translated as &quot;Taira Clan Saga, Tales of the Taira Clan&quot;, and &quot;The Sacrilegious Hero&quot;) credits its story as &quot;from the novel by Yoshikawa Eiji&quot;, which in turn is a 1950 retelling of the 14th-century epic &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;. The opening introduction to the film, in its English subtitles, is

Unlike most other tellings, Mizoguchi&#x27;s film includes only the story of Taira no Kiyomori&#x27;s youth, depicting him as a heroic character, particularly in breaking the power of the tyrannical armed monks and their palanquin shrines, where he says at his father&#x27;s grave &quot;Father, with two arrows from my bow I destroyed a superstition that gripped men for centuries. The courtiers and priests have tried to have me for blasphemy. But others have supported me, more than I expected. Some of them are lords, too. Father, a greater battle lies ahead. But I remain undaunted. No matter how I am beaten, I shall rise again&quot;. The film then ends with Kiyomori approaching an alfresco Fujiwara dance, vowing to himself, &quot;Dance, my Lords, dance. Your end is near. Tomorrow will be ours!&quot;

Taira no Kiyomori was featured by 19th-century woodblock print artists as an exemplar of guilt and retribution, see the accompanying print by Yoshitoshi. The famous print generally known as &quot;The Vision of Kiyomori&quot; by Utagawa Hiroshige depicts the actor Nakamura Utayemon IV in the character of Kiyomori, confronted by the horrific vision of his snow-filled garden transformed into the heaped bones and skulls of his slaughtered enemies.

In video games, Kiyomori appears in &quot;Warriors Orochi 2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; fighting for Orochi&#x27;s army and using prayer beads as weapons. He also makes an appearance in &quot;Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce&quot;, as a boss in one of the game&#x27;s Crossover Missions. Additionally, he is the main antagonist in &quot;Harukanaru Toki no Naka De 3&quot;.

Kiyomori also features prominently as a sympathetic villain in Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s Phoenix series in the first half of the ninth volume, &quot;Turbulent Times&quot; (retitled &quot;Civil War&quot; in English), another Genpei War epic. Like most villains in the series he desires the titular bird for its immortality granting blood, due to his desire to continue to lead and protect the Taira clan and lack of confidence in his successors, but winds up being tricked into buying an imported peacock instead.

A character named Lord Kiyomori appears in Book 6, &quot;The Lords of the Rising Sun&quot; in the Fabled Lands adventure gamebook series, where he is portrayed as the Imperial Sovereign Takakura&#x27;s chancellor, and on the verge of war with the self-proclaimed shogun by the name of &quot;Yoritomo&quot;.

The 2012 NHK Taiga drama was about him.

<doc id="180283" wikidata="Q688564" url="?curid=180283" title="Calendar of saints">
<text>The calendar of saints is the traditional Christian method of organizing a liturgical year by associating each day with one or more saints and referring to the day as the feast day or feast of said saint. The word &quot;feast&quot; in this context does not mean &quot;a large meal, typically a celebratory one&quot;, but instead &quot;an annual religious celebration, a day dedicated to a particular saint&quot;.

The system rose from the early Christian custom of commemorating each martyr annually on the date of their death, their birth into heaven, a date therefore referred to in Latin as the martyr&#x27;s &quot;dies natalis&quot; (&#x27;day of birth&#x27;). In the Eastern Orthodox Church, a calendar of saints is called a &quot;Menologion&quot;. &quot;Menologion&quot; may also mean a set of icons on which saints are depicted in the order of the dates of their feasts, often made in two panels.

== History ==

As the number of recognized saints increased during Late Antiquity and the first half of the Middle Ages, eventually every day of the year had at least one saint who was commemorated on that date. To deal with this increase, some saints were moved to alternate days in some traditions or completely removed, with the result that some saints have different feast days in different calendars. For example, saints Perpetua and Felicity died on 7 March, but this date was later assigned to St. Thomas Aquinas, allowing them only a commemoration (see Tridentine calendar), so in 1908 they were moved one day earlier. When the 1969 reform of the Catholic calendar moved him to 28 January, they were moved back to 7 March (see General Roman Calendar). Both days can thus be said to be their feast day, in different traditions. The General Roman Calendar, which list those saints celebrated in the entire church, contains only a selection of the saints for each of its days. A fuller list is found in the Roman Martyrology, and some of the saints there may be celebrated locally.

The earliest feast days of saints were those of martyrs, venerated as having shown for Christ the greatest form of love, in accordance with the teaching: &quot;Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.&quot; Saint Martin of Tours is said to be the first or at least one of the first non-martyrs to be venerated as a saint. The title &quot;confessor&quot; was used for such saints, who had confessed their faith in Christ by their lives rather than by their deaths. Martyrs are regarded as dying in the service of the Lord, and confessors are people who died natural deaths. A broader range of titles was used later, such as Virgin, Pastor, Bishop, Monk, Priest, Founder, Abbot, Apostle, and Doctor of the Church.

The Tridentine Missal has common formulæ for Masses of Martyrs, Confessors who were bishops, Doctors of the Church, Confessors who were not Bishops, Abbots, Virgins, Non-Virgins, Dedication of Churches, and Feast Days of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pope Pius XII added a common formula for Popes. The 1962 Roman Missal of Pope John XXIII omitted the common of Apostles, assigning a proper Mass to every feast day of an Apostle. The present Roman Missal has common formulas for the Dedication of Churches, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Martyrs (with special formulas for missionary martyrs and virgin martyrs), pastors (subdivided into bishops, generic pastors, founders of churches, and missionaries), Doctors of the Church, Virgins, and (generic) Saints (with special formulas for abbots, monks, nuns, religious, those noted for works of mercy, educators, and [generically] women saints).

This calendar system, when combined with major church festivals and movable and immovable feasts, constructs a very human and personalised yet often localized way of organizing the year and identifying dates. Some Christians continue the tradition of dating by saints&#x27; days: their works may appear &quot;dated&quot; as &quot;The Feast of Saint Martin&quot;.

As different Christian jurisdictions parted ways theologically, differing lists of saints began to develop. This happened because the same individual may be considered differently by one church; in extreme examples, one church&#x27;s saint may be another church&#x27;s heretic, as in the cases of Nestorius, Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria, or Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople.

== Ranking of feast days ==

In the Catholic Church feast days are ranked in accordance with their importance. In the post-Vatican II form of the Roman Rite, feast days are ranked (in descending order of importance) as solemnities, feasts or memorials (obligatory or optional). Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 Code of Rubrics, whose use remains authorized by the motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, divides liturgical days into I, II, III, and IV class days. Those who use even earlier forms of the Roman Rite rank feast days as doubles (of three or four kinds), Semidoubles, and Simples. See Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church the ranking of feasts varies from church to church. In the Russian Orthodox Church they are: Great Feasts, middle, and minor feasts. Each portion of such feasts may also be called feasts as follows: All-night vigils, Polyeleos, Great Doxology, Sextuple (&quot;sixfold&quot;, having six stichera at Vespers and six troparia at the Canon of Matins). There are also distinctions between Simple feasts and double (i.e., two simple feasts celebrated together). In Double Feasts, the order of hymns and readings for each feast are rigidly instructed in Typikon, the liturgy book.

The Lutheran Churches celebrate Festivals, Lesser Festivals, Days of Devotion, and Commemorations.

In the Church of England, mother Church of the Anglican Communion, there are Principal Feasts and Principal Holy Days, Festivals, Lesser Festivals, and Commemorations.

== Connection to tropical cyclones ==
Before the advent of standardized naming of tropical storms and hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin, tropical storms and hurricanes that affected the island of Puerto Rico were informally named after the Catholic saints corresponding to the feast days when the cyclones either made landfall or started to seriously affect the island. Examples include: the 1780 San Calixto hurricane (more widely known as the Great Hurricane of 1780, the deadliest in the North Atlantic basin&#x27;s recorded history; named after Pope Callixtus I (Saint Callixtus), whose feast day is October 14), the 1867 San Narciso hurricane (named after Saint Narcissus of Jerusalem, feast day October 29), the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane (the deadliest in the island&#x27;s recorded history; Saint Cyriacus, August 8), the 1928 San Felipe hurricane (the strongest in terms of measured wind speed; Saint Philip, father of Saint Eugenia of Rome, September 13), and the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane (Saint Cyprian, September 26).

This practice continued until quite some time after the United States Weather Bureau (now called the National Weather Service) started publishing and using official female human names (initially; male names were added starting in 1979 after the NWS relinquished control over naming to the World Meteorological Organization). The last two usages of this informal naming scheme in Puerto Rico were in 1956 (Hurricane Betsy, locally nicknamed Santa Clara after Saint Clare of Assisi, feast day August 12 back then; her feast day was advanced one day in 1970) and 1960 (Hurricane Donna, nicknamed San Lorenzo after Saint Lawrence Justinian, September 5 back then; feast day now observed January 8 by Canons regular of St. Augustine).

<doc id="180289" wikidata="Q192151" url="?curid=180289" title="Saint Valentine">
<text>Saint Valentine (; ) was a 3rd-century Roman saint, commemorated in Western Christianity on February 14 and in Eastern Orthodoxy on July 6. From the High Middle Ages, his feast day has been associated with a tradition of courtly love. He is also a patron saint of Terni, epilepsy, and beekeepers. Saint Valentine was a clergymaneither a priest or a bishopin the Roman Empire who ministered to persecuted Christians. He was martyred and his body buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14, which has been observed as the Feast of Saint Valentine (Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day) since at least the eighth century.

Relics of him were kept in the Church and Catacombs of San Valentino in Rome, which &quot;remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of St. Valentine were transferred to the church of Santa Prassede during the pontificate of Nicholas IV&quot;. His skull, crowned with flowers, is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. Other relics of him are in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church, Dublin, Ireland, a popular place of pilgrimage, especially on Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day, for those seeking love. At least two different Saint Valentines are mentioned in the early martyrologies. For Saint Valentine of Rome, along with Saint Valentine of Terni, &quot;abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of Europe&quot;, according to Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas.

Saint Valentine is commemorated in the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Churches on February 14. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, he is recognised on July 6; in addition, the Eastern Orthodox Church observes the feast of Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna, on July 30. In 1969, the Catholic Church removed his name from the General Roman Calendar, leaving his liturgical celebration to local calendars, though use of the pre-1970 liturgical calendar is also authorised under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; of 2007. The Catholic Church continues to recognise him as a saint, listing him as such in the February 14 entry in the Roman Martyrology. The official Liturgical Calendar for the Dioceses of the United States identifies February 14 as the memorial of Saints Cyril and Methodius.

== Identification ==
Saint Valentine does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the &quot;Chronography of 354&quot;, although the patron of the Chronography&#x27;s compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus. There is a reference to his feast day on 14 February in one of the 9th century copies of the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot;, which may have been compiled originally between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources, but the entry may be much later. The widespread modern legend that the feast of St. Valentine on February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those &quot;... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God&quot; is in fact based upon a statement in the Gelasian Decree which mentions St George but not St Valentine, and is not in fact by Gelasius.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; and other hagiographical sources speak of three Saints Valentine that appear in connection with February 14. One was a Roman priest, another the bishop of Interamna (modern Terni, Italy) both buried along the Via Flaminia outside Rome, at different distances from the city. The third was said to be a saint who suffered on the same day with a number of companions in the Roman province of Africa, of whom nothing else is known.

Though the extant accounts of the martyrdoms of the first two listed saints are of a late date and contain legendary elements, &quot;a common nucleus of fact&quot; may underlie the two accounts and they may refer to &quot;a single person&quot;. According to the official biography of the Diocese of Terni, Bishop Valentine was born and lived in Interamna and while on a temporary stay in Rome he was imprisoned, tortured, and martyred there on February 14, 269. His body was hastily buried at a nearby cemetery and a few nights later his disciples retrieved his body and returned him home.

The &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, the Catholic Church&#x27;s official list of recognised saints, for February 14 gives only one Saint Valentine: a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia.

The name &quot;Valentine&quot;, derived from &quot;valens&quot; (worthy, strong, powerful), was popular in Late Antiquity. About eleven other saints with the name Valentine are commemorated in the Catholic Church. Some Eastern Churches of the Western rite may provide still other different lists of Saint Valentines. The Roman martyrology lists only seven who died on days &quot;other&quot; than February 14: a priest from Viterbo (November 3); Valentine of Passau, papal missionary bishop to Raetia, among first patrons of Passau, and later hermit in Zenoburg, near Mais, South Tyrol, Italy, where he died in 475 (January 7); a 5th-century priest and hermit (July 4); a Spanish hermit who died c. 715 (October 25); Valentine Berrio Ochoa, martyred in 1861 (November 24); and Valentine Jaunzarás Gómez, martyred in 1936 (September 18). It also lists a virgin, Saint Valentina, who was martyred in 308 (July 25) in Caesarea, Palestine.

==Hagiography and testimony==

The inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.

A common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of Terni, an important town of Umbria, in central Italy. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of Jesus. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge&#x27;s adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl&#x27;s sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentinus, praying to God, laid his hands on her eyes and the child&#x27;s vision was restored. 

Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentinus what he should do. Valentinus replied that all of the idols around the judge&#x27;s house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo the Christian sacrament of baptism. The judge obeyed and, as a result of his fasting and prayer, freed all the Christian inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member household of adult family members and servants were baptised. 

Valentinus was later arrested again for continuing to evangelise. He was sent to the prefect of Rome, to the emperor Claudius Gothicus (Claudius II) himself. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentinus tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity. Claudius refused and condemned Valentinus to death, commanding that Valentinus either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs and beheaded. Valentinus refused and was executed outside the Flaminian Gate on February 14, 269.
An embellishment to this account states that before his execution, Saint Valentine wrote a note to Asterius&#x27;s daughter signed &quot;from your Valentine&quot;, which is said to have &quot;inspired today&#x27;s romantic missives&quot;.

The &quot;Legenda Aurea&quot; of Jacobus de Voragine, compiled and one of the most-read books of the High Middle Ages, gives sufficient details of the saints for each day of the liturgical year to inspire a homily on each occasion. The very brief &quot;vita&quot; of St Valentine states that he was executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the &quot;Emperor Claudius&quot; in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of &quot;Valentine&quot;, &quot;as containing valor&quot;.

A popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest of exceptional learning who converted the daughter of Asterius and forty-nine others to Christianity before being martyred during the reign of Claudius Gothicus.

There are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that the priest Valentine defied the order of the emperor and secretly performed Christian weddings for couples, allowing the husbands involved to escape conscription into the Roman army. This legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a great inconvenience to the emperor. The account mentions that in order &quot;to remind these men of their vows and God’s love, Saint Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment&quot;, giving them to these persecuted Christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day.

==Namesake churches==
There are many churches dedicated to Saint Valentine in countries such as Italy. Saint Valentine was venerated no more than other Christian martyrs and saints.

A 5th- or 6th-century work called &quot;Passio Marii et Marthae&quot; made up a legend about Saint Valentine&#x27;s Basilica being dedicated to Saint Valentine in Rome. A later &quot;Passio&quot; repeated the legend and added the adornment that Pope Julius I (357–352) had built the ancient basilica &quot;S. Valentini extra Portam&quot; on top of his sepulchre, in the Via Flaminia. This church was really named after a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated the land on which it is built. It hosted the martyr&#x27;s relics until the 13th century, when they were transferred to Santa Prassede, and the ancient basilica decayed.

Saint Valentine&#x27;s Church in Rome, built in 1960 for the needs of the Olympic Village, continues as a modern, well-visited parish church.

==Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day==

Saint Valentine of Rome was martyred on February 14 in AD 269. The Feast of Saint Valentine, also known as Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day, was established by Pope Gelasius I in AD 496 to be celebrated on February 14 in honour of the Christian martyr.
February 14 is Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day in the Lutheran calendar of saints. Valentine is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on February 14. The Church of England had him in its pre-Reformation calendars, and restored his mention as bishop and martyr in its 1661–62 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, and most provinces of the Anglican Communion celebrate his feast. The Catholic Church includes him in its official list of saints, the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;. 

Saint Valentine was also in the General Roman Calendar for celebration as a simple feast until 1955, when Pope Pius XII reduced all such feasts to just a commemoration within another celebration. The 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar removed this mention, leaving it for inclusion only in local calendars such as that of Balzan, Malta. His commemoration was still in the 1962 Roman Missal and is thus observed also by those who, in the circumstances indicated in Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s 2007 motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, use that edition.

July 6 is the date on which the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates the Roman presbyter Valentine; on July 30 it observes the feast of the Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna. Members of the Greek Orthodox Church named Valentinos (male) or Valentina (female) may observe their name day on the Western ecclesiastical calendar date of February 14.

English 18th-century antiquarians Alban Butler and Francis Douce, noting the obscurity of Saint Valentine&#x27;s identity, suggested that Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day was created as an attempt to supersede the pagan holiday of Lupercalia (mid-February in Rome). This idea has lately been dismissed by academics and researchers, such as Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas, Henry Ansgar Kelly of the University of California, Los Angeles and Michael Matthew Kaylor of Masaryk University. Many of the current legends that characterize Saint Valentine were invented in the 14th century in England, notably by Geoffrey Chaucer and his circle, when the feast day of February 14 first became associated with romantic love.

Oruch charges that the traditions associated with &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, documented in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot; and set in the fictional context of an old tradition, did not exist before Chaucer. He argues that the speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among 18th-century antiquaries, notably Alban Butler, the author of &quot;Butler&#x27;s Lives of Saints&quot;, and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. In the French 14th-century manuscript illumination from a &quot;Vies des Saints&quot; (&quot;illustration above&quot;), Saint Valentine, Bishop of Terni, oversees the construction of his basilica at Terni; there is no suggestion here that the bishop was a patron of lovers.

During the Middle Ages, it was believed that birds paired in mid-February. This was then associated with the romance of Valentine. Although these legends differ, Valentine&#x27;s Day is widely recognised as a day for romance and devotion.

== Associated Christian relics ==

The flower-crowned alleged skull of St. Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.

St. Valentine&#x27;s remains are deposited in St Anton&#x27;s Church, Madrid, where they have lain since the late 1700s. They were a present from the Pope to King Carlos IV, who entrusted them to the Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools (Piarists). The relics have been displayed publicly since 1984, in a foundation open to the public at all times in order to help people in need.

Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church, Dublin, also houses some relics of St Valentine. On 27 December 1835, the Very Reverend Father John Spratt, Master of Sacred Theology to the Carmelite order in Dublin, was sent the partial remains of St Valentine by Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi, under the auspices of Pope Gregory XVI. The relics and the accompanying letter from Cardinal Odescalchi have remained in the church ever since. The remains, which include &quot;a small vessel tinged with his blood&quot;, were sent as a token of esteem following an eloquent sermon Fr Spratt had delivered in Rome. 

On Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day in Ireland, many individuals who seek true love make a Christian pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, which is said to house relics of Saint Valentine of Rome; they pray at the shrine in hope of finding romance. Therein lies a book in which foreigners and locals have written their prayer requests for love.

Another relic was found in 2003 in Prague in the Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul at Vyšehrad.

Saint Valentine&#x27;s relics can also be found in Slovakia in two cities. The first is Košice, where the relic is placed in the Immaculate Conception (placed in 1720). The second is Nováky, which they had in the church of St. Nicholas and the rare statue of Saint Valentine, which was stolen in the 1990s (according to one saved original part of the statue – the head, a new copy was created, which was ceremoniously placed in the church in 2000.

A silver reliquary containing a fragment of St. Valentine&#x27;s skull is found in the parish church of St. Mary&#x27;s Assumption in Chełmno, Poland.

Relics can also be found in Mytilene on the Greek island of Lesbos.

Another set of relics can also be found in Savona, in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta.

Alleged relics of St. Valentine also lie at the reliquary of Roquemaure, Gard, France, in the St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, Vienna, in Balzan in Malta and also in Blessed John Duns Scotus Church in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland. There is also a gold reliquary bearing the words &quot;Corpus St. Valentin, M&quot; (Body of St. Valentine, Martyr) at Birmingham Oratory, UK, in one of the side altars in the main church.

<text>Ellsworth Huntington (September 16, 1876 – October 17, 1947) was a professor of geography at Yale University during the early 20th century, known for his studies on environmental determinism/climatic determinism, economic growth, and economic geography. He served as president of the Ecological Society of America in 1917, the Association of American Geographers in 1923 and president of the board of directors of the American Eugenics Society from 1934 to 1938.

He taught at Euphrates College, Turkey (1897–1901); accompanied the Pumpelly (1903) and Barrett (1905–1906) expeditions to central Asia; and wrote of his Asian experiences in &quot;Explorations in Turkestan&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Pulse of Asia&quot; (1907). He taught geography at Yale (1907–1915) and from 1917 was a research associate there, devoting his time chiefly to climatic and anthropogeographic studies. He was the 1916 recipient of the Elisha Kent Kane Gold Medal from the Geographical Society of Philadelphia.

In 1909, Huntington led the Yale Expedition to Palestine. It was his mission to determine &quot;step by step the process by which geologic structure, topographic form, and the present and past nature of the climate have shaped man&#x27;s progress, moulded his history; and thus played an incalculable part in the development of a system of thought which could scarcely have arisen under any other physical circumstances.&quot;

During the Progressive Era, Huntington expressed concern about immigration and the race mixing. He claimed that liberal immigration policy would lead to the &quot;highest racial values&quot; being &quot;irrevocably swamped by those of lower calibre.&quot;

He was on the original standing committee of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles from 1941.

<text>John Francis Mehegan (June 6, 1916 – April 3, 1984) was an American jazz pianist, lecturer and critic.

==Early life==
Mehegan was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on June 6, 1916, although he sometimes gave the year as 1920. He began playing the violin in 1926 and played for seven years without enjoying it. He initially taught himself to play the piano by matching his fingers to the notes played on a player piano. He went on to study at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford. He had gigs in the Massachusetts area, and then moved to New York in 1941.

==Later life and career==
In New York, Mehegan played in clubs. He recorded four quartet tracks as a leader for Savoy Records in 1945. In the same year, he became teaching assistant to pianist Teddy Wilson in the jazz department at the Metropolitan Music School, and became the head of its jazz department in 1946; a position he held for around a decade. In the early 1950s, his &quot;From Barrelhouse to Bop&quot; album was the first release by Perspective Records; it consisted of spoken introductions followed by performances in the style of other jazz pianists. He also taught at the Juilliard School of Music (1947–64), Columbia University Teachers College (1958 to 1961 or 1962), the University of Bridgeport (1968–77) and Yale University (1974–83).

He wrote the incidental music for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; which he performed on Broadway for two years. Mehegan was questioned by the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he was an uncooperative witness. He was the jazz critic for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; from 1957 to 1960. &quot;A summer concert, lecture, and research tour of South Africa in 1959 was cut short because he encouraged black musicians, but while there he recorded with the group which was about to become the Jazz Epistles&quot;. His final recordings, as a trio, were made in 1960.

He wrote numerous books on jazz, including the &quot;Jazz Improvisation&quot; series, which sets out the basic principles of jazz, and was published between 1959 and 1965.

The American composer Leonard Bernstein dedicated a piano composition to Mehegan in his 1948 collection &quot;Four Anniversaries&quot;. Mehegan died in New Canaan, Connecticut, on April 3, 1984.

<doc id="180305" wikidata="Q156789" url="?curid=180305" title="Raetia">
<text>Raetia or Rhaetia ( , ) was a province of the Roman Empire named after the Rhaetian people. It bordered on the west with the country of the Helvetii, on the east with Noricum, on the north with Vindelicia, on the south-west with Transalpine Gaul and on the south with Venetia et Histria, a region of Roman Italy.

It thus comprised the districts occupied in modern times by eastern and central Switzerland (containing the Upper Rhine and Lake Constance), southern Germany (Bavaria and most of Baden-Württemberg), Vorarlberg and the greater part of Tyrol in Austria, and part of northern Lombardy in Italy. The region of Vindelicia (today eastern Württemberg and western Bavaria) was annexed to the province at a later date than the others. The northern border of Raetia during the reigns of emperors Augustus and Tiberius was the River Danube. Later the Limes Germanicus marked the northern boundary, stretching for 166 km north of the Danube. Raetia was connected to Italy across the Alps over the Reschen Pass, by the Via Claudia Augusta.

The capital of the province was Augusta Vindelicorum, present-day Augsburg in southern Germany.

==History==
Little is known of the origin or history of the Raetians, who appear in the records as one of the most powerful and warlike of the Alpine tribes. Livy states distinctly that they were of Etruscan origin (a belief that was favored by Niebuhr and Mommsen). A tradition reported by Justin and Pliny the Elder affirmed that they were a portion of that people who had settled in the plains of the Po and were driven into the mountains by the invading Gauls, when they assumed the name of &quot;Raetians&quot; from an eponymous leader Raetus. Even if their Etruscan origin be accepted, at the time when the land became known to the Romans, Celtic tribes were already in possession of much of it and had amalgamated so completely with the original inhabitants that, generally speaking, the Raetians of later times may be regarded as a Celtic people, although non-Celtic tribes (es. Euganei) were settled among them.

The Raetians are first mentioned (but only incidentally) by Polybius, and little is heard of them till after the end of the Republic. There is little doubt, however, that they retained their independence until their subjugation in 15 BC by Tiberius and Drusus.

At first Raetia formed a distinct province, but towards the end of the 1st century AD Vindelicia was added to it; hence, Tacitus (&quot;Germania&quot;, 41) could speak of &quot;Augusta Vindelicorum&quot; (Augsburg) as &quot;a colony of the province of Raetia&quot;. The whole province (including Vindelicia) was at first under a military prefect, then under a procurator; it had no standing army quartered in it but relied on its own native troops and militia for protection until the 2nd century AD.

During the reign of Marcus Aurelius, Raetia was governed by the commander of the Legio III &quot;Italica&quot;, which was based in Castra Regina (Regensburg) by 179 AD. Under Diocletian, Raetia formed part of the diocese of the &quot;vicarius Italiae&quot;, and was subdivided into &quot;Raetia prima&quot;, with a &quot;praeses&quot; at Curia Raetorum (Chur) and &quot;Raetia secunda&quot;, with a &quot;praeses&quot; at Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), the former corresponding to the old Raetia, the latter to Vindelicia. The boundary between them is not clearly defined, but may be stated generally as a line drawn eastwards from the &quot;lacus Brigantinus&quot; (Lake Constance) to the &quot;Oenus&quot; (River Inn).

During the last years of the Western Roman Empire, the land was in a desolate condition, but its occupation by the Ostrogoths in the time of Theodoric the Great, who placed it under a &quot;dux&quot;, to some extent revived its prosperity. Much of &quot;Raetia prima&quot; remained as a separate political unit, Raetia Curiensis, for several centuries, until it was attached to the Duchy of Swabia in AD 917.

==Economy==
The land was very mountainous, and the inhabitants, when not engaged in predatory expeditions, chiefly supported themselves by breeding cattle and cutting timber, little attention being paid to agriculture. Some of the valleys, however, were rich and fertile, and produced wine, which was considered equal to any in Italia. Augustus preferred Raetian wine to any other. Considerable trade in pitch, honey, wax, and cheese occurred.

==Geography==
The chief towns of Raetia (excluding Vindelicia) were Tridentum (Trento) and Curia (Coire or Chur). It was traversed by two great lines of Roman roads: the Via Claudia Augusta leading from Verona and Tridentum across the Reschen Pass to the Fern Pass and thence to Augusta Vindelicorum (Augsburg), the other from Brigantium (Bregenz) on Lake Constance by Chur and Chiavenna to Como and Milan.

The Rätikon mountain range derives its name from Raetia.

<doc id="180306" wikidata="Q169814" url="?curid=180306" title="Valentino Rossi">
<text>Valentino Rossi ( , ; born 16 February 1979) is an Italian racing driver, former professional motorcycle road racer and nine-time Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion. His nickname is &quot;The Doctor&quot;, Rossi is widely considered one of the greatest motorcycle racers of all time. He is also the only road racer to have competed in 400 or more Grands Prix. Of Rossi&#x27;s nine Grand Prix World Championships, seven were in the premier 500cc/MotoGP class. He holds the record for most premier class victories and podiums, with 89 victories and 199 podiums to his name. He won premier class World Championships with both Honda and Yamaha. He rode with the number 46 for his entire career.

After graduating to the premier class in 2000, Rossi won the final 500cc World Championship (becoming the last satellite rider to win the top-class title until Jorge Martín in 2024) and the Suzuka 8 Hours race with Honda in 2001. He also won MotoGP World Championships with the factory Repsol Honda team in 2002 and 2003 and continued his run of back-to-back championships by winning the 2004 and 2005 titles after leaving Honda to join Yamaha. He lost the 2006 title with a crash in the final round at Valencia. In 2007, he ultimately finished third overall, before regaining the title in 2008 and retaining it in 2009. After a 2010 season marred by a broken leg and no title defense, he left Yamaha to join the Ducati factory team, replacing Casey Stoner for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, and endured two winless seasons with the Italian marque.

Rossi returned to Yamaha in 2013 and finished fourth in the standings followed by three successive runner-up positions in 2014, 2015 and 2016. His best chance of winning a tenth title came in 2015, where he led the standings for most of the season, finishing five points behind team-mate Jorge Lorenzo, the eventual champion. 2017 was the final season in which he achieved over 200 championship points, and he won his final race victory in the 2017 Dutch TT at the age of 38. After three winless seasons with the Yamaha factory team, he moved to Petronas SRT for 2021, retiring after only one season with the satellite Yamaha team and failing to achieve a podium for the first time in a career spanning 26 seasons in Grands Prix. The dominant force in MotoGP in the 2000s, all of Rossi&#x27;s seven premier class titles came in this decade, including 77 race wins and 48 pole positions. In the ensuing 12 seasons, he managed 12 race wins and seven pole positions. During this period, Rossi was the 6th most successful rider in terms of total race victories.

Rossi was inducted into the MotoGP Hall of Fame as an official Legend by the FIM at the awards ceremony after the conclusion of the 2021 season. His #46 bike number was retired at the 2022 Italian Grand Prix. Rossi owns and manages the Racing Team VR46, which competes in MotoGP as of 2024. In addition to his team management role, Rossi competes full-time in the FIA World Endurance Championship, driving for Team WRT, in a BMW M4 GT3, which also bears the now iconic number 46. 
==Career==
===Early career===
Rossi was born in Urbino, in the Marche region of Italy. While he was a child, his family moved to Tavullia. The son of former motorcycle racer Graziano Rossi, he began riding at a very young age. Rossi&#x27;s first racing love, however, was kart racing. Fueled by his mother, Stefania&#x27;s, concern for her son&#x27;s safety, Graziano purchased a kart as a substitute for the bike. However, the Rossi family trait of perpetually wanting to go faster prompted a redesign; Graziano replaced the 60 cc motor with a 100 cc national kart motor for his then 5-year-old son.

Rossi won the regional kart championship in 1990. After this, he took up minimoto and, before the end of 1991, had won numerous regional races.

Rossi continued to race karts and finished fifth at the national kart championships in Parma. Both he and his father thought about transitioning to the Italian 100cc series and the European series, which could have potentially directed him toward Formula One. However, the high costs associated with kart racing led them to choose to focus solely on racing minimotos. Through 1992 and 1993, Valentino continued to learn the ins and outs of minimoto racing.

===Junior career===
In 1993, Rossi was given his first opportunity to ride a 125cc motorcycle by former world champion Paolo Pileri, who became a team manager after retiring from competition. Later in 1993, with help from his father, Virginio Ferrari, Claudio Castiglioni and Cagiva factory racing team manager Claudio Lusuardi, Rossi competed in the 125 cc Italian Sport Production Championship on a Cagiva Mito alongside teammate Vittoriano Guareschi. At his first race meeting with the Cagiva team, he damaged his motorcycle in a first-corner crash no more than a hundred meters from the pit lane. He finished ninth in that race weekend.

Although his first season in the Italian Sport Production Championship was varied, he achieved a pole position in the season&#x27;s final race at Misano, where he would ultimately finish on the podium. By the second year, Rossi had been provided with a factory Mito by Lusuardi and won the Italian title.

In 1994, Rossi raced in the Italian 125 CC Championship with a prototype called Sandroni, using a Rotax engine. The bike was built by Guido Mancini, a former rider and mechanic who had worked, in the past, with Loris Capirossi. A documentary about Mancini, called &quot;Mancini, the Motorcycle Wizard&quot; (Il Mago Mancini), was released in 2016 by director Jeffrey Zani and explains the birth of the motorcycle and the relationship between Rossi and the mechanic. In 1995, Rossi switched to Aprilia and won the Italian 125 CC Championship. He was third in the European Championship.

===125cc World Championship===

The 1996 championship season marked the debut of Rossi, then 17, in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. He had some success in his first year, scoring consistent points and sometimes finishing just off the podium in his races from Malaysia to Italy, but he retired in both the French and Dutch rounds. He scored more points by finishing fifth in Germany, but suffered another retirement in the British round.

At the 1996 Austrian Grand Prix, Rossi achieved his first ever podium by finishing in third place after battling with Jorge Martínez. In the following race, the 1996 Czech Republic Grand Prix, he achieved both his first ever pole position, on the Saturday, and his first ever race victory in the 125cc class on the Sunday. He rode an AGV Aprilia RS125R and won after another tussle with Jorge Martínez.

Rossi earned more points at Imola but was forced to retire in both the Catalan and Rio rounds. He scored points in the final round in Australia, finishing his first season in ninth place with 111 points.

In his second year, the 1997 championship season, he moved from the AGV team to the official Nastro Azzurro Aprilia Team and went on to dominate the season. He immediately started with a pole and race win at the 1997 Malaysian Grand Prix but retired from the next race in Japan. In the next two races, he bounced back by winning the Spanish and Italian rounds. Rossi finished second in Austria, just 0.004 seconds behind winner Noboru Ueda, then scored a flurry of victories from France to Britain, including three pole positions in the Dutch, Imola and German rounds.

After third place in the Czech round, Rossi then gained two more wins in the Catalan and Indonesian races. He finished sixth in Australia. He won the 1997 125cc title, winning 11 of the 15 races with 321 points. Throughout the season, he dressed up as Robin Hood and carried a blow-up doll on a few occasions. His fun-loving character gained him many fans at the time and in future seasons.

===250cc World Championship===
====1998 season====
After winning the 125cc title in 1997, Rossi moved up to the 250cc class the following year. In the 1998 season, the Aprilia RS250 was reaching its pinnacle and had a team of riders in Rossi, Loris Capirossi and Tetsuya Harada. Rossi had to retire from the first two races in Japan and Malaysia. He came back from this by scoring three consecutive second places in Spain, Italy, and France, but retired once more from the Madrid round.

He scored his first victory at the 1998 Dutch TT, when he was more than 19 seconds ahead of second-placed Jürgen Fuchs. He had to retire from the British Grand Prix but bounced back by achieving a podium place in Germany, finishing third.

In the Czech Republic, he crashed out of the race, but then enjoyed a flurry of victories from Imola to Argentina. He finished the season, his rookie year in the class, as the championship runner-up with 201 points, just 23 behind champion Loris Capirossi.

====1999 season====

In the 1999 season, his second year in the 250cc class, Rossi became the sole driver of the official Aprilia Grand Prix Racing team, and dominated the championship. He began with a pole position in Malaysia but finished fifth on race day. He gained further points in Japan and went on to win the third round in Spain. Rossi had his second pole position of the season in France, but retired from the race. He bounced back with back-to-back wins in Italy and Catalunya. He finished second at the Dutch round, narrowly losing out to Capirossi. He then won the next three races from the British to the Czech Grands Prix.

Rossi finished second in Imola, but was off the podium in eighth place at Valencia. He finished the season strongly with three more wins: one in Australia, where he fought hard against Olivier Jacque, one in South Africa, and one in Rio de Janeiro. After that, he finished third in Argentina despite starting in pole position. He actually won the title in Rio de Janeiro, with the Argentinian round in hand, and finished the season with 309 points, his first 250cc world championship title and his second title overall.

===500cc World Championship===
====Honda (2000–2001)====
=====2000=====

After achieving the 250cc World Championship in 1999, Rossi was given a seat with Honda in what was then the highest class in World Championship motorcycle racing, the 500cc. Retired five-time 500cc World Champion Mick Doohan, who had also had Jeremy Burgess as chief engineer, worked with Rossi as his personal mentor in his first year with Honda. It was also the first time Rossi raced against Max Biaggi.

Rossi started off his first year in the 500cc class with retirements in the first two rounds: he crashed out of the South African and Malaysian races. He scored points in the third round in Japan and picked up two third-place finishes in Spain and France. Rossi picked up additional points in Italy and another third-place podium finish in the Catalan round. He gained more points by finishing sixth in the 2000 Dutch TT.

It took nine races before Rossi won on the Honda, but his first 500cc victory came after a fierce battle with the Suzuki of Kenny Roberts Jr. and the Aprilia of Jeremy McWilliams. On a track that was affected by ever-changing weather conditions and despite only qualifying in seventh position on Saturday, the Italian chose the right tyers and stormed through the field to battle with Roberts Jr. and McWilliams and win his first race in the 500cc class.
After his victory in Donington Park, Rossi went on to score consecutive podium places in the next three races: two second-place finishes in Germany and the Czech Republic and one third-place finish in Portugal. He retired from the Valencian Community round after a crash.

Rossi won the Rio round. However, it was Kenny Roberts Jr. who clinched the 2000 title after finishing in sixth position, which gave him an unassailable lead in the championship. After his second 500cc win, Rossi went on to finish second in the Pacific race and third in the Australian races. He finished second in his rookie season in the 500cc class with 209 points.

=====2001=====

Rossi dominated his second season in the 500cc class, scoring 11 wins and only finishing off the podium three times. He started the year off with a victory in Japan after battling with Max Biaggi. He then achieved back-to-back poles and race wins in the South African and Spanish rounds. He finished the French race in third place but crashed out of the Italian round whilst leading the wet race after taking another pole on Saturday.

Rossi bounced back by taking pole position and winning the following race in Catalunya, despite making a poor start that dropped him to 15th place at the end of the first lap. He scored a second place after narrowly losing out on the race victory with Biaggi in the Dutch round. He followed this up with another win: this time the British GP.

Rossi finished a disappointing seventh in Germany but then took back-to-back wins in the Czech Republic (gaining a 29-point advantage over Biaggi) and Portugal. He had another disappointing result in the Valencian Community round when he finished in 11th place, but then scored a string of race wins from the Pacific to the Rio rounds.

Rossi won his first 500cc title with 325 points and third title overall, 106 points ahead of Biaggi, who became Rossi&#x27;s main rival during the season. During the season, Rossi also teamed up with American rider Colin Edwards for the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race aboard a Honda VTR1000SPW, becoming the first Italian rider to win the race. The pair won the race despite Rossi&#x27;s lack of experience racing superbikes. In 2002, 500cc two-strokes were still allowed, but saw the beginning of the 990cc four-stroke MotoGP class, after which the 500cc machines essentially became obsolete.

===MotoGP World Championship===
====Honda (2002–2003)====
=====2002=====

The inaugural year for the MotoGP bikes was 2002, when riders experienced teething problems getting used to the new bikes. Rossi started the year off strong and won the first race in wet conditions in Japan, beating several local riders who were racing as wildcards. He also took the pole position in the first five races.

Rossi finished second in South Africa, where his teammate Tohru Ukawa took his first and only victory in the MotoGP class. He then scored victories from the Spanish to the German rounds, including two pole positions in the Dutch and British GPs. His only retirement of the season was from the Czech Republic round. He then had back-to-back wins in Portugal and Rio, two second-place finishes in the Pacific and Malaysia, another victory in Australia and a second-place finish in the final race in the Valencian Community.

Rossi went on to win eight of the first nine races of the season, eventually claiming 11 victories in total. He clinched his second title in the Rio de Janeiro race, his first in the inaugural class, and fourth title overall with four races remaining.

=====2003=====

After a strong 2002, Rossi continued to dominate in 2003 despite competition from emerging Spaniard Sete Gibernau. Rossi took pole and won the first round of the season in Japan, but the race was marred by the death of Japanese rider Daijiro Kato who crashed in the 130R and hit the barrier at high speed in the ensuing Casio Triangle. Rossi finished second in the South African round before winning again in Spain, despite falling back to ninth place on the opening lap.

Rossi scored three pole positions in the next three races and finished second in France after battling with Gibernau, who overtook him on the last lap. He won in Italy and came second again in Catalunya. He took two third-place finishes in the Dutch and British rounds – the latter the result of a ten-second penalty for overtaking under yellow flags, gifting victory to Max Biaggi in the process – and another second place in Germany, once again battling Gibernau who denied him victory with just 0.060 seconds separating both when they crossed the finish line after a titanic battle between the two.

After Germany, Rossi won three more races and scored two more poles: a pole position converted into a victory came in the Czech Republic where he battled with championship rival Gibernau once more, Rossi overtaking him on the final lap to take victory by just 0.042 seconds. A regular victory came in Portugal and another pole-victory came in the Rio de Janeiro rounds. He finished second in the Pacific GP after a mistake made him run off into the gravel and relegated him to ninth, which made it impossible for him to catch race winner Biaggi in the closing laps.

Rossi ended his season in style by scoring three consecutive poles and race wins in the Malaysian, Australian and Valencian Community rounds. The Australian Grand Prix in Phillip Island is considered by many observers to be one of Rossi&#x27;s greatest career moments due to the unique circumstances. After being given a ten-second penalty for overtaking Marco Melandri under yellow flags due to a crash by Ducati rider Troy Bayliss, front runner Rossi pulled away from the rest of the field after being informed of the penalty, eventually finishing more than 15 seconds ahead, overcoming the penalty and winning the race.

Rossi won the 2003 title in Malaysia, his third in the top class and fifth title overall, with two races remaining. He won the final race in the Valencian Community round with a special livery, this race marking his final win for Honda.

With increased scepticism that the reason for his success was the dominance of the RC211V rather than Rossi, they parted ways at the end of the season. Mid-season rumours pointed towards a possible move to Ducati, which sent the Italian press into a frenzy; the concept of Rossi on the great Italian bike seemed too good to be true. Ducati did indeed try to seduce Rossi into riding their MotoGP bike, the Desmosedici, but for numerous reasons Rossi passed the offer up. Critics say that compared to the other manufacturers, Ducati had a significant way to go before being competitive even with Rossi at the helm. This proved to be the truth with Ducati&#x27;s lacklustre performance in the 2004 season, which had actually been worse than their inaugural year in MotoGP in 2003. In his 2005 autobiography, &quot;What If I&#x27;d Never Tried It?&quot;, Rossi offered another reason for choosing Yamaha over Ducati, saying that the mindset at Ducati Corse was similar to the one he was trying to escape from at Honda. Ultimately, Rossi signed a two-year contract with rivals Yamaha reportedly worth in excess of US$12 million; a price no other manufacturer, even Honda, was willing to pay.

====Yamaha (2004–2010)====
=====2004=====

Rossi made the switch from Honda to Yamaha and signed a two-year contract with the team. Many doubted his move and would expect Biaggi, who joined the Honda Pons team a year earlier, as well as Gibernau to be genuine contenders for the title this year.

With the traditional first venue of the season in Suzuka having been taken off the calendar due to safety concerns following the fatal accident of Daijiro Kato in 2003, the 2004 season started in Welkom in South Africa. Rossi took the pole on Saturday and won the South African race after a hard-fought battle with Max Biaggi, becoming the first ever rider to win consecutive races with different manufacturers, having won the final race of the previous season on his Honda bike. Rossi took another pole in Spain but his fourth-place finish on Sunday saw the end of a 23-race podium streak. He once again had to miss out on the podium in France but responded with three consecutive victories in Italy, Catalunya and the Netherlands, a race that he won from pole after a hard-fought battle with Gibernau.

In the Rio de Janeiro race, Rossi crashed out when he lost the front of his M1 and slid into the gravel whilst battling with Makoto Tamada, Max Biaggi, Nicky Hayden and Alex Barros, forcing him to retire from the race. After the Rio round, Rossi found himself off the podium once more in fourth place in the German GP but bounced back by winning the British round from pole. He then went on to finish second in the Czech Republic, first in Portugal and second once again in Japan.

In the inaugural Qatar round, controversy arose when Rossi&#x27;s team was penalised by starting in the back of the grid for grid cleaning. Gibernau won the race, whilst Rossi crashed out of the race when he was in sixth position. Despite this second DNF of the season, Rossi scored a pole that he converted into a win in Malaysia and two more regular victories in the Australian and Valencian Community rounds, battling with the likes of Troy Bayliss, Nicky Hayden, Makoto Tamada and Max Biaggi to take his ninth victory of the year.

Rossi finished first with 304 points to Gibernau&#x27;s 257, with Max Biaggi third with 217 points. He clinched his third MotoGP, fourth top class and sixth overall championship in the penultimate race of the season in Phillip Island, beating Gibernau by just 0.097 seconds to do so.

=====2005=====

In 2005, Rossi and the Factory Yamaha team proved to be even more dominant than the year before. Rossi immediately began the season by capturing pole and winning the first round in Spain in a controversial manner, colliding with the Gresini Honda of Sete Gibernau on the last lap. He scored a second-place finish in Portugal but then went on to take five consecutive victories from the Chinese to the Dutch rounds, including three pole positions in France, Italy and Assen.

In the first United States round since 1994, Rossi struggled and finish in third place whilst local hero Nicky Hayden won the race. Rossi bounced back by picking up three more wins, starting from a pole-victory in a rainy Great Britain and two regular victories in Germany, holding off Gibernau on the last lap, and the Czech Republic.

Rossi&#x27;s crashed out of the Japanese round when he collided with Marco Melandri during a failed overtaking attempt. This was the only time he failed to make the podium that season. After Motegi, Rossi scored a podium in the form of second place in Malaysia and back-to-back wins in Qatar and Australia, beating Nicky Hayden for the victory. He finished the season with a second and third-place finish in the inaugural Turkish and the Valencian Community rounds.

Rossi finished the season in first place with a total of 367 points, 147 points ahead of second-place finisher Marco Melandri and captured his fourth MotoGP, fifth top class and seventh overall championship in Sepang with four races remaining. He won 11 races including wins in three rain-affected races in Shanghai, Le Mans and Donington.

=====2006=====
The 2006 season started off with Rossi once again being the favourite to win the title. However, in the first round in Spain, Rossi was unlucky when Toni Elías misjudged his braking point into a corner and hit the rear wheel of the Italian, who crashed into the gravel as a result. He rejoined the race but only managed to finish 14th. In the next race in Qatar, he scored his first win of the season but finished just off the podium in the next round in Turkey.

Going into the third round in China, disaster would strike again when Rossi was forced to retire after he moved up from thirteenth to fifth and was battling with Colin Edwards and John Hopkins for third position. A chunk of rubber from his front tyre had been thrown onto his front fender, knocking it off the motorbike. Things didn&#x27;t improve for him in the next round in France, he brushed the back of Honda rider Dani Pedrosa, causing him to run wide and hit Randy de Puniet who then fell from his Kawasaki after striking Sete Gibernau. After climbing his way back up to second, Rossi overtook Hopkins on the fifth lap and started to pull a gap from Pedrosa after Hopkins lost the front of his Suzuki in an off-camber right-hander on lap 10 and retired. He was leading comfortably in first place with a gap of over three seconds until his Yamaha had a mechanical problem on lap 21, forcing Rossi to retire again. Rossi would leave Le Mans eighth in the standings with a 43-points deficit to Nicky Hayden.

After these two disappointing races, Rossi bounced back by scoring two wins: a regular victory in Italy and a pole-victory in Catalunya. In the Dutch round, he only finished eighth after he fractured his hand and ankle when he fell on Thursday. The race was won by Nicky Hayden, who battled with Yamaha teammate Colin Edwards on the last lap. Edwards tried to lunge past Hayden, but ran wide onto the gravel and eventually fell in the last corner.

With the disappointing result in Assen, Rossi took second place in Great Britain and another win in Germany, fighting tooth and nail with the three Honda&#x27;s of Marco Melandri, Nicky Hayden and Dani Pedrosa. However, he retired once more in the United States round due to mechanical problems in the last few laps; local hero Nicky Hayden won the event to retain his title. This extended Hayden&#x27;s lead over Rossi by 34 points to 51 and saw Rossi drop to fourth in the championship.

Going into round 12 in the Czech Republic, Rossi picked up a pole and a second place, and then won the next round in Malaysia. Hayden held the points lead throughout most of the season, but by now Rossi was slowly working his way up the points ladder. A third place in Australia and a further second position in Japan saw the points lead of Hayden reduced from 51 points in Laguna Seca to 12 points in Motegi, with Rossi moving from fourth to second in the championship standings.

Going into the penultimate round of the season in Portugal, Rossi took pole position on Saturday. On Sunday, Hayden was taken out by his teammate Dani Pedrosa on lap 5, causing both riders to retire. On the last lap, Toni Elías who was in third place, overtook both Kenny Roberts Jr. and Rossi to take the lead. Rossi eventually got back in front, but Elías shot past him in the final corner and won the race with a minuscule 0.002 second advantage over Rossi. This led to Rossi taking the points lead by 8 points going into the last round of the year.

In the final race of the season, the Valencian Community round, Rossi needed to finish in second place or higher to win the title. He took the second consecutive pole position on Saturday whilst Hayden could only qualify fifth. However, Rossi got a poor start on Sunday when the red lights went out, dropping him back in seventh place. On lap five, he made a mistake, lost the front wheel of his M1 and slid out of contention. He managed to get going again, but it would be to no avail: Rossi only managed to finish 13th, finishing the season on 247 points and losing the title to Nicky Hayden by just five points. The race was won by wildcard rider Troy Bayliss, who replaced the injured Sete Gibernau. After the race, Rossi called his fall &quot;a disaster&quot; but congratulated Nicky on his won title as well.

=====2007=====

After Rossi lost the title in 2006, he nonetheless tried again in 2007 as he was still one of the favourites to win the championship. The engine capacity of the bikes was reduced from 990cc to 800cc for this season and over the winter, Yamaha worked on a new bike fitting these specifications for both Rossi and Colin Edwards. In the season opener in Qatar, Rossi took his first pole position of the year on Saturday but came second to Casey Stoner on the Ducati on Sunday, who had made the switch from the LCR Honda team to the Factory Ducati team. Rossi then won the second race in Spain to bounce back. In Turkey, Rossi clinched another pole on Saturday but eventually finished way down in tenth position after running wide on the fast turn eleven when he pushed hard to break away on the opening lap. Rossi fought his way back to second, overtaking Loris Capirossi on lap nine, but lost positions quickly after the Michelin tyres started to fade and he suffered from a mysterious lack of speed, which allowed Toni Elías, Capirossi, John Hopkins, Marco Melandri and Alex Barros to overtake him within three laps. Stoner led every lap, won the race and gained a 10-point lead over Rossi in the process.

Rossi, once again finding himself on the backfoot in the championship, responded in China by setting another pole position on Saturday and finishing in second place after battling hard with Stoner. The Australian, who made good use of the straight line speed of the Ducati on the long straight, blasted past Rossi every time he got overtaken earlier on the circuit. In the French round, Chris Vermeulen on the Suzuki won a rain-affected race. Rossi initially started well and even overtook Stoner in the early part of the race to make a break but when the rain intensified, Rossi and his YZR-M1 struggled and were overtaken by Stoner, Randy de Puniet, Sylvain Guintoli and later also Nicky Hayden, Dani Pedrosa and Alex Hofmann. Rossi eventually finished in sixth whilst Stoner crossed the line in third, extending his championship lead by 21 points.

In Italy, he won his first race of the season and in round seven in Catalunya, Rossi took his fourth and final pole of the season. After a hard-fought battle with Stoner, Rossi finished second by just 0.069 seconds and lost out again. In Great Britain, Rossi finished just outside of the podium in fourth but bounced back in the Dutch round in great fashion by winning the race from eleventh on the grid. He overtook many riders and eventually did the same to Stoner with four laps to go, building up a small gap he never gave away when crossing the line.

After Rossi&#x27;s great win in Assen, bad luck struck when he crashed on lap five of the German round and was forced to retire. He had made a poor start, dropping him from sixth to ninth on lap one, but was quick to regain two positions before struggling to pass Randy de Puniet for sixth place. When Rossi tried to squeeze his bike next to the Kawasaki of de Puniet, he lost the front of his M1 in low speed through a long right-hander and slid into the gravel. Rossi then picked up more points by finishing in fourth and seventh place in the United States and Czech Republic, but by then Stoner had built up a 60-point gap over Rossi when they left round 12.

Rossi retired again in the new San Marino venue whilst Stoner took his eighth win of the season, extending his championship lead from 60 to 85 points. In the next round in Portugal, Rossi would win his final race of the season after a close fight with the Honda of Dani Pedrosa. Rossi worked his way up from fifth to third on the opening lap, overtaking Stoner on lap nine after Pedrosa did the same two laps earlier. He then overtook Pedrosa on lap ten and a fight commenced where Pedrosa re-overtook Rossi on lap 16, only taking the first spot back from the Spaniard with four laps left after he ran wide. Rossi made a similar error and Pedrosa retook the lead just half a lap later. Pedrosa was still narrowly ahead but Rossi was better on the brakes and plunged down the inside of the first corner in turn one. The move failed and he ran wide, but carried enough momentum to try the same move again a few corners later, this time succeeding. Rossi crossed the line 0.175 seconds ahead of Pedrosa to win his fourth race of the season.

In the Japanese round, Rossi suffered from braking problems on his second bike after all riders were forced to swap bikes due to the drying track, finishing in 13th position. This was enough for Casey Stoner to become 2007 world champion after he finished the race in sixth position and gave him an unassailable lead in the championship. Rossi went on to take one last podium in Australia, finishing in third place, then picked up points in fifth position in the Malaysian round. In the last race of the season, the Valencian Community race, Rossi started way back in 17th due to a fracture of three bones in his right hand after he fell during qualifying. He took 16th on lap seven and passed Shinya Nakano for 15th and thus the final point, but was forced to retire on lap 18 after his YZR-M1 suffered a technical problem, this marking his third DNF of the season. The race was won by Dani Pedrosa, with Casey Stoner about five seconds behind in second place.

Stoner dominated the season, winning ten races to take his first title, 125 points clear of second place Dani Pedrosa. Rossi on the other hand, finished in third place with 241 points, six less than in 2006. This was Rossi&#x27;s lowest championship position since his first season in 1996 in the 125cc. Pedrosa&#x27;s win in the last race in Valencia combined with Rossi&#x27;s retirement meant that he beat Rossi by a single point.

=====2008=====

After two frustrating seasons where Rossi and Yamaha lost the title for two consecutive seasons to Nicky Hayden&#x27;s Honda and Casey Stoner&#x27;s Ducati, critics started to doubt if he was capable of ever winning another title. Some said he should retire, whilst others assumed that Casey Stoner would win his second title or that Dani Pedrosa would become a genuine title contender after his strong performances in 2006 and 2007. This was also the year he switched from Michelin to Bridgestone tyres, which Rossi claimed was needed to &quot;boost his motivation&quot;. His new teammate, Jorge Lorenzo, did not opt for the change.

Rossi started the year with a fifth place in Qatar whilst Stoner won the race, prompting some to already suggest that it would be more of the same like last year. However, Rossi fought back in Spain by finishing second whilst Stoner could only manage eleventh place. Rossi finished third in the Portuguese round with his teammate Jorge Lorenzo winning after a late charge from Pedrosa was not enough to retake the lead.

After the good performances in Spain and Portugal, Rossi scored three consecutive victories: two regular victories in China and France and a pole-victory in the Italian round. Two more second-place finishes followed, one in Catalunya and one in Great Britain.

Approaching round 9 of the season, the Dutch GP was not a success for Rossi. He came to Assen with an 11-point lead over runner-up Pedrosa but made a slow start from third on the grid, only to lose the back of his M1 machine on the entry of a tight left hand hairpin – his rear wheel sliding around and collecting Randy de Puniet&#x27;s LCR Honda, taking him out in the process. Rossi remounted the bike and got going again but could only finish eleventh, handing the lead of the championship to Pedrosa by four points.

After the disappointing result in Assen, Rossi retook the lead of the title hunt in a rain-affected German round after Pedrosa crashed out of the wet track and Rossi came second, the race was won by Stoner. Rossi then took a multitude of race wins from the United States, where Rossi took the win after a hard battle and a pass down the &quot;Corkscrew&quot; corner over Stoner, who crashed a few laps later but continued and took second place, to Japan, including a pole-victory in a rain-shortened race in Indianapolis. His wins in both Laguna Seca and Indianapolis also meant that Rossi had won in every circuit on the calendar in the time and his win in Motegi was his first MotoGP victory in the track, becoming the first Yamaha rider to win in the Honda-owned circuit.

Going into round 15 of the championship, Rossi needed to finish third or higher to win the title in Motegi. He started off poor, dropping from fourth to fifth on the grid but quickly made up ground by overtaking Jorge Lorenzo and Nicky Hayden on lap two before he hunted down his title rivals. When Stoner made the pass on Pedrosa on lap six, Rossi did the same and went after Stoner until he made the race winning move on lap 14 under braking. Rossi then pulled away from the Ducati rider to cross the line in first position and clinch his fifth MotoGP, sixth top class and eighth overall championship in Japan with three races remaining. On the podium, he wore a shirt with the text &quot;Scusate il ritardo&quot; (&quot;Sorry for the delay&quot;) in Italian, emphasising his lack of titles in the last two years.

After Rossi wrapped up the title in Motegi with an unassailable lead of 92 points, he scored three more podiums: a second-place finish behind home hero Stoner in Australia, another win in Malaysia and a third place in the Valencian Community round.

Rossi finished first in the championship with 373 points, 93 points ahead of second place Casey Stoner.

=====2009=====
After the unexpected success and title of Rossi in 2008, many expected him to be a strong contender in 2009. Rossi took two consecutive second places: a regular podium in Qatar and a pole-podium in Japan, the race won by Rossi&#x27;s teammate Jorge Lorenzo.

Rossi&#x27;s first victory of the year came in the third round in Spain. Rossi started fourth, but overtook teammate Lorenzo for third on lap two, then made a second pass stick for second position on lap seven. Race leader Pedrosa was ahead with 1.4 seconds ahead of him by then, but Rossi stormed to the rear wheel of the Honda rider with eleven laps to go. He made the victory pass in the Nieto corner to take a lead of 2.7 seconds when crossing the line, taking the championship lead over from Stoner by eleven points in the process.

The French GP turned out to be a disaster for Rossi. Jorge Lorenzo won the frantic wet/dry race whilst Rossi fell after a premature bike swap to slick tyres and also received a ride through penalty, ending up in sixteenth place and thus failed to score any points. This handed the championship lead to Rossi&#x27;s teammate Lorenzo who now is ahead of both Rossi and Stoner by just one point.

Things started to look better when Rossi registered a third position finish in Italy, but lost his sequence of seven consecutive victories in the venue. After Mugello, Rossi took two more victories: a regular victory in Catalunya, battling with Lorenzo throughout the race and overtaking him on the last corner of the last lap to win the race by just 0.095 seconds and a pole-victory in the Dutch round. This victory marked his 100th career win, becoming only the second rider in motorcycle grand prix history – after Giacomo Agostini – to reach 100 wins.

In the United States GP, Rossi finished a close second behind surprise race winner Dani Pedrosa. He then went on to score three more pole positions: a pole-win in the German round, fighting tooth and nail once more with his teammate Jorge Lorenzo with five laps to go. On the penultimate lap, Rossi retook the lead and held off the Spaniard to claim win by a margin of 0.099 seconds. This win gave Rossi a championship lead of 14 points over Lorenzo and a 28-point lead over Stoner. In the next race in Great Britain, Rossi started from pole but was demoted to third on the first lap. A five-strong lead group of Jorge Lorenzo, Andrea Dovizioso, Rossi, Dani Pedrosa and Toni Elías were battling for the lead when Elías was the first to fall on lap eight after he clipped a wet white line on the track, a similar mistake also led to Lorenzo&#x27;s fall and retirement. This left Dovizioso and Rossi to battle it out, but as the rain intensified, so did their lead. Both were ahead with 13 seconds separating them and third place Randy de Puniet. However, it was not meant to be as Rossi spun out of the lead when the rear of his M1 span-out through the Fogarty Esses on lap 20, demoting him to eleventh and leaving Dovizioso almost ten seconds clear of de Puniet. Rossi climbed up to fifth on the last lap, overtaking home hero James Toseland in the final turn, but the race victory went to the Honda of Andrea Dovizioso for the first time. In the Czech Republic round, Rossi took a commanding victory, crossing the line more than 11 seconds ahead of second place Pedrosa.

Rossi&#x27;s only retirement in 2009 was in Indianapolis when he crashed out of the race after being overtaken by the eventual winner Lorenzo on lap ten. This win meant that Lorenzo had halved Rossi&#x27;s title advantage to just 25 points with five rounds to go. In the next race in San Marino, Rossi responded by taking his sixth pole position of the year on Saturday and winning the race in his &quot;home venue&quot; ahead of Lorenzo on Sunday, extending his lead to 30 points. In Portugal however, it was Lorenzo who had the upper hand, winning the race with Rossi only able to finish fourth, reducing the championship lead from 30 to 18 points. In the Australian round, Rossi finished a close second to home hero Casey Stoner who won the race. Lorenzo crashed on the opening lap after running into Nicky Hayden&#x27;s Honda, forcing him to retire. This widened the championship gap from 18 to 38 points with two rounds remaining.

In the penultimate round in Malaysia, Rossi scored another pole position on Saturday and a podium in the form of third place in the wet track in Sepang on race day, behind Stoner and Pedrosa. This was enough for him to clinch his sixth MotoGP, seventh top class and ninth overall title over Jorge Lorenzo who started in the back of the grid and only managed to finish fourth, behind Rossi. This gave him an unassailable lead of 45 points over Lorenzo. The final race of the season, the Valencian Community, resulted in a final second place podium of the year for Rossi, behind Pedrosa.

Rossi finished first in the championship with 306 points, 72 points ahead of second-place Jorge Lorenzo. Six wins was the lowest number of wins Rossi has had in a championship winning season; the previous minima were nine in 1999 in the 250cc class and 2003, 2004 and 2008 in MotoGP. Rossi also failed to win in Mugello for the first time since 2001.

On 8 June 2009, Rossi rode a Yamaha around the famous Snaefell Mountain Course in an exhibition lap in the 2009 Isle of Man TT alongside Agostini, in what was called &#x27;The Lap of the Gods&#x27;. This had been delayed by 48 hours due to bad weather. He also performed the garlanding ceremony for the Superbike podium, bestowing the podium of John McGuinness, Steve Plater and Guy Martin.

=====2010=====

With two consecutive titles won, Rossi was once again the favourite to win the championship going into the 2010 season and this seemed even more likely after he topped all but one of the pre-season testing sessions over the winter.

Rossi started off the first few races well. He won the first race of the season in Qatar after early leader Casey Stoner crashed out, took third place in Spain even though he had an injured shoulder sustained from a motocross accident two weeks earlier – the race being won by his teammate Jorge Lorenzo after a last-lap pass in the Dry Sack corner on Honda&#x27;s Dani Pedrosa – and a pole-podium in the form of a second place in France where Lorenzo claimed back-to-back wins for the first time in his MotoGP career. The injury Rossi had was not taken seriously initially and was expected to cure in a few weeks, but that did not turn out as expected and the ligament tear in his shoulder failed to heal sufficiently.

In round four in Italy, things took a turn for the worse for Rossi. He highsided his YZR-M1 in one of the fast right-left combinations – the Biondetti corner – during the second free practice in around . He suffered a displaced compound fracture of his right tibia. This crushed any hopes of him winning the 2010 title, and after post-surgical care close to his home in the hospital in Cattolica, it was clear that he was out of contention for the next two or three months. It was the first time that Rossi had missed a race in his Grand Prix career, and allowed his title rivals – Lorenzo, Pedrosa and Stoner – to gain points, podiums and wins while he was absent for the Italian, British, Dutch and Catalan rounds.

Ahead of the British Grand Prix, Suzi Perry reported in her &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; column that Rossi was planning on making a comeback in Brno. This was confirmed a week later by Rossi himself. On 7 July, Rossi rode in Misano on a Superbike World Championship-specification Yamaha YZF-R1 provided by the Yamaha World Superbike Team to test his leg&#x27;s recovery. He completed 26 laps during two runs, with a best lap time that was around two seconds off the pace of recent World Superbike times in the circuit. In the conclusion of the session, Rossi complained of discomfort, reporting pain in both his leg and his shoulder. On 12 July, Rossi took part in another test in Brno, after which Rossi stated he was happier and a lot more in form.

After an observation by the Chief Medical Officer on the Thursday before the German GP weekend and missing four rounds, Rossi returned in Germany and remarkably finished just off the podium in fourth position after losing out to Casey Stoner on the final corner, starting fifth. He returned two rounds earlier than predicted, and only 41 days after his accident. In round 9 of the season, held in the United States, Rossi took his first podium since his broken leg seven weeks ago in Mugello, overtaking the Honda of Andrea Dovizioso in the process. The race was won by Lorenzo after Pedrosa crashed out of the lead. In the next two rounds, in the Czech Republic and Indianapolis, Rossi scored lackluster results by finishing fifth and fourth.

In his &quot;home race&quot; in San Marino, Rossi scored another third place behind race-winner Pedrosa and second-place Lorenzo. The race was marred by the death of the Japanese Moto2 rider Shoya Tomizawa, who was hit in high speed by Alex de Angelis and Scott Redding after he fell in the fast right-hander of the Misano circuit on lap 12 and succumbed to his injuries later in the hospital. In the new venue in Aragón, Rossi was again off the pace and finished in sixth position. He bounced back by scoring another third-place podium in Japan, the race being moved from April to October due to the disruption of air travel after the second eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. Rossi battled with teammate Lorenzo for the bottom step of the podium during the race, which was won by Casey Stoner, but by now had a 69-point lead in the championship over second place Dani Pedrosa.

In Malaysia, Rossi took a stunning victory by winning the race from eleventh position, battling with the Honda of Dovizioso for the win multiple times. Rossi had qualified sixth, but lost multiple positions in the first set of corners after a poor getaway. He overtook multiple riders, including Lorenzo, to fight for the lead with Dovizioso on a few occasions, but held on to finish ahead of him with just 0.224 seconds. This was his first win since the accident in June, and his second win of the season. However, Lorenzo won the title, finishing in third place when he needed ninth or higher to win the title.

After his win in Malaysia, Rossi continued to impress by scoring a third place in Australia, a second place in Portugal and a final third place in the Valencian Community rounds.

Rossi finished third in the championship with 233 points, 150 points behind champion Jorge Lorenzo and 12 points behind runner-up Dani Pedrosa. Rossi collected ten podiums throughout the season, including five consecutive podiums in the season&#x27;s final run.

====Ducati (2011–2012)====
=====2011=====

On 15 August 2010, after the Brno race, Rossi confirmed he was going to ride for the Ducati factory team, signing a two-year deal starting in 2011 and joining former Honda racing teammate Nicky Hayden. He tested the Ducati Desmosedici for the first time in Valencia on 9 November 2010, making this his first appearance since 1999 on an Italian motorcycle. Rossi underwent surgery on his shoulder which he injured during the 2010 season in order to be ready for pre-season testing in Malaysia. After initial progress during the first test, the Ducati failed to meet the team&#x27;s expectations in the second Malaysian test and left Rossi unsatisfied, having finished over 1.8 seconds behind Casey Stoner&#x27;s pace-setting Honda.

There was much anticipation for the first race of the season; Rossi on an Italian bike turned quite some heads, but he started the season on a disappointing note, only finishing seventh in Qatar. In the second round in Spain, he had moved up from twelfth on the grid to third when he collided with the Honda of Casey Stoner with 20 laps to go. As Rossi edged past on the inside of Stoner, his bike slipped from under him in the wet conditions, causing both riders to slide off the track. Rossi resumed and eventually finished fifth but Stoner retired from the race. Rossi later apologised for the incident. Another fifth place followed in Portugal where he rose from ninth to fourth, battling with the Honda of Andrea Dovizioso who snatched fourth place from him in the line.

Rossi&#x27;s best result of the year came in France, where he took his first and only podium of the season. He battled hard with the Yamaha of Jorge Lorenzo and the Honda of Andrea Dovizioso, overtaking both for fifth place, when Dani Pedrosa and Marco Simoncelli in the front collided. Pedrosa crashed and retired from the race while Simoncelli was given a ride-through penalty.

Rossi then finished the next four races inside the top six; fifth in Catalunya, sixth in Great Britain, fourth in the Dutch round and sixth again in Italy.

In round nine in Germany, Rossi disappointingly finished in ninth place. In the next two races in the United States and the Czech Republic, he picked up two sixth places but once again scored a disappointing result when he crossed the line in tenth in Indianapolis after he encountered gearbox problems in the race. On lap nine, Rossi ran last and considered retiring, but climbed his way back up to tenth place in the end.

Poor results continued in his &quot;home grand prix&quot; in San Marino and Aragón when Rossi only managed to finish seventh and tenth, battling with the Tech 3 Yamaha of Cal Crutchlow before he got the better of Rossi to cross the line 0.180 seconds ahead of him.

Rossi ended the year on a low. In the Japanese round, he crashed out of the race on the first lap after a couple of corners. He collided with Jorge Lorenzo and Ben Spies and left Rossi with a blow to his finger. Another retirement followed in Australia when Rossi tried to overtake Álvaro Bautista for fifth on lap 14, lost the front of his Ducati and slid out of the race.

In Malaysia, Rossi qualified ninth but was involved in a collision with Marco Simoncelli and Colin Edwards on the second lap of the race. Simoncelli fell while running fourth, landing in the path of Edwards and Rossi who both hit his Honda. Simoncelli&#x27;s helmet also came off in the incident. The blow resulted in the Italian suffering critical injuries from which he later died in hospital. In the Valencian Community race, Rossi retired in the first corner after Álvaro Bautista fell from his bike and took down Rossi, teammate Hayden and Randy de Puniet in the process.

Rossi finished seventh in the championship with 139 points, 211 points behind champion Casey Stoner. He also finished a season winless for the first time in his Grand Prix career.

=====2012=====

After a frustrating first season with the Ducati, 2012 was a little better for Rossi. He started poorly in Qatar, starting from twelfth and only mustered tenth in the line. In Spain and Portugal, he finished in ninth and seventh positions, respectively.

One of his best results of the year came in the French round. He started from seventh on the grid but moved to fourth on the opening lap and overtook the fading Pedrosa for third on lap three. Rossi then was caught by the Tech 3 Yamaha&#x27;s of Cal Crutchlow and Andrea Dovizioso who battled with him over the bottom step of the podium from laps 4 to 18 until Crutchlow lost the front end of his M1 in the first corner. He remounted and continued the race as did Dovizioso, who suffered the same fate with four laps to go. After breaking free of both the Tech 3 riders, Rossi slashed the advantage Stoner had built up during the fighting and reeled him in over the remaining ten laps. On the penultimate lap, Rossi tried to overtake Stoner on the fast left-right combination in the beginning of the track but ran wide and Stoner retook the position. On the final lap, Rossi retried the move, this time successfully, and built a small gap over the remainder of the lap to cross the line in second place: the best finish Rossi has on a Ducati to date.

Over the next couple of races, the Ducati continued to perform poorly, allowing Rossi to score points only. He finished seventh in Catalunya while in Great Britain, Rossi was fastest in the first free-practice session but finished the race in ninth. After a thirteenth-place finish in the Dutch round Rossi finished sixth in Germany, his best dry result of the season so far. In Italy, he improved upon his German result and finished fifth. His first and only DNF of the season came in the United States GP. Rossi was going to come home in eighth position when he fell in the corkscrew corner whilst trying to brake. He was also unhappy with the bike setup for the race, preventing him from riding quick enough all weekend. Rossi finished seventh in the Indianapolis and Czech Republic rounds.

Rossi equalled his best Ducati result in Le Mans by finishing second for the second consecutive time this season in San Marino. His Ducati bike got a new frame and swingarm, which improved the performance of the motorcycle. Rossi ended his final year with Ducati with lackluster performances. In Aragón he finished eighth, in Japan seventh, in the Malaysian round fifth, in Australia seventh again and in the Valencian Community round tenth.

Rossi finished sixth in the championship with 163 points, 187 points behind champion Jorge Lorenzo.

====Return to Yamaha (2013–2020)====
=====2013=====

On 10 August, it was confirmed that Rossi was going to leave the factory Ducati team in the end of the 2012 season. Later that day, it was also announced that Rossi were to rejoin the Yamaha factory team until the end of the 2014 season, resuming his partnership with Jorge Lorenzo. Rossi was reacquainted with the Yamaha when he tested the bike over 13–14 November 2012 in a post-season test in Valencia. However, rain prevented him from posting an accurate lap time until he tested the 2013 machine later on 5–7 February 2013 in Sepang, where he posted the third-fastest time of 2:00.542 out of 28 riders. He clocked 0.442 seconds off from pace-setter Dani Pedrosa and just 0.113 seconds off teammate Jorge Lorenzo.

He kicked off the season well. In the opening round in Qatar he had a competitive pace all weekend but lost out badly with the new qualifying format, demoting him to seventh place on race day. He quickly fought himself back to fourth on the opening lap, but ran wide when he tried to overtake Ducati replacement rider Andrea Dovizioso, once again dropping him back to seventh place. His podium chances continued to worsen when he got stuck behind Stefan Bradl but once he passed him, he defied the odds by bridging a three-second gap to Cal Crutchlow, Dani Pedrosa and rookie Marc Márquez who were fighting for second place. Rossi passed both Crutchlow and Pedrosa, but Márquez&#x27; aggressive riding style and determination led to a battle between the two. Márquez overtook Rossi on the penultimate lap, with Rossi repassing him on the final lap to stay in front and cross the line ahead of the Spanish rookie with 0.211 seconds. In the next two races in the Americas and Spain, Rossi finished in sixth and fourth position. In the French round, he finished a disappointing twelfth. He started the race from eighth on the grid and moved up to third to grab another podium but lost the position to Cal Crutchlow and then slid out of contention with ten laps to go. Rossi continued to finish in twelfth position, albeit on a damaged bike and hampered by a misting visor.

In round five, the Italian Grand Prix, Rossi registered his only retirement of the year. He was involved in a first-lap collision with the Gresini Honda of Álvaro Bautista in the left-right chicane which forms turns two and three. Rossi rode around the outside of Bautista, but he failed to notice Rossi and clipped his bike on the approach to the right-hander, making him fall and collecting Rossi in the process. In Catalunya, Rossi finished just off the podium for the second consecutive time by finishing fourth after starting from seventh on the grid.

On 29 June 2013 in the Dutch round, Rossi recorded his first MotoGP win since Malaysia in 2010 – a 46-race winless streak. He started from fourth on the grid but overtook the Honda of Dani Pedrosa for the lead on lap six, a lead he held to the line despite a late charge by the other Honda of Márquez, who crossed the line 2.170 seconds behind the Italian. After his first win of the season in Assen, Rossi continued to score good results by scoring two more podiums in the form of third places in the German and United States, in which Márquez overtook Rossi in the corkscrew corner in similar fashion to what Rossi did to Casey Stoner in 2008 to win the race.

From Indianapolis to San Marino, Rossi scored four consecutive fourth places before scoring yet another third-place podium in Aragón after a three-way battle for the spot with Álvaro Bautista, Stefan Bradl and Cal Crutchlow. Rossi again finished just off the podium in the Malaysian round, finishing fourth but scored a final podium in the form of third place in the Australian round, once more battling Crutchlow and Bautista. In the last two rounds in Japan and in the Valencian Community, he finished sixth and fourth respectively.

Rossi finished fourth in the championship with 237 points – his best result since 2010 – 97 points behind champion Marc Márquez. He scored six podiums, including one win in Assen.

=====2014=====
In the end of the 2013 season, Rossi announced the conclusion of his long collaboration with crew chief Jeremy Burgess, who was replaced by Silvano Galbusera, the former crew chief of Marco Melandri in the Superbike World Championship.

Rossi&#x27;s first year since his return to Yamaha went well, and hopes for 2014 were even higher: more podiums, wins or even the illustrious tenth title all were mentioned by people. He started the season well with a second-place finish in Qatar, storming from tenth on the grid to battle with the Honda of Márquez for the win, only to miss out on the victory on the last lap with 0.259 seconds in the line. In the next two races, the 2014 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas and the new venue in Argentina, Rossi only scored points by finishing in eighth and fourth.

A better result was achieved in the fourth round of the championship in Spain, where he chose to use an extra-hard rear tyre that allowed him to move up to second from fourth on the grid and overtake Márquez in the end of the back straight on the first lap. Both swapped places over the remainder of the first and second laps, but Márquez pulled away in the Dry Sack corner and Rossi had to settle for second place. Another second place came in France after Rossi ran wide halfway through the race, allowing Márquez to win. On 1 June 2014, Rossi appeared in his 300th Grand Prix race in the Italian round, where he finished in third. His fourth second place came in the Catalan GP, leading for much of the race but ultimately losing first place to Márquez in a late stage of the race. Lackluster performances followed in the Dutch and German rounds – fifth and fourth – until a string of third places followed in the Indianapolis, Czech and British races.

In his &quot;home race&quot; in San Marino, Rossi won his first race since the 2013 Dutch TT round. He started third on the grid before moving up and battling with Márquez for the lead. On lap 10, Márquez fell, which allowed Rossi to pull a gap and finish first in the line, ahead of teammate Jorge Lorenzo. The victory pushed him past 5000 total career points, making him the first, and so far only, rider to achieve this.

In round 14 in Aragón, Rossi qualified in sixth place and had been making progress up the order when he ran wide onto the grass – damp due to the wet conditions – and crashed heavily. He lost consciousness briefly after the crash (or as Rossi put it: &quot;I had a little nap&quot;) and was transferred to a hospital in Alcañiz for a precautionary CT scan.

In Australia Rossi took his second victory of the year. He benefitted from an accident of Marc Márquez who had been leading the race. It was Rossi&#x27;s sixth win in the circuit after five consecutive wins he took from 2001 to 2005. In Malaysia, another second-place finish followed when he initially took the lead halfway in the race after passing Lorenzo. Márquez passed both Lorenzo and Rossi, pulling a gap and finishing 2.445 seconds ahead of the Italian. Rossi took his first pole position since the 2010 French Grand Prix in the Valencian Community race, his 60th pole position in Grand Prix racing. He finished in second place behind Márquez in the race.

Rossi secured second place in the championship with 295 points, trailing champion Marc Márquez by 67 points.

=====2015=====

With a season of consistent podium finishes – including two wins in San Marino and Australia – there were once more hopes that Rossi might be able to win his tenth title this year. He started the 2015 season – his 20th in World Championship level – by taking victory in the opening race in Qatar; it was his first win in a season-opening race since the 2010 Qatar race. Rossi held off Ducati&#x27;s Andrea Dovizioso to cross the line 0.174 seconds ahead and complete his 109th Grand Prix victory while Dovizioso&#x27;s teammate Andrea Iannone finished third, completing an all-Italian podium – the first since the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix. In the second race in the Americas, Rossi scored his first third-place podium. He moved up into second place but couldn&#x27;t match the pace of polesitter and eventual winner Marc Márquez and lost second position to Dovizioso in the late stages of the race. His second victory of the season came in Argentina where Rossi and polesitter Márquez had a clash after a battle for the lead, causing Márquez to crash out of the penultimate lap and handing Rossi the race victory. This win consolidated his championship lead, becoming the first rider to win a race using an extra-hard Bridgestone rear tyre.

He recorded his fourth podium finish of the year, eighth successive podium finish – and the 200th of his Grand Prix career – with a third place in Spain, then kept the run going with a second place in France and a third place on home soil in Italy. In Catalunya, Rossi finished second after a late charge on teammate and race winner Jorge Lorenzo to maintain the championship lead over his teammate by one point.

Rossi took his first pole position of the season in the Dutch race – his first pole since the 2014 Valencian Community round and 61st pole position in Grand Prix racing – and achieved his third victory of the season after a race-long battle with Márquez where the pair once again collided on the final corner on the last lap. It was his first win from pole position since the 2009 San Marino Grand Prix and his twelfth successive podium. He also extended his championship lead to ten points over Lorenzo, who finished third.

Rossi further extended his championship lead in Germany with third and continued his podium streak with third-place finishes in Indianapolis and the Czech Republic. Lorenzo&#x27;s win in Brno gave him the championship lead over Rossi, by virtue of more wins in that point.

Rossi regained the championship lead with his fourth victory of the year in Great Britain after Márquez – who had been chasing him for the majority of the race – crashed out in wet conditions on lap 13 while Lorenzo finished fourth. The podium streak of 16 races ended with a fifth-place finish in San Marino, but Rossi extended his championship lead to 23 points after Lorenzo crashed out. Lorenzo won the Aragón round with Rossi finishing in third to cut the gap to fourteen points with four races remaining. The pair&#x27;s results were enough for the Yamaha Motor Racing team to clinch their respective title, their first since 2010.

In Japan, Rossi extended his championship lead to eighteen points with a second-place finish to Dani Pedrosa – his first win of the season – in drying conditions. Lorenzo had started on pole but faded to third with tyre issues. Lorenzo then cut the lead to eleven points in Australia by finishing second to Rossi&#x27;s fourth.

Lorenzo further cut the lead to seven points after a second-place finish in Malaysia; Rossi finished third after a controversial collision with Márquez, in which he accrued three penalty points – enough to enforce a start from the back of the grid for the final race in the Valencian Community. Rossi accused Márquez of deliberately trying to harm his championship, something Márquez repeatedly denied. Rossi made it up to fourth in the race but with Lorenzo winning it, he took the championship by only five points.

The controversial rivalries between Rossi and Márquez appeared to end in the 2016 Catalan Grand Prix, when Rossi and Márquez shook hands in the parc ferme. However, during the 2018 Argentine Grand Prix, controversies reared up again following some disputed maneuvers carried out by Marc Márquez before and during the race, where he tried a very risky overtake on Rossi that resulted in a crash for the latter.

=====2016=====

Before the 2016 season even began, Rossi announced that he will continue his career by keeping his contract with the Factory Yamaha team until 2018. Yamaha announced that Rossi will ride a 2016 YZR-M1 which also includes ECU Michelin tyres new to MotoGP and all riders. Expecting a difficult start to the season due to the new tyres, Rossi was able to adjust as he stated to the media in Sepang during the tests.
Rossi began the 2016 season with fourth place in Qatar, albeit just two seconds from victory. In the next race in Argentina, Rossi returned to the podium with a second place behind Marc Márquez after a collision between Ducati riders Andrea Iannone and Andrea Dovizioso on the last lap allowed Rossi and Dani Pedrosa to move up, for which Iannone was penalised. The race was split into two parts similar to the 2013 Australian Grand Prix after concerns over Michelin rear tyres forced riders to make a pitstop to change bikes. Rossi had fought with Márquez for the lead in the first half of the race but fell back to fourth on his second bike before the last lap incident between the Ducatis. In the third round in the Americas, Rossi suffered his first DNF since the 2014 Aragon Grand Prix, bringing an end to a run of 24 consecutive top-five finishes after crashing in the start of the third lap in turn 2 when he lost the front of his M1 mid-corner.

In Spain, Rossi took pole position – his first since the Dutch round last year and his 52nd pole position overall – on Saturday, then led the race from start-to-finish with the exception of one corner to win. The race marked the first time in his MotoGP career that Rossi led every lap of a race from pole position. In the French round, Rossi started a lowly seventh on the grid but recovered in the race, overtaking both Márquez and Dovizioso in the process to finish second with the fastest lap of the race, the race being won by Yamaha teammate Lorenzo. Rossi suffered an engine failure on his home race in Italy when battling Lorenzo for the lead after starting from pole position. It was Rossi&#x27;s first technical failure since the 2007 San Marino Grand Prix.

Rossi bounced back in Catalunya by winning from seventh on the first lap after a late-race battle with Márquez. Rossi dedicated the victory to the family of former Moto2 rider Luis Salom, who had been killed following a crash during Friday practice. The first race held on Sunday in the Dutch race saw disappointment for Rossi as wet conditions saw him fall from a comfortable lead in a restarted race following a red flag in torrential conditions. Assuming the lead in the second race, Rossi set the fastest lap and continued to push before crashing due to what he called a &quot;stupid mistake&quot;. More rain in the German round saw Rossi in contention for victory again. However, a delayed decision to change bikes in the drying conditions, combined with using intermediate tyres instead of slicks like Márquez, saw him come home eighth.

After the summer break, MotoGP&#x27;s return to Austria for the first time since 1997 saw the Factory Ducati riders dominate for a 1–2 finish, Rossi coming home a close fourth behind Jorge Lorenzo. Another wet race in the Czech Republic saw Rossi go against the majority of the field in choosing the harder rear wet tyre. Initially it seemed an error as he fell from 6th to 12th but he recovered throughout the race to finish second to Cal Crutchlow. Great Britain saw Rossi line up second on the grid behind pole-sitter Crutchlow and following an intense battle with Márquez, eventually finishing third behind Crutchlow and first-time race winner Maverick Viñales. A week later Rossi finished second in his &quot;home race&quot; in San Marino. After leading for the majority of the race he was overhauled by Dani Pedrosa in the closing laps. Rossi again led for a period in Aragón before eventually finishing third.

The flyaway races began badly for Rossi after he crashed out of second place in Japan, having started from pole. Victory for Márquez saw the Spaniard crowned champion with three races remaining. Rossi started in fifteenth spot in the Australian race after a rain affected qualifying but recovered to finish second in the race. Rossi secured second place once more in wet conditions in Malaysia behind Andrea Dovizioso having again led for periods of the race, the result securing second place in the championship for the third consecutive year. The season concluded in the same fashion as 2015 did, with fourth place in Valencia after a long battle with Iannone.

Rossi finished second in the championship with 249 points, 49 points behind champion Marc Márquez.

=====2017=====
Rossi suffered a difficult winter testing period for the 2017 season, often lagging behind new teammate Maverick Viñales after suffering with a new, softer construction Michelin front tyre.

For the season opener in Qatar however, he appeared to make a breakthrough, moving from tenth on the grid to finish third. Rossi continued his improvement by taking back-to-back second place podiums in Argentina after a battle with Cal Crutchlow for second place and the Americas to take the lead of the championship after three races by six points.

The European season began disappointingly with a lowly tenth position in the Spanish round whilst Honda rider Dani Pedrosa won the race from pole. In the next race in France, Rossi crashed out of the race on the last lap while battling with teammate Viñales for the win. Rossi also lost the championship lead after the race. Following the French round, Rossi suffered a motocross training crash and had mild thoracic and abdominal trauma, but no fractures were detected in any part of the body and no serious traumatic pathologies were found. This crash initially threatened his participation in Mugello, but ultimately he passed a late fitness test and was deemed fit to race. In his home race in Italy, Rossi finished just off the podium in fourth, blaming his lack of energy due to his motocross training crash a week earlier which prevented him from scoring said podium. A week later in Catalunya, both Yamaha riders struggled as they did in Jerez in the hot conditions with Rossi and Viñales only able to finish eighth and tenth.

Tests of a new chassis after the Catalan race were positive and saw Rossi take his first and only win of the season in the Dutch round after a late-race battle with the Pramac Ducati of Danilo Petrucci, who ran slick tyres on a damp track, the older Italian prevailing by just 0.063 seconds. The result also made Rossi the oldest race winner in the MotoGP era, surpassing Troy Bayliss. After his win in Assen, Rossi underperformed in the next three rounds in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria, finishing in fifth, fourth and seventh positions.

Rossi returned on the podium in Great Britain, leading for much of the race but ultimately having to concede the win to Dovizioso and second to Viñales with three laps to go. After the race in Silverstone, Rossi suffered another motocross crash in late August where he suffered displaced fractures of the tibia and fibula of his right leg. He suffered these injuries on the same leg that he previously broke in his high-speed crash in Mugello in 2010 and put him out of contention, requiring surgery and missing his &quot;home race&quot; in San Marino.

After missing out on the race in Misano, Rossi returned in Aragón to finish an impressive fifth after lining up in the front row of the grid on Saturday. In Japan, he had his second retirement of the season after he crashed in the wet conditions early in the race. In the Australian GP, Rossi scored his final podium of the season by finishing in second place, fighting hard with Tech 3 Yamaha rider Johann Zarco and finishing ahead of teammate Viñales by just 0.016 seconds. Rossi finished the season with disappointing results in the Malaysian and Valencian Community rounds, only being able to score seventh and fifth.

Rossi finished fifth in the championship with 208 points – his lowest position since his final season with Ducati in 2012 – 90 points behind champion Marc Márquez.

=====2018=====
Before the start of the season-opening race in Qatar, Rossi announced he had extended his contract in the Factory Yamaha team until 2020, when he will be 41 years old.

During the pre-season tests, Rossi and Viñales once again struggled with their 2018 Yamaha YZR-M1 competitor. Both riders were concerned about corner-entry and corner-exit issues as well as the lack of traction and tyre temperature.

In the first round in Qatar, Rossi started off well by getting a first podium of the season in the form of third place. He had a good start from eighth on the grid to move up to fourth on the opening lap, overtook the Honda of Dani Pedrosa on the second lap and made his move on the other Honda of Marc Márquez with 17 laps to go. However, he went wide in turn one on lap 11 and allowed Márquez and Andrea Dovizioso past. With five laps to go, Rossi muscled his way past the Tech 3 Yamaha of Johann Zarco but eventually couldn&#x27;t get close enough and crossed the line 0.797 seconds behind eventual race winner Dovizioso. In Argentina, Rossi finished outside of the points in nineteenth place after a collision with the Honda of Márquez, who was storming through the field after starting from the back, when his bike stalled as a result of the crash. Márquez went up the inside of multiple riders, clashing with the Aprilia of Aleix Espargaró first and later with Rossi. When the Spaniard misjudged the braking point, he forced Rossi to go wide, making him clip the grass and fall in the process. Rossi eventually got going again, but failed to score any points afterwards. After the race, Rossi accused Márquez of &quot;destroying our sport&quot; because he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have any respect for his rivals&quot; and Márquez received a 30-second penalty for the action. In the following rounds in the Americas and Spain, Rossi finished off the podium twice in fourth and fifth place, but he bounced back by scoring three consecutive third-place podiums in the French, Italian and Catalan rounds. In Mugello, he scored his first and only pole position of the season – his first since the 2016 Japanese GP and his 51st MotoGP pole position overall.

Rossi only finished fifth in the Dutch round but managed to score his first and only second place of the season in Germany, 2.196 seconds behind winner Márquez, claiming he finished so high on a track that usually doesn&#x27;t suit the Yamaha&#x27;s because he &quot;studied everything&quot; from the then-absent Jonas Folger. After his podium finish in the Sachsenring, Rossi finished off the podium again in the Czech Republic and Austria races in fourth and sixth place.

With the race in Great Britain cancelled due to heavy rain which failed to drain properly on the newly repaved Silverstone surface, Rossi failed to finish on the podium for five consecutive races. He finished the San Marino race in seventh, the Aragón race in eighth, the Thai and Japanese races in fourth and the Australian race in sixth.

Rossi&#x27;s best chance in a victory came in the penultimate round of the season in Malaysia. He took the lead going into the first corner from P2 after poleman Zarco made a poor start and built up a gap, but Márquez stormed up through the field and the gap between them was 1.1 seconds with ten laps to go. Rossi pushed hard to keep the gap above 1 second but Márquez dipped below to 0.7 seconds with five laps to go. Many were preparing for a Rossi-Márquez battle when Rossi lost the front of his M1 bike with four laps to go in turn 1. Márquez won the race, with Rossi remounting and finishing nineteenth, outside the points. In the Valencian Community round, Rossi moved up the order from sixteenth on the grid in the wet conditions, being helped by some of the front runners crashing out in the ever-worsening conditions. When the race was stopped, Rossi was forced to use a used rear tyre, which he claimed &quot;made the difference&quot; as he was &quot;more in trouble with the rear&quot;. As the race restarted, Rossi crashed out of second place.

Rossi finished third in the championship with 198 points, 123 points behind champion Marc Márquez. This was Rossi&#x27;s first winless season since 2012 when he raced with Ducati and his first ever winless season with the Factory Yamaha team.

=====2019=====

During the pre-season tests, both Yamaha riders had mixed feelings of the 2019 YZR-M1. There were signs that showed that some of the problems, such as the lack of traction and degradation of the tyres, were less of an issue this year. However, in the Sepang tests, Rossi said he was only &quot;half-happy&quot; with the results, claiming, &quot;some things worked well and we improved our performance, other things from which we expected a lot unfortunately didn&#x27;t bring us what we need.&quot;

In the opening round in Qatar, Rossi lined up fourteenth on the grid on Saturday but stormed through the field to finish in fifth in the line, +0.600 seconds behind race winner Andrea Dovizioso. In the next race in Argentina, he rode a strong race where he battled with the Ducati of Dovizioso, overtaking him on the last lap to finish second, his first podium since the 2018 German round. In the third round in the Americas, Rossi again finished second after Marc Márquez crashed out of the race and Rossi was overtaken by the Suzuki of Álex Rins with four laps to go. Eventually, Rins crossed the line 0.462 seconds ahead of Rossi to win his first ever MotoGP race. After the good results in Argentina and the U.S., Rossi only managed to finish in sixth and fifth place in Spain and France.

In the next three rounds, Rossi registered three consecutive retirements – for the first time in his career. In Italy, he crashed out after clipping the back of Joan Mir&#x27;s Suzuki and ran across the gravel in Turn 4. He recovered and tried to regain the lost ground but eventually slid off again in the high-speed Arrabiata 2 corner to register his first DNF since the 2017 Japanese race. In Catalunya, Rossi – despite qualifying well on Saturday in fifth – was again forced to retire after an error by Jorge Lorenzo on lap 2 led to a freak accident in which Lorenzo, Rossi, teammate Viñales and Andrea Dovizioso were all involved. When Lorenzo tried to dive down the inside of Dovizioso in Turn 10, he lost the bike and collected Dovizioso, which in turn took out Viñales. Rossi was forced to go wide and initially survived a minor hit of Lorenzo&#x27;s stricken bike, only to hit it again and fall onto the tarmac this time. The bike was damaged as a result and Rossi was unable to continue. In the Netherlands, Rossi registered his third DNF when he crashed and took out Takaaki Nakagami in Turn 8 on lap 4, the race being won by his teammate Viñales.

After these disastrous results, the next races went better for him. In the German and Czech rounds, Rossi managed to score an eighth and sixth place. He then scored three consecutive fourth places in Austria, which was the scene of the dramatic last-lap battle between Dovizioso and Màrquez, Great Britain and his home race in San Marino. Two eighth-place finishes followed for the Italian in Aragón and Thailand.

In Japan, Rossi had another retirement. He crashed out of a lowly eleventh place in Turn 1 with four laps to go. This was Rossi&#x27;s fourth DNF of the season, equalling his 1998 season and the highest number of his MotoGP career. Rossi ended the season only being able to score points: he finished in eighth place in Australia, fourth place in Malaysia – narrowly losing out on the podium but taking the fastest lap of the race – and eighth again in Valencia.

Rossi finished seventh in the championship with 174 points, 246 points behind champion Marc Márquez. This was Rossi&#x27;s lowest championship position since 2011 when he raced for Ducati and marked his second winless season.

=====2020=====

In October 2019, Rossi announced he would be changing his crew chief. Silvano Galbusera, who has been Rossi&#x27;s crew chief since 2014, will be replaced by David Muñoz for the 2020 season. The reason stated for this change was because of the poor results Rossi obtained during the 2019 season.

Rossi&#x27;s future in the factory Yamaha team was uncertain after the rather poor results he had obtained the previous year. His initial plan was to wait for a handful of races in 2020 to see how competitive he still is because he has not won a race since 2017 and because of his lackluster 2019 season. However, because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent delay of the start of the season, Rossi did not get the five or six races he hoped for. The team had asked him in the beginning of the year to make a decision regarding his future for reasons dictated by the riders&#x27; market, but ended the negotiations after his decision and chose Fabio Quartararo to line up beside Viñales for the 2021 season. This has left Rossi with a vacant seat but Yamaha&#x27;s Lin Jarvis has already said that the team wants to supply him with a full factory bike and support. In July 2020, Rossi said that he is &quot;99% certain&quot; he will ride for the SIC Racing Team even though no contract has been signed yet, and that he&#x27;ll make the decision either in August or September 2020. Rossi has also said he wants to continue racing in 2021, but that both he and SIC team boss Razlan Razali had doubts after the poor weekend in Spain. However, after Rossi&#x27;s podium in the second race in Andalucia, these doubts were put to rest.

In the pre-season tests, the 2020 Yamaha YZR-M1 had improved considerably compared to the 2019 counterpart. The new engine had fixed most of the deficit that the riders suffered from in 2018 and 2019 and the handling was improved as well thanks to an updated chassis. Both the Factory as well as the SIC satellite riders were happy with the feeling of this year&#x27;s bike and Rossi said that the bike has &quot;a very good feeling&quot; but that he personally worries he&#x27;ll struggle with the tyres after around five to six laps and is disappointed the Yamaha is still losing out to the competitors on the straights. He also commented that the updated Michelin tyres suit the bike, as well as his riding style, a lot more compared to last year.

Rossi&#x27;s first race was supposed to start in Qatar but was cancelled due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. After a three-month delay, the season finally got underway in Spain. In this race, Rossi was in tenth position before retiring with technical problems. The race was won by satellite rider Quartararo for the first time in his MotoGP career. In the same venue one week later in Andalucia, the Italian took his first podium since Austin. After qualifying in a strong fourth on Saturday, Rossi found himself in a fierce battle for second place with teammate Maverick Viñales after multiple riders either crashed out or had technical issues. Eventually, after outbraking himself, he lost second to Viñales but came home third to pick up his 199th podium in his motorcycle racing career. In the following two rounds in the Czech Republic and Austria, he came home in fifth place but only managed to come home ninth in the Styrian GP. Following a fourth place in the first race in his home Grand Prix in Misano, Rossi had three consecutive retirements, crashing out in the early stages of the second race in Misano and Le Mans, and while challenging Quartararo for a potential race win in Barcelona.

On 15 October 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19, which forced him to miss the Aragon and Teruel GP&#x27;s. Six members of the factory Yamaha team were quarantined as one member had already tested positive earlier in October 2020. Having recovered from COVID-19, Rossi raced in the European GP but retired. On 12 November, Rossi tested positive for COVID-19 for a second time. However, further tests confirmed that the previous test was a false positive and he was allowed to participate in the final two races of the season.

==== Petronas Yamaha SRT (2021) ====

In September 2020, after six months of speculation, Rossi confirmed that he would be joining Petronas Yamaha SRT for the 2021 season alongside his VR46 Academy protégé Franco Morbidelli. This is the first time that Rossi raced with a satellite team since 2001 – which was when he clinched his first-ever premier class world title. Despite being a non-factory rider, Rossi still received factory-supported machinery for his season in Petronas Yamaha SRT. In this team he had five different teammates in a season, namely Franco Morbidelli, Garrett Gerloff, Cal Crutchlow, Jake Dixon, and Andrea Dovizioso.

===Retirement from motorcycle racing===
On 5 August 2021, during the pre-event press conference of the 2021 Styrian motorcycle Grand Prix weekend, Rossi announced that he would retire from MotoGP after the 2021 season. His last race was the 2021 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix, and he was congratulated for a successful career by various celebrities and prominent racing figures such as Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, as well as former rival Casey Stoner. Rossi&#x27;s number 46 was retired with a ceremony in the 2022 Italian motorcycle Grand Prix.

===Sportscar racing===
During his MotoGP career, Rossi had participated in some car racing events like the Gulf 12 Hours in 2019 and 2020, usually driving a Ferrari. On 13 January 2022, it was announced that Rossi would be racing for Team WRT in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup in 2022, driving an Audi R8 LMS.

====GT World Challenge Europe Endurance &amp; Sprint====
===== Team WRT (2022–)=====
======2022======

In January 2022, Team WRT announced that Rossi would join its driver line-up in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe Powered by AWS for the 2022 season. Rossi started his professional career on four wheels with the Belgian squad, which is the reigning champion team in the Fanatec GTWCE Powered by AWS (overall, Endurance and Sprint). Rossi competed in both the Endurance and the Sprint Cups, driving an Audi R8 LMS sporting the emblematic #46 in the Pro Cup class. He was paired with Audi factory drivers Nico Müller and Frédéric Vervisch for his first full-time foray in sportscar racing, the former being an endurance co-driver for the team.

In his first race in Imola, Rossi finished in 17th place overall due to a miscommunication causing him to overshoot his pit box; despite this issue Rossi stated he &quot;enjoyed every moment&quot;. In the next round in Brands Hatch, the first Sprint round of the championship, he finished Race 1 and Race 2 in 13th and 8th places respectively. In the following 6 rounds of the championship, Rossi and his teammates achieved 4 overall top ten finishes, three of them being 5th place finishes. Rossi would end the season 21st in the standings, ending up 16th in the standings in both the Endurance and Sprint Cups.

======2023======

Rossi continued with Team WRT for 2023, this time driving a BMW M4 GT3 as opposed to an Audi R8 LMS due to WRT becoming a BMW factory team. For that year, Rossi was paired with BMW factory drivers Maxime Martin and Augusto Farfus, the latter joining for the endurance rounds. Rossi won his first race in the GT World Challenge in Misano. Rossi finished 6th in the standings during his second full year in the championship.

======2024======
Rossi continued with Team WRT for 2024, with Farfus replaced with new BMW factory driver Raffaele Marciello for the endurance rounds. Rossi would claim his second win in the series, repeating his win in Misano the previous year.

Rossi is also expected to compete in the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans alongside Martin and Al Harthy.
At this season in the Endurance Cup, Rossi managed to finish in 9th position in the final standings with 34 points.Meanwhile in the Sprint Cup race, Rossi managed to achieve 2 podiums and 1 win, finished in 8th in the standings and got 27 points.

====Road to Le Mans====
Rossi competed in the 2023 Road to Le Mans with Team WRT, alongside Jérôme Policand, in preparation for a planned debut in the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans. Rossi and Policand scored a class victory in the second race, having been promoted to the position after the AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE of Kei Cozzolino and Hiroshi Koizumi was penalized for &quot;erratic driving&quot;.

====Intercontinental GT Challenge====

At his first season in 2023 in this competition, Rossi managed to achieve 1 podium by finishing in 13th place in the final standings and gaining 38 points.

In the next season, Rossi finished in 17th position in the final standings with 14 points.

====24H GT Series====
Rossi competed in the 24H Series race. In 2023, he teamed up with Sean Gelael, Maxime Martin, Max Hesse, and Tom Whale on Team WRT for the 2022–23 Middle East Trophy. The five of them drove the BMW M4 GT3, according to the class they participated in, namely the GT3. The GT3 class is attended by 20 cars which is the most from all classes. In the first race in Dubai, Rossi and his co-drivers achieved a third-place finish.

====World Endurance Championship====

=====2024=====
In addition to his GT World Challenge Europe commitments, Rossi was signed to compete in the World Endurance Championship. He would be paired with Maxime Martin and Ahmad Al Harthy for his initial season in WEC.

In the first round, Rossi successfully completed his debut in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) car racing event at Lusail International Circuit, Qatar. Rossi drove the BMW M4 LMGT3 car with the Team WRT. Rossi, who retired from MotoGP at the end of the 2021 season, joined the Team WRT for the opening WEC series, in the Qatar 1812 km, which takes place on March 1–2, 2024. Rossi shares car number 46 with teammates Dries Vanthoor and Charles Weerts. In a race that lasted 12 hours, Rossi and his team managed to finish fourth in the LMGT3 class, and 14th overall. They were just 1 minute 23 seconds behind the LMGT3 class winners.

Next in the second round, Rossi scored his maiden podium in his second race, at the 2024 6 Hours of Imola. The Doctor had a fierce duel with Sean Gelael. At that time Rossi was winning with a good time. Rossi with WRT #46 was more than 20 seconds ahead of WRT #31, which was Sean Gelael&#x27;s team. But Sean cut the distance, to 19, 17, 13, 10, 8, and finally 5 seconds. An uphill battle considering the track conditions were also not easy because there were many incidents of cars leaving the track and then bringing gravel into the race track. It rained at the end of the race, but the two cars Team WRT pulled away to finish in the front two positions at Imola.
After a perfect result at Imola, Rossi had to accept his misfortune in the third race of the FIA WEC series titled 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. Rossi&#x27;s car failed to finish due to a careless mistake by a hypercar in the six-hour race at Team WRT&#x27;s home track. Rossi had been having a pretty good race from the start, and had the potential for a good result in the LMGT3 class this weekend. In the race, the #46 car driven by Rossi and his two partners started from second position. The #46 car suffered first when its partner, Ahmad Al Harthy, was hit. There were two hypercars battling it out, one of which was driven by Rene Rast who is also a BMW M Team WRT driver. Rast crashed into the #38 JOTA team hypercar driven by Philip Hanson, and unfortunately there was a car crash that hit Al Harthy. The race was stopped for over an hour to repair the track barrier due to the crash, and car #46 had to be retired.

Next in Le Mans, Rossi and the #46 car had some bad luck. Battling for the top spot in the opening stages, Al Harthy handed over the BMW WRT to Rossi who managed to maintain the top spot for most of his stint. But when the rain came, Al Harthy, who stayed on track with slippery tires, crashed and damaged the car beyond repair.

In the race at the Interlagos Circuit, Brazil, Team WRT 46 driven by Valentino Rossi and his two colleagues were able to finish fifth even though they started from 12th place. The WRT 31 Team&#x27;s main competitor in the hunt for the LMGT3 class title, Manthey PureRxcing 92, won the race and has now widened the points gap in the standings. Meanwhile, the Manthey EMA 91 team experienced problems and finished 12th.

Next round at America, The #46 BMW M4 LMGT3 car driven by Valentino Rossi, Ahmad Al Harthy and Maxime Martin crashed out 15 minutes before the end of the World Endurance Championship race at Circuit of the Americas, Austin, Texas. They rose from 15th in the LMGT3 class to fifth alongside Al-Harty in Sunday&#x27;s Lone Star Le Mans starting stint at COTA. Al-Harty&#x27;s strong speed was maintained by his teammates, Rossi and Martin in the six-hour race. Running inside the top five as the finish line neared, the car experienced hydraulic problems with 15 minutes remaining and was forced to retire.
The next race was held in Fuji, Japan. This is Valentino Rossi&#x27;s latest achievement in four-wheel racing, winning his first World Endurance Championship (WEC) podium at the Fuji Circuit. Rossi and his teammates Maxime Martin and Ahmad Al Harthy placed their #46 BMW M4 in third place in the LMGT3 class. They finished behind Ferrari and Porsche. Rossi drove the final lap for his team and completed two overtakes at the same corner. He rose five positions in two rounds. They started from 12th position on the grid.

Next is the final race held in Bahrain. Moving into the top 10 later on the hour, as the first round of pit stops began to take place, the Omani rider remained off track at the start and as a result moved further into the top six with less than 55 minutes gone. After his first visit to the pits soon after, Al Harthy emerged in 10th place and was aiming to make progress but was instead back to 12th in the second hour. He then pitted himself against each other again towards the end of the second hour. Rossi got behind the wheel of the No.46 BMW M4 for his first race and when orders were finalized he was 12th. Gaining some ground to re-emerge in the top 10, Rossi pitted about 45 minutes into the third hour and rejoined in 12th time again. Al Harthy returned to the driver&#x27;s seat for his final stint before the fourth hour ended, finishing 14th and holding that position until his next pit visit. Martin then took over driving duties, entering the race in 15th position. With two and a half hours remaining he moved up to 13th, before Rossi took over for the final race. After that, the last few hours passed in the same manner with Martin doing his best to gain strength but feeling frustrated in the end. Running 13th with less than half an hour remaining, Martin had to make one final pit visit and ultimately took the checked flag at the end of eight hours in 14th place in LMGT3.

=====Hypercar=====
The 8 Hours of Bahrain on November 2 marked the end of BMW M Motorsport&#x27;s debut season in the Hypercar class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (FIA WEC). On the Sunday after the race, the FIA WEC Rookie Test is scheduled, where Valentino Rossi (ITA), Dan Harper (GBR), and Max Hesse (GER) will piloted the BMW M Hybrid V8. The three of them have prepared for their Rookie Test in the BMW M Motorsport simulator in Munich (GER). Hesse was involved in development work during the season. He and Harper had also previously completed aerodynamic tests. For Rossi, this will be his first appearance in the cockpit of an LMDh car.

The seven-time MotoGP champion posted a 1m50.577s aboard the #20 WRT BMW M Hybrid V8 LMDh late in the afternoon session of the test on Sunday, the day after the WEC championship finale in Bahrain. 
That compared with Arthur Leclerc’s 1m50.460s at the wheel of the #50 AF Corse Ferrari 499P Le Mans Hypercar also set in the final hour of the afternoon period.

====24 Hours of Le Mans====
In 2024, Valentino Rossi debuts with Team WRT at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The #46 WRT car actually performed very impressively in the first third of the race, especially when the wheel was held by Valentino Rossi. Rossi and the #46 car, which actually only started 12th in the LMGT3 class, were able to impress and then lead the race in the LMGT3 class for quite a while. Unfortunately, this unwanted incident by Valentino Rossi, Ahmad Al Harthy and Maxime Martin then occurred at midnight local time.
After completing his first stint, Rossi handed over the wheel of his BMW M4 LMGT3 car to Ahmad Al Harthy. Unexpectedly in a lead of more than a minute, Al Harthy lost control of his car and then twisted in the area after Dunlop Chicane and Tertre Rouge S. The car that was being held by Al Harthy also hit the track dividing wall and then suffered severe damage. The crash forced Rossi, Al Harthy and Martin out of the race and The Doctor&#x27;s debut ended in disappointment.

==Rivalries==
===1990s and early 2000s: Capirossi, Biaggi and Gibernau===
====Loris Capirossi====
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially during his 250cc career, Rossi&#x27;s main rival was fellow Italian Loris Capirossi. They often fought hard between each other during the races – with 1999 Assen, 2003 Catalunya and 2006 Mugello as examples – they always maintained a level of fairness on and off the track.

Their rivalry died down when Capirossi stopped consistently battling for podiums and eventually retired from MotoGP racing completely in 2011.

====Max Biaggi====
At the early stages of his 500cc career, Max Biaggi was considered Rossi&#x27;s main rival. Rossi often found himself battling on the track with Capirossi and Biaggi, dubbing them &quot;the three musketeers&quot; by the Italian press. While the rivalry with Capirossi never escalated and the two always were on good terms with each other, the rivalry with Biaggi had been growing since the mid-1990s, even though both didn&#x27;t race against each other until the 2000 season when Rossi first joined the 500cc class.

Before the first race of the 2001 season even started, Rossi and Biaggi had already had a heated argument when Biaggi encountered Rossi at a restaurant in Suzuka and told him to &quot;wash your mouth out before saying my name&quot;. At the first round of the season in Japan, one of the most famous episodes in their rivalry took place when Biaggi seemed to have tried to push Rossi into the dirt at high speed and a few laps later Rossi overtook Biaggi and showed, on live television, his middle finger to him. Their rivalry reached its peak two months later at the 2001 Catalan round when at the end of the 500cc race, Rossi and Biaggi came to blows (involving members of their entourage and circuit employees) in the moments before the podium ceremony. Neither rider admitted that they got into a fist fight, but Biaggi appeared in the post-race press conference with red marks and scratches on his face, which he said &quot;must have been caused by a mosquito bite&quot;. Rossi claimed that the incident happened because Biaggi bumped into his manager as both riders prepared to go up to the podium with third-place finisher Loris Capirossi.

Two weeks later at the next Grand Prix in Assen, Honda organized a press conference to put the events of Barcelona behind them. Rossi and Biaggi talked about the event and shook hands in front of the media, which ended the feud. After that, although they have had run-ins on track over the next couple of seasons, the media frenzy surrounding them and any incidents off-track calmed down, mainly due to Rossi&#x27;s consecutive World Championships and Biaggi&#x27;s struggle to find support and a consistent rhythm with his races, even after switching to the Honda Pons and later the Factory Honda team.

Some would also consider the 2004 South African round another key point in the rivalry due to the switch Rossi made from the Factory Honda to the Factory Yamaha team, with many believing that Biaggi would have the upper hand for the season due to the advantage the Honda had over its competitors at the time. During the race, Rossi and Biaggi fought hard but eventually, Rossi crossed the line 0.210 seconds ahead of Biaggi, dealing a critical psychological blow to Biaggi, with Rossi calling the race &quot;one of the best of his career&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;What If I&#x27;d Never Tried It?&quot;, Rossi makes a number of claims about the reasons for his rivalry with Biaggi, and some of the incidents which led to its escalation. The rivalry was also featured in the 2003 documentary film, &quot;Faster&quot;.

====Sete Gibernau====
Rossi&#x27;s closest rival in the 2003 and 2004 seasons was Sete Gibernau, riding for the Gresini Team Movistar Honda on a satellite RC211V in 2004 and then on an all but in name factory RC211V, which Gibernau helped to develop, in 2005. Initially they were quite friendly in the paddock and off – Gibernau partied on occasions with Rossi at the Italian&#x27;s Ibiza villa – but a souring in their relationship began in the 2004 season and culminated in the &quot;Qatar Incident&quot; that same season when Rossi&#x27;s team was penalized for &quot;cleaning&quot; his grid position to aid in traction, along with Honda Pons&#x27; Max Biaggi, and both riders were subsequently forced to start from the back of the grid. A number of teams, including Gibernau&#x27;s Team Gresini and the official Repsol Honda factory team, appealed successfully to race direction for Rossi to be sanctioned. Rossi and his chief engineer, Jeremy Burgess, insisted that they were doing nothing more than what many others had done before when faced with a dirty track and Rossi accused Gibernau of being behind the move to appeal for a sanction, something the Spaniard categorically denied. Rossi accused Gibernau in 2015 that he was &quot;playing a dirty game&quot;.

Since then the two have not spoken and Rossi seemed to use the incident to apply psychological pressure on Gibernau. Rumours of Rossi having sworn that after the Qatar race, which Gibernau won while Rossi crashed out after rising to 6th position, he would do everything to make sure that Gibernau never stood on the highest step of the podium again. However, Rossi has denied these claims.

The rivalry between Rossi and Gibernau climaxed at the 2005 round in Jerez. Rossi started from pole position but Gibernau overtook him on the first lap. On the final lap, Gibernau was in the lead, but Rossi tried to overtake him at the final corner – named the Curva Ducados at the time – with both colliding mid-corner. Gibernau ran wide and would finish second whilst Rossi would win the race. After the incident, Gibernau was furious and refused to comment on the last lap. The Spanish crowd booed Rossi as the Italian national anthem was playing to celebrate his victory. Rossi commented on the incident, stating that his move had been &quot;hard&quot; but also, &quot;motorbike races sometimes are like this.&quot;

Tensions ended when Gibernau retired from Grand Prix racing after an unsuccessful, injury-blighted 2006 season with Ducati and he never won another race after Qatar, prompting some in the Spanish and Italian motorcycle racing media to explain this fact by way of reference to the &quot;Qatar Curse&quot;.

===Late 2000s and early 2010s: Stoner and Lorenzo===
====Casey Stoner====
Casey Stoner emerged as a rival for Rossi when he moved from the LCR team in 2006 to the official Factory Ducati team in 2007. Over the course of the season, Rossi and Stoner frequently battled for wins – particularly in Catalunya and China – but the young Australian had the better of Rossi in many of the races thanks to his outstanding talent despite the problems with the Ducati, resulting in his claiming of the 2007 MotoGP World Championship title.

Stoner&#x27;s and Rossi&#x27;s rivalry came to a dramatic climax at the 2008 United States GP. After numerous position changes, Rossi overtook Stoner at the Corkscrew. The move caused Rossi to run into the dirt and broken pavement on the inside of the right turn, and his rejoining the track came close to causing a collision between the two riders. A few laps later, Stoner went into the gravel on the slow entry into turn 11 whilst outbraking himself, almost crashing into Rossi in the process. Stoner picked up his bike to finish second, while Rossi took the win. 
When Rossi wanted to shake Stoner&#x27;s hand in the &quot;parc fermé&quot;, he angrily refused. At the press conference, Stoner claimed that some of Rossi&#x27;s moves were considered &quot;aggressive&quot; but Rossi called it &quot;just racing&quot;. After this, Casey Stoner made the comment &quot;I have lost respect for one of the greatest riders in history.&quot; For the comment, Stoner apologised to Rossi at the next race.

The rivalry cooled down when Rossi won back-to-back titles in 2008 and 2009 whilst Stoner struggled with the Ducati for multiple seasons, suffered from a mystery illness and various crashes – despite still battling hard with Rossi on some occasions.

After Rossi moved to the Factory Ducati team and Stoner to the Factory Honda team in 2011, tensions would once again rise at the 2011 Spanish round when Rossi collided with Stoner, causing him to crash out of the race while Rossi got going again and finished fifth. After the race, Rossi went to Stoner to apologise for the incident, who smiled and accepted Rossi&#x27;s handshake. However, Stoner told Rossi &quot;your ambition outweighs your talent&quot; during the brief exchange, in which he also asked about Rossi&#x27;s shoulder. Stoner later apologised for this comment. After this, tensions between both riders would ease once more when Stoner won his 2011 World Championship title whilst Rossi struggled on an underperforming Ducati for the rest of the season.

However, tensions would rise once more at the 2012 French race where Rossi and Stoner once again came to blows when they battled hard in the wet conditions, with Rossi passing and repassing Stoner on the first corners of the Le Mans track before he permanently overtook him on the last lap to cross the line in second place. When Rossi caught Stoner, he thought of his mistake in Jerez last year and was more cautious because of it.

Rossi and Stoner&#x27;s rivalry ended permanently when Stoner retired in 2012 and Rossi returned to the Factory Yamaha team in 2013.

====Jorge Lorenzo====

In 2008, Jorge Lorenzo joined Rossi in the Factory Yamaha team which started a new rivalry. Initially, relationships were friendly; Rossi won the 2008 title while Lorenzo suffered two serious crashes at Shanghai and Laguna Seca which prevented any serious rivalries from ever starting to begin with, Rossi concentrated more on his rivalry with Casey Stoner at the time.

In 2009, Rossi and Lorenzo resumed hostilities with Rossi emerging as champion again. Over the course of the season, Rossi defeated Lorenzo in several tight battles – such as Assen, Sachsenring, Valencia and, most memorably, Lorenzo&#x27;s home race in Catalunya. Both were battling hard on the Catalan circuit, with Lorenzo taking the lead on the final lap. Rossi tried to overtake him in the usual spots but failed, with many assuming Lorenzo was going to win the race. However, Rossi managed to pass him going into the final corner, where many assumed overtaking was impossible, to take an unlikely victory.

In 2010, Lorenzo finally emerged victorious in the championship battle after Rossi first injured his shoulder at a motocross accident two weeks before the 2010 Spanish race and then suffered a displaced compound fracture of his right tibia during a free practice fall at the 2010 Italian round, which caused him to miss four races. The most dramatic race of the season came at Motegi when Rossi fought hard with Lorenzo on the final laps of the race for third place, colliding with each other on more than one occasion. Rossi would win the battle, crossing the line in third.

After Rossi moved to the Factory Ducati team in 2011, Lorenzo stayed with the Factory Yamaha team and the rivalry cooled down when Rossi underperformed on the Ducati for two seasons while Lorenzo fought for the championship in both years, losing out to Stoner in 2011 but winning his second MotoGP title in 2012.

After Rossi returned to Yamaha in 2013, the rivalry resumed, and came to a boiling point in 2015. Rossi was on course to win his tenth overall title but was narrowly ahead of his teammate Lorenzo, who had closed the gap after the summer break. Going into the penultimate round in Malaysia, Rossi and Márquez had a falling out, causing Márquez to fall and Rossi to resume, finishing third. This decision led to the race direction imposing three penalty points to Rossi and demoting him to the back of the grid at the final round in Valencia. This was crucial for Rossi&#x27;s title chances because Lorenzo started on pole and won the race while he crossed the line in fourth place, handing the title to Lorenzo by just five points. Rossi accused both Márquez and Lorenzo, calling this title &quot;a Spanish stitch-up&quot; and &quot;having Marc Márquez as the bodyguard of Lorenzo is embarrassing.&quot;

After this, the relationship between Rossi and Lorenzo became sour, though would ease once more when Lorenzo moved to the Factory Ducati team in 2017 whilst Rossi stayed with the team. In the subsequent seasons the rivalry cooled down as Andrea Dovizioso emerged as the main challenger to Marc Márquez starting with 2017. Rossi only won 1 race since then and Lorenzo 3 all coming in 2018 with Ducati after initially struggling with his new team.
The rivalry ended when Lorenzo retired from the sport at the end of the 2019 season.

===Mid to late 2010s: Marc Márquez===
====Marc Márquez====

In more recent times, Rossi has been involved in an, at times, heated rivalry with Spanish rider Marc Márquez. Márquez moved up to the MotoGP category in 2013 and initially the two had a good relationship, with Márquez stating that Rossi had been his childhood idol and that it was a pleasure to battle with him. Their respect for each other took a turn during the 2015 season, starting with a late race collision whilst battling for the lead at the third round in Argentina. Márquez started from pole and created a gap at the opening stages of the race, but Rossi closed him down and a battle commenced. At turn 5, Márquez made contact with Rossi, which resulted in Márquez&#x27;s bike hitting Rossi&#x27;s rear tyre, causing him to fall. Márquez could not rejoin, and as a result, Rossi took his second win of the season. Both riders shrugged it off as a racing incident. A similar incident occurred at Assen several months later; Márquez lunged up the inside of Rossi at the final chicane on the final lap, Rossi picked the bike up and rode through the gravel, rejoined the track and won the race. Post-race Márquez seemed fairly unbothered by the incident, although his team did appeal the result.

Their relationship broke down completely after the penultimate round in Malaysia. Having had a poor season and being out of championship contention, Márquez won at Phillip Island whilst points leader Rossi was only fourth. A week later during the pre-event press conference in Malaysia, Rossi accused Marc of deliberately battling aggressively with him in Australia to cost him time and give an advantage to Rossi&#x27;s teammate and championship rival Jorge Lorenzo. Tempers reached boiling point in the race, where Márquez ran wide early on, allowing Lorenzo through for second and then had a heated battle with Rossi which lasted for several laps. Coming into turn 14, Rossi ran Márquez to the outside of the corner and they collided at the edge of the track, knocking Márquez out of the race whilst Rossi carried on to finish third. Post-race, Rossi was penalised by three championship points and by starting from the back of the grid for the championship decider in Valencia. In that race, Rossi rode from the back to fourth, but Lorenzo took victory with Márquez second to claim the title by 5 points. Márquez was accused by fans to have deliberately defended Lorenzo for the whole race against his own teammate Dani Pedrosa and Rossi called this championship a &quot;Spanish stitch-up&quot;.

Their relationship remained frosty for the beginning of 2016, but the feud came to an end when they shook hands after battling each other in Barcelona to remember Luis Salom, who died after crashing at high speed on the Catalan circuit. However, tempers would again flare two years later, once more in Argentina. Márquez was given a ride-through penalty after he stalled on the grid and retook his original starting position. Whilst riding back through the field in the late stages, he caught Rossi who was running in fifth place. He attempted to overtake into the final corner, but hit a damp patch and collided with Rossi, pushing him off the track and causing him to fall. Márquez crossed the line in fifth but was penalised a further 30 seconds for the incident. After the race, Marquez walked to Rossi&#x27;s garage to apologise, but Rossi refused to receive him. Instead, one of Rossi&#x27;s team asked Marquez to leave. Later, Rossi stated that Márquez &quot;destroyed our sport&quot; with his aggressive riding. He also said, &quot;Marquez needs to get away from me and not look me in the face anymore&quot;.

After Argentina, the relationship between the two remained quite poor. At the 2018 San Marino race, Rossi refused to shake Márquez&#x27;s hand and claimed, &quot;We don&#x27;t need to shake the hand. We don&#x27;t have any problem.&quot; However, one year later at the 2019 Argentine GP, Rossi and Márquez once more shook each other&#x27;s hands just before the podium ceremony, indicating that tensions between the riders have eased once more.

==Nicknames==


Since his early racing days Rossi has had numerous nicknames. In the beginning of his career he was known as &quot;Rossifumi&quot; because he was a big fan of Japanese riders, most notably Norifumi Abe, who made a spectacular debut in the 500cc class as a wildcard rider in Japan. Rossi saw the race when he was only 14 years old and became a fan of him, which led to him also wanting to become a grand prix motorcycle racing rider in the future. As such, the nickname is a tribute to him.

Another nickname Rossi had earlier on in his career, albeit not as known or popular, was &quot;Valentinik&quot;. This name appeared around the days when he raced in the 250cc championship. The nickname comes from the comic of Donald Duck, in Italian called &quot;Paperino&quot;. In the comics, he transforms into an alter ego called Super Donald which in Italian translates to &quot;Paperinik&quot;. This version of Donald Duck sports a mask and a cape and looks just like a super hero, but unlike actual super heroes does not have any luck and wreaks destruction everywhere he goes. However, he also is a funny and likeable character. The nickname is a reference to this Italian superhero, which can also be translated to &quot;Super Valentino&quot;.

Since Rossi started to dominate in the 500cc, later known as MotoGP, &quot;The Doctor&quot; has become the nickname of choice for Rossi. Although not common in English-speaking countries, the nickname is given to those as a sign of respect. Two theories prevail as to why Rossi uses this name. One is that Rossi adopted the nickname upon having earned a degree, which in Italy entitles one to use the title &quot;Doctor&quot;. Another, as spoken by Graziano Rossi himself, &quot;The Doctor because, I don&#x27;t think there is a particular reason, but it&#x27;s beautiful, and is important, The Doctor. And in Italy, The Doctor is a name you give to someone for respect, it&#x27;s very important, The Doctor... important.&quot; Rossi often jokes, however, that the name arrived because in Italy, Rossi is a common surname for doctors.

He has always raced with the number 46 in his motorcycle grand prix career, the number his father had raced with in the first of his three grand prix career wins in 1979, in Yugoslavia, on a 250c Morbidelli. Typically, a World Championship winner is awarded the No. 1 sticker for the next season. However, in a homage to Britain&#x27;s Barry Sheene, who was the first rider of the modern era to keep the same number (#7), Rossi has stayed with the now-famous No. 46 throughout his career, though as the world champion he has worn the No. 1 on the shoulder of his racing leathers.

The text on his helmet&#x27;s visors refers to the name of his group of friends: &quot;The Tribe of the Chihuahua&quot;, in Italian &quot;Tribu Dei Chihuahua&quot;. This is also a reference to a tribe of natives found in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. The letters WLF on his leathers stand for &quot;Viva La Figa&quot;, Italian for &quot;Long Live Pussy&quot;. He has so far escaped any sanctions or ultimatums that he remove the letters because the &quot;W&quot; in &quot;WLF&quot; represents the two &quot;V&quot;s in &quot;ViVa&quot;. Equally obvious is his success at escaping any disciplinary action from the FIM or Dorna Sports for having the letters so brazenly on the front neck area of his leathers. He traditionally also incorporates his favorite color (fluorescent yellow) into his leather designs. This has also earned him the nickname &quot;Highlighter Pen&quot;.

Fellow motorcycle racer and former teammate Colin Edwards, as well as many well known riders, commentators and journalists have often referred to him as &#x27;the GOAT&#x27; (Greatest of all Time).

==Other motorsport activities==
===Suzuka 8 Hours===

Apart from MotoGP, the motorcycle racing event that Valentino Rossi has participated is the FIM Endurance World Championship (EWC). However, he did not fully participate in the championship, but has participated in one of its series which is also a prestigious motorcycle race and the most physically and mentally demanding, the Suzuka 8 Hours in Japan. He took part in the event in 2000, teaming up with Colin Edwards and riding a Honda. Unfortunately, they failed to finish. In 2001, Rossi and Edwards teamed up for revenge, and eventually won the title. He also became the first Italian rider in history to win the race.2019.

===Formula One===
Rossi tested the Ferrari Formula One car in 2006 from 31 January to 2 February at the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia. The first test saw Rossi spin out on the damp track into the gravel trap, ending his day. On the second day, he posted the ninth fastest time of fifteen drivers, approximately one second behind Michael Schumacher, who himself was third fastest. Rossi lapped faster than seasoned drivers Red Bull Racing&#x27;s Mark Webber and David Coulthard and Toyota F1&#x27;s Jarno Trulli. On the final day of testing, Rossi was just a little more than a half second behind Schumacher&#x27;s best time. Schumacher hailed Rossi as having immense talent and said he would be perfectly capable of moving to Formula One and being competitive immediately.

In May 2006, Rossi announced that he would be staying in MotoGP until he felt his work on the motorbike was &quot;finished&quot;. Ferrari driver Schumacher said that he felt &quot;saddened&quot; by Rossi&#x27;s decision but supported it. Rossi subsequently signed a new contract with Yamaha for the 2007 and 2008 seasons, then for 2009 and 2010.

In 2008, Rossi tested a Ferrari F2008 at Mugello Circuit on 20 and 21 November 2008, as a gift from Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali to celebrate his eighth world title. On the first day Rossi completed over 20 laps, and set a best time of 1:22.5, only 1.5 seconds off Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s best time set at Ferrari&#x27;s previous Mugello test. The second day was interrupted by rain, but Rossi still managed to set a best time of 1:24.04.
In January 2010, Rossi has said that once he retires from motorcycle racing, he hopes to move into rallying. &quot;There are not many changes in a man&#x27;s body between 22 and 34 so I still have some time left. I would consider shifting to cars, probably rallying, after that before I finally decide to take it easy ... I know F1 would&#x27;ve been easier but by the time I finish MotoGP, I will be too old for F1.&quot; Stefano Domenicali, Ferrari&#x27;s Formula One Team principal, however, reasserted his wish to have a third Ferrari on the F1 grid driven by Rossi, whilst confirming that Rossi would test an older Ferrari F1 car on 21 and 22 January 2010. At the aforementioned test at Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, Rossi once again drove a Ferrari F2008 on GP2 tyres, setting a best laptime within 0.1 seconds of Kimi Räikkönen&#x27;s 2008 pole time.

In December 2019, Rossi got the chance to swap rides with then six-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton at Circuit Ricardo Tormo, as part of a sponsor event. He completed several laps in a 2017 Mercedes AMG F1 W08 EQ Power+, while Hamilton rode a Yamaha YZR-M1, identical to the one Rossi rode in the 2019 MotoGP season. Press were locked out of the event, so laptimes weren&#x27;t made public.

===Monza Rally Show===

In 2018, Valentino Rossi claimed the Monza Rally Show title for the seventh time, driving a Ford Fiesta WRC car. The Italian passed the record of five time winners Rinaldo Capello, Sebastien Loeb and Robert Kubica.
With his latest victory, Rossi was the fastest driver four consecutive times. He has collected titles from 2006, 2007, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 while participating in this rally since 1998.

===Rally===

Beyond his interest in F1, Rossi&#x27;s strong passion is for rallying. In Rossi&#x27;s youth one of his heroes was WRC Champion Colin McRae. Rally legend McRae taught Rossi the basics of driving a rally car. The two competed against each other at the 2005 Monza Rally Show, with McRae driving a Skoda Fabia WRC and Rossi winning in a Subaru Impreza WRC. His first official foray into rallying came in 2002 at WRC Rally Great Britain in a Peugeot 206 WRC, in which he crashed out on the second stage (first non-superspecial stage). Rossi had competed in the Monza Rally Show several times in a Toyota Corolla WRC.

In October 2006 it was announced that Rossi would enter that year&#x27;s Rally New Zealand, a World Rally Championship (WRC) event, which was to run from 17 to 19 November. He competed in a Subaru Impreza WRC04 finishing 11th out of 39. In 2006 Rossi also won the Monza Rally Show driving a Ford Focus RS WRC 04. He beat the 2005 winner Rinaldo Capello by 24 seconds, winning five of the seven stages on his way. He also managed to outpace former WRC champion Didier Auriol by seven seconds in the head-to-head Master Show final. Rossi also announced at the 2006 Monza Rally Show, that he would be entering the 2007 Rally of Great Britain, however, he later opted out. At the 2007 Monza Rally, Rossi again took first place.

Rossi had been linked with a move to both Formula One and the World Rally Championship in 2007, having tested for Ferrari and competed in a number of rally events.

But Rossi decided to remain in MotoGP; &quot;I have a contract with Yamaha until 2008&quot;, said Rossi. &quot;When that finishes then we will see. What I am sure about is that I will ride until I&#x27;m 31 or 32 at most. I will look for new stimuli in the next few seasons, but for now I am fully motivated.&quot; Rossi signed a new two-year contract confirming he will be at Yamaha until 2010. He originally planned to use the Impreza WRC2008 during his participation in the Rally GB in December 2008, but decided to drive a Ford Focus RS WRC 07 instead. He finished the rally in 12th place, 13 minutes and 20.4 seconds behind eventual winner Sébastien Loeb.

In March 2010, the Italian minister Franco Frattini government awarded Rossi the first Winning Italy Award for the image he portrays of his country on an international level.

===Blancpain Endurance Series===
In 2012, Rossi participated in the Blancpain Endurance Series Pro-Am Cup with the Kessel Racing Team, driving a Ferrari 458 Italia GT3. In that season he had only two races, the first series in Monza and the fifth series in the Nürburgring.

===Gulf 12 Hour===
Later in the same week after Rossi got the chance to swap rides with six-time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton at Circuit Ricardo Tormo in a 2017 Mercedes AMG F1 W08 EQ Power+, Rossi competed in the 2019 Gulf 12 Hour at Yas Marina Circuit, behind the wheel of a Ferrari 488 GT3 owned by Kessel Racing. His co-drivers were his half-brother and Moto2 rider, Luca Marini, and Alessio Salucci. Rossi set the team&#x27;s fastest laptime in qualifying, securing seventh place overall on the grid. Despite a shaky start with some lost positions, the team were in the lead of the Pro-Am class at the halfway point. A few technical issues in the Pro-class left the VR46 car in a battle for the final overall podium place with Spirit Race Team&#x27;s Audi R8 LMS. Rossi got into the car for the final stint and drove the car to an overall third place and a win in the Pro-Am class, despite picking up a five-second time penalty.

In January 2021, he and his co-drivers Luca Marini and Alessio Salucci, driving a 488 GT3, competed in the 2020 Gulf 12 Hours at the Bahrain International Circuit and won the third podium.

In December 2023, Rossi finished second on the podium at the Gulf 12 Hours at Abu Dhabi, the season finale of the 2023 Intercontinental GT Challenge driving the BMW M4 GT3 with Team WRT. In the end, Rossi and teammates Dries Vanthoor and Nick Yelloly missed out on victory by 12 seconds to the Mercedes-AMG GT3 driven by Maro Engel, Luca Stolz and Mikael Grenier. Rossi led the race after 7.5 hours, then maintained his lead for an hour, when he then handed it over to Yelloly.

===Motocross &amp; Flat Track===
Not only does he love the world of road racing and all-terrain car racing, Rossi is also known to love the motocross arena. In flat track racing, Rossi has won several times the &#x27;La 100 km dei Campioni&#x27; racing event which he holds at Motor Ranch every year and is attended by members of the VR46 Riders Academy and professional motorcycle racers from other events.

==Team ownership==

Rossi is the owner of the junior-class team Sky Racing Team by VR46, which debuted in the Moto3 category of Grand Prix motorcycle racing in 2014 with riders Romano Fenati and Francesco Bagnaia with his former Cagiva teammate Vittoriano Guareschi as team manager. In 2015, Andrea Migno replaced Francesco Bagnaia and Guareschi was replaced by Alessio &#x27;Uccio&#x27; Salucci and Carlo Alberto Tebaldi. The team also races in Moto2. In 2020, it was announced that Rossi&#x27;s brand VR46 would back one machine from the Esponsorama Avintia team in the 2021 MotoGP season, to be ridden by his half-brother, Luca Marini.

VR46 Riders Academy began to reap the &quot;investment&quot; results through several academy drivers, including Franco Morbidelli who became the 2017 world champion and then finished as the 2020 MotoGP runner-up. This achievement was then repeated by Francesco Bagnaia who became the 2018 Moto2 world champion and then finished second in the 2021 MotoGP final standings. Until finally, Bagnaia ended the long wait for VR46 Academy by becoming the 2022 MotoGP world champion.

In addition, there are several other names who have managed to compete at the top of the standings, such as Luca Marini who was runner-up in Moto2 2020, Marco Bezzecchi who managed to get third in the final Moto2 2021 standings, and several other riders in academy.

In the 2020 season, the Sky Racing VR46 won the Moto2 teams championship by taking first place in the final standings after leading the standings with 380 points.

==Collaboration team==
In addition to leading his own team, Rossi collaborates with several others to attract young racers through various programs.

===Team Bardahl VR46 Riders Academy===
The team competes in the CIV Italian Championships Series in collaboration with Bardahl as the main sponsor. In the 2021 season the team got a wildcard to race in two Moto3 series, at Mugello and Misano. This team races using KTM bikes.

===Yamaha VR46 MasterCamp Team===
He also runs a program to nurture young riders called VR46 MasterCamp. In collaboration with Yamaha, the team competed in the CEV Moto2 Championships for several years under the name Yamaha VR46 MasterCamp. Starting 2022 season, this team will debuted in Moto2.

===Avintia VR46 Riders Academy===
Starting from the 2022 season, the VR46 Racing Team will also return to Moto3 and work closely with Esponsorama Avintia. Then the Avintia Racing team changed its name to Avintia VR46 Riders Academy, the result of a collaboration between Avintia Racing and VR46 Riders Academy, which is likely to place several VR46 racers in the team.

===RMU Moto VR46 Academy===
This team is the outcome of a collaboration between the VR46 Riders Academy and RMU Moto from Italy. They compete in the CIV PreMoto3, featuring young riders trained at the VR46 Riders Academy.

==Helmets and protective gear==
Rossi has gone through numerous helmet designs throughout his career, most featuring the Sun &amp; Moon motif, signifying (according to Rossi) the two sides of his personality. His helmets are manufactured by AGV. Aldo Drudi was associated with Rossi&#x27;s helmet graphics in 2010. Nearly every year, Rossi works with Aldo Drudi to design a unique helmet to use while racing at the Italian and San Marino Grand Prix.

Since commencing his Grand Prix career, Rossi has worn leathers from Dainese. In and , Alpinestars was a sponsor on his bike, but did not supply Rossi with leathers. Alpinestars just supplied racing boots for Rossi. After Rossi joined the Yamaha factory team, the team wore shirts from Alpinestars, while Rossi maintained his association with Dainese. In and , Rossi was a member of the Ducati factory team, where the team wore shirts from Puma, while Rossi still maintained his association with Dainese.

In March 2022 Rossi has announced a multi-year partnership with Racing Force Group, which would see Rossi use OMP race suit and Bell helmets in his car racing career.

==Pre-ride rituals==

Rossi is superstitious and renowned for his pre-ride rituals. On a race day, he will always watch the beginning of the Moto3 race to see how long the starting lights remain lit before going out at the start of the race. Prior to riding (whether racing, qualifying, or practice), he will start his personal ritual by stopping about two metres from his bike, bending over and reaching for his boots. Then, when arriving at his bike, he will crouch down and hold the right-side foot-peg, with his head bowed. In an interview, Rossi said &quot;It&#x27;s just a moment to focus and &#x27;talk&#x27; to my bike, like moving from one place to the next&quot;. He adjusts the fit of his leathers by standing straight up on the foot-pegs, whilst riding down the pit-lane before the start of race or practice. He also revealed in an interview with MotoGP.com that he always puts one particular boot on before the other, as well as one particular glove on before the other, and that he always gets on the bike the same way. He also gets off the bike in the same way, swinging his right leg over the front of the bike.

==Personal life==
After leaving the family home in Tavullia, he moved to Milan, before taking up residency in London, England during his period with Honda. During this time he acquired a villa in Ibiza which he still owns, and following the tax case returned to his main residence to live close to his family in Italy. Rossi is a practising Catholic.

Though Tavullia falls in the Marche region on the border with Emilia-Romagna, Rossi has been known to identify also with the historical region of Romagna. In June 2017, at an inauguration of a swimming pool in Pesaro, the provincial capital, Giovanni Malagò, President of the Italian National Olympic Committee, was booed for saying that Rossi was &quot;a little here [Marche] and a little there [Romagna]&quot;.

In 2002, Rossi received threats from an Italian-Spanish anarchist movement, which in those days sent parcel bombs to people it considered targets in either of the two countries. The anarchists considered Rossi &quot;guilty&quot; because at the time he rode for Honda&#x27;s MotoGP factory team, it had been sponsored by the oil company Repsol since 1994, (for which he filmed a commercial in Spain.) with their logo displayed on both the motorcycle and on his race suits.

On 31 May 2005 he received an honorary degree in Communications and Advertising for Organizations. In March 2010, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini delivered to Rossi the first Winning Italy Award for his contribution to the promotion of Italy&#x27;s image in the world.

Rossi has a maternal half-brother, Luca Marini, 2020 Moto2 season runner-up who was racing for the Sky Racing Team by VR46. In 2021, Marini moved to the MotoGP class joining the Esponsorama team using the Sky VR46 livery on his bike, before moving over to Rossi&#x27;s VR46 Racing Team for the 2022 season.

On 4 March 2022, he had a daughter with his partner, Francesca Sofia Novello.

In July 2024, Valentino Rossi announced his partner, Francesca Sofia Novello was pregnant with his second child. Through his personal Instagram @valeyellow46 he uploaded a photo of himself wearing a doctor&#x27;s uniform using a stethoscope to the stomach of his lover, Franci. At that moment Rossi was seen holding his first daughter Giulietta Rossi on his lap.

Besides having a racing team, Rossi also has other businesses such as merchandise, apparel, and many other things with the VR46 brand. In Tavullia he also has a place of business with the name Tavullia 46. Tavullia 46 owns various entities such as pizza restaurants and ice cream shops.

===Reported earnings===
According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Rossi is one of the highest-earning sports personalities in the world, having earned an estimated $34 million in 2007. In 2009 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Rossi as number nine among the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes having earned an estimated $35 million in the past year.

===Tax avoidance case===
====2002====
Rossi was investigated by the Italian tax authorities for tax evasion in 2002 but the investigation proved unsuccessful.

====2007====
In 2007, the Italian tax authorities declared Rossi was being investigated for suspected tax evasion. The authorities announced they were investigating Rossi for undeclared revenues of 112 million euros ($160 million) between 2000 and 2004. The officials said, against the European Taxes Agreements among European countries, Rossi&#x27;s London residency has enabled him to take advantage of favourable tax conditions, such as only declaring earnings made in Britain and avoiding taxes on his lucrative merchandising and sponsorship contracts, commenting that Rossi had residency in London but his &quot;centre of interests&quot; wasn&#x27;t there, as shown by a thorough investigation. It noted that in 2002, Rossi&#x27;s Italian tax form declared earnings of 500 euros, while sponsorship contracts were all reported to be made out to foreign companies, but with his affairs controlled mainly from Italy. In February 2008, Rossi announced that he had reached a settlement with the Italian tax authorities: he paid 35 million euros to close the tax case. He also plea-bargained a suspended sentence of six months&#x27; imprisonment for non-declaration of income.

===Videogame===
In November 2015, Milestone srl announced the development of &quot;Valentino Rossi: The Game&quot;, to be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with Rossi officially endorsing the game. It was then released on 16 June 2016, and it is also the official video game of the 2016 MotoGP season.

===Other hobbies===
Rossi supports Italian football club Inter Milan. After he won world titles in 2008 and 2009, Inter congratulated him via their website. At the 2015 Argentine Grand Prix, Rossi wore a replica Diego Maradona football shirt on the podium in tribute to Maradona after Rossi won the race. Maradona congratulated him via his Facebook.

<text>&#x27; (; commonly known as Adressa&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a regional newspaper published daily, except Sundays, in Trondheim, Norway. The paper has been in circulation since 1767 and is one of the oldest newspapers in Norway after Norske Intelligenz-Seddeler which was launched in 1763.

 is owned by Polaris Media, in which Schibsted controls 29% of the shares.

==History and profile==

The newspaper was first published on 3 July 1767 as &quot;Kongelig allene privilegerede Trondheims Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger&quot;, making it the oldest Norwegian newspaper still being published. The paper was founded as a classified advertising publication. The name of the newspaper was changed several times before its present name began to be used in 1927. Locally it is often referred to as &quot;Adressa&quot;. The newspaper is based in Trondheim and covers the areas of Trøndelag and Nordmøre.

Martinus Lind Nissen (1744–1795) was the founder and first editor of . At his death, Nissen was succeeded by Mathias Conrad Peterson, a French-oriented revolutionary pioneering radical journalism in Norway. Later editors, however, have been more conservative. In Peterson&#x27;s age the paper was renamed &quot;Trondhjemske Tidender&quot; (roughly &quot;Trondhjem Times&quot;) and began to look more like a modern newspaper. Changing names, owners and profile several times during the 19th century, the paper was named &quot;Trondhjems Adresseavis&quot; in 1890. Its first press picture was published in 1893. During the 1920s, the paper was nearly bankrupted, but it was saved by the new editor, Harald Houge Torp, who held the position from 1927 to 1941, and then from 1945 until 1969.

In 1941, during the German occupation of Norway, the occupiers took control of the paper. The editorial leadership was dismissed and some were arrested. Jacob Skylstad, a member of the Norwegian nazi party, Nasjonal Samling, was appointed as chief editor. Under nazi leadership the paper was published until the liberation of Norway in May 1945. During this period the paper was considered &quot;less bad&quot; than Dagsposten which was the official Nasjonal Samling publication in Trondheim. At the end of the war the dismissed editorial leadership was reappointed.

 describes itself as conservative and is part of the Adresseavisen Media Group which owns several smaller local newspapers in the Trøndelag region. It also owns and operates a local radio station, Radio-Adressa, and a local TV station, TV-Adressa (prior to 30 January 2006: TVTrøndelag). In addition, the company owns the local newspapers &quot;Fosna-Folket&quot;, &quot;Hitra-Frøya&quot;, &quot;Levanger-Avisa&quot;, &quot;Sør-Trøndelag&quot;, &quot;Trønderbladet&quot; and &quot;Verdalingen&quot;. As of 2006 Schibsted had a share of the paper (31.7%). Stocks in are traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

&quot;Adressavisen&quot; became the first Norwegian newspaper to use computer technology in 1967. Its website was launched in 1996. Gunnar Flikke was editor-in-chief from 1989 to 2006. switched from broadsheet to tabloid format on 16 September 2006.

<text>The Treaty of Campo Formio (today Campoformido) was signed on 17 October 1797 (26 Vendémiaire VI) by Napoleon Bonaparte and Count Philipp von Cobenzl as representatives of the French Republic and the Austrian monarchy, respectively. The treaty followed the armistice of Leoben (18 April 1797), which had been forced on the Habsburgs by Napoleon&#x27;s victorious campaign in Italy. It ended the War of the First Coalition and left Great Britain fighting alone against revolutionary France.

The treaty&#x27;s public articles concerned only France and Austria and called for a Congress of Rastatt to be held to negotiate a final peace for the Holy Roman Empire. In the treaty&#x27;s secret articles, Austria as the personal state of the Emperor promised to work with France to certain ends at the congress. Among other provisions, the treaty meant the definitive end to the ancient Republic of Venice, which was disbanded and partitioned by the French and the Austrians. 

The congress failed to achieve peace, and by early 1799 France and Austria were at war again. The new war, the War of the Second Coalition, ended with the Peace of Lunéville, a peace for the whole empire, in 1801.

==Location==
Campo Formio, now called Campoformido, is a village west of Udine in historical Friuli region in north-eastern Italy, in the middle between Austrian headquarters in Udine and Bonaparte&#x27;s residence. The French commander resided at Villa Manin, the country mansion of Ludovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice, near Codroipo. The treaty was signed in an old house in the main square of the village, property of Bertrando Del Torre, a local merchant.

On 18 January 1798, Austrian troops entered Venice, and three days later, they held an official reception at the Doge&#x27;s Palace, where Ludovico Manin was a guest of honour.

==Terms==

Beyond the usual clauses of &quot;firm and inviolable peace&quot;, the treaty transferred a number of Austrian territories into French hands. Lands ceded included the Austrian Netherlands (most of modern Belgium). Territories of the Republic of Venice were divided between the two states: certain islands in the Mediterranean, including Corfu and other Venetian possessions in the Ionian Sea were turned over to the French. 

The city of Venice with Terraferma (Venetian mainland), Venetian Istria, Venetian Dalmatia and the Bay of Kotor region were turned over to the Habsburg emperor. Austria recognized the Cisalpine Republic and the newly created Ligurian Republic, formed of Savoyard state and Genoese territories, as independent powers.

The Italian states formally ceased to owe fealty to the Holy Roman emperor, ending the formal existence of the Kingdom of Italy, which, as a personal holding of the emperor, had existed &quot;de jure&quot; but not &quot;de facto&quot; since at least the 14th century.

The treaty contained secret clauses signed by Napoleon and representatives of the Holy Roman emperor, which divided up certain other territories, and agreed to the extension of the borders of France up to the Rhine, the Nette, and the Roer. Free French navigation was guaranteed on the Rhine, the Meuse and the Moselle. The French Republic had been expanded into areas that had never before been under French control.

The treaty was composed and signed after five months of negotiations. It was basically what had been agreed earlier at the Treaty of Leoben in April 1797, but the negotiations had been spun out by both parties for a number of reasons. During the negotiating period the French had to crush a royalist coup in September. That was used as a cause for the arrest and deportation of royalist and moderate deputies in the Directory.

Napoleon&#x27;s biographer, Felix Markham, wrote &quot;the partition of Venice was not only a moral blot on the peace settlement but left Austria a foothold in Italy, which could only lead to further war.&quot; In fact, the Peace of Campo Formio, though it reshaped the map of Europe and marked a major step in Napoleon&#x27;s fame, was only a respite. One consequence was the Peasants&#x27; War, which erupted in the Southern Netherlands in 1798 following the French introduction of conscription.

As a result of the treaty, Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, a prisoner from the French Revolution, was released from Austrian captivity.

By passing Venetian possessions in Greece, such as the Ionian Islands, to French rule, the treaty had an effect on later Greek history neither intended nor expected at the time.

<text>In finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency. Currencies are most commonly national currencies, but may be sub-national as in the case of Hong Kong or supra-national as in the case of the euro.

The exchange rate is also regarded as the value of one country&#x27;s currency in relation to another currency. For example, an interbank exchange rate of 141 Japanese yen to the United States dollar means that ¥141 will be exchanged for or that will be exchanged for ¥141. In this case it is said that the price of a dollar in relation to yen is ¥141, or equivalently that the price of a yen in relation to dollars is $1/141.

Each country determines the exchange rate regime that will apply to its currency. For example, a currency may be floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid. Governments can impose certain limits and controls on exchange rates. Countries can also have a strong or weak currency. There is no agreement in the economic literature on the optimal national exchange rate policy (unlike on the subject of trade where free trade is considered optimal). Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations.

In floating exchange rate regimes, exchange rates are determined in the foreign exchange market, which is open to a wide range of different types of buyers and sellers, and where currency trading is continuous: 24 hours a day except weekends (i.e. trading from 20:15 GMT on Sunday until 22:00 GMT Friday). The spot exchange rate is the current exchange rate, while the forward exchange rate is an exchange rate that is quoted and traded today but for delivery and payment on a specific future date.

In the retail currency exchange market, different buying and selling rates will be quoted by money dealers. Most trades are to or from the local currency. The buying rate is the rate at which money dealers will buy foreign currency, and the selling rate is the rate at which they will sell that currency. The quoted rates will incorporate an allowance for a dealer&#x27;s margin (or profit) in trading, or else the margin may be recovered in the form of a commission or in some other way. Different rates may also be quoted for cash, a documentary transaction or for electronic transfers. The higher rate on documentary transactions has been justified as compensating for the additional time and cost of clearing the document. On the other hand, cash is available for resale immediately, but incurs security, storage, and transportation costs, and the cost of tying up capital in a stock of banknotes (bills).

==The retail exchange market==

Currency for international travel and cross-border payments is predominantly purchased from banks, foreign exchange brokerages and various forms of bureaux de change. These retail outlets source currency from the interbank markets, which are valued by the Bank for International Settlements at US$5.3 trillion per day. The purchase is made at the spot contract rate. Retail customers will be charged, in the form of commission or otherwise, to cover the provider&#x27;s costs and generate a profit. One form of charge is the use of an exchange rate that is less favourable than the wholesale spot rate. The difference between retail buying and selling prices is referred to as the bid–ask spread. 

== Retail foreign exchange trading ==

Retail foreign exchange trading is a small segment of the larger foreign exchange market where individuals speculate on the exchange rate between different currencies. This segment has developed with the advent of dedicated electronic trading platforms and the internet, which allows individuals to access the global currency markets. As of 2016, it was reported that retail foreign exchange trading represented 5.5% of the whole foreign exchange market ($282 billion in daily trading turnover).

==Quotations==

There is a market convention that rules the notation used to communicate the fixed and variable currencies in a quotation. For example, in a conversion from EUR to AUD, EUR is the fixed currency, AUD is the variable currency and the exchange rate indicates how many Australian dollars would be paid or received for 1 euro.

In some areas of Europe and in the retail market in the United Kingdom, EUR and GBP are reversed so that GBP is quoted as the fixed currency to the euro. In order to determine which is the fixed currency when neither currency is on the above list (i.e. both are &quot;other&quot;), market convention is to use the fixed currency which gives an exchange rate greater than 1.000. This reduces rounding issues and the need to use excessive numbers of decimal places. There are some exceptions to this rule: for example, the Japanese often quote their currency as the base to other currencies.

Quotation using a country&#x27;s home currency as the price currency is known as direct quotation or price quotation (from that country&#x27;s perspective) 
 For example, = in the Eurozone and is used in most countries.

Quotation using a country&#x27;s home currency as the unit currency (for example, = in the Eurozone) is known as indirect quotation or quantity quotation and is used in British newspapers; it is also common in Australia, New Zealand and the Eurozone.

Using direct quotation, if the home currency is strengthening (that is, appreciating, or becoming more valuable) then the exchange rate number decreases. Conversely, if the foreign currency is strengthening and the home currency is depreciating, the exchange rate number increases.

Market convention from the early 1980s to 2006 was that most currency pairs were quoted to four decimal places for spot transactions and up to six decimal places for forward outrights or swaps. (The fourth decimal place is usually referred to as a &quot;pip&quot;). An exception to this was exchange rates with a value of less than 1.000 which were usually quoted to five or six decimal places. Although there is no fixed rule, exchange rates numerically greater than around 20 were usually quoted to three decimal places and exchange rates greater than 80 were quoted to two decimal places. Currencies over 5000 were usually quoted with no decimal places (for example, the former Turkish Lira). e.g. (GBPOMR : 0.765432 - : 1.4436 - EURJPY : 165.29). In other words, quotes are given with five digits. Where rates are below 1, quotes frequently include five decimal places.

In 2005, Barclays Capital broke with convention by quoting spot exchange rates with five or six decimal places on their electronic dealing platform. The contraction of spreads (the difference between the bid and ask rates) arguably necessitated finer pricing and gave the banks the ability to try to win transactions on multibank trading platforms where all banks may otherwise have been quoting the same price. A number of other banks have since followed this system.

==Exchange rate regime==

Countries are free to choose which type of exchange rate regime they will apply to their currency. The main types of exchange rate regimes are: free-floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid.

In free-floating regimes, exchange rates are allowed to vary against each other according to the market forces of supply and demand. Exchange rates for such currencies are likely to change almost constantly as quoted on financial markets, mainly by banks, around the world.

A movable or adjustable peg system is a system of fixed exchange rates, but with a provision for the revaluation (usually devaluation) of a currency. For example, between 1994 and 2005, the Chinese yuan renminbi (RMB) was pegged to the United States dollar at RMB 8.2768 to $1. China was not the only country to do this; from the end of World War II until 1967, Western European countries all maintained fixed exchange rates with the US dollar based on the Bretton Woods system. But that system had to be abandoned in favor of floating, market-based regimes due to market pressures and speculation, according to President Richard M. Nixon in a speech on August 15, 1971, in what is known as the Nixon Shock.

Still, some governments strive to keep their currency within a narrow range. As a result, currencies become over-valued or under-valued, leading to excessive trade deficits or surpluses.

==Exchange rate classification==
; From the perspective of bank foreign exchange trading:
* Buying rate: Also known as the purchase price, it is the price used by the foreign exchange bank to buy foreign currency from the customer. In general, the exchange rate where the foreign currency is converted to a smaller number of domestic currencies is the buying rate, which indicates how much the country&#x27;s currency is required to buy a certain amount of foreign exchange.
* Selling rate: Also known as the foreign exchange selling price, it refers to the exchange rate used by the bank to sell foreign exchange to customers. It indicates how much the country&#x27;s currency needs to be recovered if the bank sells a certain amount of foreign exchange.
* Middle rate: The average of the bid price and the ask price. Commonly used in newspapers, magazines or economic analysis.

; According to the length of delivery after foreign exchange transactions:
* Spot exchange rate: Refers to the exchange rate of spot foreign exchange transactions. That is, after the foreign exchange transaction is completed, the exchange rate in Delivery within two working days. The exchange rate that is generally listed on the foreign exchange market is generally referred to as the spot exchange rate unless it specifically indicates the forward exchange rate.
* Forward exchange rate: To be delivered in a certain period of time in the future, but beforehand, the buyer and the seller will enter into a contract to reach an agreement. When the delivery date is reached, both parties to the agreement will deliver the transaction at the exchange rate and amount of the reservation. Forward foreign exchange trading is an appointment-based transaction, which is due to the different time the foreign exchange purchaser needs for foreign exchange funds and the introduction of foreign exchange risk. The forward exchange rate is based on the spot exchange rate, which is represented by the &quot;premium&quot;, &quot;discount&quot;, and &quot;parity&quot; of the spot exchange rate.

; According to the method of setting the exchange rate:
* Basic rate: Usually choose a key convertible currency that is the most commonly used in international economic transactions and accounts for the largest proportion of foreign exchange reserves. Compare it with the currency of the country and set the exchange rate. This exchange rate is the basic exchange rate. The key currency generally refers to a world currency, which is widely used for pricing, settlement, reserve currency, freely convertible, and internationally accepted currency.
* Cross rate: After the basic exchange rate is worked out, the exchange rate of the local currency against other foreign currencies can be calculated through the basic exchange rate. The resulting exchange rate is the cross exchange rate.

=== Other classifications ===

; According to the payment method in foreign exchange transactions:

* Telegraphic exchange rate
* Mail transfer rate
* Demand draft rate

; According to the level of foreign exchange controls:

* Official rate: The official exchange rate is the rate of exchange announced by a country&#x27;s foreign exchange administration. Usually used by countries with strict foreign exchange controls.
* Market rate: The market exchange rate refers to the real exchange rate for trading foreign exchange in the free market. It fluctuates with changes in foreign exchange supply and demand conditions.

; According to the international exchange rate regime:

* Fixed exchange rate: It means that the exchange rate between a country&#x27;s currency and another country&#x27;s currency is basically fixed, and the fluctuation of exchange rate is very small.
* Floating exchange rate: It means that the monetary authorities of a country do not stipulate the official exchange rate of the country&#x27;s currency against other currencies, nor does it have any upper or lower limit of exchange rate fluctuations. The local currency is determined by the supply and demand relationship of the foreign exchange market, and it is free to rise and fall.

; Whether inflation is included:

* Nominal exchange rate: an exchange rate that is officially announced or marketed which does not consider inflation.
* Real exchange rate: The nominal exchange rate eliminating inflation

==Factors affecting the change of exchange rate==
#Balance of payments: When a country has a large international balance of payments deficit or trade deficit, it means that its foreign exchange earnings are less than foreign exchange expenditures and its demand for foreign exchange exceeds its supply, so its foreign exchange rate rises, and its currency depreciates.
#Interest rate level: Interest rates are the cost and profit of borrowing capital. When a country raises its interest rate or its domestic interest rate is higher than the foreign interest rate, it will cause capital inflow, thereby increasing the demand for domestic currency, allowing the currency to appreciate and the foreign exchange depreciate.
#Inflation factor: The inflation rate of a country rises, the purchasing power of money declines, the paper currency depreciates internally, and then the foreign currency appreciates. If both countries have inflation, the currencies of countries with high inflation will depreciate against those with low inflation. The latter is a relative revaluation of the former.
#Fiscal and monetary policy: Although the influence of monetary policy on the exchange rate changes of a country&#x27;s government is indirect, it is also very important. In general, the huge fiscal revenue and expenditure deficit caused by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and inflation will devalue the domestic currency. The tightening fiscal and monetary policies will reduce fiscal expenditures, stabilize the currency, and increase the value of the domestic currency. 
#Speculation: If speculators expect a certain currency to appreciate, they will buy a large amount of that currency, which will cause the exchange rate of that currency to rise. Conversely, if speculators expect a certain currency to depreciate, they will sell off a large amount of the currency causing the exchange rate to fall. Speculation is an important factor in the short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate of the foreign exchange market.
#Government market intervention: When exchange rate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market adversely affect a country&#x27;s economy, trade, or the government needs to achieve certain policy goals through exchange rate adjustments, monetary authorities can participate in currency trading, buying or selling local or foreign currencies in large quantities in the market. The foreign exchange supply and demand has caused the exchange rate to change.
#Economic strength of a country: In general, high economic growth rates are not conducive to the local currency&#x27;s performance in the foreign exchange market in the short term, but in the long run, they strongly support the strong momentum of the local currency.

===Emerging markets===
Research on target zones has mainly concentrated on the benefit of stability of exchange rates for industrial countries, but some studies have argued that volatile bilateral exchange rates between industrial countries are in part responsible for financial crisis in emerging markets. According to this view the ability of emerging market economies to compete is weakened because many of the currencies are tied to the US dollar in various fashions either implicitly or explicitly, so fluctuations such as the appreciation of the US dollar to the yen or deutsche Mark have contributed to destabilizing shocks. Most of these countries are net debtors whose debt is denominated in one of the G3 currencies.

In September 2019 Argentina restricted the ability to buy US dollars. Mauricio Macri in 2015 campaigned on a promise to lift restrictions put in place by the left-wing government including the capital controls which have been used in Argentina to manage economic instability. When inflation rose above 20 percent transactions denominated in dollars became commonplace as Argentines moved away from using the peso. In 2011 the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner restricted the purchase of dollars leading to a rise in black market dollar purchases. The controls were rolled back after Macri took office and Argentina issued dollar denominated bonds, but when various factors led to a loss in the value of the peso relative to the dollar leading to the restoration of capital controls to prevent additional depreciation amidst peso selloffs.

==Fluctuations in exchange rates==
A market-based exchange rate will change whenever the values of either of the two component currencies change. A currency becomes more valuable whenever demand for it is greater than the available supply. It will become less valuable whenever demand is less than available supply (this does not mean people no longer want money, it just means they prefer holding their wealth in some other form, possibly another currency).

Increased demand for a currency can be due to either an increased transaction demand for money or an increased speculative demand for money. The transaction demand is highly correlated to a country&#x27;s level of business activity, gross domestic product (GDP), and employment levels. The more people that are unemployed, the less the public as a whole will spend on goods and services. Central banks typically have little difficulty adjusting the available money supply to accommodate changes in the demand for money due to business transactions.

Speculative demand is much harder for central banks to accommodate, which they influence by adjusting interest rates. A speculator may buy a currency if the return (that is the interest rate) is high enough. In general, the higher a country&#x27;s interest rates, the greater will be the demand for that currency. It has been argued that such speculation can undermine real economic growth, in particular since large currency speculators may deliberately create downward pressure on a currency by shorting in order to force that central bank to buy their own currency to keep it stable. (When that happens, the speculator can buy the currency back after it depreciates, close out their position, and thereby make a profit.)

For carrier companies shipping goods from one nation to another, exchange rates can often impact them severely. Therefore, most carriers have a CAF charge to account for these fluctuations.

==Purchasing power of currency==
The real exchange rate (RER) is the purchasing power of a currency relative to another at current exchange rates and prices. It is the ratio of the number of units of a given country&#x27;s currency necessary to buy a market basket of goods in the other country, after acquiring the other country&#x27;s currency in the foreign exchange market, to the number of units of the given country&#x27;s currency that would be necessary to buy that market basket directly in the given country. There are various ways to measure RER.

Thus the real exchange rate is the exchange rate times the relative prices of a market basket of goods in the two countries. For example, the purchasing power of the US dollar relative to that of the euro is the dollar price of a euro (dollars per euro) times the euro price of one unit of the market basket (euros/goods unit) divided by the dollar price of the market basket (dollars per goods unit), and hence is dimensionless. This is the exchange rate (expressed as dollars per euro) times the relative price of the two currencies in terms of their ability to purchase units of the market basket (euros per goods unit divided by dollars per goods unit). If all goods were freely tradable, and foreign and domestic residents purchased identical baskets of goods, purchasing power parity (PPP) would hold for the exchange rate and GDP deflators (price levels) of the two countries, and the real exchange rate would always equal 1.

The rate of change of the real exchange rate over time for the euro versus the dollar equals the rate of appreciation of the euro (the positive or negative percentage rate of change of the dollars-per-euro exchange rate) plus the inflation rate of the euro minus the inflation rate of the dollar.

==Real exchange rate equilibrium and misalignment==
The Real Exchange Rate (RER) represents the nominal exchange rate adjusted by the relative price of domestic and foreign goods and services, thus reflecting the competitiveness of a country with respect to the rest of the world. More in detail, an appreciation of the currency or a high level of domestic inflation reduces the RER, thus reducing the country&#x27;s competitiveness and lowering the Current Account (CA). On the other hand, a currency depreciation generates an opposite effect, improving the country&#x27;s CA.

There is evidence that the RER generally reaches a steady level in the long-term, and that this process is faster in small open economies characterized by fixed exchange rates. Any substantial and persistent RER deviation from its long-run equilibrium level, the so-called RER misalignment, has shown to produce negative impacts on a country&#x27;s balance of payments. An overvalued RER means that the current RER is above its equilibrium value, whereas an undervalued RER indicates the contrary. Specifically, a prolonged RER overvaluation is widely considered as an early sign of an upcoming crisis, due to the fact that the country becomes vulnerable to both speculative attacks and currency crisis, as happened in Thailand during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. On the other side, a protracted RER undervaluation usually generates pressure on domestic prices, changing the consumers&#x27; consumption incentives and, so, misallocating resources between tradable and non-tradable sectors.

Given that RER misalignment and, in particular overvaluation, can undermine the country&#x27;s export-oriented development strategy, the equilibrium RER measurement is crucial for policymakers. Unfortunately, this variable cannot be observed. The most common method in order to estimate the equilibrium RER is the universally accepted Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory, according to which the RER equilibrium level is assumed to remain constant over time. Nevertheless, the equilibrium RER is not a fixed value as it follows the trend of key economic fundamentals, such as different monetary and fiscal policies or asymmetrical shocks between the home country and abroad. Consequently, the PPP doctrine has been largely debated during the years, given that it may signal a natural RER movement towards its new equilibrium as a RER misalignment.

Starting from the 1980s, in order to overcome the limitations of this approach, many researchers tried to find some alternative equilibrium RER measures. Two of the most popular approaches in the economic literature are the Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER), developed by Williamson (1994), and the Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER), initially estimated by Clark and MacDonald (1998). 
The FEER focuses on long-run determinants of the RER, rather than on short-term cyclical and speculative forces. It represents a RER consistent with macroeconomic balance, characterized by the achievement of internal and external balances at the same time. Internal balance is reached when the level of output is in line with both full employment of all available factors of production, and a low and stable rate of inflation. On the other hand, external balance holds when actual and future CA balances are compatible with long-term sustainable net capital flows. Nevertheless, the FEER is viewed as a normative measure of the RER since it is based on some &quot;ideal&quot; economic conditions related to internal and external balances. Particularly, since the sustainable CA position is defined as an exogenous value, this approach has been broadly questioned over time.
By contrast, the BEER entails an econometric analysis of the RER behaviour, considering significant RER deviations from its PPP equilibrium level as a consequence of changes in key economic fundamentals. According to this method, the BEER is the RER that results when all the economic fundamentals are at their equilibrium values. Therefore, the total RER misalignment is given by the extent to which economic fundamentals differ from their long-run sustainable levels. In short, the BEER is a more general approach than the FEER, since it is not limited to the long-term perspective, being able to explain RER cyclical movements.

==Bilateral vs. effective exchange rate==

Bilateral exchange rate involves a currency pair, while an effective exchange rate is a weighted average of a basket of foreign currencies, and it can be viewed as an overall measure of the country&#x27;s external competitiveness. A nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) is weighted with the inverse of the asymptotic trade weights. A real effective exchange rate (REER) adjusts NEER by appropriate foreign price level and deflates by the home country price level. Compared to NEER, a GDP weighted effective exchange rate might be more appropriate considering the global investment phenomenon.

== Parallel exchange rate ==
In many countries there is a distinction between the official exchange rate for permitted transactions within the country, and a parallel exchange rate (or black market, grey, unregulated, unofficial, etc. exchange rate) that responds to excess demand for foreign currency at the official exchange rate. The degree by which the parallel exchange rate exceeds the official exchange rate is known as the parallel premium. Unofficial transactions of this nature may be illegal.

==Economic models==
===Uncovered interest rate parity model===

Uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) states that an appreciation or depreciation of one currency against another currency might be neutralized by a change in the interest rate differential. If US interest rates increase while Japanese interest rates remain unchanged then the US dollar should depreciate against the Japanese yen by an amount that prevents arbitrage (in reality the opposite, appreciation, quite frequently happens in the short-term, as explained below). The future exchange rate is reflected into the forward exchange rate stated today. In our example, the forward exchange rate of the dollar is said to be at a discount because it buys fewer Japanese yen in the forward rate than it does in the spot rate. The yen is said to be at a premium.

UIRP showed no proof of working after the 1990s. Contrary to the theory, currencies with high interest rates characteristically appreciated rather than depreciated on the reward of the containment of inflation and a higher-yielding currency.

===Balance of payments model===
The balance of payments model holds that foreign exchange rates are at an equilibrium level if they produce a stable Current account (balance of payments)current account balance. A nation with a trade deficit will experience a reduction in its foreign exchange reserves, which ultimately lowers (depreciates) the value of its currency. A cheaper (undervalued) currency renders the nation&#x27;s goods (exports) more affordable in the global market while making imports more expensive. After an intermediate period, imports will be forced down and exports to rise, thus stabilizing the trade balance and bring the currency towards equilibrium.

Like purchasing power parity, the balance of payments model focuses largely on tradeable goods and services, ignoring the increasing role of global capital flows. In other words, money is not only chasing goods and services, but to a larger extent, financial assets such as stocks and bonds. Their flows go into the capital account item of the balance of payments, thus balancing the deficit in the current account. The increase in capital flows has given rise to the asset market model effectively.

===Asset market model===
The increasing volume of trading of financial assets (stocks and bonds) has required a rethink of its impact on exchange rates. Economic variables such as economic growth, inflation and productivity are no longer the only drivers of currency movements. The proportion of foreign exchange transactions stemming from cross border-trading of financial assets has dwarfed the extent of currency transactions generated from trading in goods and services.

The asset market approach views currencies as asset prices traded in an efficient financial market. Consequently, currencies are increasingly demonstrating a strong correlation with other markets, particularly equities.

Like the stock exchange, money can be made (or lost) on trading by investors and speculators in the foreign exchange market. Currencies can be traded at spot and foreign exchange options markets. The represents current exchange rates, whereas options are derivatives of exchange rates.

==Manipulation of exchange rates==
A country may gain an advantage in international trade if it controls the market for its currency to keep its value low, typically by the national central bank engaging in open market operations in the foreign exchange market, or through preventing the exchange of foreign currency for domestic notes. The People&#x27;s Republic of China has been periodically accused of exchange rate manipulation, notably by Donald Trump during his successful campaign for the US presidency.

Other nations, including Iceland, Japan, Brazil, and so on have had a policy of maintaining a low value of their currencies in the hope of reducing the cost of exports and thus bolstering their economies. A lower exchange rate lowers the price of a country&#x27;s goods for consumers in other countries, but raises the price of imported goods and services for consumers in the low value currency country.

This practice is known as &quot;modern mercantilism&quot;, namely lowering the exchange rate below its real and fair price, to increase the competitiveness of trade and exports, and encourage economic growth. Rodrik said that this practice was quite effective in encouraging economic growth in developing countries but at the expense of other deficit countries.

In general, exporters of goods and services will prefer a lower value for their currencies, while importers will prefer a higher value.

<text>Canton of Basel-Stadt or Basel-City ( ; ; ; ) is one of the 26 cantons forming the Swiss Confederation. It is composed of three municipalities with Basel as the capital. It is traditionally considered a &quot;half-canton&quot;, the other half being Basel-Landschaft, its rural counterpart.

Basel-Stadt is one of the northernmost and lowest cantons of Switzerland, and the smallest by area. The canton lies on both sides of the Rhine and is very densely populated. The largest municipality is Basel, followed by Riehen and Bettingen. The only canton sharing borders with Basel-Stadt is Basel-Landschaft to the south. To the north of Basel-Stadt are France and Germany, with the tripoint being in the middle of the Rhine.

Together with Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt was part of the Canton of Basel, which joined the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1501. Political quarrels and armed conflict led to the partition of the canton in 1833.

Basel-Stadt is Switzerland&#x27;s seventh-largest economic centre and has the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva (in 2018). In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City&#x27;s goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighbouring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports.

==History==
The canton of Basel-Stadt was created when the historic canton of Basel was divided in 1833, following political quarrels and armed conflict in the canton. Some of these were concerned with the rights of the population in the agricultural areas. They ultimately led to the separation of the canton of Basel-Landschaft from the city of Basel on 26 August 1833. Since then, there has been a movement for reunification. This movement gained momentum after 1900 when many parts of Basel-Landschaft became industrialized. The two half-cantons agreed in principle to reunite, but in 1969, and again in September 2014, the people of Basel-Landschaft voted against this proposal in favour of retaining their independence.

==Geography==

The canton of Basel-Stadt is located in the north of Switzerland. Basel is located at the so-called &#x27;knee&#x27; of the Rhine, at the point where from the west the little Birsig joins the Rhine from the left, and where the Rhine itself switches from flowing in a westerly direction to a northerly flow. It is the second flattest canton, with a height difference of only 277 metres between the Rhine and St. Chrischona.

Bettingen, Riehen and a part of Basel city lie on the east bank of the Rhine, bordered on three sides by the German state of Baden-Württemberg. The rest of the canton lies on the west bank of the Rhine.

The area of the canton is , making Basel-Stadt the smallest canton in Switzerland. It is sometimes likened to a city-state.

Basel-Stadt borders Basel-Landschaft to the south, the only adjacent canton. To the north, it borders Germany (Baden-Württemberg) and France (Grand Est). The three countries meet in the middle of the Rhine, about 150 metres north of the Dreiländereck monument.

==Municipalities==
There are three municipalities:
==Politics==
The canton of Basel-Stadt shares its political structure and administration with the municipality of Basel.

 is a half-canton. This means that the canton only sends one representative to the Council of States. The capital of the canton is the city of Basel. The present constitution of the canton dates from 1889. In 1966 Basel-Stadt became the first German-speaking canton to allow women to vote, five years before the right to vote was extended to all Swiss women in 1971.

The parliament of the canton is the Grand Council, which has 100 members, who are elected for four years at a time. There are eight different political parties represented in the parliament; the largest party is the Social Democratic Party, with 32 seats.

The executive of the canton (&quot;&quot;) is made up of seven members.

The canton has a sister state status with Massachusetts.

==Demographics==

=== Historical population ===
The historical population is given in the following table:

The population of the canton (as of ) is . , the population included 56,106 foreigners, or about 30.29% of the total population. The population () is nearly evenly split between Roman Catholics (25%) and Protestants (27%). About 10% of the population was classed as adhering to another religion, while 36% did not belong to an organized religion.

==Economy==

The economic area of Basel is considered to be the second largest economic centre in Switzerland, after Zurich.
The chemical industry and the pharmaceutical industry are of greatest significance in the canton. There are a number of multinationals in the city of Basel, attracting workers from both cantons of Basel and the areas across the border in France and Germany. Banking and finance are important as is the service sector in general. Small and middle-sized businesses employ a significant number of people, both in the city as the two municipalities. The canton is also known for its banking sector, and for being the worldwide seat of the Bank for International Settlements.

Economically, the neighbouring lands in Germany and France are not separated from the area of the canton of Basel-Stadt. Good transport links across the border, as well as supportive local governments, facilitate this link.

The fact that three nation-states come together in one spot near Basel (&quot;) helps attract tourists. The site is clearly identified and a popular destination for primary school classes. The carnival attracts a large number of people from across Switzerland and the neighbouring countries.

In 2014, there were 104 workers in Basel-Stadt who worked in the primary sector (the total for all of Switzerland is 3.3%). In the same year the secondary sector employed 36,441 or about 19.0% of the total workforce. Of those in the secondary sector, nearly half of the workers were involved in the production of pharmaceutical products. The tertiary sector employed 154,896 or about 80.9% of the total, which is slightly higher than 74.9% nationwide. Of those in the tertiary sector, health care, education and retail sales made up about a quarter. Some of the other major tertiary fields included job placement (5.1%), management and business consulting (4.1%), public administration (3.9%), architectural and engineering offices (3.7%) and financial services (3.5%).

==Transport==

There is an international airport at Basel-Mulhouse, actually located inside French territory but with customs-free access from the city. The canton is well connected by both trains and motorways to the rest of Switzerland and the neighbouring areas in France and Germany.

Basel is a major railway station of Switzerland, connected to Paris and Berlin with direct fast trains.

There is a port at Basel for ships on the Rhine. This port is of great significance to landlocked Switzerland, as it offers the country&#x27;s only direct connection to the sea. The port benefits from good connections to both rail and road.

==Culture==

The Carnival of Basel (&#x27;) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is one of the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds, despite the fact that many of its central traditions are played out in the early morning starting at 4am (&#x27;) and followed by a continuous run of festivities for 72 hours.

The Autumn Fair in Basel (&quot;) is the biggest in Switzerland.

The canton of Basel is renowned for two of its biscuits. The Basler Läckerli is a hard biscuit made of honey, almonds, candied peel and Kirsch, and is enjoyed as a speciality all year round. The Basler Brunsli is made of almonds and generally enjoyed at Christmas all around Switzerland.

The Basel Messe convention center is the location of several international events. The largest are Art Basel, an art show for modern and contemporary works, and BaselWorld, a major watch and jewellery show.

Famous cultural ambassadors of Basel are the Top Secret Drum Corps and the Basel Boys Choir.

<text>Buttigliera Alta is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Turin about from Turin in the Susa valley in Piedmont, northern Italy. It is not far to Avigliana, of which it once was a part.
==History==
It first became an autonomous fief in 1619 when Giovanni Carron received the fiefs of Buttigliera, Uriola, and Case Nicola - as well as the title of Count - from Duke Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy.

From that point in time the history of Buttigliera was intimately tied with the history of the Carron family. The last member of the family, Clementina Carron, died in April 1912.

In the 20th century, the FIAT group established one of its metallurgical factories in Ferriera, a &quot;frazione&quot; of Buttigliera Alta.

==Main sights==

*The nearby &quot;Sacra di San Michele&quot;. It is located at the entrance to the Susa Valley.
*The preceptory of &quot;Sant&#x27;Antonio di Ranverso&quot;.

==Twin towns==
* Jougne, France

<text>Norman Stewart Hughson Lamont, Baron Lamont of Lerwick, (born 8 May 1942) is a British politician and former Conservative MP for Kingston-upon-Thames. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1990 until 1993. He was created a life peer in 1998. Lamont was a supporter of the Eurosceptic organisation Leave Means Leave.

==Early life==
Norman Stewart Hughson Lamont was born in Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands, on 8 May 1942, where his father Daniel Lamont OBE was the islands&#x27; surgeon. In 1953, he moved south with his parents to Grimsby, Lincolnshire, after his father took up a position at Scartho Road Infirmary. He was privately educated at Loretto School, Musselburgh, Scotland, and read economics at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he was Chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association and President of the Cambridge Union Society in 1964.

==Corporate career==
Before entering Parliament, Lamont worked for N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, the investment bank, and became director of Rothschild Asset Management.

In addition to his role as a working peer, Lamont is currently a director of and a consultant to various companies in the financial sector. He is a director of the hedge fund company RAB Capital, Balli Group plc (commodities trading house), and he is an advisor to Rotch Property Group. He is also a director of a number of investment funds. In December 2008 he joined the board of Phorm, an online behavioural advertising company, and he is a non-executive director of Balli Group PLC and the Honorary President of the British Romanian Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman of the British Iranian Chamber of Commerce.

== Early political career ==
===Member of Parliament===
Lamont stood as a candidate for Member of Parliament in the June 1970 general election for Kingston upon Hull East. He was defeated by John Prescott, who went on to become Tony Blair&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister. Two years later, on 4 May 1972, Lamont won a by-election to become MP for Kingston-upon-Thames.

===Junior Minister===
Lamont served in successive governments under Margaret Thatcher and John Major for a total of 14 years, in the Departments of Energy, Industry, Defence and the Treasury. In 1986, he moved to the Treasury, first as Financial Secretary to the Treasury, then Chief Secretary to the Treasury (succeeding John Major in the latter job on Major&#x27;s promotion to Foreign Secretary in July 1989) under Chancellor Nigel Lawson, whom he tried unsuccessfully to persuade not to resign from the government on the morning of 26 October 1989 – Lawson resigned that evening. Lamont remained as Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Major&#x27;s Chancellorship. In this position, he acquiesced in Major&#x27;s decision to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) at a central parity of 2.95 Deutschmarks to the Pound, although neither he nor any other Cabinet ministers were involved or informed about the decision before it had been made.

The decision to join the ERM was announced on Friday 5 October 1990, the last trading day before the week of the Conservative party conference. Shortly afterwards he successfully managed Major&#x27;s election campaign to succeed Margaret Thatcher as party leader and Prime Minister. In her memoirs, Thatcher listed Lamont along with six other Cabinet ministers as a potential successor to her.
During the leadership election, Lamont clashed angrily in private with Lawson who preferred Michael Heseltine as Thatcher&#x27;s successor, phoning Lawson up to remind him of his caustic remarks made about Heseltine&#x27;s economic policies. Lamont eventually slammed the phone down on Lawson in temper, though he later wrote to Lawson to offer an apology.

On 16 May 1991, Lamont stated in parliament that &quot;Rising unemployment and the recession have been the price that we have had to pay to get inflation down. That price is well worth paying.&quot; The remark is regularly, but not always approvingly, recalled by commentators and other politicians. Seven months before Lamont made the statement, inflation (as measured by the annual change in the Retail Price Index) reached 10.9%. In May 1991, inflation fell to 6.4%. A year after the Major government was reelected in the 1992 general election, winning the most votes of any political party in British electoral history, inflation fell to 4.3%, falling to 1.3% a year later. However the economy continued to contract until the third quarter of 1991. After economic growth resumed, the economy grew rapidly and by the third quarter of 1993, GDP was greater than the pre-recession peak in the second quarter of 1990.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
Lamont replaced Major as Chancellor in Major&#x27;s new Cabinet, thereby inheriting Major&#x27;s exchange rate policy. In his memoirs, Lamont recalls a senior Treasury civil servant answering his question on why Britain had joined the ERM by replying, &quot;It&#x27;s politics,&quot; to which Lamont replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would have given up the flexibility of the exchange rate.&quot; In public, Lamont justified the decision to join the ERM in terms of the government&#x27;s counter-inflation strategy. In the House of Commons debate shortly after the pound joined the ERM, he argued that under a regime of floating exchange rates, the consequences of depreciating the currency had been short-lived in terms of output and competitiveness, &quot;but have been lasting in terms of inflation. That is one of the reasons why the Government concluded that it would be right to join the ERM.&quot;

=== Fiscal policy ===
By the time Lamont was appointed Chancellor, the Conservative government&#x27;s principal economic objective was to regain control of inflation. The Thatcher government had been elected in 1979 on a manifesto that had listed restoration of sound money as its first priority. Having peaked at 21.9% in 1980, inflation (as measured by the 12-month increase in the Retail Prices Index) fell to 3.3% at the beginning of 1988. However, controlling inflation through the targeting of the growth of the domestic money supply, as proposed in that manifesto, turned out to be more problematic than its authors had envisaged and during his time as Chancellor, Lawson had increasingly been drawn instead to targeting the exchange rate to provide an external monetary anchor. From its low point in February 1988, inflation rose with apparent inexorability: of the 31 months until it peaked at 10.9% in October 1990, there were only four months when inflation fell. In response, interest rates were progressively increased, doubling from 7.4% in June 1988 to 15% in October 1988, being cut by one point to 14% when the pound entered the ERM, the level of interest rates Lamont inherited as chancellor. As a result, the economy began to slow, contracting by 1.1% in the third quarter of 1990 and shrinking a further 0.7% in the final quarter of the year. Thus Lamont&#x27;s period as Chancellor started with inflation at its highest level since 1982 and the economy in recession.

Asked at his first appearance as chancellor at the Treasury Select Committee whether he agreed with his predecessor&#x27;s view on the depth and duration of the recession and not wishing to contradict Major, Lamont replied that &quot;there are reasons why one could believe that it will be relatively short-lived and relatively shallow.&quot; In October 1991, based on CBI and Institute of Directors business surveys, he said &quot;what we are seeing is the return of that vital ingredient – confidence. The Green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again.&quot; The comment was widely criticised as premature. However, Gavyn Davies, then chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a newspaper article at the time of Lamont&#x27;s removal from the Treasury that the &quot;Green shoots&quot; speech had turned out to be &quot;remarkably prescient. From that moment onwards, output stopped declining, and within a few months, it started to rise. Estimates of Gross Domestic Product show the trough of the recession occurring in the fourth quarter of 1991, with sustained growth resuming in the third quarter of 1992, when GDP grew 0.4% compared to the second quarter.

===Negotiating the Maastricht Treaty===
On succeeding Thatcher, the Major government had to decide its position on the negotiations on European Economic and monetary union (EMU); this would lead to the Maastricht Treaty. It had been Thatcher&#x27;s opposition to EMU which triggered the end of her premiership. Like Thatcher, Lamont was a long-standing opponent of EMU and the European single currency. In his memoirs, Lamont wrote that he was &quot;horrified&quot; when Ted Heath in 1972 announced Britain that it was accepting the Werner Plan for monetary union. Newly appointed as Chancellor, Lamont therefore supported Major&#x27;s idea of Britain negotiating an opt-out from the single currency. Negotiations on the economic aspects of the proposed treaty began in earnest at the end of 1990 with monthly meetings of European finance ministers. At an Intergovernmental Conference held in Rome on 15 December 1990, Lamont declared, &quot;I remain unconvinced that the potential benefits of a single currency are as great as its supporters allege.&quot;

In a minute to the Cabinet&#x27;s Defence and Overseas Policy committee the following month, Lamont set out his three objectives for the negotiations: first, to ensure that Britain did not have to join the single currency; second, to ensure the opt-out was legally water-tight; and third, to ensure that during the period in the run-up to the single currency, there should be no binding obligations on Britain. In meeting the third of these, Lamont had to overcome the resistance of the prime minister and the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, who told Lamont: &quot;I can&#x27;t see what you are so worked up about. We are in the ERM. What difference does it make if it is in the Treaty?&quot; Lamont decided to ignore their objections. At the next negotiating meeting on the treaty, he told his fellow European finance ministers that Britain would not accept membership of the ERM as a treaty obligation. As a result, the meeting agreed to remove it.

Lamont decided that the best way of securing the first two of his negotiating objectives was for Britain to draw up a protocol listing those parts of the treaty from which Britain would be exempted. When Wim Kok, the Dutch finance minister chairing the finance ministers&#x27; negotiations at Maastricht, decided that the meeting should review the British opt-out line-by-line, Lamont said the text was not negotiable. After Kok persevered, Lamont walked out of the meeting. In his absence, the protocol was endorsed without amendment.

===Exchange Rate Mechanism exit===
Within the constraints of the ERM, sterling interest rates were cut seven times in 1991, falling from 14% to 10.5% in September, with inflation halving from 9.0% to 4.5% over the course of the year, leaving real interest rates just 0.5% lower. The scope for swifter cuts in interest rates was squeezed by an event that few had anticipated when Britain joined the ERM: based on OECD indices of consumer prices, inflation in Germany, which had been 2.7% in 1990, rose to 5.1% in 1992, whilst in Britain inflation fell from 7.0% to 4.3%. In response, the Bundesbank increased its discount rate from 6.0% in 1990 to 8.75% in July 1992, creating the conditions for the turbulence the ERM was to experience later that autumn.

Despite the Conservatives&#x27; surprise victory in the April 1992 general election, for these reasons, the ERM policy proved increasingly unsustainable and collapsed on Black Wednesday, when Lamont was forced to withdraw the pound from the ERM despite assuring the public that he would not do so just a week earlier. He faced fierce criticism at the time for his apparent insouciance in the face of the collapse of the stated central plank of his economic policy. Later that month, at a press conference in the garden of the British embassy in Washington, DC in response to a question as to why he appeared so cheerful, Lamont commented that it was a beautiful morning, adding, &quot;My wife said she heard me singing in the bath this morning,&quot; a response which led to the story that he was singing in the bath with happiness at leaving the ERM. After Major left office and published his memoirs, Lamont publicly denied Major&#x27;s version of events, claiming that Major had effectively opted out of his responsibilities and left Lamont to carry the can for that day&#x27;s actions. On the evening of Black Wednesday and for days after, Major contemplated resigning, drafting a statement to that effect, but wrote Lamont a note instructing him not to resign.

Major&#x27;s verdict on the ERM was that it was the medicine that cured Britain of inflation; &quot;it hurt but it worked.&quot; Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that &quot;the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw.&quot; Lamont&#x27;s view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain&#x27;s inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain&#x27;s membership was undoubtedly correct; &quot;the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do.&quot; Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury&#x27;s Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain&#x27;s membership of the ERM, has written, &quot;although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance.&quot;

During the autumn of 1992, Lamont became a press target in a string of largely fabricated stories: that he had not paid his hotel bill for &quot;champagne and large breakfasts&quot; from the Conservative Party Conference (in fact his bill had been forwarded on for settlement); that he was in arrears on his personal Access credit card bill (true); that in June 1991 he had used taxpayers&#x27; money to handle the fall-out from press stories concerning a sex therapist, who was using a flat he owned (the Treasury contributed £4,700 of the £23,000 bill which had been formally approved by the Head of the Civil Service and the Prime Minister; there was never any suggestion that he had ever met her); and that he had called at a newsagent in a seedy area of Paddington late at night to purchase champagne and cheap &quot;Raffles&quot; cigarettes. The last story turned out to have been partly invented (Lamont only purchased three bottles of wine).

===Post-ERM chancellorship===
Following Britain&#x27;s exit from the ERM, Lamont had two major tasks: to replace the ERM with a new framework for monetary policy, and to address the sharp increase in government borrowing caused by the recession and the rapid fall in inflation. In a letter to the Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee in October 1992, Lamont set out a new basis for the conduct of monetary policy centred on inflation targeting. He set a target range for inflation excluding mortgage interest rate payments of 1–4%, falling into the lower part of the range by the end of the Parliament. In assessing progress toward meeting the inflation target, there was a target for the growth of narrow money (M0) and monitoring ranges for the growth of broad money (M4). Decisions on interest rates would also take account of house and asset price inflation and the exchange rate. Transparency and market credibility would be enhanced by the publication of a monthly monetary assessment and the Bank of England was asked to produce a quarterly inflation report. These innovations marked a decisive break with the past and a necessary step toward central bank independence. Inflation targeting was the basis on which the Bank of England was made independent by the Blair government in 1997, the Bank&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee being made accountable for achieving the government&#x27;s inflation target.

The new framework enabled interest rates to be cut from the 10% that they had been within the ERM to 6% by January 1993. Inflation continued to fall. In June 1993, the first month after Lamont had left the Treasury, Britain recorded its lowest monthly rate of inflation since February 1964. According to Alan Budd, the Treasury&#x27;s Chief Economic Adviser during the period, the important step of central bank independence could only have been successful once monetary stability had been achieved; &quot;In 1997 the Bank of England was not asked to succeed where politicians had failed; it was asked to maintain the rate of inflation, namely 2.5%, that it inherited.&quot; In Budd&#x27;s view, the essential elements of the new framework and its success in achieving low and stable inflation were the establishment of an inflation target and the institution of monthly meetings with the governor of the Bank of England to discuss interest rates. The new framework, according to Budd, &quot;worked extraordinarily well.&quot; &quot;Credit must be given to those, principally Norman Lamont, who designed and implemented it.&quot;

Lamont&#x27;s second task was to reduce government borrowing, which was rising sharply because of the twofold impact of the ERM on the public finances. The loss of output had reduced tax revenues and increased public spending as unemployment rose. The sharp falls in inflation further reduced tax revenues compared to previous forecasts at the same time as increasing public spending after inflation, because public spending is planned in cash terms which becomes worth more in real terms if inflation falls. The March 1993 budget forecast a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993-94 of £50bn, equivalent to 8% of GDP. In terms of the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, the definition currently in use to measure the UK government deficit, the actual deficit for 1993–94 of 6.9% was the highest since 1975–76 at 9.2% but just over half the 13.3% deficit projected for 2009–10 in the April 2009 budget.

To reduce government borrowing, the March 1993 budget announced a rising wedge of tax increases – £0.5bn in the first year, £6.7bn in the second, rising to £10.3bn in the third, the aim being to give markets confidence that government borrowing was under control without damaging the recovery. Although the budget provoked a fierce reaction in some parts of the press, its reputation improved with the passage of time. After the 2009 budget, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editorialised that Lamont&#x27;s budget had been so badly received that he was out of his job within two months, &quot;but it fixed the public finances and set up the prosperity of the 1990s and beyond&quot; and Derek Scott, Tony Blair&#x27;s economic adviser from 1997 to 2003, wrote that Lamont was &quot;rightly praised&quot; for putting in place the post-ERM framework, that stage of Lamont&#x27;s career being &quot;due for rerating since, in addition to designing a proper framework for monetary policy (later consolidated by Bank of England independence in 1997), he also took most of the tough decisions on spending and tax to put the public finances on the road to recovery.&quot; Sir Alan Walters, whose opposition to the ERM as Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s economic adviser triggered Nigel Lawson&#x27;s resignation as chancellor, wrote on the buoyant state of the British economy in 2001 that &quot;all the difficult and correct decisions that produced this happy state of affairs were taken and implemented by Norman Lamont, who thus showed himself, in his Mark 2 post ERM version, to be not only the most effective but also the bravest Chancellor since the War.&quot;

===Resignation ===
During the Newbury by-election in May 1993, Lamont was asked at a press conference whether he most regretted claiming to see &quot;the green shoots of recovery&quot; or &quot;singing in his bath&quot;. He replied by quoting the Édith Piaf song &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot;, a dry response which raised a laugh at the press conference but which played poorly when quoted later on the television that evening and afterwards. When called to defend him on &quot;Newsnight&quot; his friend the former Labour MP Woodrow Wyatt caused further merriment by claiming that Lamont could do an excellent impersonation of a Scops owl (whose cry, Lamont later explained, &quot;sounds like a tennis ball emitter&quot;).

Three weeks after the government&#x27;s massive loss in the by-election, on 27 May 1993, Lamont was sacked (technically resigning from the government because he declined a demotion to become Secretary of State for the Environment), throwing (by his own account) Major&#x27;s letter of regret at his departure unopened into the wastepaper basket, and giving a resignation speech in the House of Commons on 9 June, that made clear his feeling that he had been unfairly treated, saying that the government &quot;gives the impression of being in office but not in power&quot;; the then Party Chairman Norman Fowler dismissed the speech as &quot;dud, nasty, ludicrous and silly&quot;. Major and Lamont agree that Lamont had offered his resignation immediately after Black Wednesday and that Major pressed him to remain in office. Lamont came to the view that Major had sought his survival in office as a firebreak against the criticism of the ERM policy rebounding on himself.

== Post-chancellorship==
In the following years, Lamont became a fierce critic of the Major government. He is now regarded as a staunch euro-sceptic. In March 1995 he voted with the Labour Party in a vote on Europe, and later that year he authored &quot;Sovereign Britain&quot; in which he envisaged Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union, and was talked of as a potential leadership challenger to John Major; in the event, it was John Redwood who challenged for the leadership. Lamont supported Redwood&#x27;s campaign, which was managed by David Evans MP. He is the current vice president of the euro-sceptic Bruges Group.

Despite departing under a cloud, Lamont defends his budget record to this day. The 1991 budget, in which he seized the opportunity presented by Thatcher&#x27;s resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the basic rate of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in &quot;The Economist&quot; which dubbed him a &quot;Nimble Novice&quot;. In the 1992 budget, his proposal to advance to a 20% basic rate of income tax through a combination of a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson&#x27;s view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major&#x27;s 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.

The day after his dismissal from the Treasury, Sir Samuel Brittan wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that history was likely to record him as one of the better Chancellors, citing his structural reforms of taxation, his determination to give priority to securing and maintaining low inflation and the delayed tax increases in his final budget. &quot;He leaves behind an economy with a faster growth rate than that of any other of the main G7 countries and an underlying rate of inflation lower than in most.&quot; According to Ruth Lea, writing 12 years later on the factors behind the subsequent performance of the British economy, Lamont had introduced path-breaking macro-economic reforms including inflation targeting and the first steps towards an independent Bank of England and had begun a programme of fiscal consolidation, which transformed the public finances. &quot;These macro economic reforms, along with the Thatcher economic reforms of the 1980s, effectively transformed the British economy.&quot;

=== Brexit ===
In the period after his resignation, Lamont became the first leading politician to raise the prospect of Britain withdrawing from the European Union. Shortly before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, the journalist Matthew d&#x27;Ancona wrote that someone must have dared to make the initial leap to retrieve the &quot;frozen thesis&quot; from its glacial prison. &quot;In the case of Brexit, it was Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who dragged the idea back from the snowy wastes.&quot;

At a private meeting of the Conservative Philosophy Group in 1994, he argued that withdrawal from the European Union was an option that should be restored to the range of serious possibilities, d&#x27;Ancona, who attended the meeting, wrote. Later that year at the Conservative Party conference in Bournemouth, Lamont addressed a fringe meeting of the Selsdon Group. &quot;When we come to examine the advantages of our membership today of the European Union they are remarkably elusive. As a former Chancellor, I can only say that I cannot pinpoint a single concrete advantage that unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership of the European Union,&quot; Lamont told the group. He rejected the argument made by Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, who had claimed that the debate in Europe was turning Britain&#x27;s way. &quot;We deceive the British people and we deceive ourselves if we claim that we are winning the argument in Europe ... There is not a shred of evidence at Maastricht or since then that anyone accepts our view of Europe.&quot;

Lamont implicitly challenged the view expressed by John Major, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom: &quot;It has recently been said that the option of leaving the Community was &#x27;unthinkable.&#x27; I believe that this attitude is rather simplistic.&quot; He stopped short of arguing Britain should unilaterally withdraw from the European Union &quot;today,&quot; but warned: &quot;the issue may well return to the political agenda.&quot; Instead, he outlined an alternative to membership of a federal EU. &quot;This means looking at all the options ranging from membership of an outer tier to participating solely in the European Economic Area. One day it may mean contemplating withdrawal.&quot;

===1997 election===
In boundary changes enacted for the 1997 general election, Lamont&#x27;s constituency of Kingston upon Thames was split up. The northern parts were merged with Richmond and Barnes to form Richmond Park, and the southern parts merged with the larger Surbiton to form Kingston and Surbiton. Lamont lost the contest for the candidacy for the new seat to the incumbent Surbiton MP Richard Tracey. He then embarked on a high-profile search for a new constituency and was eventually adopted as the Conservative candidate for the new seat of Harrogate and Knaresborough in Yorkshire. The move was seen as an attempt to parachute in an outsider, with Lamont seeming like an opportunist next to the Liberal Democrat candidate, Phil Willis, a local teacher and long-time local politician. When the general election came, his unpopularity, and that of the Conservatives in general, led a massive tactical voting campaign in the constituency and the Liberal Democrats won the seat. He was not recommended for a peerage in John Major&#x27;s resignation honours, but the following year William Hague recommended him, and Lamont was made a life peer as Baron Lamont of Lerwick, of Lerwick in the Shetland Islands, on 24 July 1998.

===After Parliament===
In 1998, the former military dictator of Chile, General Augusto Pinochet visited Britain to obtain medical treatment. This prompted a debate about whether he should be arrested and put on trial over his human rights record. Lamont joined with Margaret Thatcher in defending Pinochet, calling him a &quot;good and brave and honourable soldier&quot;. His stance was highly criticised.

He attempted to be selected as a candidate for the 1999 European Parliament election, but was unsuccessful.

In February 2005, it was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that Lamont and John Major had held up the release of papers concerning Black Wednesday under the Freedom of Information Act. The two wrote to the paper to deny the reports. Later it emerged that the source of the story had been Damian McBride, then a Treasury civil servant who as a result of this became a special adviser to the then Chancellor, Gordon Brown. McBride in 2009 resigned from a similar position in 10 Downing Street following publication of emails indicating a plan to smear leading Conservative politicians.

In October 2006, he complained that the new party leader David Cameron (Lamont&#x27;s political adviser around the time of Black Wednesday) lacked policies. In late 2008, Cameron asked Lamont, together with fellow former chancellors Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson and Kenneth Clarke, to provide him with strategic political and economic advice as Britain&#x27;s banking and fiscal position worsened.

In June 2007, Lamont became honorary patron of the Oxford University History Society, one of the university&#x27;s largest societies, and he was, from 1996 to 2008, chairman of Le Cercle, a secret anti-Communist group which meets bi-annually in Washington, DC. In 2008, he became the president of the Economic Research Council, Britain&#x27;s oldest economics-based think tank.

In February 2015, Lamont resigned as a director of Phorm Corporation Limited, an internet personalisation technology company.

Yanis Varoufakis said Lamont provided him with &quot;counsel&quot;, and &quot;advice&quot; and was &quot;a pillar of strength&quot; while he unsuccessfully negotiated Debt relief with the troika during his six months as Greek Finance Minister in 2015.

<text>Fitzwilliam College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge.

The college traces its origins back to 1869 and the foundation of the Non-Collegiate Students Board, a venture intended to offer academically excellent students of all backgrounds a chance to study at the university. The institution was originally based at Fitzwilliam Hall (later renamed Fitzwilliam House), opposite the Fitzwilliam Museum in south-west Cambridge. Having moved to its present site in the north of the city, Fitzwilliam attained collegiate status in 1966. Female undergraduates were first admitted in 1978, around the time most colleges were first admitting women.

Fitzwilliam is now home to around 500 undergraduates, 400 graduate students and 90 fellows. By overall student numbers, it was the seventh-largest college in Cambridge as of 2018/19.

Notable alumni of Fitzwilliam College include six Nobel laureates, a large number of prominent academics, public officials, businesspeople, clergy and athletes, three heads of state or government, one current UK Supreme Court Justice, and a significant number of political figures including a former Liberal Democrats leader, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and two former Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police.

==History==


===Foundation===
In 1869, Cambridge University altered its statutes to allow men who were not members of a college to become members of the university under the supervision of a censor, whose office was in Trumpington Street, opposite the Fitzwilliam Museum, founded in 1816 under the will of Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam (1745–1816). This provided students who could not afford to belong to a college with a base from which to study at the university, allowing them to be admitted to degrees, sit examinations and compete for scholarships. The name &quot;Fitzwilliam&quot; was chosen by the students at a meeting of the Non-Collegiate Amalgamation Club in 1887 and, as a result, the university decreed that the house in Trumpington Street could be known as Fitzwilliam Hall. The coat of arms of the new establishment appropriated the arms of the Fitzwilliam family (&quot;lozengy argent and gules&quot;), to which it had no connection, and added as a chief the arms of Cambridge University.
Fitzwilliam Hall became the headquarters of the Non-Collegiate Students Board and provided student facilities and limited accommodation. It was renamed Fitzwilliam House in 1922.

Due to its emphasis on academic ability rather than wealth, Fitzwilliam quickly attracted a strong academic contingent that included future Nobel Prize winners, Heads of State and important judicial figures. It developed a tradition in Medicine and established a reputation as one of the most internationally diverse institutions within the university.

In the second half of the 20th century, the availability of grants made Cambridge more accessible and the need for a non-collegiate body of undergraduates began to decline. The suggestion that Fitzwilliam close prompted an outcry from former students and it was therefore decided that it should aim for collegiate status. Funds were accumulated and a new site was acquired at Castle Hill, about one mile north of the city centre. The first new buildings were opened in 1963.

In 1966, Fitzwilliam House was granted a royal charter by the Queen-in-Council and became Fitzwilliam College.

===Expansion===
Since Fitzwilliam began operating at its current site in the north-west of Cambridge, it has grown steadily and developed into one of the university&#x27;s larger, more cosmopolitan colleges. Built around a regency manor house, the college has grown by one or two buildings each decade and now consists of five interconnected courts, enclosing large, rectangular gardens. In contrast to most of the university, and indeed the regency estate at the college&#x27;s centre, the majority of the buildings are of modern design.

The first two courts and the central building (comprising, among other things, the rooms formerly belonging to the old library, the dining hall, the junior common room and the bar) were designed by Sir Denys Lasdun and completed in 1963. The intention was for these buildings to constitute the back of the college and, as funding became available, the college grew to the south, with New Court (1985), the Chapel (1991) and Wilson Court (1994). Finally, the plan was completed when Gatehouse Court (2003) became the college&#x27;s new front. In the following year, the college completed the new Auditorium building, and in doing so became home to some of the best performance facilities in the university.

In 2007 the college built a new boathouse on the River Cam, in 2009 the Library and IT Centre was added and, in 2010, the college acquired the buildings and grounds that formerly belonged to the Cambridge Lodge Hotel with the intention of renovating them for the use of graduate students.

Fitzwilliam has, over the years, also become known for its beautiful gardens, which largely predate the college. In 2008, an archaeological dig discovered on the college site the earliest clear evidence of settlement in Cambridge, the remains of a 3,500-year-old farmstead.

Fitzwilliam was the third Cambridge college and is, as of today, one of only seven to have won &quot;University Challenge&quot;. It did so in 1973 with a team that consisted of Philip Bassett (Botany), David Curry (Material Sciences), David Wurtzel (Law) and Michael Halls (English). The same team featured in the 2002 Reunited Series and won its only game, which was against a team from neighbouring college Churchill, winner of the 1970 series.

==Buildings and grounds==
The main grounds of the college are located off Storey&#x27;s Way, towards the north-west of Cambridge. The college is sometimes identified as one of the Hill Colleges, together with Churchill College, St Edmund&#x27;s College, Girton College and Murray Edwards College. These colleges are all among the most recently established and tend to share certain architectural features.

Fitzwilliam consists of a variety of modern buildings, built in the grounds of a regency estate. The Central Hall Building, New Court and Chapel became Grade II listed buildings in 2024.

===The Grove (1813)===
The college&#x27;s centrepiece is the Grove, a Grade II regency manor house, designed by the architect William Custance and constructed in 1813. Custance was also the house&#x27;s first resident and his initials, along with the date &#x27;1814&#x27;, can be found on a rainwater hopper at the side of the house.

Another slightly smaller building known as Grove Lodge was also designed by Custance and is now part of Murray Edwards College. For some time, both properties were owned by the Darwin family and the Grove served as Emma Darwin&#x27;s primary residence between 1883 and 1896, following the death of her husband Charles. During this time, she had the interior lined with original William Morris wallpaper and two of her sons had smaller houses built in the grounds. Although both have since been demolished, the house built by Horace Darwin, which was known as the Orchard, was donated to Murray Edwards College in 1962 and the site now serves as its primary campus. In 1988, the Grove became part of Fitzwilliam and today it is home to the Senior Tutor&#x27;s office and various multi-purpose rooms, as well as the Middle and Senior Common Rooms.

===The Hall Building (1963)===
The Hall Building is a large complex towards the back of the college. It was built between 1960 and 1963 and was designed by Sir Denys Lasdun, who won Royal Gold Medal in 1977 and is best known for having designed the National Theatre in London. The building consists primarily of the college dining hall, but also houses the bar, kitchens, the junior common room, a couple of seminar rooms and a music room. The dinner gong, just outside the dining hall, was originally the bell of the aircraft carrier HMS Ocean, and was presented to Fitzwilliam House by Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John in 1962.

===Fellows&#x27; Court (1963)===
Like the Hall Building, Fellows&#x27; Court was part of the initial construction, designed by Sir Denys Lasdun and completed in 1963 at a cost of approximately £300,000. It occupies an area in the far corner of the college and is enclosed by the Hall Building, the Law Library and two dormitories. It is generally reserved for fellows, and, as well as residence, housed the Fellows&#x27; Parlour.

===Tree Court (1963)===

Tree Court, the last component of the initial 1963 construction, is located at the north end of the college, opposite Fellows&#x27; Court. The court was initially the college&#x27;s main entrance and, with a car park and a cycling bay just outside, it remains a back door to the college. Tree Court was Lasdun&#x27;s first student accommodation; he would go on to design similar buildings at the University of East Anglia and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Although the court opens out onto the college gardens, the wall opposite the Hall Building was recently lengthened with the addition of the college&#x27;s new Library and IT Centre. Today, Tree Court provides residence for the majority of first-year students.

===New Court (1985)===
In the mid-eighties, the college expanded to the south with the construction of New Court, a three-walled residential compound, designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. Students and fellows contributed to the design with such ideas as intersecting staircases and elongated windows. The building won 1989 David Urwin Award for Best New Building.

In 2004, the court gained its fourth wall with the completion of the college&#x27;s new auditorium.
===The Chapel (1991)===
In 1991, a college chapel was appended to the north wing of New Court. The building, which was also designed by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, faces directly towards the Grove and is in the International style. It is designed to resemble the hull of a ship, hinting at the religious themes of journey and protection. The building is home to a fine two-manual organ designed by Peter Collins, a Bechstein grand piano and a Goble harpsichord. The addition won the 1992 Civic Trust Award, the 1993 Carpenters&#x27; Award and the 1993 David Urwin Award for Best New Building. The firm later used a similar design for the Ruskin Library at the University of Lancaster.
===Wilson Court (1994)===
The fourth court was added to the south of the college, next to the boundary with Murray Edwards, in 1994. It was designed by van Heyningen and Haward Architects and includes 48 acoustically independent student bedrooms, three seminar rooms, a large common room with a bar and the Gordon Cameron Lecture Theatre, which is also used as the college cinema. It won the 1996 RIBA Award.
===Gatehouse Court (2003)===
The completion of Gatehouse Court in 2003 saw the realisation of Sir Denys Lasdun&#x27;s original vision. The design, courtesy of Allies &amp; Morrison, reorientated the college by giving it a new entrance, complete with Porter&#x27;s Lodge, administrative offices, meeting rooms, parking facilities, a large-scale engraving of the college crest and a flagpole. It also provided an extra 42 en suite bedrooms for student accommodation. The college now faces south and opens onto Storey&#x27;s Way, a smaller, primarily residential, street branching off Madingley Road; in 2021 it was reported to be the most expensive street in East Anglia.

This development expanded the college&#x27;s main site dramatically and the quality of the design was recognised with the award of the 2005 RIBA Award and the 2005 BDA Award for Building of the Year.

===Auditorium (2004)===
The Auditorium building was completed in 2004. Having overseen the construction of Gatehouse Court, Allies &amp; Morrison were employed to design the college&#x27;s new performance facilities. Built using a similar brick to that used for the Grove almost 200 years earlier, the building is largely below ground-level, resulting in a direct view of the surrounding landscape for audience members towards the back of the gallery. It won the 2005 Concrete Society Award and the 2005 BDA Award for Best Public Building.

Located near the front of the college, the building faces New Court and backs onto the college gardens. Consisting of a large central performance area, three smaller practice rooms and an entrance hall, the auditorium is the official home of the Fitzwilliam Quartet.

The main hall, which has been praised for its acoustics, houses a Steinway grand piano, and a tympani, a full-size drum kit, amplifiers and a Bösendorfer piano for student use. Although used primarily for music, the building has also hosted drama performances and important lectures.

In recent years, guest speakers have included the American politician Jesse Jackson, former poet laureate Sir Andrew Motion, and the former head of MI6 Sir Richard Dearlove, who visited the college as part of the Arrol Adam Lecture Series in 2008.

===The Olisa Library (2009)===

A new library and IT centre was completed in 2009. As of January 2010, its book collection contains around 60,000 volumes and increases by about 1,000 volumes each year. At a cost of £5m, the building was designed by Edward Cullinan, who had worked with Lasdun on the original college plan, and who was undertaking his first major project after receiving the Royal Gold Medal in 2008. It was built as an extension to the uncompleted east wing of Tree Court and was designed to allow maximum luminosity and energy efficiency.

The building, opened in April 2010 by the Duke of Edinburgh, is also fitted with extensive computing facilities and includes separate underground computer rooms for undergraduates and postgraduates. In 2011, alumnus Ken Olisa donated £1.4m to the development of the Library and IT Centre. In tribute to this generosity, the building was named the Olisa Library. Unlike most college libraries, it is open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

Because Fitzwilliam is at the top of one of the few hills in Cambridge, the Olisa Library&#x27;s tower is one of the highest points in the city, sometimes said to be the highest.

==Heritage==

===Name===

The name of the college refers ultimately to the Fitzwilliam family, prominent members of the Anglo-Irish nobility, whose ancestral seat Milton Hall is located to the north of Cambridge and who, as students and benefactors, have been associated with the university for several hundred years; more directly, it refers to the Fitzwilliam Museum, founded in 1816 with the bequest of the library, art collection and personal fortune of the 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam and situated directly opposite the original headquarters of the Non-Collegiate Students Board, and also to the adjacent Fitzwilliam Street, where many of the non-collegiate students were housed.

===Coat of arms===
Along with the name, the college&#x27;s coat of arms first came into use in the 1880s when Fitzwilliam Hall needed an emblem to represent its newly formed boat club. The result was a combination between the university coat of arms and the lozengy shield used by the Earls of Fitzwilliam. Initially, the design was used unofficially and it was only when Fitzwilliam was in the process of attaining collegiate status, some 80 years later, that it actually applied for a grant of arms. The design was formally recorded by the Duke of Norfolk on behalf of the Queen-in-Council in the late 60s. Notably, the Fitzwilliam coat of arms is the only college emblem to reference the university&#x27;s own coat of arms.

====Motto====
The college motto is: &quot;Ex antiquis et novissimis optima&quot; (&quot;the best of the old and the new&quot;). The motto has since been adopted by the nearby village of Hardwick and is very similar to that of St Catherine&#x27;s College, Oxford, which was established with aims very similar to those with which Fitzwilliam was.

===Colours===

The earliest records of the college&#x27;s sporting clubs describe the colours as &#x27;grey and ruby&#x27;. By Easter 1892, the colours were more closely defined as &#x27;cardinal and French grey&#x27;. Since then various shades have been used, although the Middle Combination Room&#x27;s ties, which celebrate the 1869 foundation, have reverted to cardinal as their main colour. Today, the college is firmly associated with the colours grey and dark red, although they were at one time &#x27;blue and buff&#x27;, with blue remaining the principal colour of some sporting blazers right up until the 1960s.

Students from Fitzwilliam are sometimes informally referred to as &quot;Fitzbillys&quot; or &quot;Billygoats&quot;. As a consequence, the goat has become a popular college mascot and the image of a goat can be found on the front of the boat house, on the boat club flag, and in various places around the college.

==Academic reputation==
Between 1997 and 2006, Fitzwilliam achieved an average of 17th place, near the bottom of the second third, in the Tompkins Table which lists the university&#x27;s 29 undergraduate colleges in order of their students&#x27; examination performances. In the last decade, between 2007 and 2016, Fitzwilliam averaged 21st place, near the top of the bottom third. 

The college places an increasing emphasis on Natural Sciences, with students of the discipline accounting for approximately 20% of its undergraduate intake, and has developed traditional strengths in both Music and Politics; in 2010, there were more Fitzwilliam graduates in Parliament than graduates of any other college (6 MPs and 4 life peers). Additionally, Geography students have represented a disproportionately-high presence across generations of Fitzwilliam&#x27;s undergraduate cohort, with the college hosting a unique annual taster day in reflection of this disciplinary strength.

Fitzwilliam is also home to a noted Criminology department, headed by Emeritus Professor Sir Anthony Bottoms and the former College Master Professor Nicola Padfield, and is one of the two colleges (the other being Wolfson) that takes in postgraduate students, in association with the Institute of Criminology, as part of the Police Executive Programme. As a consequence, many prominent figures in Britain&#x27;s police force are associated with Fitzwilliam.

==Wealth==
With, as of 2019, fixed assets worth slightly more than £144m and an endowment of just under £60m, Fitzwilliam is broadly average in terms of college wealth. It is the wealthiest college to have been established (as a college) in the second half of the twentieth century.

==Student life==

Former pupils of state schools usually comprise around 70–75% of the college&#x27;s undergraduate population. However, as many of these are either overseas students or from provincial grammar schools and leading comprehensive schools, membership is a lot more diverse than the figures may suggest.

Fitzwilliam has no distinct political leaning and has, in recent years, produced prominent members of all three major national parties.

=== Sport ===
Fitzwilliam enjoys a very strong sporting reputation and is traditionally strong in football, rugby union and table tennis. In 2017, Fitzwilliam became the first college in CUAFL history to win all 4 major university men&#x27;s football titles in one season, with Fitzwilliam&#x27;s women&#x27;s side winning their league simultaneously. As of 2021, Fitzwilliam are the reigning Men&#x27;s Football Cuppers Champions, having won the last five years in a row.

On site, the college has a multi-gym in the Hall Building, a badminton court in the Auditorium Building and three Squash courts, which are also used for table tennis, in a separate sports hall towards the front of the college.

The college&#x27;s main sports grounds are located on Oxford Road, just a few minutes&#x27; walk from the college&#x27;s Huntingdon Road entrance. The land was donated to Fitzwilliam Hall in honour of the students who died in the First World War. The grounds include tennis courts, a netball court, a cricket pitch, a rugby pitch, and both full-size and five-a-side football pitches. It is the only sports ground in the university with an on-site club house, complete with a bar. It&#x27;s regularly used by varsity teams and is also made available to students of Murray Edwards College.

In 2007, the college completed its new boat house, home to Fitzwilliam College Boat Club.

===Music===

In recent years, Fitzwilliam has developed a strong musical tradition. Former students include composer and Master of the King&#x27;s Music Sir Walford Davies, award-winning conductor David Atherton, the TV and radio presenter Humphrey Burton, music broadcasting executive Sonita Alleyne and singer-songwriter Nick Drake, who secured a record deal with a four-track demo recorded in his college room in 1968. Other prominent music graduates include violist Martin Outram, baritone John Noble, bassist Simon H. Fell and two founding members of the Fitzwilliam String Quartet, which often returns to the college to perform and hold workshops. Opera singer Sally Bradshaw is also on the college teaching staff.

In 2010 Fitzwilliam had more active music groups than any other college. As well as the traditional Chapel Choir, which also takes in choristers from nearby Murray Edwards, the college is home to numerous singing ensembles. The college&#x27;s two a cappella groups, Fitz Barbershop and The Sirens, are respectively the oldest and the oldest all-female a cappella groups currently running in Cambridge; both are regular and often successful competitors at the annual Voice Festival UK. Other student groups include Fitz Swing, a big band established in 1990 and the longest-running student jazz band in Cambridge and Fitzwilliam Chamber Opera, &#x27;the only permanent collegiate opera group in Cambridge&#x27;.

To encourage musical activity, the college hosts the annual Alkan Piano Competition, named after the nineteenth-century virtuoso Charles Valentin Alkan and sponsored by the Alkan Society. The competition is followed by a recital from a professional pianist with a particular interest in Alkan&#x27;s music, the first of whom was Ronald Smith. Fitzwilliam also offers many music scholarships and bursaries, including, somewhat unusually, a saxophone scholarship.

Fitzwilliam new Auditorium performance venue hosts the Fitzwilliam Chamber Series, a collection of concerts by professional musicians. Performers at the college have included the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber, the DJ Annie Mac and the English Touring Opera.

It was at Fitzwilliam that Indie band Good Shoes played their first ever gig.

====The Fitzwilliam Quartet====

Fitzwilliam is the only college in Cambridge with a resident professional string quartet. The Fitzwilliam Quartet was established by Cambridge undergraduates, two of them Fitzwilliam students, in 1968. They made their first professional appearance a year later at the Sheffield Arts Festival and, following graduation in 1971, became the Resident Quartet at the University of York.

Just a year into their residence, they became personally acquainted with the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich and gained international recognition when they were asked to premier several of his string quartets. They went on to become the first group to perform and record all 15 of his string quartets and Shostakovich himself described them as his &quot;preferred performers&quot;. When the composer died in August 1975, they had been scheduled to visit him in Moscow just a month later.

The group proceeded to record acclaimed interpretations of many other composers, notably Brahms and Haydn, and won the Grammy Award for Chamber Music in 1977. In 1981, they were awarded Honorary Doctorates of Music by Bucknell University, which were presented by Shostakovich&#x27;s son, Maxim.

In 2005, a number of their recordings were included in Gramophone magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;Hundred Greatest-ever Recordings&quot;. They have a long-term contract with Decca Records and perform regularly all over the world. Although membership has changed over the years, the group returned to Fitzwilliam in 1999 when they were appointed the college&#x27;s Resident Quartet. They visit for performances and workshops each term and even premier pieces written by students. In 2008, they celebrated their 40th anniversary.

====The University Orchestra====
The University of Cambridge Philharmonic Orchestra (UCPO) was founded as an offshoot of Fitzwilliam College Music Society. In its early days, the orchestra was supported by grants from the college and rehearsing took place on site. It was initially called the West Cambridge Symphony Orchestra, because the majority of its members were from West Cambridge colleges – predominantly Fitzwilliam, Churchill and New Hall. Although the orchestra later changed its name, a smaller affiliated group, known as the West Cambridge Sinfonia, maintains the reference.

In 2010 the orchestra was rehearsing primarily at St Giles&#x27; Church. It toured and recorded on a regular basis and performs University concerts once a term. At Fitzwilliam, the role originally played by WCSO has since been taken over by the Orchestra on the Hill.

<text>A clipboard is a thin, rigid with a clip at the top for holding paper in place. A clipboard is typically used to support paper with one hand while writing on it with the other, especially when other writing surfaces are not available. The earliest forms were patented in 1870–1871 and referred to as board clips. Another early version of the clipboard, known as the &quot;memorandum file&quot;, was invented by American inventor George Henry Hohnsbeen in 1921, for which he was granted . Related to the clipboard is the Shannon Arch File, which was developed around 1877.

==Variations==
Clipboards can be constructed from a variety of material, including but not limited to, hardboard, aluminum, PVC, polypropylene, High Impact Polystyrene, and Foamex. Clipboards generally come in two different designs—single or folding. Single clipboards are the more traditional type and consist of a single piece of rigid material and some sort of fixing mechanism along the top. Folding clipboards are usually constructed from a single piece of flexible PVC with two rigid materials enclosed within. A folding hinge connects the two sections to allow the front to be folded over the content to provide protection and often to allow some sort of promotional print or instructions. Folding clipboards also provide additional benefits because of the extra space available, allowing the incorporation of pen holders and pockets for storage. The arrival of the microprocessor and Internet age gave rise to high-tech variants of the traditional clipboard, the first being the Ferranti Market Research Terminal that retained a clip, to hold A4 paper sheets (looking like a large clipboard) but recording answers to questions in its electronic memory.

===Storage clipboards===

Storage clipboards have one or more compartments designed for paperwork, both to allow for easy transport of needed papers, and to protect those papers. They may also feature one or several compartments for writing implements. Some versions feature a hinged panel to slide between portions of a two-sided multi-part form.

<text>The Tortilla Curtain is a 1995 novel by American author T.C. Boyle. It is about middle-class values, illegal immigration, xenophobia, poverty, and environmental destruction. In 1997, it was awarded the French Prix Médicis Étranger prize for best foreign novel.

==Plot summary==

Cándido Rincón (33) and América (his pregnant common-law wife, 17) are two Mexicans who enter the United States illegally, dreaming of a good life in their own little house somewhere in California. Meanwhile, they are homeless and camping at the bottom of the Topanga Canyon area of Los Angeles, in the hills above Malibu. Another couple, Delaney and Kyra Mossbacher, have recently moved into a gated community on top of Topanga, in order to be closer to nature yet be close enough to the city to enjoy those amenities. Kyra is a successful real estate agent while Delaney keeps house, looks after Kyra&#x27;s son by her first marriage and writes a regular column for an environmentalist magazine.

The two couples&#x27; paths cross unexpectedly when Cándido is hit and injured by Delaney, who is driving his car along the suburban roads near his home. For different reasons, each man prefers not to call the police or an ambulance. Cándido is afraid of being deported and Delaney is afraid of ruining his perfect driving record. Delaney soothes his conscience by giving Cándido &quot;$20 blood money,&quot; explaining to Kyra that &quot;He&#x27;s a Mexican.&quot; From that moment on, the lives of the two couples are constantly influenced by the others.

After the accident, Cándido&#x27;s problems deepen. At first he can&#x27;t work after being injured by the car crash and when he does not find a temporary job at a local work exchange anymore, he unavailingly tries to find one in the city, hoping to save money for an apartment in the North despite the low wages offered. With América, his wife, pregnant, his shame at not being able to get a job and procure a home and food for his family increases, especially when América decides to find some illegal—and possibly dangerous—work herself. At one point in the novel, after Cándido is robbed by some Mexicans in the city, they are forced to go through the trash cans behind a fast-food restaurant so they do not starve.

The Mossbachers, Delaney&#x27;s family, are also having problems of their own, though of an altogether different nature. Comfortably settled in their new home, in a gated community, they are faced with the cruelty of nature when one of their two pet dogs is killed by a coyote. In addition, the majority of inhabitants of their exclusive estate feel increasingly disturbed and threatened by the presence of—as they see it—potentially criminal, illegal immigrants and vote for a wall to be built around the whole estate.

Cándido has a stroke of luck when he is given a free turkey at a grocery store by another customer, who has just received it through the store&#x27;s Thanksgiving promotion. When Cándido starts roasting the bird back in their shelter, he inadvertently causes a fire which spreads so quickly that even the gated community the Mossbachers live in has to be evacuated.

In the midst of the escalating disasters, América gives birth to Socorro, a daughter, who she suspects might be blind. But the couple has no money to see the doctor. Delaney stalks Cándido back to their shack. He carries a gun, but does not intend to kill Cándido with it. Meanwhile, América tells Cándido about the night when she was raped, as she suspects that the baby&#x27;s blindness was caused by a venereal disease transmitted by the rapist. Just as she is telling him this, Delaney finds their shack and is about to confront Cándido about the forest fire, when the shack is knocked over in a landslide. Cándido and América manage to save themselves, but Socorro drowns in a river. The book ends with Cándido helping Delaney out of the river.
Time and again in the novel, however, it is hinted at that the real perpetrators can be found inside rather than outside the projected wall: well-to-do people insensitive to the plight of the have-nots.

<text>A scholarship is a form of financial aid awarded to students for further education. Generally, scholarships are awarded based on a set of criteria such as academic merit, diversity and inclusion, athletic skill, and financial need, research experience or specific professional experience. 

Scholarship criteria usually reflect the values and goals of the donor of the award. While scholarship recipients are not required to repay scholarships, the awards may require that the recipient continue to meet certain requirements during their period of support, such as maintaining a minimum grade point average or engaging in a certain activity (e.g., playing on a school sports team for athletic scholarship holders). 

Scholarships also range in generosity; some cover partial tuition, while others offer a &#x27;full-ride&#x27;, covering all tuition, accommodation, housing and others.

Some prestigious, highly competitive scholarships are well-known even outside the academic community, such as Fulbright Scholarship and the Rhodes Scholarships at the graduate level, and the Robertson, Morehead-Cain and Jefferson Scholarships at the undergraduate level.

==Scholarships vs. grants==
While the terms &quot;scholarship&quot; and &quot;grant&quot; are frequently used interchangeably, they are distinctly different. Where grants are offered based exclusively on financial need, scholarships may have a financial need component but rely on other criteria as well.

* Academic scholarships typically use a minimum grade-point average or standardized test score such as the ACT or SAT to narrow down awardees.
* Athletic scholarships are generally based on athletic performance of a student and used as a tool to recruit high-performing athletes for their school&#x27;s athletic teams.
* Merit scholarships can be based on a number of criteria, including performance in a particular school subject or club participation or community service.

A federal Pell Grant can be awarded to someone planning to receive their undergraduate degree and is solely based on their financial needs.

==Types==

The most common scholarships may be classified as:
* Merit-based: These awards are based on a student&#x27;s academic, artistic, athletic, or other abilities, and often a factor in an applicant&#x27;s extracurricular activities and community service record. Most such merit-based scholarships are paid directly by the institution the student attends, rather than issued directly to the student.
* Need-based: Some private need-based awards are confusingly called scholarships, and require the results of a FAFSA (the family&#x27;s expected family contribution). However, scholarships are often merit-based, while grants tend to be need-based.
* Student-specific: These are scholarships for which applicants qualify on student-specific factors. 
* Group-specific: Scholarships exclusive to a protected group such as based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion can violate anti-discrimination law. 
* Career-specific: These are scholarships a college or university awards to students who plan to pursue a specific field of study. Often, the most generous awards go to students who pursue careers in high-need areas, such as education or nursing. Many schools in the United States give future nurses full scholarships to enter the field, especially if the student intends to work in a high-need community.
* College-specific: College-specific scholarships are offered by individual colleges and universities to highly qualified applicants. These scholarships are given on the basis of academic and personal achievement. Some scholarships have a &quot;bond&quot; requirement. Recipients may be required to work for a particular employer for a specified period of time or to work in rural or remote areas; otherwise, they may be required to repay the value of the support they received from the scholarship. This is particularly the case with education and nursing scholarships for people prepared to work in rural and remote areas. The programs offered by the uniformed services of the United States (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, and Public Health Service Commissioned Corps) sometimes resemble such scholarships.
* Athletic: Awarded to students with exceptional skill in a sport. Often this is so that the student will be available to attend the school or college and play the sport on their team, although in some countries government funded sports scholarships are available, allowing scholarship holders to train for international representation. School-based athletics scholarships can be controversial, as some believe that awarding scholarship money for athletic rather than academic or intellectual purposes is not in the institution&#x27;s best interest.
* Brand: These scholarships are sponsored by a corporation that is trying to gain attention to their brand, or a cause. Sometimes these scholarships are referred to as branded scholarships. The Miss America beauty pageant is a famous example of a brand scholarship. 
* Creative contest: These scholarships are awarded to students based on a creative submission. Contest scholarships are also called mini project-based scholarships, where students can submit entries based on unique and innovative ideas.
*&quot;Last dollar&quot;: can be provided by private and government-based institutions, and are intended to cover the remaining fees charged to a student after the various grants are taken into account. To prohibit institutions from taking last dollar scholarships into account, and thereby removing other sources of funding, these scholarships are not offered until after financial aid has been offered in the form of a letter. Furthermore, last dollar scholarships may require families to have filed taxes for the most recent year, received their other sources of financial aid, and not yet received loans.
*Open: a scholarship open to any applicant.

<text>Richmond is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. It is located at the point where Swaledale, the upper valley of the River Swale, opens into the Vale of Mowbray. The town&#x27;s population at the 2011 census was 8,413. The town is north-west of Northallerton, the county town, and north-west of York.

In the Domesday Book of 1086 the area was collected under Yorkshire and the town was in the Gilling Wapentake. After the book it became the centre for wapentakes in the Honour of Richmond for the North Riding of Yorkshire. Between 1974 and 2023 the town was the administrative centre of the Richmondshire district of the North Yorkshire non-metropolitan county. Richmond is located near the eastern boundary of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, for which it has become a tourist centre. 

==History==
Richmond in North Yorkshire was the Honour of Richmond of the Earls of Richmond (or &quot;comtes de Richemont&quot;), a dignity also held by the Duke of Brittany from 1136 to 1399.

Richmond was founded in 1071 by Alan Rufus, a Breton nobleman, on lands granted to him by William the Conqueror, though it was called &quot;Hindrelag&quot; initially. The name derives from Old French &quot;Riche and Monte&quot;, meaning &quot;Strong Hill&quot;, which was also the name of a village in Normandy. Richmond is one of the most commonly re-used English place names: there are 56 other Richmonds around the world. Richmond Castle was completed in 1086 with a keep and walls encompassing the area now known as the Market Place.

Richmond was part of the lands of the earldom of Richmond, which was intermittently held by the Dukes of Brittany until the 14th century. John V, Duke of Brittany, died in 1399, and Henry IV took possession. Richmond is one of a few settlements that was spared from being raided by the Scots during The Great Raid of 1322 by bribing them off. In 1453, the earldom was conferred on Edmund Tudor, and it was merged with the crown when Edmund&#x27;s son became King Henry VII in 1485. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Covenanter Army led by David Leslie, Lord Newark, took over the castle, and conflict ensued between local Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians.

In 1608, Robert Willance became the first alderman of Richmond, two years prior in 1606, whilst hunting on the nearby Whitcliffe Scar, the horse Willance was riding became nervous when thick mist descended, bolting over the edge and falling over to the valley floor, Willance survived this fall with a broken leg and erected a monument on top of the cliff as a show of gratitude for his survival. Willance died in 1616.

The prosperity of the medieval town and centre of the Swaledale wool industry greatly increased in the late 17th and 18th centuries with the burgeoning lead mining industry in nearby Arkengarthdale. It is from this period that the town&#x27;s Georgian architecture originates, the most notable examples of which are to be found on Newbiggin and in Frenchgate. One of Europe&#x27;s first gas works was built in the town in 1830. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Richmond Barracks in 1877.

During the First World War, Richmond&#x27;s own Green Howards Regiment raised 24 battalions for the war effort, the castle assumed a role as a barracks and training camp for new recruits and members of the Non-Combatant Corps, in 1915, the first troops occupied the area south of Richmond in what was to become Catterick Camp, the planning of which was commissioned by Lord Baden Powell during his residence at the town&#x27;s barracks.

In 1916, a group of &quot;absolutist&quot; conscientious objectors known as the Richmond Sixteen were held at the castle after refusing to undertake even non-combatant military duties. After being transported to France, they were court-martialled and formally sentenced to be executed by firing squad, but this sentence was immediately commuted to ten years&#x27; penal servitude, and the men were eventually released in 1919. Richmond Castle&#x27;s 19th-century cell block continued to be used to house prisoners into the Second World War.

In June 1927, Richmond was a centre line of totality during a solar eclipse, the event is marked with a plaque at the top of Reeth Road.

== Governance ==

=== Local government ===

Richmond is located in the eponymous district of Richmondshire, created under the Local Government Act 1972 by a merger of the municipal borough of Richmond with the rural districts of Richmond, Aysgarth, Leyburn, Reeth, and part of Croft. The town itself is split between three local government wards, Richmond East, Richmond North, and Richmond West, however the most southerly residential areas including Holly Hill and the area surrounding the former railway station are covered by the Hipswell ward, and as a result these residents are not able to elect members of the town council. The town council consists of 15 councillors elected from the three Richmond wards, a new town mayor is elected by the council members each February and taking office in May; meetings are held at Richmond Town Hall.

=== Parliamentary representation ===

The serving member for Richmond and Northallerton constituency in Westminster is the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Rishi Sunak of the Conservative Party, who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague. In modern times it has been an ultra-safe seat for the Conservative Party with them having held it continually since 1910.

== Geography ==
Situated approximately north-west of the county town Northallerton, Richmond straddles the eastern border of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, at the edge of a valley or dale known as Swaledale, which takes its name from the river that flows through the town, said to be one of the fastest flowing in England.

The nearest official Met Office weather station to Richmond is Leeming, about to the south-east. Temperature extremes have ranged from during August 1990, down to during December 2010.


== Demography ==
According to the 2011 United Kingdom census, the parish of Richmond had a total resident population of 8,413, of which 4,374 females and 4,039 males. 95.8% of the population identified as white British, 1.4% as other white, 1.1% as Asian or Asian British, and 0.8% as black, Afro-Caribbean or black British. The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was 93.8% United Kingdom, 3.3% from European Union countries, and 2.5% from elsewhere in the world. 71.7% said they had religious beliefs; 70.4% of those were Christian, 1.3% is made up of all other religions, the largest being Buddhism at 0.8%, 21.4% said they had no religion.

A quirk of the demographics in the town is that 2% of the population was born in Germany. This is a result of the nearby Catterick Garrison.

The following table shows historic population changes in the Richmond parish area between 1801 and 2011.
==Economy==
As a gateway town to the Yorkshire Dales, tourism is important to the local economy, but the single largest influence is the Catterick Garrison army base, which is rapidly becoming the largest population centre in Richmondshire. National chain retailers such as Lidl, WHSmith, Boots, and the Co-op, as well as local independent shops, restaurants and pubs, also provide a source of employment. The Gallowfields Trading Estate in the north of the town accommodates several builder&#x27;s merchants, car garages and showrooms, a Royal Mail delivery office and a veterinarian surgery.

A traditional market still operates every Saturday in one of the largest cobbled market places in England, as well as a week round indoor one in the town&#x27;s 19th-century market hall. The origins of the markets date back as far as 1093 when they were authorised by the Earls, and the first known royal charter was granted in 1155.

According to the 2011 United Kingdom census, the economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 37.6% in full-time employment, 15.5% in part-time employment, 10.4% self-employed, 3.4% unemployed, 2.4% students with jobs, 3.6% students without jobs, 20% retired, 2.9% looking after home or family, 2.8% permanently sick or disabled, and 1.4% economically inactive for other reasons.

The average price of a house in Richmond for the 12-month period ending February 2020 was £241,583 compared to £223,537 for North Yorkshire and the national average of £232,320.

==Landmarks==
Richmond Castle in the town centre overlooks the River Swale and is a major tourist attraction, bringing in close to 40,000 visitors a year. Scolland&#x27;s Hall is the gatehouse and was staffed by the Lords of Bedale, such as Bryan FitzAlan, Lord FitzAlan, and Miles Stapleton, Founder KG. Other staff residences were Constable Burton and Thornton Steward. Also, Richmond had an extended Wensleydale castlery initially consisting of Middleham Castle, Ravensworth and Snape (Baron FitzHugh &amp; Neville Baron Latymer). The Conyers, Wyville, Gascoigne, Stapleton and Lovell families were all notable gentry.

Within walking distance from the town centre are the ruins of the premonstratensian Easby Abbey, managed by English Heritage, and adjacent Easby Hall, built in 1729. A popular town legend tells the story of the Little Drummer Boy, a young member of an 18th-century regiment who was sent by soldiers to investigate a tunnel leading away from the castle towards Easby, playing his drum to guide the soldiers above ground, however the drums ceased suddenly and the boy was never seen or located since, a stone marker stands at the point at which the boy&#x27;s drumming stopped, on a footpath between the town and Easby.

The tall market cross or &quot;obelisk&quot; was built in 1771 to replace the medieval cross that stood before it. On the south-west side of the town stands the folly of Culloden Tower, originally built in 1746 to commemorate the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s at the Battle of Culloden, after falling into disrepair it was restored in 1981 and now is used a holiday let. Another small folly is Oliver Duckett on the northern outskirts of the town, a rounded bastion tower, built from the same stone as Richmond Castle and now lying on public land.

Swale House on Frenchgate, built around 1750, was home to the headmaster and students of the nearby grammar school, before being used as a hospital for wounded officers in the First World War. For many years, it was the headquarters of Richmondshire District Council, before being closed and sold off in 2013. Millgate House bed &amp; breakfast has received mentions in several national publications for its accompanying gardens.

There are two war memorials sited in Richmond, the Gallowgate Memorial stands overlooking Frenchgate, taking the form of a Celtic cross and is dedicated to the losses suffered by the Green Howards regiment during both the First and Second World Wars, the other monument commissioned is located in the friary gardens and commemorates all of the victims of the two 
World Wars who resided in Richmond.

Richmond Falls are a short walk from the town centre and to the west of the town, on the road to Marske, is the unusually named Richmond Out Moor.

=== Religious sites ===
There are four extant churches within the town, the Church of England&#x27;s St Mary the Virgin, the Roman Catholic St Joseph and St Francis Xavier, Richmond Methodist Church and Influence Church, formed in 1950 as Richmond Pentecostal Church. Former religious buildings and structures include Holy Trinity Church, a grade I Listed building in the centre of the market place, no longer conducting regular services, the 15th century bell tower of the former friary of Greyfriars, stands over an area of public green space, known as the Friary Gardens, and a former United Reformed Church building on Dundas Street.

==Transport==

Richmond Railway Station opened in 1846 and closed in 1968, a year before the branch line itself was taken out of service. After the station closed, the building was used for many years as a garden centre. It has now been renovated by the Richmondshire Building Preservation Trust and opened in late 2007, now titled &quot;The Station&quot;, a mixed-use space for community and commercial activities. The nearest main line station to Richmond is now Darlington on the East Coast Main Line, north-east.

The town is served by Arriva North East buses to Darlington and Catterick Garrison, as well as links to Barnard Castle and Northallerton provided by Hodgsons and routes to Leyburn and Ripon by Dales &amp; District, along with council run services that serve Richmond&#x27;s residential areas. The Little White Bus connects Richmond with the villages of Swaledale as far west as Keld and is operated solely by volunteer drivers.

Richmond has two four digit A-roads passing through it; the A6108 is the main entry route from the A1(M) junction at Scotch Corner, and continues west towards Leyburn and then Ripon. The A6136 connects to nearby Catterick Garrison across Mercury Bridge that spans the River Swale. Mercury Bridge is grade II listed, and as its original name of &quot;Station Bridge&quot; suggests, it was built to give vehicular access to the railway station. In June 2000, heavy flooding resulted in the bridge suffering considerable structural damage to one side, repairs were made at a cost of approximately £500,000 and the bridge re-opened to traffic in December of the same year.

The closest airport is Teesside International Airport just to the east of Darlington approximately north-east.

==Education==
The town is home to two secondary schools: Richmond School, a large school and sixth form with specialisms in performing arts, science, and mathematics, and St Francis Xavier School, which is a smaller, voluntary aided, joint Roman Catholic and Church of England School for boys and girls aged 11–16.

The Georgian Theatre Royal in Richmond, built in 1788, is the UK&#x27;s most complete 18th century theatre. A decline in the fortunes of theatre led to closure in 1848 and it was used as a warehouse until 1963 when the theatre was restored and reopened, with a museum added in 1979, after renovation in 2003, a new block providing services and access was added next to the original auditorium.

<text>In music, an ostinato (; derived from the Italian word for &quot;stubborn&quot;, compare English &quot;obstinate&quot;) is a motif or phrase that persistently repeats in the same musical voice, frequently in the same pitch. Well-known ostinato-based pieces include classical compositions such as Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot; and the &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot;, and popular songs such as John Lennon’s “Mind Games”(1973), Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (1977), Henry Mancini&#x27;s theme from &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; (1959), The Who&#x27;s &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; (1971), The Verve&#x27;s &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; (1997), and Flo Rida&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; (2007).

Both &quot;ostinatos&quot; and &quot;ostinati&quot; are accepted English plural forms, the latter reflecting the word&#x27;s Italian etymology.

The repeating idea may be a rhythmic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete melody in itself. Strictly speaking, ostinati should have exact repetition, but in common usage, the term covers repetition with variation and development, such as the alteration of an ostinato line to fit changing harmonies or keys.

Within the context of European classical and film music, Claudia Gorbman defines an &quot;ostinato&quot; as a repeated melodic or rhythmic figure that propels scenes that lack dynamic visual action.

Ostinati play an important part in improvised music (rock and jazz), in which they are often referred to as riffs or vamps. A &quot;favorite technique of contemporary jazz writers&quot;, ostinati are often used in modal and Latin jazz and traditional African music including Gnawa music.

The term &quot;ostinato&quot; essentially has the same meaning as the medieval Latin word &quot;pes&quot;, the word &quot;ground&quot; as applied to classical music, and the word &quot;riff&quot; in contemporary popular music.

==European classical music==
Within the domain of European classical music traditions, &quot;Ostinati&quot; are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches, as in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;Augurs of Spring&quot;. A famous type of ostinato, called the &quot;Rossini crescendo&quot;, owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza. This style was emulated by other bel canto composers, especially Vincenzo Bellini; and later by Wagner (in pure instrumental terms, discarding the closing vocal cadenza).

Applicable in homophonic and contrapuntal textures, they are &quot;repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes&quot;, more familiar as accompanimental melodies, or purely rhythmic. The technique&#x27;s appeal to composers from Debussy to avant-garde composers until at least the 1970s &quot;... lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional chord progressions to shape phrases and define tonality&quot;. Similarly, in modal music, &quot;... relentless, repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center&quot;. Their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use, though, &quot;... ostinato must be employed judiciously, as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony&quot;.

===Medieval===
Ostinato patterns have been present in European music from the Middle Ages onwards. In the famous English canon &quot;Sumer Is Icumen In&quot;, the main vocal lines are underpinned by an ostinato pattern, known as a &quot;pes&quot;:

Later in the medieval era, Guillaume Dufay&#x27;s 15th-century chanson &quot;Resvelons Nous&quot; features a similarly constructed ostinato pattern, but this time 5 bars long. Over this, the main melodic line moves freely, varying the phrase-lengths, while being &quot;to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices.&quot; 

===Ground bass: Late Renaissance and Baroque===
&quot;Ground bass&quot; or &quot;basso ostinato&quot; (obstinate bass) is a type of variation form in which a bass line, or harmonic pattern (see Chaconne; also common in Elizabethan England as &quot;Grounde&quot;) is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations. Aaron Copland describes basso ostinato as &quot;... the easiest to recognize&quot; of the variation forms wherein, &quot;... a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part, while the upper parts proceed normally [with variation]&quot;. However, he cautions, &quot;it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form.&quot;

One striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late Renaissance period is &quot;The Bells&quot;, a piece for virginals by William Byrd. Here the ostinato (or &#x27;ground&#x27;) consists of just two notes:

In Italy, during the seventeenth century, Claudio Monteverdi composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works. One of these was his 1650 version of &quot;Laetatus sum&quot;, an imposing setting of Psalm 122 that pits a four-note &quot;ostinato of unquenchable energy.&quot; against both voices and instruments:

Later in the same century, Henry Purcell became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns. His most famous ostinato is the descending chromatic ground bass that underpins the aria &quot;When I am laid in earth&quot; (&quot;Dido&#x27;s Lament&quot;) at the end of his opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot;: While the use of a descending chromatic scale to express pathos was fairly common at the end of the seventeenth century, Richard Taruskin pointed out that Purcell shows a fresh approach to this musical trope: &quot;Altogether unconventional and characteristic, however, is the interpolation of an additional cadential measure into the stereotyped ground, increasing its length from a routine four to a haunting five bars, against which the vocal line, with its despondent refrain (&quot;Remember me!&quot;), is deployed with marked asymmetry. That, in addition to Purcell&#x27;s distinctively dissonant, suspension-saturated harmony, enhanced by additional chromatic descents during the final ritornello and by many deceptive cadences, makes this little aria an unforgettably poignant embodiment of heartache.&quot; See also: Lament bass.

However, this is not the only ostinato pattern that Purcell uses in the opera. Dido&#x27;s opening aria &quot;Ah, Belinda&quot; is a further demonstration of Purcell&#x27;s technical mastery: the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the four-bar ground:

&quot;Purcell&#x27;s compositions over a ground vary in their working out, and the repetition never becomes a restriction.&quot; Purcell&#x27;s instrumental music also featured ground patterns. A particularly fine and complex example is his Fantasia upon a Ground for three violins and continuo: 

The intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the Baroque Period. Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part: 

Two pieces by J.S.Bach are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass: the Crucifixus from his Mass in B minor and the Passacaglia in C minor for organ, which has a ground rich in melodic intervals: The first variation that Bach builds over this ostinato consists of a gently syncopated motif in the upper voices: This characteristic rhythmic pattern continues in the second variation, but with some engaging harmonic subtleties, especially in the second bar, where an unexpected chord creates a passing implication of a related key: In common with other Passacaglias of the era, the ostinato is not simply confined to the bass, but rises to the uppermost part later in the piece: A performance of the entire piece can be heard here.

===Late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===

Ostinatos feature in many works of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Mozart uses an ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends Act 2 of the &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot;, to convey a sense of suspense as the jealous Count Almaviva tries in vain to incriminate the Countess, his wife, and Figaro, his butler, for plotting behind his back. A famous type of ostinato, called the Rossini crescendo, owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza.

In the energetic Scherzo of Beethoven’s late C sharp minor Quartet, Op. 131, there is a harmonically static passage, with &quot;the repetitiveness of a nursery rhyme&quot; that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins: Beethoven reverses this relationship a few bars later with the melody in the viola and cello and the ostinato shared between the violins:

Both the first and third acts of Wagner&#x27;s final opera &quot;Parsifal&quot; feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of Knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the Grail. The &quot;Transformation music&quot; that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells: Brahms used ostinato patterns in both the finale of his Fourth Symphony and in the closing section of his &quot;Variations on a Theme by Haydn&quot;: 

===Twentieth century===
Debussy featured an ostinato pattern throughout his Piano Prelude &quot;Des pas sur la neige&quot;. Here, the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano – it is never used as a bass. &quot;Remark that the footfall ostinato remains nearly throughout on the same notes, at the same pitch level... this piece is an appeal to the basic loneliness of all human beings, oft-forgotten perhaps, but, like the ostinato, forming a basic undercurrent of our history.&quot; Of all the major classical composers of the 20th century, Stravinsky is possibly the one most associated with the practice of ostinato. In conversation with the composer, his friend and colleague Robert Craft remarked &quot;Your music always has an element of repetition, of ostinato. What is the function of ostinato?&quot; Stravinsky replied; &quot;It is static – that is, anti-development; and sometimes we need a contradiction to development.&quot; Stravinsky was particularly skilled at using ostinatos to confound rather than confirm rhythmic expectations. In the first of his &quot;Three Pieces for String Quartet&quot;, Stravinsky sets up three repeated patterns, which overlap one another and never coincide. &quot;Here a rigid pattern of (3+2+2/4) bars is laid over a strictly recurring 23-beat tune (the bars being marked by a cello ostinato), so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme.&quot; &quot;The rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces.&quot;

A subtler metrical conflict can be found in the final section of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot;. The choir sing a melody in triple time, while the bass instruments in the orchestra play a 4-beat ostinato against this. &quot;This is built up over an ostinato bass (harp, two pianos and timpani) moving in fourths like a pendulum.&quot;

==Sub-Saharan African music==
===Counter-metric structure===
Many instruments south of the Sahara Desert play ostinato melodies. These include lamellophones such as the mbira, as well as xylophones like the balafon, the bikutsi, and the gyil. Ostinato figures are also played on string instruments such as the kora, gankoqui bell ensembles, and pitched drums ensembles. Often, African ostinatos contain offbeats or cross-beats, that contradict the metric structure. Other African ostinatos generate complete cross-rhythms by sounding both the main beats and cross-beats. In the following example, a gyil sounds the three-against-two cross-rhythm (hemiola). The left hand (lower notes) sounds the two main beats, while the right hand (upper notes) sounds the three cross-beats.

===African harmonic progressions===
Popular dance bands in West Africa and the Congo region feature ostinato-playing guitars. The African guitar parts are drawn from a variety of sources, including the indigenous mbira, as well as foreign influences such as James Brown-type funk riffs. However, the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly African ostinato sensibility. African guitar styles began with Congolese bands doing Cuban cover songs. The Cuban guajeo had a both familiar and exotic quality to the African musicians. Gradually, various regional guitar styles emerged, as indigenous influences became increasingly dominant within these &quot;Africanized guajeos&quot;.

As Moore states, &quot;One could say that I – IV – V – IV [chord progressions] is to African music what the 12-bar blues is to North American music.&quot; Such progressions seem superficially to follow the conventions of Western music theory. However, performers of African popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way. Harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant (as they are known in European music) have been used in Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony for hundreds of years. Their elaborations follow all the conventions of traditional African harmonic principles. Gehard Kubik concludes:

The harmonic cycle of C–F–G–F [I–IV–V–IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer&#x27;s appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music—(Kubik 1999).

==Afro-Cuban guajeo==
A guajeo is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. The guajeo is a hybrid of the African and European ostinato. The guajeo was first played as accompaniment on the tres in the folkloric changüí and son. The term &quot;guajeo&quot; is often used to mean specific ostinato patterns played by a tres, piano, an instrument of the violin family, or saxophones. The guajeo is a fundamental component of modern-day salsa, and Latin jazz. The following example shows a basic guajeo pattern.

The guajeo is a seamless Afro-Euro ostinato hybrid, which has had a major influence upon jazz, R&amp;B, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and popular music in general. The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; guitar riff is guajeo-like.

==Riff==
In various popular music styles, riff refers to a brief, relaxed phrase repeated over changing melodies. It may serve as a refrain or melodic figure, often played by the rhythm section instruments or solo instruments that form the basis or accompaniment of a musical composition. Though they are most often found in rock music, heavy metal music, Latin, funk and jazz, classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff, such as Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. Riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple, catchy rhythmic figure, or as complex as the riff-based variations in the head arrangements played by the Count Basie Orchestra.

David Brackett (1999) defines riffs as &quot;short melodic phrases&quot;, while Richard Middleton (1999) defines them as &quot;short rhythmic, melodic, or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework&quot;. Rikky Rooksby states: &quot;A riff is a short, repeated, memorable musical phrase, often pitched low on the guitar, which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song.&quot;

In jazz and R&amp;B, riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions. The riff from Charlie Parker&#x27;s bebop number &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; (1945) re-emerged four years later as the R&amp;B dance hit &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot;. The verse of &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot;—another riff—was &quot;borrowed&quot; from the Artie Matthews composition &quot;Weary Blues&quot;. Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot; had an earlier life as Wingy Manone&#x27;s &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot;. All these songs use twelve bar blues riffs, and most of these riffs probably precede the examples given.

Neither of the terms &#x27;riff&#x27; or &#x27;lick&#x27; are used in classical music. Instead, individual musical phrases used as the basis of classical music pieces are called ostinatos or simply phrases. Contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in modal music. Latin jazz often uses guajeo-based riffs.

==Vamp==

In music, a vamp is a repeating musical figure, section, or accompaniment. Vamps are usually harmonically sparse: A vamp may consist of a single chord or a sequence of chords played in a repeated rhythm. The term frequently appeared in the instruction &#x27;Vamp till ready&#x27; on sheet music for popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s, indicating the accompanist should repeat the musical phrase until the vocalist was ready. Vamps are generally symmetrical, self-contained, and open to variation. They are used in blues, jazz, gospel, soul, and musical theater. Vamps are also found in rock, funk, reggae, R&amp;B, pop, and country. The equivalent in classical music is an ostinato, in hip hop and electronic music the loop, and in rock music the riff.

The slang term &quot;vamp&quot; comes from the Middle English word &quot;vampe&quot; (sock), from Old French &quot;avanpie&quot;, equivalent to Modern French &quot;avant-pied&quot;, literally &quot;before-foot&quot;.

Many vamp-oriented songwriters begin the creative process by attempting to evoke a mood or feeling while riffing freely on an instrument or scat singing. Many well known artists primarily build songs with a vamp/riff/ostinato based approach—including John Lee Hooker (&quot;Boogie Chillen&quot;, &quot;House Rent Boogie&quot;), Bo Diddley (&quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;), Jimmy Page (&quot;Ramble On&quot;, &quot;Bron Yr Aur&quot;), Nine Inch Nails (&quot;Closer&quot;), and Beck (&quot;Loser&quot;).

Classic examples of vamps in jazz include &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;, &quot;Take Five&quot;, &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, and &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot;. Rock examples include the long jam at the ends of &quot;Loose Change&quot; by Neil Young and Crazy Horse and &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; by King&#x27;s X.

===Jazz, fusion, and Latin jazz===
In jazz, fusion, and related genres, a background vamp provides a performer with a harmonic framework supporting improvisation. In Latin jazz guajeos fulfill the role of piano vamp. A vamp at the beginning of a jazz tune may act as a springboard to the main tune; a vamp at the end of a song is often called a &quot;tag&quot;.

====Examples====
&quot;Take Five&quot; begins with a repeated, syncopated figure in time, which pianist Dave Brubeck plays throughout the song (except for Joe Morello&#x27;s drum solo and a variation on the chords in the middle section).

The music from Miles Davis&#x27;s modal period (1958–1963) was based on improvising songs with a small number of chords. The jazz standard &quot;So What&quot; uses a vamp in the two-note &quot;Sooooo what?&quot; figure, regularly played by the piano and the trumpet throughout. Jazz scholar Barry Kernfeld calls this music &quot;vamp music&quot;.

Examples include the outros to George Benson&#x27;s &quot;Body Talk&quot; and &quot;Plum&quot;, and the solo changes to &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot;. The following songs are dominated by vamps: John Coltrane, Kenny Burrell, and Grant Green&#x27;s versions of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; and &quot;Chameleon&quot;, Wes Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Bumpin&#x27; on Sunset&quot;, and Larry Carlton&#x27;s &quot;Room 335&quot;.

The Afro-Cuban vamp style known as guajeo is used in the bebop/Latin jazz standard &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot;. Depending upon the musician, a repeating figure in &quot;A Night in Tunisia&quot; could be called an &quot;ostinato&quot;, &quot;guajeo&quot;, &quot;riff&quot;, or &quot;vamp&quot;. The Cuban-jazz hybrid spans the disciplines that encompass all these terms.

===Gospel, soul, and funk===
In gospel and soul music, the band often vamps on a simple ostinato groove at the end of a song, usually over a single chord. In soul music, the end of recorded songs often contains a display of vocal effects—such as rapid scales, arpeggios, and improvised passages. For recordings, sound engineers gradually fade out the vamp section at the end of a song, to transition to the next track on the album. Salsoul singers such as Loleatta Holloway have become notable for their vocal improvisations at the end of songs, and they are sampled and used in other songs. Andrae Crouch extended the use of vamps in gospel, introducing chain vamps (one vamp after the other, each successive vamp drawn from the first).

1970s-era funk music often takes a short one or two bar musical figure based on a single chord one would consider an introduction vamp in jazz or soul music, and then uses this vamp as the basis of the entire song (&quot;Funky Drummer&quot; by James Brown, for example). Jazz, blues, and rock are almost always based on chord progressions (a sequence of changing chords), and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest. Unlike these music genres, funk is based on the rhythmic groove of the percussion, rhythm section instruments, and a deep electric bass line, usually all over a single chord. &quot;In funk, harmony is often second to the &#x27;lock,&#x27; the linking of contrapuntal parts that are played on guitar, bass, and drums in the repeating vamp.&quot;

Examples include Stevie Wonder&#x27;s vamp-based &quot;Superstition&quot; and Little Johnny Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Part Time Love&quot;, which features an extended improvisation over a two-chord vamp.

===Musical theater===
In musical theater, a vamp, or intro, is the few bars, one to eight, of music without lyrics that begin a printed copy of a song. The orchestra may repeat the vamp or other accompaniment during dialogue or stage business, as accompaniment for onstage transitions of indeterminate length. The score provides a one or two bar vamp figure, and indicates, &quot;Vamp till cue&quot;, by the conductor. The vamp gives the onstage singers time to prepare for the song or the next verse, without requiring the music to pause. Once the vamp section is over, the music continues to the next section.

The vamp may be written by the composer of the song, a copyist employed by the publisher, or the arranger for the vocalist. The vamp serves three main purposes: it provides the key, establishes the tempo, and provides emotional context. The vamp may be as short as a &quot;bell tone&quot;, &quot;sting&quot; (a harmonized bell tone with stress on the starting note), or measures long. The &quot;rideout&quot; is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long, though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a Roxy Rideout.

==Indian classical music==

In Indian classical music, during Tabla or Pakhawaj solo performances and Kathak dance accompaniments, a conceptually similar melodic pattern known as the Lehara (sometimes spelled Lehra) or Nagma is played repeatedly throughout the performance. This melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle (Tala or Taal) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple Ragas.

The basic idea of the lehara is to provide a steady melodious framework and keep the time-cycle for rhythmic improvisations. It serves as an auditory workbench not only for the soloist but also for the audience to appreciate the ingenuity of the improvisations and thus the merits of the overall performance. In Indian Classical Music, the concept of &#x27;sam&#x27; (pronounced as &#x27;sum&#x27;) carries paramount importance. The sam is the target unison beat (and almost always the first beat) of any rhythmic cycle. The second most important beat is the Khali, which is a complement of the sam. Besides these two prominent beats, there are other beats of emphasis in any given taal, which signify &#x27;khand&#x27;s (divisions) of the taal. E.g. &#x27;Roopak&#x27; or &#x27;Rupak&#x27; taal, a 7-beat rhythmic cycle, is divided 3–2–2, further implying that the 1st, 4th, and 6th beats are the prominent beats in that taal. Therefore, it is customary, but not essential, to align the lehara according to the divisions of the Taal. It is done with a view to emphasize those beats that mark the divisions of the Taal.

The lehara can be played on a variety of instruments, including the sarangi, harmonium, sitar, sarod, flute and others. The playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of &quot;Raga Sangeet&quot;, which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of Indian Classical Music. The lehara may be interspersed with short and occasional improvisations built around the basic melody. It is also permissible to switch between two or more disparate melodies during the course of the performance. It is essential that the lehara be played with the highest precision in Laya (Tempo) and Swara control, which requires years of specialist training (&quot;Taalim&quot;) and practice (&quot;Riyaaz&quot;). It is considered a hallmark of excellence to play lehara alongside a recognised Tabla or Pakhawaj virtuoso as it is a difficult task to keep a steady pulse while the percussionist is improvising or playing difficult compositions in counterpoint. While there may be scores of individually talented instrumentalists, there are very few who are capable of playing the lehra for a Tabla / Pakhawaj solo performance.

<text>At , St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was the tallest building in London from 1710 until it was eventually surpassed by the 118 metre (387 ft) Millbank Tower in 1963. This in turn was overtaken by the BT Tower at tall in 1964. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s several high-rise buildings were built, mostly in the western side of Central London and the City of London. In 1980, the 183 metre (600 ft) NatWest Tower (now Tower 42) was completed in the City of London. In 1991, One Canada Square was topped-out at , becoming the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development.

The 2000s saw the beginnings of a boom in skyscraper building, mostly in the City of London and Canary Wharf. Since 2012, the tallest building in London has been The Shard at London Bridge, which was topped out at . There are several tall buildings planned for the City and Canary Wharf, with further clusters emerging in other districts of London including: Stratford, the South Bank, Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall, Nine Elms, Islington, Lewisham as well as in places in Outer London such as Croydon.

As of 2022, there are 121 buildings or structures that are at least tall in the Greater London metropolitan area, with 24 of these being in the City of London and 27 being in the Canary Wharf / Isle of Dogs district. The Greater London metropolitan area contains the second most skyscrapers of any city in Europe after Moscow. There are 42 skyscrapers in Greater London that reach a roof height of at least .

==History==
===Medieval and early modern period===
The history of tall structures in London began with the completion of the White Tower, a part of the Tower of London, in 1098. The first structure to surpass a height of was the Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Completed in 1310, it stood at a height of . St Paul&#x27;s was the world&#x27;s tallest structure until 1311, when its height was surpassed by Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln. It regained the title when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral fell in 1549.

Although the spire of the Old St Paul&#x27;s was destroyed by lightning in 1561, it still stood as the tallest structure in London, while the world&#x27;s tallest structure became Strasbourg Cathedral in Strasbourg, France. St Paul&#x27;s was severely damaged by the Great Fire of London in 1666. The title of the tallest structure in London passed to Southwark Cathedral, which stands at a height of and no structure in London again rose above 100 metres until 1710, when the current St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was completed at , becoming London&#x27;s tallest building.

===19th century===
Few skyscrapers were built in London before the late 20th century, owing to restrictions on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed the construction of the 14-storey Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions. Though restrictions have long since been eased, harsh regulations remain to preserve protected views, especially those of St Paul&#x27;s, the Tower of London and Palace of Westminster, as well as to comply with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority.

===1960s and 1970s===
The lifting of height restrictions caused a boom in the construction of tall buildings during the 1960s. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral remained as London&#x27;s tallest building until it was overtaken in 1963 by the Millbank Tower at , which in turn was overtaken by the BT Tower which topped out just one year later in 1964 at and officially opened in 1965 (then known as the Post Office Tower). One of London&#x27;s first notable tall buildings was the Centre Point, completed in 1966.

Others completed in the 1960s include: the Empress State Building at in 1961, the Shell Centre at in 1961, the London Hilton at in 1963, Portland House at in 1963, and Euston Tower at in 1970, all built on the west side of Central London. In 1969, St. Helen&#x27;s at was completed in the City of London, along with Britannic House in 1967 at 122 metres (400 ft), but the latter was refurbished in 2000, increased to 127m in height and renamed Citypoint. Cromwell Tower, completed in 1973, Lauderdale Tower, completed in 1974 and Shakespeare Tower, completed in 1976, all at , were built as part of the Barbican Estate in the northern part of the City of London.

===1980s, 1990s and 2000s===
The NatWest Tower, later renamed Tower 42, was completed in 1980, which at and 42 storeys, was considered the first &quot;skyscraper&quot; in the City of London. Its height was controversial, being contrary to the previous height restrictions, it was the tallest building in the United Kingdom at the time and also the tallest cantilever building in the world. Following an over ten-year gap, One Canada Square was completed in 1991 at and formed the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development, which itself is part of the Isle of Dogs and can be considered the east-side of Central London. At 50 storeys, it became the tallest building in the United Kingdom.

With the encouragement of Ken Livingstone who was Mayor of London from 2000 to 2008, a renewed trend for building tall was established in the 2000s.

Following another over 10-year gap, 8 Canada Square and 25 Canada Square, both standing at , were completed at Canary Wharf in 2002. Several others of a smaller height followed at Canary Wharf including: Heron Quays, 40 Bank Street in 2003 at , 10 Upper Bank Street in 2003 at , and 25 Bank Street in 2004 at . In the City of London, The Gherkin was completed in 2003 at , Heron Tower in 2007 at , and the Broadgate Tower in 2008 at . Notably, some of the awards given to 30 St Mary Axe include the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2003 and the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture in 2004.

===2010s to present===
Boris Johnson, who was Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, approved the construction of more skyscrapers in London.

At the time of its completion in 2010, Strata SE1 was the tallest residential building in London. The Shard topped out in 2012 at London Bridge and at remains London&#x27;s tallest building. In 2014, the tall 122 Leadenhall Street, nicknamed &quot;the Cheesegrater&quot;, was completed in the City of London. In September 2016, a refit was completed of the 111m King&#x27;s Reach Tower, originally built in the 1970s, which included an 11-storey height increase to bring it up to tall and it was renamed the South Bank Tower.

One Blackfriars, also located on the South Bank, topped out in 2017 at . The Scalpel, at was completed in the City of London in 2018 and it was designed to protect views of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Newfoundland Quay, at and Landmark Pinnacle at topped out in Canary Wharf in 2018 and 2019 respectively. One Park Drive at and South Quay Plaza at both also topped out at Canary Wharf in 2019. 22 Bishopsgate, at topped out in the City of London in 2019, after being approved by the current mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in 2016.

1 Undershaft, at , also approved by Sadiq Khan in 2016, is planned to form the centrepiece of the City of London&#x27;s skyscraper cluster. It is the tallest skyscraper currently proposed for London and will only be exceeded in height by The Shard. It will be built on the site of the aforementioned 1969 St Helen&#x27;s building which will be demolished. 100 Leadenhall, at , and already nicknamed the &quot;Cheesegrater 2&quot;, is also planned for the City of London. Spire London, at is planned for Canary Wharf. However, construction was halted after concerns that the building only had one escape stairwell for residents on the upper floors. The tallest of the two Riverside South towers that have been planned for construction at Canary Wharf since 2008 would have exceeded that cluster&#x27;s tallest building, One Canada Square, by 1 metre in height, but construction has been stalled since 2011. Construction has started on the tall Consort Place (previously called Alpha Square) also at Canary Wharf.

There is another major skyscraper cluster emerging in the Vauxhall and Nine Elms districts of London. The first skyscraper to appear here was St George Wharf Tower at and which was completed in 2014. The tallest tower planned for this cluster is the One Nine Elms City Tower.

In 2019, Sadiq Khan blocked the construction of the 290 metre tall Tulip that would have been built in the City of London. After an appeal was launched by the developers against Khan&#x27;s decision, UK housing secretary Michael Gove rejected the proposal in November 2021.

<doc id="180345" wikidata="Q2619009" url="?curid=180345" title="Jury nullification">
<text>Jury nullification, also known in the United Kingdom as jury equity, or a perverse verdict, is when the jury in a criminal trial gives a verdict of not guilty even though they think a defendant has broken the law. The jury&#x27;s reasons may include the belief that the law itself is unjust, that the prosecutor has misapplied the law in the defendant&#x27;s case, that the punishment for breaking the law is too harsh, or general frustrations with the criminal justice system. It has been commonly used to oppose what jurors perceive as unjust laws, such as those that once penalized runaway slaves under the Fugitive Slave Act, prohibited alcohol during Prohibition, or criminalized draft evasion during the Vietnam War. Some juries have also refused to convict due to their own prejudices in favor of the defendant. Such verdicts are possible because a jury has an absolute right to return any verdict it chooses. Nullification is not an official part of criminal procedure, but is the logical consequence of two rules governing the systems in which it exists:
# Jurors cannot be punished for passing an incorrect verdict.
# In many jurisdictions, a defendant who is acquitted cannot be tried a second time for the same offense.

A jury verdict that is contrary to the letter of the law pertains only to the particular case before it; however, if a pattern of acquittals develops in response to repeated attempts to prosecute a particular offence, this can have the &quot;de facto&quot; effect of invalidating the law. Such a pattern may indicate public opposition to an unwanted legislative enactment. It may also happen that a jury convicts a defendant even if no law was broken, although such a conviction may be overturned on appeal. Nullification can also occur in civil trials; unlike in criminal trials, if the jury renders a not liable verdict that is clearly at odds with the evidence, the judge can issue a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or order a new trial.

==Background==
In the past, it was feared that a single judge or panel of government officials might be unduly influenced to follow established legal practice, even when that practice had drifted from its origins. In most modern Western legal systems, judges often instruct juries to act only as &quot;finders of fact&quot;, whose role it is to determine the veracity of the evidence presented, the weight accorded to the evidence, to apply that evidence to the law as explained by the judge, and to reach a verdict; but not to question the law itself. Similarly, juries are routinely cautioned by courts and some attorneys not to allow sympathy for a party or other affected persons to compromise the fair and dispassionate evaluation of evidence. These instructions are criticized by advocates of jury nullification. Some commonly cited historical examples of jury nullification involve jurors refusing to convict persons accused of violating the Fugitive Slave Act by assisting runaway slaves or being fugitive slaves themselves, and refusal of American colonial juries to convict a defendant under English law.

Jury nullification is the source of much debate. Some maintain that it is an important safeguard of last resort against wrongful imprisonment and government tyranny. Some view it as a violation of the right to a jury trial, which undermines the law; whereas others, such as those members of Congress who voted to impeach Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase for instructing a jury against nullification, view a jury as a body charged with judging both law and fact. Some view it as a violation of the oath sworn by jurors. In the United States, some view the requirement that jurors take an oath to be unlawful in itself, while still others view the oath&#x27;s reference to &quot;deliverance&quot; to &quot;require&quot; nullification of unjust law: &quot;will well and truly try and a true deliverance make between the United States and the defendant at the bar, and a true verdict render according to the evidence, so help [me] God&quot;. 

Some fear that nullification could be used to permit violence against socially unpopular factions. They point to the danger that a jury may choose to convict a defendant who has not broken the letter of the law. However, judges retain the rights both to decide sentences and to disregard juries&#x27; guilty verdicts, acting as a check against malicious juries. Jury nullification may also occur in civil suits, in which the verdict is generally a finding of liability or lack of liability (rather than a finding of guilty or not guilty).

The main ethical issue involved in jury nullification is the tension between democratic self-government and integrity. The argument has been raised that prosecutors are not allowed to seek jury nullification, and therefore defendants should not be allowed to seek it either; however, for a prosecutor to nullify a law in this context would require negating the presumption of innocence. For this reason, prosecutorial nullification is typically defined as declining to prosecute. Nevertheless, there is little doubt as to the ability of a jury to nullify the law. Today, there are several issues raised by jury nullification, such as:
# Whether juries can or should be instructed or informed of their power to nullify.
# Whether a judge may remove jurors &quot;for cause&quot; when they refuse to apply the law as instructed.
# Whether a judge may punish a juror for practicing jury nullification.
# Whether all legal arguments, except perhaps on motions to exclude evidence, should be made in the presence of the jury.

In some cases in the United States, a stealth juror will attempt to get on a jury in order to nullify the law. Some lawyers use a shadow defense to expose the jury to information that would otherwise be inadmissible, hoping that evidence will trigger a nullification.

==Common law precedent==

The early history of juries supports the recognition of the &quot;de facto&quot; power of nullification. By the 12th century, common law courts in England began using juries for more than administrative duties. Juries were composed primarily of &quot;laymen&quot; from the local community and provided a somewhat efficient means of dispute resolution with the benefit of supplying legitimacy. The general power of juries to decide on verdicts was recognised in the English Magna Carta of 1215, which put into words existing practices:

Largely, the earliest juries returned verdicts in accordance with the wishes of the judge or the Crown. This was achieved either by &quot;packing the jury&quot; or by &quot;writs of attaint&quot;. Juries were packed by hand-selecting or by bribing the jury so as to return the desired verdict. That was a common tactic in cases involving treason or sedition. In addition, the writ of attaint allowed a judge to retry the case in front of a second jury when the judge believed the first jury returned a &quot;false verdict&quot;. If the second jury returned a different verdict, that verdict was imposed, and the first jury was imprisoned or fined.

That history is marked by a number of notable exceptions, several of which claim rights commonly recognized as fundamental in modern democratic societies, such as freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom of religious practice. In 1554, a jury acquitted Sir Nicholas Throckmorton but was severely punished by the court. Almost a century later, in 1649, in the first known attempt to argue for jury nullification, a jury likewise acquitted John Lilburne for his part in inciting a rebellion against Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s regime. Lilburne had been charged with seditious libel for the publication of articles critical of the government; the jury were instructed to give a verdict only on whether the text was published, and to leave the issue of libel to the judge, while Lilburne argued the jury should give a general verdict and should judge whether the law&#x27;s restraint on speech against the government was just. The theoretician and politician Eduard Bernstein wrote of Lilburne&#x27;s trial:

In 1653, Lilburne was on trial again and asked the jury to acquit him if it found the death penalty &quot;unconscionably severe&quot; in proportion to the crime he had committed. The jury found Lilburne &quot;not guilty of any crime worthy of death&quot;. In 1670, a petit jury refused to convict William Penn of unlawful assembly for religious practice not associated with the Church of England. The judge held the jury in contempt of court, which was ruled inappropriate by the Court of Common Pleas in &quot;Bushel&#x27;s Case&quot;. In 1681, a grand jury refused to indict the Earl of Shaftesbury. In 1688, a jury acquitted the Seven Bishops of the Church of England of seditious libel. Juries continued, even in non-criminal cases, to act in defiance of the Crown. In 1763 and 1765, juries awarded £4,000 to John Wilkes and £300 to John Entick in separate suits for trespass against the Crown&#x27;s messengers. In both cases, messengers had been sent by Lord Halifax to seize allegedly-libellous papers.

In Scotland, jury nullification had the profound effect of introducing the three-verdict system including the option of &quot;not proven&quot;, which remains in Scotland to this day. In 1728, Carnegie of Finhaven accidentally killed the Earl of Strathmore. As the defendant had undoubtedly killed the Earl, the law, as it then stood, required the jury merely to look at the facts and to pass a verdict of &quot;proven&quot; or &quot;not proven&quot;, depending on whether it believed that the facts proved the defendant had killed the Earl. If the jury brought in a &quot;proven&quot; verdict, that would lead to Carnegie&#x27;s hanging though he had not intended any harm to the Earl. To avert that injustice, the jury decided to assert what it believed to be its &quot;ancient right&quot; to judge the whole case, not just the facts, and rendered the verdict of &quot;not proven&quot;. Over time, juries have tended to favour the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict over &quot;not proven&quot; and so the interpretation has changed. The &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict has become the normal verdict when a jury is convinced of innocence, and the &quot;not proven&quot; verdict is used only if the jury is not certain of innocence or guilt.

The standard jury trial practice in the United States during the Founding Era and for several decades afterward was to argue all issues of law in the presence of the jury so that it heard the same arguments as the bench in reaching its rulings on motions. That is evidenced by such decisions as the 1839 case &quot;Stettinius&quot;, which held, &quot;The defense can argue law to the jury before the court gives instructions.&quot; Later, judges began to demand the parties submit motions in writing, often before the jury was empaneled, to be argued and decided without the jury being present. The transition began with motions &quot;in limine&quot; to exclude evidence on which it was felt the jury should not hear the argument because it would be informed of the evidence to be excluded. Later, that was expanded to include all legal argument and so that today, the earlier practice of arguing law before the jury has been largely forgotten, and judges even declare mistrials or overturn verdicts if legal arguments are made to the jury.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Canada===
Although extremely rare, jury nullification occurs in Canada. As the prosecution has powers to appeal the resulting acquittal, it lacks the finality found in the United States. However, the Crown cannot appeal on grounds of an unreasonable acquittal although it can appeal on errors of law. In &quot;R. v. Latimer&quot;, 2001 SCC 1, the Supreme Court discussed jury nullification and indicated that it is a duty of the presiding justice to try to prevent it from occurring. Perhaps the most famous cases of jury nullification in Canada were the various trials of Henry Morgentaler, who openly operated a private abortion clinic in violation of the Criminal Code. Repeated attempts at prosecuting Morgentaler resulted in acquittals at jury trials in the 1970s and the 1980s. In the 1988 Supreme Court case, &quot;R. v. Morgentaler&quot;, 1988 SCR 30, a nullification was appealed all the way to the country&#x27;s highest court, which struck down the law in question. In &quot;obiter dicta&quot;, Chief Justice Dickson wrote:

The Supreme Court in 2006 issued a decision, &quot;R. v. Krieger&quot;, 2006 SCC 47, which confirmed that juries in Canada have the power to refuse to apply the law when their consciences require that they do so. The decision stated that &quot;juries are not entitled as a matter of right to refuse to apply the law—but they do have the power to do so when their consciences permit of no other course&quot;.

===England and Wales===
By the late 17th century, the court&#x27;s power to punish juries was removed in &quot;Bushel&#x27;s Case&quot; involving a juror on the case against William Penn. Penn and William Mead had been arrested in 1670 for illegally preaching a Quaker sermon and disturbing the peace but four jurors, led by Edward Bushell, refused to find them guilty. Instead of dismissing the jury, the judge sent them back for further deliberations. Despite the judge demanding a guilty verdict, the jury now unanimously found Penn guilty of preaching but acquitted him on the charge of disturbing the peace and acquitted Mead of all charges. The jury was then subsequently kept for three days without &quot;meat, drink, fire and tobacco&quot; to force it to bring in a guilty verdict. When it failed to do so, the judge ended the trial. As punishment, the judge ordered the jurors imprisoned until they paid a fine to the court.
Four jurors refused to pay the fine, and after several months, Bushell sought a writ of habeas corpus. Chief Justice Vaughan, sitting on the Court of Common Pleas, discharged the writ, released them, called the power to punish a jury &quot;absurd&quot; and forbade judges from punishing jurors for returning a verdict the judge disagreed with. That series of events is considered a significant milestone in the history of jury nullification. The &quot;courage and endurance&quot; of the jury is celebrated in a plaque displayed in the Central Criminal Court (the Old Bailey) in London. In a criminal libel case, &quot;R. v. Shipley&quot; (1784), 4 Dougl. 73, 99 E.R. 774, at p. 824, Lord Mansfield, sitting as a judge in the case, disparaged the practice of jury nullification:

A 2016 study exploring the history of juror punishment in England and Wales after Bushel&#x27;s Case found no clear examples of jurors being punished solely for returning the &quot;wrong&quot; verdict. The closest that a jury came to that was in 1917, when a jury acquitted two teenage boys of arson. The boys had confessed at their pre-trial hearing but entered pleas of not guilty at their trial. Home Office civil servants suspected the difference between the pleas could be explained by the difference between the boys&#x27; admitting that they had caused the fire and their denial that they had done so maliciously. The trial judge did not consider that possibility or was not satisfied with it. On receiving the jury&#x27;s verdict, he told them that &quot;you have been absolutely regardless of your oath. These men have pleaded guilty, and the evidence is of the clearest possible nature. You are none of you fit to serve on a Jury, but you will remain here until the end of the Sessions&quot;. The foreman, George Lathan, considered that a form of punishment for the jury, as the jurors were not going to be permitted to serve on any more juries but were nonetheless required to keep attending court or face contempt proceedings, which Lathan considered a tacit form of imprisonment. Officials in the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Office noted that while the judge&#x27;s conduct &quot;was ill-judged and arbitrary, he did not, so far as I can see, do any act which would justify the Lord Chancellor in removing him from the Bench&quot;. Home Office officials wrote to the judge, advising him that his actions &quot;would be impossible for the Home Secretary to defend as constitutional or right&quot;, and after several days, the jurors were relieved of their duties. Home Office minutes suggest they did not think that kind of informal punishment of jurors who had returned the &quot;wrong&quot; verdict to be unheard of.

In 1982, during the Falklands War, the Royal Navy sank the Argentine cruiser, &quot;General Belgrano&quot;. Three years later a civil servant, Clive Ponting, leaked two government documents concerning the sinking of the cruiser to a Member of Parliament (Tam Dalyell) and was subsequently charged with breaching section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. The prosecution in the case demanded that the jury convict Ponting, as he had clearly contravened the Act by leaking official information about the sinking of the Belgrano during the Falklands War. His main defence was that it was in the public interest that the information be made available. The judge, Sir Anthony McCowan, &quot;indicated that the jury should convict him&quot;, and had ruled that &quot;the public interest is what the government of the day says it is&quot;. The jury acquitted him instead, much to the consternation of the government. In 2001, two people were charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage to a Trident submarine in a Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. Though the two admitted their intention to trash the submarine, the two said they were planning to do so due to nuclear bombs being immoral and illegal. The judge told the juries that such ideals were not a defence against the charge. The jury brought a verdict of not guilty on these two anti-nuclear protesters.

In 2021, six activists associated with the environmental protest organisation Extinction Rebellion were tried for causing criminal damage to the British headquarters of the multinational oil company Royal Dutch Shell. The judge told the jury that there was &#x27;no defence in law&#x27; for the protestors&#x27; actions, which according to the prosecutor had caused &#x27;significant damage&#x27; to the building, but the activists were acquitted. In 2023, Insulate Britain members Giovanna Lewis and Amy Pritchard were jailed for seven weeks after defying the judge&#x27;s ban on informing the jury of the reasons for their actions. In charging them with contempt, the judge referred to an earlier case where another environmental activist was sentenced to eight weeks in prison for the same reason. Following juries acquitting activists, dozens of people have been threatened with arrest for displaying signs that remind jurors of their right to make decisions based on conscience. In 2024, a motion brought by government lawyers to prosecute the activist Trudi Warner for holding a placard stating the right to jury nullification was thrown out by a High Court judge on the basis that there was a well-established principle in law of jury equity and Warner had not broken any law. Warner&#x27;s placard had directly referenced the wording on the plaque inside the Old Bailey.

===Germany===

In 1921, an Armenian genocide survivor, Soghomon Tehlirian, assassinated Talaat Pasha, who was considered the main architect of the genocide, in Berlin. Although Tehlirian&#x27;s lawyers did not contest that their client had killed Talaat, the jury (Germany used jury trials until 1924) returned a verdict of not guilty. However, although the moral dimension of the case was strongly emphasised by the defense, the acquittal was based on a plead of temporary insanity and there was no dissent between court and jury.

===United States===

In the United States, jury nullification first appeared just before the American Revolutionary War, when colonial juries frequently exercised their nullification power, principally in maritime cases and cases implicating free speech. Jury nullification became so common that many British prosecutors gave up trying maritime cases since conviction seemed hopeless. Before the American Civil War, juries sometimes refused to convict for violations of the Fugitive Slave Act. Later, during Prohibition, juries often nullified alcohol control laws. That resistance may have contributed to the adoption of the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed Prohibition and the Eighteenth Amendment.

In a well-known example of jury nullification, at the end of Wild Bill Hickok&#x27;s trial for the manslaughter of Davis Tutt in 1865, Judge Sempronius Boyd gave the jury two instructions. He first instructed the jury that a conviction was its only option under the law. He then instructed them that they could apply the unwritten law of the &quot;fair fight&quot; and acquit. Hickok was acquitted; the verdict was not necessarily universally popular with the press and public. There have been contemporary instances of activists being arrested for informing jurists of their right of jury nullification in front of court houses, with subsequent rulings that arresting people for this activity is unconstitutional.

====Fugitive Slave Act====
Juries across the North acquitted defendants who had clearly breached the Fugitive Slave Act in the 1850s. Part of the Compromise of 1850, it had been passed to mollify Southern slaveowners, who were otherwise threatening to secede from the Union. Secretary of State Daniel Webster was a key supporter of the law as expressed in his famous &quot;Seventh of March&quot; speech. He wanted high-profile convictions, but the jury nullifications ruined his presidential aspirations and his last-ditch efforts to find a compromise between North and South. Webster led the prosecution when defendants were accused of rescuing Shadrach Minkins in 1851 from Boston officials who intended to return Minkins to his owner. The juries convicted none of the men. Webster tried to enforce a law that was extremely unpopular in the North, and his Whig Party passed over him again when it chose a presidential nominee in 1852.

====After Civil War====
White defendants accused of crimes against black people and other minorities were often acquitted by all-white juries, especially in the South, even in the face of irrefutable evidence. An example is the trial of Roy Bryant and J. W. Milam.

====21st century====
In the 21st century, many discussions of jury nullification center on drug laws, which some consider unjust in principle or because they are seen to discriminate against certain groups. A jury nullification advocacy group estimates that 3–4% of all jury trials involve nullification, and a recent rise in hung juries is seen by some as being indirect evidence that juries have begun to consider the validity or the fairness of the laws themselves.

====Judicial opinion====
In the 1895 case of &quot;Sparf v. United States&quot;, written by Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, the US Supreme Court held 5-4 that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws. That decision, often cited, has led to a common practice by US judges to penalize anyone who attempts to present a nullification argument to jurors and to declare a mistrial if such argument has been presented to them. In some states, jurors are likely to be struck from the panel during &quot;voir dire&quot; if they do not agree to accept as correct the rulings and instructions of the law as provided by the judge.

In later rulings the courts continued to prohibit informing juries about jury nullification. In a 1969, Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, &quot;U.S. v. Moylan&quot;, 417 F.2d 1002 (4th Cir.1969), the Court affirmed the concept of jury nullification, but upheld the power of a court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect. In 1972, in &quot;United States v. Dougherty&quot;, 473 F.2d 1113, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling similar to &quot;Moylan&quot; that affirmed the &quot;de facto&quot; power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense&#x27;s chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify.

In 1988, the Sixth Circuit upheld a jury instruction: &quot;There is no such thing as valid jury nullification.&quot; In &quot;United States v. Thomas&quot; (1997), the Second Circuit ruled that jurors can be removed if there is evidence that they intend to nullify the law. The Supreme Court has not recently confronted the issue of jury nullification. In 2017, a jury was instructed: &quot;You cannot substitute your sense of justice, whatever that means, for your duty to follow the law, whether you agree with it or not. It is not for you to determine whether the law is just or whether the law is unjust. That cannot be your task. There is no such thing as valid jury nullification. You would violate your oath and the law if you willfully brought a verdict contrary to the law given to you in this case.&quot; The Ninth Circuit upheld the first three sentences of the jury&#x27;s instruction and overruled the remainder but deemed that instruction a harmless error and affirmed the conviction.

====State laws====
In 2002, South Dakota voters rejected by a 78% margin a state constitutional amendment to permit criminal defendants to argue for jury nullification. On June 18, 2012, New Hampshire passed a law explicitly allowing defense attorneys to inform juries about jury nullification. On October 24, 2014, the New Hampshire Supreme Court effectively nullified the law and held that the wording of the statute does not allow defense attorneys to tell juries they can nullify a law. The Maryland State Constitution, Declaration of Rights, states that &quot;in the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.&quot; Nevertheless, the Maryland Courts jury service brochure states that &quot;it is your duty to accept what the judge is saying about the law, and how it is to be applied to the case.&quot;

<text>André de Latour, comte de Lorde (1869–1942) was a French playwright, the main author of the Grand Guignol plays from 1901 to 1926. His evening career was as a dramatist of terror; during daytimes he worked as a librarian in the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Arsenal. He wrote 150 plays, all of them devoted mainly to the exploitation of terror and insanity, and a few novels. For plays the subject matter of which concerned mental illness he sometimes collaborated with psychologist Alfred Binet, the developer of IQ testing.

During the 1920s de Lorde was elected &quot;Prince of Fear&quot; (&quot;Prince de la Terreur&quot;) by his peers.

<text>Bielefeld () is a city in the Ostwestfalen-Lippe Region in the north-east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. With a population of 341,755, it is also the most populous city in the administrative region () of Detmold and the 18th largest city in Germany.

The historical centre of the city is situated north of the Teutoburg Forest line of hills, but modern Bielefeld also incorporates boroughs on the opposite side and on the hills. The city is situated on the &quot;Hermannsweg&quot;, a hiking trail which runs for 156 km along the length of the Teutoburg Forest.

Bielefeld is home to a significant number of internationally operating companies, including Dr. Oetker, DMG Mori (former Gildemeister), Möller Group, Goldbeck and Schüco. It has a university and several technical colleges (). Bielefeld is also known for the Bethel Institution.

==History==

Founded in 1214 by Count Hermann IV of Ravensberg to guard a pass crossing the Teutoburg Forest, Bielefeld was the &quot;city of linen&quot; as a minor member of the Hanseatic League, known for bleachfields into the 19th century. Bielefeld was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia when it was created in 1807. In 1815 it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia following the defeat of France and the Congress of Vienna.

After the Cologne-Minden railway opened in 1849, the Bozi brothers constructed the first large mechanised spinning mill in 1851. The Ravensberg Spinning Mill was built from 1854 to 1857, and metal works began to open in the 1860s.

Founded in 1867 as a Bielefeld sewing machine repair company, Dürkoppwerke AG employed 1,665 people in 1892; it used Waffenamt code &quot;WaA547&quot; from 1938 to 1939 as the Dürkopp-Werke, and merged with other Bielefeld companies to form Dürkopp Adler AG in 1990.

Between 1904 and 1930, Bielefeld grew, opening a rebuilt railway station, a municipal theatre, and finally, the Rudolf-Oetker-Halle concert hall, renowned for its excellent acoustics. The Dürkopp car was produced 1898–1927. After printing emergency money () in 1923 during the inflation in the Weimar Republic, Bielefeld was one of several towns that printed very attractive and highly collectable banknotes with designs on silk, linen and velvet. These pieces were issued by the Bielefeld Stadtsparkasse (town&#x27;s savings bank) and were sent all around the world in the early 1920s. These pieces are known as &quot;Stoffgeld&quot; – that is, money made from fabric.

The town&#x27;s synagogue was burned in 1938 during the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom carried out against Jewish population. In 1944, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the USAAF bombed the gas works at Bielefeld on 20 September and the marshaling yard on 30 September; Bielefeld was bombed again on 7 October and the RAF bombed the town on the night of 4/5 December. On 17 January 1945, B-17s bombed the nearby Paderborn marshalling yard, and the railway viaduct in the suburb of Schildesche. On 14 March the RAF bombed the viaduct again, wrecking it. This was the first use of the RAF&#x27;s 10 tonne Grand Slam bomb. American troops entered the city in April 1945. 

Due to the presence of a number of barracks built during the 1930s and its location next to the main East-West Autobahn in northern Germany, after World War II Bielefeld became a headquarters town for the fighting command of the British Army of the Rhine – BAOR (the administrative and strategic headquarters were at Rheindahlen near the Dutch border). Until the 1980s there was a large British presence in the barracks housing the headquarters of the British First Corps and support units, as well as schools, NAAFI shops, officers&#x27; and sergeants&#x27; messes and several estates of married quarters. The British presence was heavily scaled back after the reunification of Germany and most of the infrastructure has disappeared.

In 1973 the first villages on the south side of the Teutoburg Forest were incorporated.

Starting in 1994, the city has been featured in the humorous Bielefeld conspiracy which satirises conspiracy theories by claiming that the city does not exist.

Bielefeld was a linen-producing town, and in the early 1920s the Town&#x27;s Savings Bank (Stadtsparkasse) issued money made of linen, silk and velvet. These items were known as &#x27;stoffgeld&#x27;.

In addition to the manufacture of home appliances and various heavy industries, Bielefeld companies include Dr. Oetker (food manufacturing), Möller Group (leather products and plastics), Seidensticker (clothing and textiles) and Bethel Institution with 17.000 employees.

==Transport==
Two major &quot;autobahns&quot;, the A 2 and A 33, intersect in the south east of Bielefeld. The &quot;Ostwestfalendamm&quot; expressway connects the two parts of the city, naturally divided by the Teutoburg Forest. Bielefeld Hauptbahnhof, the main railway station of Bielefeld, is on the Hamm–Minden railway and is part of the German ICE high-speed railroad system. The main station for intercity bus services is Brackwede station.

Bielefeld has a small airstrip, Flugplatz Bielefeld, in the Senne district but is mainly served by the three larger airports nearby, Paderborn Lippstadt Airport, Münster Osnabrück Airport and Hannover Airport.

Bielefeld boasts a well-developed public transport system, served mainly by the companies &quot;moBiel&quot; (formerly &quot;Stadtwerke Bielefeld – Verkehrsbetriebe&quot;) and &quot;BVO&quot;. The Bielefeld Stadtbahn has four major lines and regional trains connect different parts of the city with nearby counties. Buses also run throughout the area.

==Main sights==

Sparrenburg Castle is Bielefeld&#x27;s characteristic landmark. It was built between 1240 and 1250 by Count Ludwig von Ravensberg. The tower and the catacombs of the castle are open to the public.

The Linen Weavers&#x27; Monument, with the German name &quot;Leineweber-Denkmal&quot;, created by the Tyrolean sculptor Perathoner, has been one of Bielefeld&#x27;s most recognisable symbols for over 100 years. It stands as a reminder of the time when the city gained importance through the production of linen, with the traditional crafts of spinning and weaving, and its high-quality linen became known worldwide, characterised by its own seal of quality.

The Old City Hall (&quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;) was built in 1904 and still serves the same function. Its façade reflects the so-called Weserrenaissance and features elements of various architectural styles, including Gothic and Renaissance. Though the mayor still holds office in the Old City Hall, most of the city&#x27;s administration is housed in the adjacent New City Hall (&quot;Neues Rathaus&quot;).


The City Theatre (&quot;Stadttheater&quot;) is part of the same architectural ensemble as the Old City Hall, also built in 1904. It has a notable Jugendstil façade, is Bielefeld&#x27;s largest theatre and home of the Bielefeld Opera. Another theatre (&quot;Theater am Alten Markt&quot;) resides in the former town hall building on the Old Market Square (&quot;Alter Markt&quot;), which also contains a row of restored 16th and 17th-century townhouses with noteworthy late Gothic and Weser Renaissance style façades (&quot;Bürgerhäuser am Alten Markt&quot;).

The oldest city church is &quot;Altstädter Nicolaikirche&quot;. It is a Gothic hall church with a height of . It was founded in 1236 by the Bishop of Paderborn, and enlarged at the beginning of the 14th century. The church was damaged in World War II and later rebuilt. Three times a day, a carillon can be heard. The most valuable treasure of this church is a carved altar from Antwerp, decorated with 250 figures. A small museum housed within illustrates the history of the church up to World War II.

The largest church is the &quot;Neustädter Marienkirche&quot;, a Gothic hall church dating back to 1293, completed 1512. It stands tall and has a length of . Historically speaking, this building is considered to be the most precious possession of the town. It was the starting point of the Protestant Reformation in Bielefeld in 1553. A valuable wing-altar with 13 pictures, known as the &quot;Marienaltar&quot; is also kept inside. The baroque spires were destroyed in World War II and later replaced by two unusually-shaped &quot;Gothic&quot; clocktowers. The altarpiece of the Bielefeld church &quot;Neustädter Marienkirche&quot; from around 1400 is among the most prominent masterpieces of artwork of the German Middle Ages. Two of the altarpieces, &quot;The Flagellation&quot; and &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; are now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

Bielefeld is also the seat of the two largest Protestant social welfare establishments (&quot;Diakonie&quot;) in Europe, the Bethel Institution and the &quot;Evangelisches Johanneswerk&quot;.

Other important cultural sights of the region are the art museum (Kunsthalle), the Rudolf-Oetker-Halle concert hall, the city&#x27;s municipal botanical garden (Botanischer Garten Bielefeld) and the Olderdissen Heimat-Zoo, a zoological garden based on German wildlife. Bielefeld is home to the widely known Bielefelder Kinderchor, founded in 1932 by Friedrich Oberschelp as the first mixed children&#x27;s choir in Germany. It became famous for its recordings and concerts of traditional German Christmas carols, filling the Rudolf-Oetker-Halle several times each season. Foreign tours have taken the choir to many European countries, and also the U.S. and Japan.

On Hünenburg there is an observation tower, next to a radio tower.

== Sport ==

Bielefeld is home to the professional football team DSC Arminia Bielefeld. Currently a member of 3. Liga in the 2023-24 season, the club plays at the SchücoArena stadium in the west of the town centre.

Bielefeld is home to the Radrennbahn Bielefeld bike racing track.

<text>John Abbott College (French: &quot;Collège John Abbott)&quot; is an English-language public college located in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada, near the western tip of the Island of Montreal. John Abbott College is one of eight English public colleges in Quebec. The college primarily serves the Greater Montreal Region. The CEGEP shares grounds with McGill University&#x27;s Macdonald Campus.

==History==
The college was accredited in 1970 and opened the next year. It is housed in early 20th-century buildings on a campus shared with McGill University&#x27;s Macdonald College. The college is named after John Abbott, prime minister, and former mayor of Montreal who owned a country estate in nearby Senneville. He is most remembered for his role in the Pacific Scandal, the political corruption case which brought down the government of Sir John A. Macdonald in 1873.

The college originally planned to build a new campus in Pointe-Claire next to Fairview Shopping Centre. It &quot;temporarily&quot; moved into buildings on the Macdonald College campus that had been vacated the previous year by McGill&#x27;s Faculty of Education when it moved to its downtown campus. Additional temporary facilities were rented on Hymus Boulevard in Kirkland, known as the Kirkland Campus. A shuttle bus connected the two campuses. In 1973, the college decided to consolidate the college in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue by constructing a new building (subsequently named the Casgrain Centre) and renovating the existing buildings. The Kirkland Campus closed in December 1979, and the construction and renovations in Sainte-Anne were completed in 1981. It remained the last college in Quebec to be renting its campus until 2002, when it bought its buildings from the University. McGill University still owns and operates the majority of the land on campus.

==Campus==
Housed in century-old renovated buildings in historic Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, the college has long been recognized as a prominent landmark in Montreal&#x27;s West Island community. 
Characterized by tiled roofs and red brick buildings, the college is situated on the shores of Lake Saint-Louis. With its distinctive architecture, trees and rolling green lawns in a charming semi-rural setting, the college&#x27;s campus has earned a reputation for being one of the most beautiful in the public system. There are a total of ten buildings on campus, all of which are connected to each other in some fashion (with the exception of Brittain Hall).

===Brittain Hall===
Brittain Hall houses the Continuing Education centre of the college and honours the memory of Dr. W. H. Brittain, former Vice Principal of Macdonald College. It was a men&#x27;s residence until 1981. Most of the building remains closed due to severe damage caused by a fire in 1981.

===Casgrain Centre===
The Casgrain Centre houses the sports complex, as well as the theatre and art studios of the college, and is named in honour of Thérèse Casgrain, a Canadian senator who was an advocate for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.
The Casgrain building also houses a café, a large student lounge, and the student Agora, an indoor multi-use area for hosting trade fairs, musical performances, movie screenings, exhibitions, and other student-related events and activities.
===Herzberg building===
The Herzberg building is the central building on campus, housing classrooms and labs for a variety of subjects. The building is also home to essential student services, such as the college library, the Oval coffeehouse, offices for various clubs, the Print Services office, as well as offices for both the director general and the academic dean. Herzberg also houses the Agora, a large open space used for presentations, career fairs and some ceremonies. 
Other student services located in the Herzberg building include the Indigenous Student Resource Centre, Academic Advising, Counselling Services, the Student Employment Centre, Financial Assistance office, Health and Wellness Centre, the Learning Centre, Legal Advisory Services, Registrar&#x27;s office, the Access Centre, Student Activities and the University and Career Information Centre. 
The building is named in honour of Gerhard Herzberg, a pioneering German Canadian physicist and physical chemist who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1971.

===Hochelaga building===
The Hochelaga building houses classrooms for a variety of courses, including history, economics, political science, humanities, philosophy, religion, psychology and sociology, as well as program-specific courses for business administration, commerce, correctional intervention, information and library technologies, and police technology programs.
The building was named after a lost Iroquoian village visited by Jaques Cartier in 1534, which carried the same name, in honour of Canada&#x27;s Indigenous people.

===Penfield building===
The Penfield building houses classrooms for English, creative arts, French, foreign language and geography courses. It also houses a number of professional programs, including the computer science, engineering technologies, Paramedic care and publication design and hypermedia technology.
The building houses an auditorium, as well as the offices of the Student Union (SUJAC) and the John Abbott College Faculty Association (JACFA). The Pedagogical Computer Centre (PCC) is located on the third floor of the building, home to labs with the necessary materials to conduct courses requiring student computer use.
The building is named after Dr. Wilder Graves Penfield, a famous American-born Canadian neurosurgeon.
===Anne-Marie Edward Science building===
Opened in 2012, the Anne-Marie Edward Science Building is the location of the Science and Health Technologies departments. It is located between Herzberg and Stewart buildings. The AME building is distinctly modern when compared to the rest of the campus. By comparison, Herzberg has a total of 5 floors, including the basement, while AME has a total of 6 floors. The building contains 33 laboratories and 11 classrooms, along with over 50 staff offices. The building is solely reserved for the school&#x27;s biology, biopharmaceutical, chemistry, nursing, physics, and prehospital emergency care departments. The building&#x27;s name commemorates Polytechnique victim and John Abbott College alumna Anne-Marie Edward.

===Stewart Hall===
Stewart Hall is home to a small number of classrooms, the college bookstore, the college cafeteria, as well as administrative offices and the college boardroom. The building honours the memory of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Stewart, benefactors to Macdonald College.

===Other buildings===

====Stewart East====
Connected to the eastern side of the Stewart Apartments, Stewart East is home to classrooms for the dental hygiene program and the college&#x27;s own dental clinic.

====Jones Building====
The Jones building was once accessible via the Hochelaga building. However, changes have resulted in the building only being accessible from outdoors. The second floor contains offices used by the football program.

==Programs==
Pre-university programs usually consist of four semesters (2 years), while career programs usually consist of six (3 years).

==Students==
===Composition===
Over 6000 students are enrolled in the Day Division and about 2100 are in the Continuing Education Division. The college primarily serves the western end of the Montreal metropolitan area, although it also has students from other parts of Quebec, the rest of Canada and approximately one hundred international students.

===Stewart Apartments===
The Stewart Apartments are co-educational residences for full-time students attending John Abbott College. They are the only student residences in the Montreal area that are directly operated by a public English-language college.

===Student Union===
The Student Union of John Abbott College (SUJAC) promotes and defends students&#x27; rights and interests. SUJAC is the official liaison between the students and the college, representing students on committees, organizing student events, and overseeing the allocation of certain student fees for the various clubs that operate throughout the college. SUJAC works on behalf of students and informs them on relevant issues and college matters. The president of SUJAC for the 2024-2025 Academic Year is Luca Quintana. The VP Internal of SUJAC this year is Jordan Powell. The VP External is Vanshika Manan. The VP Finance is Emma Pitts. The VP Academic is Vince Joshua Lacap. The VP communications for this year is Zonaira Raja.

===Student life===
The college community offers a variety of extracurricular activities and clubs. The college operates its own radio station, &quot;CSKY radio&quot;, giving students the opportunity to explore the world of broadcasting. The student newspaper &quot;Bandersnatch&quot; has been published biweekly since the college&#x27;s establishment in 1971. John Abbott College Model United Nations Club (JACMUN) hosts an annual Model United Nations conference in the spring, which has been personally recognized by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a salient effort to promote political awareness and participation amongst youth.

<doc id="180351" wikidata="Q1139930" url="?curid=180351" title="1975 Cricket World Cup">
<text>The 1975 Cricket World Cup (officially called the Prudential Cup &#x27;75) was the inaugural men&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, and the first major tournament in the history of One Day International (ODI) cricket. Organised by the International Cricket Conference (ICC), it took place in England, between 7 June and 21 June 1975.

The tournament was sponsored by Prudential Assurance Company and had eight participating countries: the six Test-playing teams of the time – Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, the West Indies – and the two leading Associate nations at the time – Sri Lanka and East Africa. The teams were divided into two groups of four, with each team playing each other in their group once; the top two from each group qualified for the semi-finals, with the winners of these matches meeting in the final. Each match consisted of 60 overs per team and was played in traditional white clothing and with red balls; all were played and ended in daylight.

England and New Zealand finished as the top two teams in Group A, while the West Indies finished top of the Group B table ahead of Australia as the four teams qualified through to the semi-finals. After Australia defeated England and the West Indies defeated New Zealand in the semi-finals, the West Indies which came into the tournament as favourites, defeated Australia in the final at Lord&#x27;s by 17 runs to become the first World Cup winners. New Zealand batsman, Glenn Turner was the top run-scorer for the tournament with 333 runs, whilst Australian bowler Gary Gilmour was the top wicket-taker with 11 wickets despite only playing in the final two matches.

==Background==
The first multilateral cricket competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England. This was played between the three test nations at the time – England, Australia and South Africa. The concept was later dropped because of inclement weather and a lack of public interest. The first one-day match to occur was in 1962 when four English county cricket teams filled in a gap to play in a limited overs knockout competition. It was won by Northamptonshire who defeated Leicestershire by five wickets.

The limited-over format had been used in what sponsors marketed as a &#x27;World Cricket Cup&#x27; in England in 1966 and 1967, contested between England, a Rest of the World XI, and a touring team (the West Indies in 1966 and Pakistan in 1967). The marketing of the event was clearly influenced by the hosting of the 1966 FIFA World Cup in the same country. The 1966 &#x27;World Cricket Cup&#x27; was won by England, that in 1967 by the Rest of the World. A report in the &quot;Cricketer&quot; implied that the last such match in this &quot;Triangular Tournament&quot;, between Pakistan and the Rest of the World was neither well-attended nor taken entirely seriously: &quot;It was a pity that a larger crowd was not present ... Sobers took the Cup and the World Xl took the gold medals. They must have enjoyed their holiday&quot;.

It was not until 1971 that the first official One Day International (ODI) took place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as a replacement for the third test of the 1970–71 Ashes series between Australia and England. This was due to a deluge of rain that had affected the match for the first three days of the test. The match was a forty over match with each over being eight deliveries. After England made 190 from 39.4 overs, Australia chased the target at a steady rate to secure the match with 42 balls remaining. Two years later at Lord&#x27;s during the 1973 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, plans were made for a men&#x27;s tournament to take place in 1975. The tournament was planned to involve all the Test nations at the time in two group stages with the top two in each group qualifying for the knockout stage with the final at Lord&#x27;s.

==Format==
The format of the 1975 Cricket World Cup had the eight teams split into two groups of four, with each team playing the others in their group once. Each match was played over 60 overs per side with group stage matches scheduled to take place between 7 and 14 June. Each match was played entirely during day, with a cut off time of 7.30 pm. Three days were allocated to each match with each able to be continued if they were halted for rain or bad light.

The top two teams from each group advanced to the semi-finals on 18 June, with the winners qualifying for the final at Lord&#x27;s on 21 June.

==Participants==

Eight teams were invited to compete at the World Cup: the six full members of the International Cricket Conference (ICC), and two other sides – Sri Lanka and East Africa. South Africa was not allowed to complete due to the sporting boycott of the country which took place during apartheid era, the ICC having placed a moratorium on tours of the country in 1970.

Before the competition began the teams were split into two groups. The ICC made the decision to place the two teams which were not Test playing countries in separate groups. They also decided to place England and Australia in separate groups and to do the same with India and Pakistan.

==Venues==
Six grounds were used to host matches during the tournament. The announcement of venues began on 26 July 1973 when the ICC announced that the tournament would be played, with Lord&#x27;s as the venue for the final. The remaining venues were announced on 5 November 1974, with the scheduling for the tournament announced alongside that for the five county cricket tournaments that would take place during the 1975 season.

Other than Lord&#x27;s, which hosted only one group stage match, and The Oval which hosted three, each of the grounds was used for two matches during the group stage. Headingley and The Oval were the grounds chosen for the two semi-finals.

==Squads==
Before the competition began each team named a squad of 14 players.

== Preparations ==
Heading into the first Cricket World Cup, the Ladbrokes betting agency had the West Indies as the favourites at 9–4. This was followed by England at 11–4 with Pakistan and Australia in third and fourth respectively. East Africa was last in the betting odds at 1500–1. Before the tournament, most of the teams played in warm-up matches against English county sides to get used to the English conditions with most of the national teams getting wins. Only East Africa, Sri Lanka and India lost at least one warm-up match before the tournament. Australia played in Canada, losing to Eastern Canada and drawing with Toronto, before heading to England.

Eight days before the World Cup, the ICC declared in a unanimous decision that any of the balls that went over a batsman&#x27;s head would be called wide due to the fast short-pitched bowling.

==Group stage==
===Summary===
The opening round of matches took place on 7 June with four matches being played. The match at Lord&#x27;s saw England deliver the highest score by a team in the 60 over match with 334 runs being scored. Dennis Amiss top scored for the English with 137 from 147 balls helped by Keith Fletcher and Chris Old who each recorded a half-century. In response, Sunil Gavaskar batted through the entire innings for only 36 runs in which Gulabrai Ramchand thought that he was doing some batting practice. Australia opened their campaign with a win against Pakistan at Headingley with a 73-run victory. This was due to Dennis Lillee&#x27;s five-wicket haul which brought Pakistan&#x27;s hope of a win crashing down as they collapsed from 181 for four to be all out for 205. Earlier, Ross Edwards top scored for Australia with 80 as he aided the Australians in getting 94 runs from the last 13 overs to bring Australia to 278 for seven from their 60 overs. The other two matches saw easy wins for the West Indies and New Zealand. For Glenn Turner, he occupied the crease during the whole New Zealand innings as he top scored with 171 as New Zealand won by 181 runs over East Africa. The West Indies took a nine-wicket victory over Sri Lanka who became the first team to score under 100 runs in a One Day International.

Despite missing two players due to operation – Asif Iqbal – and examinations – Imran Khan – Pakistan was not fazed by the missing players in the second round of games with the team scoring 266 for seven from their 60 overs with standing captain Majid Khan top scoring for Pakistan with 60. In response, the West Indies fell to 166 for eight which included a period of three wickets for only 10 runs as Bernard Julien, Clive Lloyd and Keith Boyce all losing their wickets. But the last wicket pair of Deryck Murray and Andy Roberts stole the match away as the West Indies won by a wicket off the final over. The other match in Group B saw Australia claim their second victory, but it was not all smooth with the Australian captain Ian Chappell remarking in an interview that the English media was trying to unsettle Australia&#x27;s plans due to the Jeff Thomson no-ball problem with Chappell saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen this sort of thing before in England&quot;. On the field, Alan Turner scored a century as Australia ended with 328 with Sri Lanka falling 52 runs short as John Mason from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that they might not have many new admirers with their short ball stuff sending two Sri Lankan batsman to hospital. Group A saw two convincing wins to England and India. At Trent Bridge, Keith Fletcher top scored for England with 131 as he guided the English to their second victory and going to the lead of the group table with an 80-run win over New Zealand. The other match in Group A saw 720 spectators observe India record a 10-wicket victory with Madan Lal taking three wickets for India in which East Africa fell only 120.

With the match sold out four days in advance, the West Indies took on Australia to see who would finish top of Group B. With the ball swinging in the air, the pair of Rod Marsh and Ross Edwards guided Australia to 192 with a 99-run partnership for the sixth wicket after Australia fell to 61/5. In response, the West Indies went on to take a seven-wicket victory with Alvin Kallicharran top scoring with 78, which included a period of 31 runs of nine Dennis Lillee deliveries as the West Indies finished top of Group B. Pakistan ended their tournament with a 192-run victory over Sri Lanka at Trent Bridge with half centuries to Zaheer Abbas, Majid Khan and Sadiq Mohammad. In Group A, New Zealand sealed their spot in the semi-finals with a four-wicket victory over India off the back of a century from Glenn Turner as he hit twelve fours on his way to an unbeaten innings of 114. The other match in Group A saw England clinch a 196-run victory over East Africa; England scored 290/5 from their 60 overs off the back of a 158-run opening partnership between Dennis Amiss and Barry Wood before a bowling attack led by John Snow (taking 4 for 11 from his 12 overs) ran through the East Africans, who were bowled out for 94 in 52.3 overs. Only Ramesh Sethi offered much resistance, lasting for 32 overs to score 30.

===Group A===


===Group B===



==Knockout stage==
The knockout stage of the Cricket World Cup consisted of two single-elimination rounds leading to a final. If the match was delayed due to rain there were two reserve days to play out the match.
===Semi-finals===
The first semi-final was between England and Australia at Headingley. For Australia, their one change in bringing in Gary Gilmour for Ashley Mallett proved critical in booking Australia&#x27;s spot into the final. This was due to the grassy pitch that both captains would criticise after the match. After Australia elected to field first, Gilmour took six wickets for 14 runs as he had England at 37 for seven after he bowled his 12 overs. Mike Denness attempted to bring England back but would lose his wicket as England fell for 93. In the run-chase, Australia collapsed to 39 for six before Gilmour partnered with Doug Walters as they chased the remaining runs to earn Australia a berth in the final.

The second semi-final was between the West Indies and New Zealand at The Oval. Batting first, New Zealand reached 92 for only one loss at the lunch break. After lunch though, they collapsed to 158 with Geoff Howarth top scoring for New Zealand with 51, while Bernard Julien was the top wicket taker with four wickets. In the run chase, a 125-run second wicket partnership between Alvin Kallicharran (top scoring with 72) and Gordon Greenidge (55 runs) laid the foundation for a five-wicket victory with Richard Collinge being the only bowler to be troublesome for the West Indies with figures of three for 28 runs from his twelve overs.
----
===Final===

The final match on 21 June was sold out three days beforehand. With the West Indies being favourites for the match, they were asked by Ian Chappell to bat first and would go on to score 291 for eight wickets from 60 overs. After being given a second chance from a Ross Edwards dropped chance at mid-wicket, Clive Lloyd went on to top score for the West Indies with 102. Gary Gilmour was the best of the Australian bowlers with five wickets for 48 runs. In response, Ian Chappell scored a half-century to set up the foundation for Australia before three run-outs from the hands of Viv Richards put the pressure on Australia as they collapsed to 233 for nine. A final-wicket partnership of 41 from Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson brought Australia within 18 runs of victory. But a fifth run-out of the innings saw Australia bowled out for 274 and would see the West Indies win by 17 runs, claiming the first men&#x27;s World Cup.

==Statistics==

Glenn Turner of New Zealand ended the tournament as the leading run scorer for the 1975 edition with his 333 runs coming in four games which included an unbeaten 171 against East Africa, which was also the highest score of the tournament. In second place was English player Dennis Amiss with Pakistan&#x27;s Majid Khan rounding out the top three. Australian player Gary Gilmour was the tournament&#x27;s leading wicket taker with 11 wickets from his two games, which included the best tournament figures in the semi-finals when he took six wickets for 14 against England. Bernard Julien and Keith Boyce (both from the West Indies) finished in second place, both getting 10 wickets for the tournament.

<text>The BT Tower is a grade II listed communications tower in Fitzrovia, London, England, owned by BT Group. It has also been known as the GPO Tower, the Post Office Tower, and the Telecom Tower. The main structure is high, with aerial rigging bringing the total height to .

Upon completion in 1964, it was the tallest structure in London and remained so until 1980. Butlins managed a revolving restaurant in the tower from 1966 until 1971. A 360° LED screen displays news across central London.

In February 2024, the sale of the tower to MCR Hotels, was announced.

==History==
===Design and construction===
The tower was commissioned by the GPO. Its primary purpose was to support the microwave aerials then used to carry telecommunications traffic from London to the rest of the country, as part of the GPO microwave network.

It replaced a shorter, 1940s steel lattice tower on the roof of the neighbouring Museum Telephone Exchange. The taller structure was required to protect the radio links&#x27; line of sight against tall buildings then planned in London. Links were routed via GPO microwave stations Harrow Weald, Bagshot, Kelvedon Hatch and Fairseat, and locations including the London Air Traffic Control Centre.

The tower was designed by the Ministry of Public Building and Works, under chief architects Eric Bedford and G R Yeats. Typical for its time, the building is concrete clad in glass. The narrow cylindrical shape was chosen as a stable platform for microwave aerials. It shifts no more than in wind speeds of up to 150 km/h (95 mph). To prevent overheating, the glass cladding had to be tinted.

Construction began in June 1961; owing to the building&#x27;s height and its having a tower crane jib across the top virtually throughout the whole construction period, it gradually became a very prominent landmark that could be seen from almost anywhere in London. A question was raised in Parliament in August 1963 about the crane. Reginald Bennett MP asked the Minister of Public Buildings and Works, Geoffrey Rippon, how, when the crane on the top of the new Tower had fulfilled its purpose, he proposed to remove it. Rippon replied: &quot;This is a matter for the contractors. The problem does not have to be solved for about a year but there appears to be no danger of the crane having to be left in situ.&quot; Construction reached 475 ft by August 1963. The revolving restaurant was prefabricated by Ransomes &amp; Rapier and the lattice tower by Stewarts &amp; Lloyds subsidiary Tubewrights.

The tower was topped out on 15 July 1964, by Geoffrey Rippon and inaugurated by Prime Minister Harold Wilson on 8 October 1965. The main contractor was Peter Lind &amp; Company.

The tower was originally designed to be just high; its foundations are sunk down through of London clay, and are formed of a concrete raft square, thick, reinforced with six layers of cables, on top of which sits a reinforced concrete pyramid.

Initially, the first 16 floors were for technical equipment and power. Above that was a section for the microwave aerials, then six floors of suites, a revolving restaurant, kitchens, technical equipment, and finally a cantilevered steel lattice tower. The construction cost was £2.5 million.

The first microwave link would be to Norwich on 1 January 1965. The Met Office put a weather radar on top of the tower. Much of the telecommunications equipment was made by GEC. The stainless steel clad windows were made by Henry Hope &amp; Sons Ltd.

===Opening===

The tower was opened to the public on 19 May 1966, by Postmaster General, Anthony Wedgewood Benn and Billy Butlin, with HM Queen Elizabeth II having visited on 17 May 1966.

As well as communications equipment and office space, there were viewing galleries and a souvenir shop. Butlins&#x27; Top of the Tower revolving restaurant on the 34th floor made one revolution every 23 minutes and meals cost about £4.

In the first year there were nearly one million visitors, and over 100,000 diners.

===Bombing===
A bomb exploded in the ceiling of the men&#x27;s toilets at the Top of the Tower restaurant at 04:30 on 31 October 1971, the blast damaged buildings and cars up to away. Responsibility for the bomb was claimed by members of the Angry Brigade, a far-left anarchist collective. A call was also made by a person claiming to be the Kilburn Battalion of the IRA.

The restaurant was closed to the general public following the 1971 bombing. In 1980, Butlins&#x27; restaurant lease expired.

The tower has been used for events including a children&#x27;s Christmas party and Children in Need 2010. It retains the revolving floor.

===Recent===
The tower&#x27;s microwave aerials remained in use into the 21st century, connected to subterranean optical fibre links.

In 2009, a 360° coloured screen was installed up, over the 36 and 37th floors of the tower. It replaced an earlier light projection system and incorporated 529,750 LEDs arranged in 177 vertical strips around the tower. It was then the largest of its type in the world, occupying an area of and with a circumference of . It displayed a countdown of the number of days until the start of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In April 2019, the screen broadcast a Windows 7 error message for almost a day.

In October 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the revolving restaurant would be reopened in time for the 2012 London Olympics. However, in December 2010, it was noted those plans had been &quot;quietly dropped&quot;.

For the tower&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the 34th floor was opened for three days from 3 to 5 October 2015 to 2,400 winners of a lottery.

The BT Tower was given Grade II listed building status in 2003. Several of the defunct antennae attached to the building were protected by this listing, meaning they could not be removed unless the appropriate listed building consent was granted. Permission for their removal was given in 2011 on safety grounds, as they were in a bad state of repair and the fixings were no longer secure. The last of the antennae was removed in December 2011, leaving the core of the tower visible.

Entry to the building is by two high-speed lifts, which travel at a top speed of 1400 feet per minute () and reach the top of the building in under 30 seconds. The original equipment was installed by the Express Lift Company, but it has since been replaced by elevators manufactured by ThyssenKrupp. Due to the confined space in the tower&#x27;s core, removing the motors of the old lifts involved creating an access hole in the cast iron shaft wall, and then cutting the 3-ton winch machines into pieces and bringing them down in one of the functioning lifts. In the 1960s an Act of Parliament was passed to vary fire regulations, allowing the building to be evacuated by using the lifts – unlike other buildings of the time.

In 2006, the tower began to be used for short-term air-quality observations by the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and this has continued in a more permanent form as BT Tower Observatory, an urban atmospheric pollution observatory to help monitor air quality in the capital. The aim is to measure pollutant levels above ground level to determine their source. One area of investigation is the long-range transport of fine particles from outside the city.

On 21 February 2024, BT Group announced the sale of BT Tower to MCR Hotels, who plan to retain the tower as a hotel.

==In popular culture==

The tower has appeared in novels, films and on television, including &quot;Smashing Time&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, &quot;The Union&quot; and &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;. It is toppled by a giant kitten in &quot;The Goodies&quot; 1971 &quot;King Kong&quot; parody &quot;Kitten Kong&quot;.

It was referenced by the Dudley Moore Trio&#x27;s track &quot;GPO Tower&quot; used in the soundtrack for &quot;Bedazzled&quot; in which it also appeared.

Two stamps depicting the tower, designed by Clive Abbott (born 1933), were issued in 1965.

===Races===
The first documented race up the tower&#x27;s stairs was on 18 April 1968, between University College London and Edinburgh University; it was won by an Edinburgh runner in 4 minutes, 46 seconds.

In 1969, eight university teams competed. John Pearson from Victoria University of Manchester was fastest in 5 minutes, 6 seconds.

In May 1969, the tops of the GPO Tower and the Empire State Building in New York City served as the start and finish lines of the Daily Mail Trans-Atlantic Air Race. The race between the two buildings was held over an eight-day period and commemorated the 50th Anniversary of the first non-stop transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown. A total of 21 prizes were offered to entrants for categories based on the type of aircraft they utilised and their direction of travel.

==Secrecy==
Information about the tower was designated an official secret and in 1978, journalist Duncan Campbell was tried for collecting information about such locations. The judge ordered the tower could only be referred to as &#x27;Location 23&#x27;.

It is often said that the tower did not appear on Ordnance Survey maps, despite being a tall structure in the middle of central London that had been open to the public. However, this is incorrect; the 1971 1:25,000 and 1981 1:10,000 Ordnance Survey maps show the tower as does the 1984 London A–Z street atlas.

In February 1993, MP Kate Hoey used the tower as an example of trivia being kept secret, and joked that she hoped parliamentary privilege allowed her to confirm that the tower existed and to state its street address.

<text>Harlaxton Manor is a Victorian country house in Harlaxton, Lincolnshire, England. The house was built for Gregory Gregory, a local squire and businessman. Gregory employed two of the leading architects of Victorian England, Anthony Salvin and William Burn and consulted a third, Edward Blore, during its construction. Its architecture, which combines elements of Jacobean and Elizabethan styles with Baroque decoration, makes it unique among England&#x27;s Jacobethan houses. Harlaxton is a Grade I listed building on the National Heritage List for England, and many other structures on the estate are also listed. The surrounding park and gardens are listed Grade II* on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It is now the British campus of the University of Evansville.

==History==
Harlaxton is first recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as Harleston. The current mansion is the second Harlaxton Manor. The first was built on a different site during the 14th century and was used as a hunting lodge by John of Gaunt. By 1619, Sir Daniel de Ligne purchased the manor. The original house was deserted after 1780; it was inherited by Gregory Gregory, and was torn down in 1857.

===Gregory family===
Gregory Gregory (1786–1854) was born Gregory Williams, adopting the surname Gregory when he inherited his uncle&#x27;s estates. His father was William Gregory Williams (1742–1814) and his mother Olivia Preston (1758–1835). In 1822 Gregory inherited Harlaxton Manor and other property from his uncle George de Ligne Gregory (1740–1822). The original Harlaxton Manor was an ancient building in need of repair so Gregory did not move to the house, living at the nearby Hungerton Hall. In 1831 he commissioned the architect Anthony Salvin to build his mansion, a process which took 20 years. Unmarried, childless, with no interest in traditional country pursuits, and averse to socialising and entertaining, the building of Harlaxton, and the acquisition of architectural elements, paintings, furniture and glass to fit it out, became Gregory&#x27;s all-consuming passion. The diarist Charles Greville, visiting during the house&#x27;s construction in the 1830s, recorded Gregory&#x27;s obsessive approach, [see box].

In 1851 Gregory moved into the completed manor with a staff of fourteen servants including a butler, a house keeper, three footmen, seven domestic maids and two grooms. By 1854 he was dead. The house was inherited by his cousin, George Gregory. Gregory had loathed his distant relation and attempted to bequeath Harlaxton to a friend but was unable to break the entail on the estate. George Gregory (1775–1860) had been born in London, son of Daniel Gregory (1747–1819). George did not follow his father&#x27;s occupation as a merchant and instead bought an estate in Lincolnshire. In 1825 at the age of 50, he married Elizabeth Price, twenty years his junior. They moved to Harlaxton after he received his inheritance. With other owners of large houses in the area, George decided to open the house to visitors. George died in 1860 at the manor and another distant relative, John Sherwin Gregory, inherited the house.

John Sherwin Gregory (1803–1869) was born John Sherwin Longden. His father was John Longden and his mother was Charlotte Mettam. His father had inherited Bramcote Manor in Nottinghamshire. When his father died in 1818, John received the Bramcote property, changing his surname to Sherwin, becoming John Sherwin Sherwin. In 1829 he married Catherine Holden. The couple lived at Bramcote until inheriting Harlaxton in 1860, at which point Sherwin again changed his surname, becoming John Sherwin Gregory.

John died in 1869 and Catherine continued to live at Harlaxton Manor until her death in 1892 at the age of 86. Her obituary recorded that she was highly regarded as a benefactor, both of the church at Harlaxton and of the sick and poor of the parish. When she died in 1892, Thomas Sherwin Pearson, who was the second cousin and godson of John Sherwin Gregory, inherited the manor. Thomas added Gregory to his surname, becoming Thomas Sherwin Pearson Gregory (1851–1935). He was born in Barwell, Leicestershire, son of General Thomas Hooke Pearson and Francis Elizabeth Ashby Mettam. Thomas&#x27; grandfather the Reverend George Metttam was the brother of John Sherwin Gregory&#x27;s mother Charlotte Mettam and was John&#x27;s second cousin. Thomas was educated at Rugby and the University of Oxford, becoming a first-class cricketer. In 1885 he married Mabel Laura Payne and, in his inheritance in 1892, moved to Harlaxton with his wife and their son Philip John Sherwin Pearson-Gregory (1888–1955), who himself inherited the estate in 1935. Philip decided not to live in the house and, following an auction of the contents which lasted three days, it was sold in 1937.

===20th century===
Violet Van der Elst, a businesswoman and inventor, made her money from developing the first brushless shaving cream and made her name by campaigning against capital punishment. She restored the house, having renamed it Grantham Castle, and had it wired for electricity, before losing almost all of her fortune in &quot;obsessive litigation&quot;. During the Second World War, Harlaxton was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force as the officers&#x27; mess for RAF Harlaxton and later to house a company of the 1st Airborne Division. In 1948, Harlaxton was purchased by the Society of Jesus, who used it as a novitiate. Stanford University leased Harlaxton Manor from the Jesuits in 1965, and with only 80 students in its first year, it was the first American university in Great Britain. Students attended classes from Monday to Thursday, often travelling on the weekends, similar to the Harlaxton schedule today. Stanford used the manor as part of its British study abroad programme. But the relative isolation of the house made it unpopular and the programme relocated to Cliveden in Berkshire in 1969.

===University of Evansville===

Harlaxton is now owned by the University of Evansville, operating as Harlaxton College, and is the base for their study-abroad programme. A number of other American universities also use the estate. Evansville began using the property in 1971 as its British campus, but it was bought personally by William Ridgway, a trustee of the university, and held by him until he donated it to the university in 1986. Immediately after the purchase the university began renovating the entire facility. Since 1984, Harlaxton Manor has also been the site of the annual Harlaxton Medieval Symposium, an interdisciplinary symposium on medieval art, literature and architecture. The house and gardens are occasionally opened for public tours.

====WUEV Harlaxton Bureau at Harlaxton College====

On 30 July 1997, 91.5 FM WUEV opened the Harlaxton Bureau at Harlaxton College, Lincolnshire, England. Shortly thereafter, Harlaxton Bureau correspondents covered the death of Princess Diana and were subsequently recognized by the Indiana Society of Professional Journalists. This made the University of Evansville the first American university project to have a student-run news bureau on a foreign campus.

====Media appearances====
The manor is a popular location for filming. Exterior and interior shots have featured in &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of Patton&quot;, &quot;The Lady and the Highwayman&quot;, &quot;The Haunting&quot;, &quot;The Young Visiters&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;.

==Architecture and description==

Nicholas Antram, in his revised &quot;Lincolnshire&quot; volume of the Pevsner &quot;Buildings of England&quot; published in 2002, describes the approach to Harlaxton Manor as a &quot;crescendo of effects&quot;. From the entrance gates on the A607, just outside of the village of Harlaxton, the drive descends into a valley before crossing a serpentine lake by way of a five-arch bridge. It then passes the Kitchen Gardens before going through an outer gatehouse. It continues past the stables before entering the Cour d&#x27;honneur through a second, double, gatehouse, described by Antram as a &quot;pyrotechnic display&quot;. The visitor is then confronted by the &quot;towering façade&quot; of the main house. Gregory employed three of the major architects of the Victorian era to achieve his effects; Anthony Salvin was responsible for the majority of the exterior work, Edward Blore was consulted, and William Burn undertook the conservatory and the kitchen range. There is debate among architectural historians as to who was responsible of the design of the interiors. Salvin had been dismissed by the time of their fitting out, and Burn seems unlikely. Historic England suggests that Gregory &quot;acted largely as his own architect&quot; and Antram and Mark Girouard agree that Gregory must have made a major contribution. But Jill Allibone, Salvin&#x27;s biographer, is certain that Gregory alone could not have been responsible for the extraordinary designs.

The house cost Gregory in the region of £100,000, (£ in adjusted for inflation) a significant sum for a landowner with an annual income of £12,000, but as it had been over 30 years in the planning and as building was undertaken at a leisurely pace, the sum was affordable from his income.

===Exterior===
Harlaxton is built to an Elizabethan E-plan. The foundation stone of the main central block was laid by Gregory in 1832 and it was complete externally by 1837. All of this is by Anthony Salvin, with Gregory&#x27;s input. The main construction materials are Ancaster stone ashlar and brick. Salvin enhanced the drama of the entrance front by making the entry at basement level, the corresponding garden elevation behind opens directly onto a parterre. The main architectural style is that of an Elizabethan or Jacobethan prodigy house, such as nearby Burghley or Wollaton Hall in Nottinghamshire, although with notable European influences. Mark Girouard, in his 1979 study, &quot;The Victorian Country House&quot;, records that Gregory had visited &quot;Bramshill, Hardwick, Hatfield, Knole, Burghley, Wollaton, Kirby Lonleat, Temple Newsam and the Oxford and Cambridge colleges &quot; in pursuit of Elizabethan inspiration. The uniqueness of Harlaxton, however, is the fusion of Elizabethan and Jacobean styles with the architecture and design of the Baroque. Girouard notes that this blending continues &quot;in varying proportions all through the house&quot; and suggests David Bryce, William Burn&#x27;s chief assistant, as a possible source.

====Entrance front====

The entrance front consists of a central block with a two-storey oriel window flanked by three-storey towers with bay windows and topped by cupolas. The doorway is framed by two pilasters. Behind this there is a square tower, with an octagonal turret containing a clock and again finishing in a cupola. The sources for all of these elements can be traced: the overall impression is of Burghley House; the pilasters are a direct lift from a 16th-century German architectural work, the &quot;Architectura&quot; by Wendel Dietterlin, a copy of which Gregory is known to have owned; the oriel is from Hengrave Hall in Suffolk. Antram also identifies elements from Northumberland House and from Stonyhurst. Girouard writes, &quot;the resulting impression of power, exuberance and abundance is sensational&quot;. To the left is a 
service wing by Burn, which is visually balanced by a gazebo to the right, drawn from Wollaton Hall.

====Inner and outer gatehouses====
By the time Gregory came to begin the building of the entrance to the cour d&#x27;honneur, Salvin had been dismissed. The reason for this is unclear, but the consensus among architectural historians is that disagreements of Gregory&#x27;s future plans for the design and decoration of his house led to an estrangement. After some consultations with Edward Blore, Gregory employed William Burn. Historic England credits Burn, his assistant David Bryce, and Gregory himself with the design of the gateway. Antram considers the lodges and screen to be unlike anything else in England of that date, and comparable only to the work of John Vanbrugh at Blenheim Palace. The central gateway is flanked by two pavilions with pierced archways and larger lodges to each side. The outer lodges are topped by &quot;scrolled consoles [supporting] sacrophagi...the scale gargantuan&quot;.

The outer gatehouse is earlier and was designed by Salvin in a much more restrained Tudor Revival style.

===Interior===
The interiors at Harlaxton have been described as &quot;a prodigious display of decorative virtuosity unparalleled in 19th century England&quot;. The designers are an uncertain mixture of Salvin, Burn, Bryce and possibly others, all influenced by Gregory himself. Jill Franklin, in her 1981 study, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Country House and its plan 1835-1914&quot;, writes of the unusual nature of the interior layout of Harlaxton. Noting that there is no easy means of circulation, and that the entrance hall, the only public space at the front ground floor level, leads up via flights of stairs to two awkwardly placed landings, through which entrance is made into the main entertaining rooms of the house by concealed jib doors, she suggests that the house was always in fact designed for show, rather than for living; &quot;a guided tour, with the visitor giving delighted cries of surprise as each door is flung open&quot;.

In the early 19th century, Gregory is believed to have held a post at the British Embassy in Paris. While there, and taking advantage of the cheap prices occasioned by the end of the Napoleonic Wars, he embarked on a spending spree purchasing, &quot;panelling, chimneypieces, furniture and tapestries in great quantity&quot;. He also travelled extensively, &quot;as far as Constantinople and the Crimea&quot;, taking particular interest in the Baroque design of Germany and Austria. The wood carver William Gibbs Rogers, who visited the house in the 1860s when Gregory&#x27;s collection was still intact, recorded his impressions; &quot;marbles, jaspers, cabinets, porcelain of fabulous value, Buhl, rare sculptures, delicate carvings, furniture, tapestries, all in glorious and unreadable confusion&quot;.

The house was technologically advanced; a miniature railway, originally used to transport brick from Gregory&#x27;s kilns to the house, and subsequently used to move coal, was run into the house on a viaduct and continued into the roof spaces to supply the internal coal bunkers.
====Great Hall====
Entry to the house is through Salvin&#x27;s entrance hall, set at basement level. Stairs rise to the first floor where the Great Hall is entered through a stone screens passage. The main inspiration for what Gregory called The Barons&#x27; Hall, is that at Audley End House in Essex, but the design and decoration has decidedly Baroque elements such as the &quot;muscular atlantes&quot; supporting the roof trusses. Other decorative elements are more traditional, the stained glass in the window is by Thomas Willement and depicts Gregory&#x27;s heraldry and ancestry. The chandelier is a later introduction, bought by Mrs Van Elst, when its transportation to the intended destination, a palace in Madrid, was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War.

====Gold Drawing Room====
Louis XV style in decoration, as are most of the state rooms, this drawing room may have been created to emulate the Elizabeth Saloon at nearby Belvoir Castle. The decoration may be by John Crace.

====Cedar Staircase====
The Cedar Staircase is placed within a tower that is invisible externally. It appears to rise three full storeys in what Michael Hall, in his 2009 study, &quot;The Victorian Country House&quot; calls an, &quot;astonishingly theatrical &quot;tour de force&quot;&quot;. This is in fact a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; illusion, as the upper storey is merely a decorative device and leads nowhere, culminating in a fake sky. The decoration is entirely Baroque; &quot;swagged curtains interlaced with thriving putti blowing trumpets and supporting huge scallop shells&quot;. Franklin notes that the style would amaze in a German church but is extraordinary in an English country house. The plasterwork, here and elsewhere in the house, is possibly by the firm of Bernasconi, a London-based firm of Italian origin. An alternative theory is that Salvin, who is known to have visited Bavaria in 1835, brought back local German craftsmen to undertake the work, but architectural historians favour the former suggestion. The Bernasconi Company certainly had the necessary experience, having been employed at both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

<text>Aguascalientes (, lit. &quot;hot waters&quot; in Spanish) is the capital of the Mexican state of the same name and its most populous city, as well as the head of the Aguascalientes Municipality; with a population of 948,990 inhabitants in 2012 and 1,225,432 in the metro area. The metropolitan area also includes the municipalities of Jesús María and San Francisco de los Romo. It is located in North-Central Mexico, which roughly corresponds to the Bajío region within the central Mexican plateau. The city stands on a valley of steppe climate at 1880 meters above sea level, at . 

Originally the territory of the nomadic Chichimeca peoples, the city was founded on October 22, 1575, by Spanish families relocating from Lagos de Moreno under the name of (Village of Our Lady of the Assumption of the Hot Waters), in reference to the chosen patron saint and the many thermal springs found close to the village, which still remain to this day. It would serve as an outpost in the Silver Route, while politically, it was part of the kingdom of Nueva Galicia. In 1835, President Antonio López de Santa Anna made Aguascalientes the capital of a new territory in retaliation to the state of Zacatecas, eventually becoming capital of a new state in 1857. During the Porfiriato era, Aguascalientes was chosen to host the main workshops of the Mexican Central Railway company; bringing an industrial and cultural explosion. The city hosted the Revolutionary Convention of 1914, an important meeting of war generals during the Mexican Revolution.

Formed on a tradition of farming, mining and railroad and textile industry; contemporary Aguascalientes has attracted foreign investment of automobile and electronics companies due to its peaceful business climate, strategic location and existing infrastructure. The city is home to two Nissan automobile manufacturing plants and a shared facility by Nissan and Mercedes, which has given the city a significant Japanese immigrant community. Other companies with operations in the city include Jatco, Coca-Cola, Flextronics, Texas Instruments, Donaldson and Calsonic Kansei. The city of Aguascalientes is also known for the San Marcos Fair, the largest fair celebrated in Mexico and one of the largest in North America.

==History==
The city of Aguascalientes was founded on October 22, 1575, by Juan de Montoro, his family and accompanying families. The village was originally conceived as a minor garrison and rest stop between the cities of Zacatecas and Lagos de Moreno, with the end goal of protecting silver in its route to Mexico City from the Chichimeca. Although the founders did not envision it becoming a major city, it would eventually become the capital of a newly formed state when the territory separated from the adjacent state of Zacatecas in 1835.

The historical center of Aguascalientes was born out of four distinct neighborhoods. The oldest of these is the , which is technically older than Aguascalientes proper. Founded in 1565 by the Andalusian Hernán González Berrocal, the neighborhood was originally named &quot;Triana&quot; after the neighborhood in Seville, Spain. The &quot; is home to the Baroque-style , a Catholic church built between 1773 and 1796. The (&#x27;Black Christ of the live oak&#x27;), is a widely venerated religious icon symbolic of this neighborhood. The colonial square and the José Guadalupe Posada Museum, adjacent to the church, are one of the main attractions in the city.

The second neighborhood is the &quot;, which has its roots in the early 17th century as an indigenous settlement on the outskirts of the then-village of Aguascalientes. Between 1628 and 1688, some communal land was allocated to the community, but the indigenous people still worked on Spanish-owned farms and produced goods to sell in Aguascalientes. Meanwhile, they organized the construction of a simple hospital and a chapel. This original chapel was replaced by the current completed on December 15, 1763; this church is the spiritual headquarters of the &quot;Feria Nacional de San Marcos&quot;.

The third neighborhood is the , which began its development as a string of shops and trading posts alongside the road leading from Aguascalientes to Jalpa and Zacatecas during the latter half of the 18th century. The neighborhood&#x27;s iconic was built between 1767 and 1789; it is recognized for its Spanish Baroque façade and its dome lined with Talavera tiles. Especially after the founding of the (&#x27;Mexican Central Foundry&#x27;), the neighborhood developed quickly; by the early 20th century its roadside inns had mostly been converted into homes and its boundaries had blurred with those of the .

The final neighborhood is the , which has its roots in a small chapel and a cemetery developed towards the end of the 18th century to deal with a number of disease epidemics that had struck the area. Gravediggers established homes near the cemetery, and others took advantage of the open land to establish orchards. Though the orchards began to disappear during the early 20th century, clues as to the neighborhood&#x27;s roots still remain. First of all, the fact that property lines generally followed irrigation ditches can still be seen in the neighborhood&#x27;s haphazard street grids today. Second, the neighborhood&#x27;s working-class character is visible in its primarily single-story homes featuring simple façades.

A fifth neighborhood, the , named after the town&#x27;s central train station, is often grouped in with the city&#x27;s original neighborhoods. However, this neighborhood is considerably more modern, with much of its development dating from the final decades of the 19th century or later. Therefore, despite its important role in the history of Aguascalientes, it is not strictly accurate to consider the &quot;&quot; one of the city&#x27;s original historical neighborhoods.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Aguascalientes has a semi-arid climate (Köppen BSh). Most of the precipitation is concentrated from June to September.
==Etymology==

The name originates from the Spanish words , meaning &#x27;hot waters&#x27;, although a more accurate translation is &#x27;hot springs&#x27;, part of the original name of (Village of our Lady of Assumption of the Hot Springs). When the city was first settled by Juan de Montoro and twelve families, it was given this name for its abundance of hot springs. These thermal features are still in demand in the city&#x27;s numerous spas and even exploited for domestic use.

Aguascalientes houses the largest festival held in Mexico, the San Marcos Fair, which takes place from the middle of April to the beginning of May. The celebration was held originally in the San Marcos church, neighborhood, and its magnificent neoclassical garden; since then, it has greatly expanded to cover a huge area of exposition spaces, bullrings, nightclubs, theaters, performance stages, theme parks, hotels, convention centers, and other attractions. It attracts almost 7 million visitors to Aguascalientes every year.

The old part of the city revolves around downtown and the four original neighborhoods from which the city expanded. The most notable building here is the Baroque Government Palace, dating from 1664 and constructed out of red volcanic stone; it is known for its one hundred arches. The prominent Baroque Cathedral, begun in 1575, is the oldest building in the city. The tall column in the center of the main square dates from colonial times; it held a statue of a Spain&#x27;s viceroy, which was toppled when the country gained independence; the current sculpture on its summit commemorates Mexican independence.
===Neighborhoods and tradition===

The city of Aguascalientes is made up of four traditional neighborhoods, all of which grew up around the central Plaza de la Patria; Guadalupe, San Marcos, El Encino and La Estación.

Guadalupe neighborhood, a traditional producer of pottery, centers around its local church. Located in the heart of Guadalupe, this religious sanctuary, the second most important in the city and dating back to the late 18th century, has a Baroque façade and a large dome covered in traditional &quot;talavera&quot; tiles. Inside it has many flower and angel motifs.

The next is San Marcos, founded in 1604 and once home to natives of Tlaxcala state who fled persecution. Today, the area hosts the traditional San Marcos Fair in springtime. There is San Marcos Gardens, a green spot where paths and trees are abundant. The gardens are traditionally frequented by poets, artists and lovers. Directly in front of the gardens is the Baroque San Marcos Temple, its tiled dome glinting in the sun.

The neighborhood of La Estación takes its name from the old railway station, inaugurated in 1911 and one of Aguascalientes&#x27; architectural and historical treasures.

Aguascalientes historic downtown is home to several museums including the Aguascalientes Museum (), the city&#x27;s art museum, housed in a Classical-style building designed by the self-trained architect Refugio Reyes; the Guadalupe Posada Museum (), located in the historic nationhood of Triana, exhibits the life and work of José Guadalupe Posada; and the State History Museum, which is housed in an elegant Art Nouveau mansion typical of the Porfirian period with and ornate patio and dining room with vegetable motifs in a Mediterranean style, with a French Academism façade, and interior columns and an arcade of pink stone characteristic of Porfirian Eclecticism.

Other designs by Refugio Reyes include the Paris Hotel, the Francia Hotel, and his masterpiece, the Church of San Antonio. The Church of our Lady of Guadalupe possesses an extraordinarily exuberant Baroque facade designed by José de Alcíbar, a renowned architect of the period considered to be one of the most famous artists in Mexico in the 1770s. The Camarin of the Immaculate in the church of San Diego is considered by historians to be the last Baroque building in the world; it links the Baroque and Neoclassical styles; it is the largest of the fewer than ten of these type of structures built in the whole continent.
Aguascalientes is also home to some of the country&#x27;s leading provincial theaters. Examples are the Morelos Theater, historically important for its role during the Mexican Revolution as a convention site; architecturally, the building is notable for its facade and interior, which houses a small museum. The Teatro Aguascalientes is the city&#x27;s premier theatre and opera house.

La Estacion Historic Area (The Old Train Station Complex) contains the Old Train Station and Railway Museum historic complex, which at some point in 1884 formed the largest rail hub and warehouses in all Latin America. The complex is adorned with dancing fountains, a railway plaza and original locomotives and monuments. It was in this complex that the first locomotive completely manufactured in Mexico was made. It symbolizes the progress of the city and its transformation from the rural to an emergent industrial economy. The rail factories supplied with railways and locomotives to whole of Mexico and Central America. The Train Station is also historic due to its unusual (for Mexico) English architectural style.

<doc id="180361" wikidata="Q2635167" url="?curid=180361" title="Brigade of Gurkhas">
<text>Brigade of Gurkhas is the collective name which refers to all the units in the British Army that are composed of Nepalese Gurkha soldiers. The brigade draws its heritage from Gurkha units that originally served in the British Indian Army prior to Indian independence, and prior to that served for the East India Company. The brigade includes infantry, engineering, signal, logistic and training and support units. They are known for their khukuri, a distinctive heavy knife with a curved blade, and have a reputation for being fierce and brave soldiers.

The brigade celebrated 200 years of service in the British Army in 2015.

== History ==

During the war in Nepal in 1814, in which the British failed to annex Nepal into the Empire, Army officers were shocked by the tenacity of the Gurkha soldiers and encouraged them to volunteer for the East India Company. Gurkhas served as troops of the Company in the Pindaree War of 1817, in Bharatpur, Nepal in 1826, and the First and Second Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848. During the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the Gurkha regiments remained loyal to the British, and became part of the British Indian Army on its formation. The 2nd Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) and the 60th Rifles famously defended Hindu Rao&#x27;s house.

During the Malayan Emergency in the late 1940s, Gurkhas fought as jungle soldiers as they had done in Burma. The Training Depot Brigade of Gurkhas was established on 15 August 1951 at Sungai Petani, Kedah, Malaya. After the conflict ended, the Gurkhas were transferred to Hong Kong, where they carried out security duties. The troops patrolled the border checking for illegal immigrants entering the territory, most crucially during the turbulence of the Cultural Revolution. They were deployed to contain crowds during the Star Ferry riots of 1966.

After Indian independence and partition in 1947, under the Tripartite Agreement, six Gurkha regiments joined the post-independence Indian Army. Four Gurkha regiments, the 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 10th Gurkha Rifles, joined the British Army on 1 January 1948. The 1st/2nd Gurkha Rifles was deployed to Brunei at the outbreak of the Brunei Revolt in 1962. In 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus and the 10th Gurkha Rifles was sent to defend the British sovereign base area of Dhekelia. In 1982, during the Falklands War, the 7th Gurkha Rifles formed part of 5 Infantry Brigade and was responsible for capturing Mount William shortly before the Argentinian surrender.

On 1 July 1994 the four rifle regiments were merged into one, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, and the three corps regiments (the Gurkha Military Police having been disbanded in 1965) were reduced to squadron strength. On 1 July 1997, the British government Handover of Hong Kong Sovereignty to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which led to the elimination of the local British garrison. Gurkha HQ and recruit training were moved to the UK. The Royal Gurkha Rifles took part in operations in Kosovo in 1999, in UN peacekeeping operations in East Timor in 2000 and in Sierra Leone later that year.

In September 2008 the High Court in London ruled that the British Government must issue clear guidance on the criteria against which Gurkhas may be considered for settlement rights in the UK. On 21 May 2009, and following a lengthy campaign by Gurkha veterans, the British Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.

In 2018, the UK Government announced that it intended to expand the brigade by more than 800 posts, with the Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Engineers receiving an additional squadron, while the Queen’s Gurkha Signals and the Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment will receive two new squadrons. Additionally, approximately 300 new posts within the Royal Gurkha Rifles will be created forming a new battalion planned for the Specialist Infantry role. In 2018, it was announced that from 2020, female applicants would be able to apply to join the Gurkhas. However, this decision was reversed in 2019.

== Recruitment and basic training ==
The selection process for the Gurkhas is demanding: in 2017, 230 trainee riflemen were recruited from about 25,000 applicants. Recruitment is run by British Gurkhas Nepal; based at Jawalakhel, near Kathmandu, the main recruiting centre is in the city of Pokhara. Recruitment sees the prospective soldier undergo two stages of selection; first the regional selection at either Pokhara or Dharan, where the recruit undertakes a series of physical tests, written English and numeracy assessments, and an interview. Those that pass regional selection move forward to the central selection process in Kathmandu, which sees further physical and language tests, a medical and a second interview.

Training for Gurkhas is conducted at the Infantry Training Centre at Catterick Garrison in North Yorkshire. It lasts for 36 weeks and addresses a range of areas such as the Brigade ethos, language training, cultural training, career management and trade selection, as well as the same 26-week Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Course that the Line Infantry receive. This enables the trained Gurkha soldiers to fulfill their roles on operations and continue the traditions of their forefathers.

In addition to running recruitment of soldiers to join the British Army, British Gurkhas Nepal also runs the recruitment process for the Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force. Recruits indicate at the registration stage whether they wish to join the Singapore Police or the British Army.

Although all enlisted Gurkha soldiers are recruited from Nepalese citizens in Nepal, officers in the Brigade are either selected from those who have distinguished themselves in the ranks, or are commissioned from British or Commonwealth cadets at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Officers from Sandhurst attend an intensive language course at Pokhara Camp to enable them to converse with their soldiers in the Nepali language, although Gurkha soldiers are also expected to learn English.

== Organisation ==
Brigade HQ is based at the former Staff College, Camberley. Two battalions of the Royal Gurkha Rifles are formed as light role infantry; they are not equipped with either armoured or wheeled vehicles. The 1st Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles is based at the British garrison in Brunei as part of Britain&#x27;s commitment to maintaining a military presence in SE Asia. The 2nd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles is based at Shorncliffe Army Camp, near Folkestone in Kent as part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, and is available for deployment to most areas in Europe and Africa. The 3rd Battalion, to be stationed at Aldershot, is approximately half the size of the others, and is a so-called &#x27;specialised infantry&#x27; battalion, serving in the training role as part of the Specialised Infantry Group.

== Commemoration of service ==
=== London memorial ===

The British memorial to the Gurkhas was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 3 December 1997. The inscription on the monument is a quotation from Sir Ralph Lilley Turner, a former officer in the 3rd Gurkha Rifles.

=== 200 years of service ===
A series of events took place in 2015 to mark 200 years of service by the Gurkhas in the British Army including a march past Buckingham Palace.

== Other ==
Under international law, according to Protocol 1 Additions to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Gurkhas serving as regular uniformed soldiers are not mercenaries. According to Cabinet Office official histories (&quot;Official History of the Falkland Islands&quot; by Sir Lawrence Freedman), Sir John Nott, as Secretary of State for Defence, expressed the British Government&#x27;s concern that the Gurkhas could not be sent with the task force to recapture the Falkland Islands because it might upset the non-aligned members of the fragile coalition of support that the British had built in the United Nations. The then-Chief of Defence Staff Sir Edwin Bramall, a former officer in the 2nd Gurkhas like Nott, said that the Gurkhas were needed for sound military reasons (as a constituent part of 5th Infantry Brigade) and if they were not deployed then there would always be a political reason not to deploy Gurkhas in future conflicts. So he requested that Nott argue the case in Government for deploying them against the advice of the Foreign Office. Nott agreed to do so, commenting that the Gurkhas &quot;would be mortified if we spoilt their chances [of going]&quot;.

===Alliances===

<text>The kukri () or khukuri (, ) is a type of knife or short sword with a distinct recurve in its blade that originated in the Indian subcontinent. It serves multiple purposes as a melee weapon and also as a regular cutting/chopping tool throughout most of South Asia. The &quot;kukri&quot;, &quot;khukri&quot;, and &quot;kukkri&quot; spellings are of Indian English origin.

The kukri is the national weapon of Nepal, traditionally serving the role of a basic utility knife for the Nepali-speaking Gurkhas, and consequently is a characteristic weapon of the Nepali Army.

There are many myths surrounding the kukri since its earliest recorded use in the 7th century—most notably a traditional custom that the blade must draw blood before being sheathed, when its sole purpose is considered as a fighting weapon. 

In addition to its use in combat, the kukri is also used for a variety of other purposes. It is used by farmers and laborers for cutting crops and clearing brush, and by hunters for skinning and cleaning game. It is also used as a tool for cooking, woodworking, and even as a ceremonial object in some Nepalese religious traditions.

== History ==
Researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat. Similar implements have existed in several forms throughout the Indian subcontinent and were used both as weapons and as tools. It might have derived from the ancient Indian saber called &quot;nistrimsa&quot; (निस्त्रिंश), itself possibly based on the Greek kopis brought by Alexander the Great&#x27;s forces to India in the 4th century BC. Burton (1884) writes that the British Museum housed a large kukri-like falchion inscribed with writing in Pali. Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in Kathmandu.

The kukri came to be known to the Western world when the East India Company came into conflict with the growing Gorkha Kingdom, culminating in the Gurkha War of 1814–1816. It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Irish author Bram Stoker. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula&#x27;s bodyguards and the heroes, Mina&#x27;s narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker&#x27;s kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris&#x27;s Bowie knife.

All Gurkha troops are issued with two kukris, a Service No.1 (ceremonial) and a Service No.2 (exercise); in modern times, members of the Brigade of Gurkhas receive training in its use. The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both World War I and World War II enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit&#x27;s situation report. It reads: &quot;Enemy losses: ten killed, our nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.&quot;

== Design ==

The kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from at the handle, and can taper to by the point while the blade lengths can vary from for general use.

A kukri designed for general purpose use is commonly in overall length and weighs approximately . Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.

Another factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged (or, alternatively, hollow ground), or a fuller is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including &quot;tin Chira&quot; (triple fuller), &quot;Dui Chira&quot; (double fuller), &quot;Ang Khola&quot; (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.
Kukri blades usually have a notch (&quot;karda&quot;, &quot;kauda&quot;, &quot;Gaudi&quot;, &quot;Kaura&quot;, or &quot;Cho&quot;) at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevents the handle from becoming slippery; that it delineates the end of the blade whilst sharpening; that it is a symbol representing a cow&#x27;s foot, or Shiva; or that it can catch another blade or kukri in combat. The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.

The handles are most often made of hardwood or water buffalo horn, but also ivory, bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of brass or steel.
The traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial tang, although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular. The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.

The kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened &quot;chakmak&quot; to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a &quot;karda&quot;. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.

== Use ==
The kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a &quot;wedge&quot; effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper.

While most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans.

The kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.

The kukri often appears in Nepalese heraldry and is used in many traditional, Hindu-centric rites such as wedding ceremonies.

== Manufacture ==

The Biswakarma Kami (caste) are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making. Modern kukri blades are often forged from spring steel, sometimes collected from recycled truck suspension units. The tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.

Kukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called &quot;laha&quot; (also known as &quot;Himalayan epoxy&quot;). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a full tang (&quot;panawal&quot;) configuration.

Traditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by &quot;laha&quot;, the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a &quot;chakmak&quot; over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to steel their knives.

Kukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a &quot;Sarki&quot;.

* Lower Edge (&quot;Tallo Bhag&quot;): Belly/curvature of the scabbard.

== Classification ==
Kukris can be broadly classified into two types: Eastern and Western. The Eastern blades are originated and named according to the towns and villages of Eastern Nepal. 

Kukris made in locations like Chainpur, Bhojpur, and Dhankuta in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.

Western blades are generally broader. Occasionally the Western style is called &quot;Budhuna&quot;, (referring to a fish with a large head), or &quot;baspate&quot; (bamboo leaf) which refers to blades just outside the proportions of the normal &quot;Sirupate&quot; blade. Despite the classification of Eastern and Western, both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of Nepal.

There are kukri modelled on the one used by the Gorkhali General Amar Singh Thapa. The real one is archived at National Museum of Nepal and is more curvy in nature than other traditions.

== Military adoption ==

The kukri is in standard service with various regiments and units within the Indian Army, such as the Assam Rifles, the Kumaon Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles and the various Gorkha regiments. Outside of its native region of South Asia, the kukri also is in service with the Brigade of Gurkhas in the British Army and Gurkha Contingent of the Singapore Police Force. The kukri is not only the staple weapon, but is also the recognisible symbol of all Gurkha military regiments and units throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a &quot;Gurkha blade&quot; or &quot;Gurkha knife&quot;.

<text>The Gurkhas or Gorkhas (), with the endonym Gorkhali (Nepali: गोर्खाली ), are soldiers native to the Indian subcontinent, chiefly residing within Nepal and some parts of North India.

The Gurkha units are composed of Nepali and Indian Gorkha, Nepali-speaking Indian people, and are recruited for the Nepali Army (96,000), the Indian Army (42,000), the British Army (4,010), the Gurkha Contingent in Singapore, the Gurkha Reserve Unit in Brunei, for UN peacekeeping forces and in war zones around the world. Gurkhas are closely associated with the &quot;khukuri&quot;, a forward-curving knife, and have a reputation for fearless military prowess. Former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw once stated that: 

== Origins ==

Historically, the terms &quot;Gurkha&quot; and &quot;Gorkhali&quot; were synonymous with &quot;Nepali&quot;, which originates from the hill principality Gorkha Kingdom, from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under Prithvi Narayan Shah, who was the last ruler of the Gorkha Kingdom and first monarch of the Kingdom of Nepal . In fact, the Gorkhas’ impressive conquests of the Kathmandu Valley supplied the British with an exaggerated view of Nepal’s strength, ultimately helping lead to the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814-1816). The name may be traced to the medieval Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath who has a historic shrine in Gorkha District. The word itself derived from &quot;Go-Raksha&quot; ( i.e., &#x27;Protector (रक्षा) of cows (गो&#x27;)), &quot;raksha&quot; becoming &quot;rakha&quot; (रखा). &quot;Rakhawala&quot; means &#x27;protector&#x27; and is derived from &quot;raksha&quot; as well.

There are Gurkha military units in the Nepalese, British and Indian armies enlisted in Nepal, United Kingdom, India and Singapore. Although they meet many of the criteria of Article 47 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions regarding mercenaries, they are exempt under clauses , similar to the French Foreign Legion.

During the 1814–16 Anglo-Nepalese War between the Gorkha Kingdom and the East India Company, the Gorkhali soldiers impressed the British, who called them &quot;Gurkhas&quot;.

== British East India Company army ==
The Anglo-Nepalese War was fought between the Gurkha Kingdom of Nepal and the British East India Company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both belligerents. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.

David Ochterlony and British political agent William Fraser were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers. During the war the British used defectors from the Gurkha army and employed them as irregular forces. Fraser&#x27;s confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri Regiment. This regiment, which later became the 1st King George&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, saw action at Malaun Fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he &quot;had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions&quot;.

About 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis, but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term &quot;Gurkha&quot;, became the backbone of British Indian forces.

As well as Ochterlony&#x27;s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and Lt. Frederick Young raised the Sirmoor Battalion, later to become the 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles. An additional battalion—the Kumaon—was also raised, eventually becoming the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles. None of these units fought in the second campaign.

Gurkhas served as troops under contract to the British East India Company in the Pindaree War of 1817, in Bharatpur in 1826, and the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.

During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the British Indian Army on its formation. The 8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion made a notable contribution during the conflict, and 25 Indian Order of Merit awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi.

Three days after the rebellion began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 kilometres a day. Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended Hindu Rao&#x27;s house, losing 327 of 490 men. During this action they fought side by side with the 60th Rifles and a strong bond developed.

Twelve regiments from the Nepalese Army also took part in the relief of Lucknow under the command of Shri Teen (3) Maharaja Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal and his older brother C-in-C Ranodip Singh Kunwar (Ranaudip Singh Bahadur Rana) (later to succeed Jung Bahadur and become Sri Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh of Nepal).

After the rebellion the 60th Rifles pressed for the Sirmoor Battalion to become a rifle regiment. This honour was granted in 1858 when the battalion was renamed the Sirmoor Rifle Regiment and awarded a third colour. In 1863, Queen Victoria presented the regiment with the Queen&#x27;s Truncheon, as a replacement for the colours that rifle regiments do not usually have.

== British Indian Army (c. 1857–1947) ==


From the end of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 until the start of World War I, the Gurkha Regiments saw active service in Burma, Afghanistan, Northeast India and the North-West Frontier of India, Malta (the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78), Cyprus, Malaya, China (the Boxer Rebellion of 1900) and Tibet (Younghusband&#x27;s Expedition of 1905).

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British authorities in India feared the inclusion of Hindu castes in the army. They discouraged Brahminical influence in the military and considered the Hindu castes more susceptible to Brahminical values. As a result, they discouraged the inclusion of Thakuri and Khas groups in the Gorkha units and refused to recruit tribes other than Gurungs and Magars for Gorkha units. They also exerted diplomatic pressure on Prime Minister Bir Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana to ensure that at least 75% of new recruits were Gurungs and Magars.

Between 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions in the ten regiments.

During World War I (1914–1918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards. The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions.

A large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine, and Iraq. They served on the battlefields of France in the battles of Loos, Givenchy, and Neuve Chapelle; in Belgium at the battle of Ypres; in Iraq, Persia, Suez Canal and Palestine against Turkish advance, Gallipoli and Salonika. One detachment served with Lawrence of Arabia. During the Battle of Loos (June–December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defences, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, &quot;found its Valhalla&quot;.

During the unsuccessful Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as &quot;Gurkha Bluff&quot;. At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the straits, which was the ultimate objective. The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) fought in the conquest of Baghdad.

Following the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of trouble.

As such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the Third Afghan War in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in Waziristan, where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile Pathan tribesmen.

During this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu, and Wanna saw extensive action.

During World War II (1939–1945) there were ten Gurkha regiments, with two battalions each, making a total of 20 pre-war battalions. Following the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in 1940, the Nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to enlarge the number of Gurkha battalions in British service to 35. This would eventually rise to 43 battalions.

In order to achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR. This expansion required ten training centers to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions (14 GR, 29 GR, 38 GR, 56 GR and 710 GR) were raised, while other units (25 GR and 26 GR) were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas. Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialized duties such as paratroops, signals, engineers and military police.

A total of 250,280 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, parachute, training, garrison and porter units during the war, in almost all theatres. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in Syria, North Africa, Italy, Greece and against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, northeast India and also Singapore. They did so with distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theatres.

=== Gurkha military rank system in the British Indian Army ===
Gurkha ranks in the British Indian Army followed the same pattern as those used throughout the rest of the Indian Army at that time. As in the British Army itself, there were three distinct levels: private soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and commissioned officers. Gurkha commissioned officers in Gurkha regiments held a &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s Commission&quot;, distinct from the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Commission that British officers serving with a Gurkha regiment held. Any Gurkha holding a commission was technically subordinate to any British officer, regardless of rank.

==== Rank equivalents in modern Indian and British Armies ====
Viceroy Commissioned Officers (VCOs) up to 1947 and Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) from 1947:
* Subedar Major/no equivalent
* Subedar/no equivalent
* Jemadar (now Naib Subedar)/no equivalent

Warrant officers
* Regimental Havildar Major/Warrant Officer Class 1
* Company Havildar Major/Warrant Officer Class 2

Non-commissioned officers
* Company Quartermaster Havildar/Colour Sergeant
* Havildar/Sergeant
* Naik/Corporal
* Lance Naik/Lance Corporal

Private soldiers
* Rifleman

Notes
* British Army officers received Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s Commissions, but Gurkha officers in this system received the Viceroy&#x27;s Commission. After Indian independence in 1947, Gurkha officers in regiments which became part of the British Army received the King&#x27;s (later Queen&#x27;s) Gurkha Commission, and were known as King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Officers (KGO/QGO). Gurkha officers had no authority to command troops of British regiments. The QGO Commission was abolished in 2007.
* Jemadars and subedars normally served as platoon commanders and company 2ICs but were junior to all British officers, while the subedar major was the Commanding Officer&#x27;s advisor on the men and their welfare. For a long time it was impossible for Gurkhas to progress further, except that an honorary lieutenancy or captaincy was (very rarely) bestowed upon a Gurkha on retirement.
* The equivalent ranks in the post-1947 Indian Army were (and are) known as Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs). They retained the traditional rank titles used in the British Indian Army: Jemadar (later Naib Subedar), Subedar and Subedar Major.
* While in principle any British subject may apply for a commission without having served in the ranks, Gurkhas cannot. It was customary for a Gurkha soldier to rise through the ranks and prove his ability before his regiment would consider offering him a commission.
* From the 1920s Gurkhas could also receive King&#x27;s Indian Commissions, and later full King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Commissions, which put them on a par with British officers. This was rare until after the Second World War.
* Gurkha officers commissioned from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and Short Service Officers regularly fill appointments up to the rank of major. At least two Gurkhas have been promoted to lieutenant colonel and there is theoretically now no bar to further progression.
* After 1948, the Brigade of Gurkhas (part of the British Army) was formed and adopted standard British Army rank structure and nomenclature, except for the three Viceroy Commission ranks between Warrant Officer 1 and Second Lieutenant (jemadar, subedar and subedar major) which remained, albeit with different rank titles Lieutenant (Queens Gurkha Officer), Captain (QGO) and Major (QGO). The QGO commission was abolished in 2007; Gurkha soldiers are currently commissioned as Late Entry Officers (as above).

=== Regiments of the Gurkha Rifles (c. 1815–1947) ===

* 1st King George V&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment) (raised 1815, allocated to Indian Army at independence in 1947)
* 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles) (raised 1815, allocated to British Army in 1948)

== Post-independence (1947–present) ==
Under the Tripartite Agreement signed between the governments of the United Kingdom, India and Nepal after Indian independence and the partition of India, the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent Indian Army. Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.

To the disappointment of many of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established. The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in Malaya - a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service were subsequently reduced to a single regiment of two battalions. The Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.

The principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army. This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha&#x27;s actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.

With the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (later the &quot;Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)&quot;), which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the Nepalese people and would be banned. However, as of 2023, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.

===British Army Gurkhas===
Four Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:
* 2nd King Edward VII&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)
* 6th Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 10th Princess Mary&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles

They formed the Brigade of Gurkhas and were initially stationed in Malaya. There were also a number of additional Gurkha units including the 69th and 70th Gurkha Field Squadrons, both included in the 36th Engineer Regiment. Since then, British Gurkhas have served in Borneo during the confrontation with Indonesia, in the Falklands War and on various peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia and Kosovo.

Major Gurkha Formations:
* 43rd Independent Gurkha Infantry Brigade (Italy, circa 1943)
* 26th Gurkha Brigade (Hong Kong, 1948–1950)
* 17th Gurkha Division (Malaya, 1952–1970)
* 51st Infantry Brigade (Hong Kong disbanded 1976)
* 48th Gurkha Infantry Brigade (Hong Kong, 1957–1976; renamed Gurkha Field Force 1976–1997; returned to old title 

As of August 2021, the &quot;Brigade of Gurkhas&quot; in the British Army has the following units:
* 1st Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles (1RGR)
* 2nd Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles (2RGR)
* 3rd Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles (3RGR)
*Gurkha Allied Rapid Reaction Corps Support Battalion
* Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Signals which includes:
** 250 Gurkha Signal Squadron, 30 Signal Regiment
** 246 Gurkha Signal Squadron, 2 Signal Regiment
** 247 Gurkha Signal Squadron, 16 Signal Regiment
** 248 Gurkha Signal Squadron, 22 Signal Regiment
** 249 Gurkha Signal Squadron, 3rd (UK) Division Signal Regiment
* 10 Queen&#x27;s Own Gurkha Logistic Regiment RLC
* Queen&#x27;s Gurkha Engineers, which includes:
** 69th Gurkha Field Squadron, 36 Engineer Regiment
** 70th Gurkha Field Squadron, 36 Engineer Regiment
*Gurkha Staff and Personnel Support Company
*Band of the Brigade of Gurkhas
*Gurkha Company (Sittang), Royal Military Academy Sandhurst
*Gurkha Wing (Mandalay), Infantry Battle School
*Gurkha Company (Tavoleto), Land Warfare Centre

The Brigade of Gurkhas also has its own chefs posted among the above-mentioned units. Gurkhas were among the troops who retook the Falklands in 1982 and have served a number of tours of duty in the War in Afghanistan.

=== Indian Army Gurkhas ===

Upon independence in 1947, six of the original ten Gurkha regiments remained with the Indian Army. These regiments were:
* 1st King George V&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles (The Malaun Regiment)
* 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 4th Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles
* 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)
* 8th Gurkha Rifles
* 9th Gurkha Rifles

Additionally, a further regiment, 11 Gorkha Rifles, was raised. In 1949 the spelling was changed from &quot;Gurkha&quot; to the original &quot;Gorkha&quot;. All royal titles were dropped when India became a republic in 1950.

Since partition, the Gurkha regiments that were transferred to the Indian Army have established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent Indian Army. Indeed, while Britain has reduced its Gurkha contingent, India has continued to recruit Gorkhas of Nepal into Gorkha regiments in large numbers, as well as Indian Gorkhas. In 2009 the Indian Army had a Gorkha contingent that numbered around 42,000 men in 46 battalions, spread across seven regiments.

Although their deployment is still governed by the 1947 Tripartite Agreement, in the post-1947 conflicts India has fought in, Gorkhas have served in almost all of them, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999 and also against China in 1962. They have also been used in peacekeeping operations around the world. They have also served in Sri Lanka conducting operations against the Tamil Tigers.

=== Singapore Gurkha Contingent ===

The Gurkha Contingent (GC) of the Singapore Police Force was formed on 9 April 1949 from selected ex-British Army Gurkhas. It is an integral part of the police force and was raised to replace a Sikh unit that had existed prior to the Japanese occupation during the Second World War.

The GC is a well trained, dedicated and disciplined body whose principal role is as riot police and counter-terrorism force. In times of crisis it can be deployed as a reaction force. During the turbulent years before and after independence, the GC acquitted itself well on several occasions during outbreaks of civil disorder. The Gurkhas displayed the courage, self-restraint and professionalism for which they are famous and earned the respect of the society at large.

=== Brunei Gurkha Reserve Unit ===
The Gurkha Reserve Unit (GRU) is a special guard and elite shock-troop force in the Sultanate of Brunei. The Brunei Reserve Unit employs about 500 Gurkhas. The majority are veterans of the British Army and the Singaporean Police, who have joined the GRU as a second career.

=== Indian Special Frontier Force ===
The Special Frontier Force (SFF) is an Indian paramilitary organization consisting of Tibetan refugees, Nepali Gurkhas, and other ethnic groups from mountainous areas. The SFF is tasked with conducting covert actions against China in the event of another Sino-Indian war. The SFF was originally intended to exclusively consist of Tibetan refugees living in India, however, the SFF began recruiting Nepali Gurkhas and hill tribesmen in 1965 to make up for a declining recruitment rate among Tibetans. It is believed there are around 700 Gurkhas serving in the SFF.

== Other ==

=== Victoria Cross recipients ===
There have been 26 Victoria Crosses (VC) awarded to soldiers of Gurkha regiments. The first was awarded in 1858 and the last in 1965. Thirteen of the recipients have been British officers serving with Gurkha regiments. Since 1915, the majority have been awarded to Gurkhas serving in the ranks as private soldiers or NCOs. Since Indian independence in 1947, Gurkhas serving in the Indian Army have been awarded three &quot;Param Vir Chakras&quot;, which are equivalent to the Victoria Cross.

Two George Cross (GC) medals have been awarded to Gurkha soldiers for acts of bravery. The George Cross (GC) is the highest award bestowed by the British government for non-operational gallantry or gallantry not in the presence of an enemy. In the UK honours system, the George Cross is equal in stature to the Victoria Cross. This has been the case since the introduction of the George Cross in 1940.

=== Treatment of Gurkhas in the United Kingdom ===
The treatment of Gurkhas and their families was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom once it became widely known that Gurkhas received smaller pensions than their British counterparts. The nationality status of Gurkhas and their families was also an area of dispute, with claims that some ex-army Nepali families were being denied residency and forced to leave Britain. On 8 March 2007 the British Government announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years&#x27; service and women would also be allowed to join, although not in first-line units, conforming to the British Army&#x27;s policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in the UK for retired Gurkhas and their families.

Despite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government&#x27;s decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement. An advocacy group, Gurkha Justice Campaign, joined the debate in support of the Gurkhas.

In a landmark ruling on 30 September 2008, Mr Justice Blake in the High Court in London decided that the Home Secretary&#x27;s policy allowing Gurkhas who left the Army before 1997 to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom was irrationally restrictive in its criteria, and overturned it. He upheld the claim of six Gurkha soldiers for the right to settle in Britain at the end of their service, reciting the Military Covenant and observing that granting them residence in Britain &quot;would, in my judgment, be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant&quot;. In response to the decision of the High Court, the Home Office said it would review all cases that were affected by it.

On 29 April 2009 a motion introduced by the Liberal Democrats that all Gurkhas be offered equal right of residence was passed in the House of Commons by 267 votes to 246. This was the only first-day motion defeat for a government since 1978. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, stated that &quot;this is an immense victory ... for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice, a victory for Parliament, a victory for decency.&quot; He added that it was &quot;the kind of thing people want this country to do&quot;.

On 21 May 2009 Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years service would be allowed to settle in the UK. Actress Joanna Lumley, daughter of Gurkha corps Major James Lumley who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights, commented, &quot;This is the welcome we have always longed to give&quot;.

A charity, The Gurkha Welfare Trust, provides aid to alleviate hardship and distress among Gurkha ex-servicemen.

On 9 June 2015, a celebration called the Gurkha 200, held at The Royal Hospital Chelsea and attended by members of the royal family, commemorated the bicentennial of the Gurkha Welfare Trust by paying tribute to Gurkha culture and military service.

Gurkha Square in Fleet, Hampshire, which contains the Fleet war memorial, is named after the Gurkhas.

====Settlement rights====
A 2008 UK High Court decision on a test case in London, &quot;R. (on the application of Limbu) v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; [2008] EWHC 2261 (Admin), acknowledged the &quot;debt of honour&quot; to Gurkhas discharged before 1997. The Home Secretary&#x27;s policy allowing veterans to apply on a limited set of criteria (such as connection to the United Kingdom) was quashed as being unduly restrictive. The Court found that the Gurkhas had suffered a &quot;historic injustice&quot; and that the policy was irrational in failing to take into account factors such as length of service or particularly meritorious conduct.
