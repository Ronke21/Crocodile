Tolkien, on medical leave from the British Army at Great Haywood, begins &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; (the first version of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;), starting with the &quot;Fall of Gondolin&quot;.

Swope the first for journalism for his work for the &quot;New York World&quot;.

At Sassoon&#x27;s urging, Owen writes his two great war poems, &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; and &quot;Dulce et Decorum est&quot;, although like almost all his poetry they remain unpublished until after his death in action next year.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1920.
==Events==
*February 2 – &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot;, Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s second full-length play, opens with a Morosco Theatre matinée in New York City, partly as a producer&#x27;s experiment and partly to quiet the actor Richard Bennett, who sought to play the lead. Reviewers hail the play and O&#x27;Neill gains fame.
*February 27 – An inaugural meeting of the Bloomsbury Group&#x27;s Memoir Club is arranged by Mary MacCarthy in London.
*Spring – The poet Anton Podbevšek and others organize the Novo Mesto Spring (&quot;Novomeška pomlad&quot;) event, the beginning of Slovenian Modernism.
*March 15 – &quot;The Blue Flame&quot;, a four-act play by George V. Hobart and John Willard after Leta Vance Nicholson, opens at the Shubert Theatre (New York City) on Broadway before a year&#x27;s U.S. tour. Though described by a critic as &quot;one of the worst plays ever written,&quot; it is a commercial success, largely due to Theda Bara as the central character of a vamp.
*March 22 – Federico García Lorca&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Butterfly&#x27;s Evil Spell (El maleficio de la mariposa)&quot; is poorly received at its première in Madrid.
*March 26 – &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald sets him up as a writer and celebrity. An initial 3,000 copies sell out in three days. The book&#x27;s reputation dims in later years, but Dorothy Parker will recall that it was seen as innovative when it first appeared.
*April
**Hart Crane publishes his poem &quot;My Grandmother&#x27;s Love Letters&quot; in &quot;The Dial&quot;, his first major move toward recognition as a poet.
**The pulp magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot; is launched in New York City as &quot;An Illustrated Magazine of Detective Mystery, Adventure, Romance, and Spiritualism&quot; by journalist H. L. Mencken and drama critic George Jean Nathan.

*April 3 – F. Scott Fitzgerald marries Zelda Sayre in the rectory of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (Manhattan). 
*May 1 – F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s short story &quot;Bernice Bobs Her Hair&quot; appears in the Saturday Evening Post and on the magazine&#x27;s cover, illustrated by artist Norman Rockwell.
*July – Krishna Lal Adhikari&#x27;s &quot;Makaiko Kheti&quot; (The Cultivation of Maize) is published in Nepal; following claims that it contains &quot;mischievous expressions to treason&quot;, the author is sentenced on August 2 to nine years in prison (where he will die in 1923) and all known copies of the book are destroyed.
*August 22 – The Salzburg Festival in Austria is inaugurated with a performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal&#x27;s play &quot;Jedermann&quot; (Everyman, 1911) in front of Salzburg Cathedral, directed by Max Reinhardt.
*October – Agatha Christie&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, appears in the U.S., introducing her long-running Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in the setting of an English country house. The book is published in the U.K. on January 21, 1921.
*November 1 – Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; plays at the Playwright&#x27;s Theater in New York City with Charles Sidney Gilpin in the title role. 
*November 9 – D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;Women in Love&quot; appears in a limited U.S. subscribers&#x27; edition.
*December – The first edition of the &quot;Poems&quot; of the English war poet Wilfred Owen, killed in action in 1918, appears in London, introduced by his friend Siegfried Sassoon but with much of the editing carried out by Edith Sitwell. Only five of Owen&#x27;s verses having been published in his lifetime, the collection introduces his work to many readers. It includes the 1917 poems &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; and &quot;Dulce et Decorum est&quot;, one of the best-known poetic condemnations of war.
*December 23 – Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s play &quot;Reigen&quot; (&quot;La Ronde&quot;, 1900) receives a first authorized performance, in Berlin, where it is criticized on moral and anti-Semitic grounds.
*Christmas – Monteiro Lobato&#x27;s children&#x27;s story &quot;A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado&quot; (Girl with the Upturned Nose), the origin of the &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot; novel series, is published in Brazil.
*&quot;unknown dates&quot;
**Erwin von Busse, using the pseudonym Granand, publishes &quot;Das erotische Komödiengärtlein&quot; (&quot;Berlin Garden of Erotic Delights&quot;), a collection of short stories about sexually charged encounters between men. It is promptly banned.
**Karel Čapek&#x27;s drama &quot;R.U.R: Rossum&#x27;s Universal Robots&quot;, published in Prague, introduces the word &quot;robot&quot; into English.
**Publication in Paris of the first volume of the &quot;Collection Budé&quot; initiates editions of classical texts with parallel French translation: Plato&#x27;s &quot;Hippias Minor (Hippias Mineur)&quot;.
**Van Wyck Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Ordeal of Mark Twain&quot; controversially argues that Twain was &quot;a victim of arrested development&quot; with a dual personality. It begins a reassessment of an author seen hitherto mainly as a humorous writer. The 1920s will bring similar reconsideration of many 19th-century American writers, notably Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson.

<text>Philip W. Cook is an American journalist. He is the author of &quot;Abused Men – The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence&quot;, as well as the co-author, with Tammy L. Hodo, of &quot;When Women Sexually Abuse Men: The Hidden Side of Rape, Stalking, Harassment, and Sexual Assault&quot;.

==Education==
He obtained his degree in journalism from the University of Oregon.

==Career==
Cook focuses his work on domestic violence and family programs. He examines the results of research, the feelings and problems of victims, and the response of the media on the issue. He has been the director of radio stations in Texas and Oregon as well as director of television news stations in Washington and Nevada.

Cook left journalism for a year and became a stay at home dad for his one child. He later returned to work where he was the program director and eventually executive director of PACE Institute For Families in Transition. Here, Cook along with many others, created classes called &quot;Children for Divorce&quot;. The class required all divorcing and separating parents with children to attend and taught the parents how to not involve the children in the conflicts, diffuse anger, and improve the children&#x27;s self-esteem. The classes are now mandatory, for parents divorcing or splitting up, in one-third of Oregon counties.

==Awards and honors==
Cook has received a number of awards for his reporting from the Associated Press and the Professional Journalism Society. The Radio Television News Directors Association also recognized him as a national scholarship recipient.

==Appearances==
Cook has appeared on a variety of different national television and radio shows which include: MSNBC, Fox TV&#x27;s &quot;The Crier Report&quot;, &quot;The Sally Jesse Raphael Show&quot;, &quot;The Home and Family Show&quot;, Westwood Radio Network (Jim Bohannon Show, Dirk Van), and CBS radio. His domestic violence articles have been published in &quot;The Employee Assistance Professional &quot;Exchange&quot; Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Oregonian&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Freedom Network Magazine&quot;, and many others.

<text>OIL (Ontology Inference Layer or Ontology Interchange Language) can be regarded as an ontology infrastructure for the Semantic Web. OIL is based on concepts developed in Description Logic (DL) and frame-based systems and is compatible with RDFS.

OIL was developed by Dieter Fensel, Frank van Harmelen (Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam) and Ian Horrocks (University of Manchester) as part of the IST OntoKnowledge project.

Much of the work in OIL was subsequently incorporated into DAML+OIL and the Web Ontology Language (OWL).

<text>Description logics (DL) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first-order logic. In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are (usually) decidable, and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy description logics, and each description logic features a different balance between expressive power and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors.

DLs are used in artificial intelligence to describe and reason about the relevant concepts of an application domain (known as &quot;terminological knowledge&quot;). It is of particular importance in providing a logical formalism for ontologies and the Semantic Web: the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and its profiles are based on DLs. The most notable application of DLs and OWL is in biomedical informatics where DL assists in the codification of biomedical knowledge.

==Introduction==
A description logic (DL) models &quot;concepts&quot;, &quot;roles&quot; and &quot;individuals&quot;, and their relationships.

The fundamental modeling concept of a DL is the &quot;axiom&quot;—a logical statement relating roles and/or concepts. This is a key difference from the frames paradigm where a &quot;frame specification&quot; declares and completely defines a class.

==Nomenclature==
===Terminology compared to FOL and OWL===
The description logic community uses different terminology than the first-order logic (FOL) community for operationally equivalent notions; some examples are given below. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) uses again a different terminology, also given in the table below.

===Naming convention===
There are many varieties of description logics and there is an informal naming convention, roughly describing the operators allowed. The expressivity is encoded in the label for a logic starting with one of the following basic logics:

Followed by any of the following extensions:
====Exceptions====
Some canonical DLs that do not exactly fit this convention are:
====Examples====
As an example, formula_1 is a centrally important description logic from which comparisons with other varieties can be made. formula_1 is simply formula_3 with complement of any concept allowed, not just atomic concepts. formula_1 is used instead of the equivalent formula_5.

A further example, the description logic formula_6 is the logic formula_1 plus extended cardinality restrictions, and transitive and inverse roles. The naming conventions aren&#x27;t purely systematic so that the logic formula_8 might be referred to as formula_9 and other abbreviations are also made where possible.

The Protégé ontology editor supports formula_10. Three major biomedical informatics terminology bases, SNOMED CT, GALEN, and GO, are expressible in formula_11 (with additional role properties).

OWL 2 provides the expressiveness of formula_12, OWL-DL is based on formula_10, and for OWL-Lite it is formula_14.

==History==
Description logic was given its current name in the 1980s. Previous to this it was called (chronologically): &quot;terminological systems&quot;, and &quot;concept languages&quot;.

===Knowledge representation===
Frames and semantic networks lack formal (logic-based) semantics. DL was first introduced into knowledge representation (KR) systems to overcome this deficiency.

The first DL-based KR system was KL-ONE (by Ronald J. Brachman and Schmolze, 1985). During the &#x27;80s other DL-based systems using &quot;structural subsumption algorithms&quot; were developed including KRYPTON (1983), LOOM (1987), BACK (1988), K-REP (1991) and CLASSIC (1991). This approach featured DL with limited expressiveness but relatively efficient (polynomial time) reasoning.

In the early &#x27;90s, the introduction of a new &quot;tableau based algorithm&quot; paradigm allowed efficient reasoning on more expressive DL. DL-based systems using these algorithms — such as KRIS (1991) — show acceptable reasoning performance on typical inference problems even though the worst case complexity is no longer polynomial.

From the mid &#x27;90s, reasoners were created with good practical performance on very expressive DL with high worst case complexity. Examples from this period include FaCT, RACER (2001), CEL (2005), and KAON 2 (2005).

DL reasoners, such as FaCT, FaCT++, RACER, DLP and Pellet, implement the method of analytic tableaux. KAON2 is implemented by algorithms which reduce a SHIQ(D) knowledge base to a disjunctive datalog program.

===Semantic web===
The DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) and Ontology Inference Layer (OIL) ontology languages for the Semantic Web can be viewed as
syntactic variants of DL. In particular, the formal semantics and reasoning in OIL use the formula_6 DL. The DAML+OIL DL was developed as a submission to—and formed the starting point of—the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Ontology Working Group. In 2004, the Web Ontology Working Group completed its work by issuing the OWL recommendation. The design of OWL is based on the formula_16 family of DL with OWL DL and OWL Lite based on formula_10 and formula_14 respectively.

The W3C OWL Working Group began work in 2007 on a refinement of - and extension to - OWL. In 2009, this was completed by the issuance of the OWL2 recommendation. OWL2 is based on the description logic formula_12. Practical experience demonstrated that OWL DL lacked several key features necessary to model complex domains.

==Modeling==
In DL, a distinction is drawn between the so-called TBox (terminological box) and the ABox (assertional box). In general, the TBox contains sentences describing concept hierarchies (i.e., relations between concepts) while the ABox contains ground sentences stating where in the hierarchy, individuals belong (i.e., relations between individuals and concepts). For example, the statement:

belongs in the TBox, while the statement:

belongs in the ABox.

Note that the TBox/ABox distinction is not significant, in the same sense that the two &quot;kinds&quot; of sentences are not treated differently in first-order logic (which subsumes most DL). When translated into first-order logic, a subsumption axiom like () is simply a conditional restriction to unary predicates (concepts) with only variables appearing in it. Clearly, a sentence of this form is not privileged or special over sentences in which only constants (&quot;grounded&quot; values) appear like ().

So why was the distinction introduced? The primary reason is that the separation can be useful when describing and formulating decision-procedures for various DL. For example, a reasoner might process the TBox and ABox separately, in part because certain key inference problems are tied to one but not the other one (&#x27;classification&#x27; is related to the TBox, &#x27;instance checking&#x27; to the ABox). Another example is that the complexity of the TBox can greatly affect the performance of a given decision-procedure for a certain DL, independently of the ABox. Thus, it is useful to have a way to talk about that specific part of the knowledge base.

The secondary reason is that the distinction can make sense from the knowledge base modeler&#x27;s perspective. It is plausible to distinguish between our conception of terms/concepts in the world (class axioms in the TBox) and particular manifestations of those terms/concepts (instance assertions in the ABox). In the above example: when the hierarchy within a company is the same in every branch but the assignment to employees is different in every department (because there are other people working there), it makes sense to reuse the TBox for different branches that do not use the same ABox.

There are two features of description logic that are not shared by most other data description formalisms: DL does not make the unique name assumption (UNA) or the closed-world assumption (CWA). Not having UNA means that two concepts with different names may be allowed by some inference to be shown to be equivalent. Not having CWA, or rather having the open world assumption (OWA) means that lack of knowledge of a fact does not immediately imply knowledge of the negation of a fact.

==Formal description==
Like first-order logic (FOL), a syntax defines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in a description logic, and semantics determine meaning. Unlike FOL, a DL may have several well known syntactic variants.

===Syntax===
The syntax of a member of the description logic family is characterized by its recursive definition, in which the constructors that can be used to form concept terms are stated. Some constructors are related to logical constructors in first-order logic (FOL) such as &quot;intersection&quot; or &quot;conjunction&quot; of concepts, &quot;union&quot; or &quot;disjunction&quot; of concepts, &quot;negation&quot; or &quot;complement&quot; of concepts, &quot;universal restriction&quot; and &quot;existential restriction&quot;. Other constructors have no corresponding construction in FOL including restrictions on roles for example, inverse, transitivity and functionality.

====Notation====
Let C and D be concepts, a and b be individuals, and R be a role.

If a is R-related to b, then b is called an R-successor of a.

====The description logic ALC====
The prototypical DL &quot;Attributive Concept Language with Complements&quot; (formula_1) was introduced by Manfred Schmidt-Schauß and Gert Smolka in 1991, and is the basis of many more expressive DLs. The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.

Let formula_21, formula_22 and formula_23 be (respectively) sets of &quot;concept names&quot; (also known as &quot;atomic concepts&quot;), &quot;role names&quot; and &quot;individual names&quot; (also known as &quot;individuals&quot;, &quot;nominals&quot; or &quot;objects&quot;). Then the ordered triple (formula_21, formula_22, formula_23) is the &quot;signature&quot;.

=====Concepts=====
The set of formula_1 &quot;concepts&quot; is the smallest set such that:

* The following are &quot;concepts&quot;:
** formula_28 (&quot;top&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** formula_29 (&quot;bottom&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** Every formula_30 (all &quot;atomic concepts&quot; are &quot;concepts&quot;)
* If formula_31 and formula_32 are &quot;concepts&quot; and formula_33 then the following are &quot;concepts&quot;:
** formula_34 (the intersection of two &quot;concepts&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** formula_35 (the union of two &quot;concepts&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** formula_36 (the complement of a &quot;concept&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** formula_37 (the universal restriction of a &quot;concept&quot; by a &quot;role&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)
** formula_38 (the existential restriction of a &quot;concept&quot; by a &quot;role&quot; is a &quot;concept&quot;)

=====Terminological axioms=====
A &quot;general concept inclusion&quot; (GCI) has the form formula_39 where formula_31 and formula_32 are &quot;concepts&quot;. Write formula_42 when formula_39 and formula_44. A &quot;TBox&quot; is any finite set of GCIs.

=====Assertional axioms=====

* A &quot;concept assertion&quot; is a statement of the form formula_45 where formula_46 and C is a &quot;concept&quot;.
* A &quot;role assertion&quot; is a statement of the form formula_47 where formula_48 and R is a &quot;role&quot;.

An &quot;ABox&quot; is a finite set of assertional axioms.

=====Knowledge base=====
A &quot;knowledge base&quot; (KB) is an ordered pair formula_49 for TBox formula_50 and ABox formula_51.

===Semantics===
The semantics of description logics are defined by interpreting concepts as sets of individuals and roles as sets of ordered pairs of individuals. Those individuals are typically assumed from a given domain. The semantics of non-atomic concepts and roles is then defined in terms of atomic concepts and roles. This is done by using a recursive definition similar to the syntax.

====The description logic ALC====
The following definitions follow the treatment in Baader et al.

A &quot;terminological interpretation&quot; formula_52 over a &quot;signature&quot; formula_53 consists of
* a non-empty set formula_54 called the &quot;domain&quot;
* a &quot;interpretation function&quot; formula_55 that maps:
** every &quot;individual&quot; formula_56 to an element formula_57
** every &quot;concept&quot; to a subset of formula_54
** every &quot;role name&quot; to a subset of formula_59
such that
* formula_60
* formula_61
* formula_62 &quot;(union means disjunction)&quot;
* formula_63 &quot;(intersection means conjunction)&quot;
* formula_64 &quot;(complement means negation)&quot;
* formula_65
* formula_66

Define formula_67 (read &quot;in I holds&quot;) as follows

=====TBox=====
* formula_68 if and only if formula_69
* formula_70 if and only if formula_71 for every formula_72

=====ABox=====
* formula_73 if and only if formula_74
* formula_75 if and only if formula_76
* formula_77 if and only if formula_78 for every formula_79

=====Knowledge base=====
Let formula_80 be a knowledge base.

* formula_81 if and only if formula_70 and formula_77

==Inference==
===Decision problems===
In addition to the ability to describe concepts formally, one also would like to employ the description of a set of concepts to ask questions about the concepts and instances described. The most common decision problems are basic database-query-like questions like &quot;instance checking&quot; (is a particular instance (member of an ABox) a member of a given concept) and &quot;relation checking&quot; (does a relation/role hold between two instances, in other words does a have property b), and the more global-database-questions like &quot;subsumption&quot; (is a concept a subset of another concept), and &quot;concept consistency&quot; (is there no contradiction among the definitions or chain of definitions). The more operators one includes in a logic and the more complicated the TBox (having cycles, allowing non-atomic concepts to include each other), usually the higher the computational complexity is for each of these problems (see Description Logic Complexity Navigator for examples).

==Relationship with other logics==
===First-order logic===
Many DLs are decidable fragments of first-order logic (FOL) and are usually fragments of two-variable logic or guarded logic. In addition, some DLs have features that are not covered in FOL; this includes &quot;concrete domains&quot; (such as integer or strings, which can be used as ranges for roles such as &quot;hasAge&quot; or &quot;hasName&quot;) or an operator on roles for the transitive closure of that role.

===Fuzzy description logic===
Fuzzy description logics combines fuzzy logic with DLs. Since many concepts that are needed for intelligent systems lack well defined boundaries, or precisely defined criteria of membership, fuzzy logic is needed to deal with notions of vagueness and imprecision. This offers a motivation for a generalization of description logic towards dealing with imprecise and vague concepts.

===Modal logic===
Description logic is related to—but developed independently of—modal logic (ML). Many—but not all—DLs are syntactic variants of ML.

In general, an object corresponds to a possible world, a concept corresponds to a modal proposition, and a role-bounded quantifier to a modal operator with that role as its accessibility relation.

Operations on roles (such as composition, inversion, etc.) correspond to the modal operations used in dynamic logic.

====Examples====
===Temporal description logic===
Temporal description logic represents—and allows reasoning about—time dependent concepts and many different approaches to this problem exist. For example, a description logic might be combined with a modal temporal logic such as linear temporal logic.

===Reasoners===
There are some semantic reasoners that deal with OWL and DL. These are some of the most popular:
* CEL is an open source LISP-based reasoner (Apache 2.0 License).
* Cerebra Engine was a commercial C++-based reasoner, acquired in 2006 by webMethods.
* FaCT++ is a free open-source C++-based reasoner.
* KAON2 is a free (for non-commercial use) Java-based reasoner, offering fast reasoning support for OWL ontologies.
* MSPASS is a free open-source C reasoner for numerous DL models.
* Pellet is a dual-licensed (AGPL and proprietary) commercial, Java-based reasoner.
* RacerPro of Racer Systems was a commercial (free trials and research licenses are available) lisp-based reasoner, today both an open source version of RACER exists from the original developers at Lübeck University using the BSD 3 license, and also a commercialized version, still named RacerPro by Franz Inc.
* Sim-DL is a free open-source Java-based reasoner for the language ALCHQ. It also provides a similarity measurement functionality between concepts. To access this functionality a Protégé plugin can be used.
* HermiT is an open-source reasoner based on the &quot;hypertableau&quot; calculus. It is developed by the University of Oxford.
* Owlready2 is a package for ontology-oriented programming in Python. It can load OWL 2.0 ontologies as Python objects, modify them, save them, and perform reasoning via HermiT (included). Owlready2 allows a transparent access to OWL ontologies (contrary to usual Java-based API).
* OWLAPY. OWLAPY is an open-source Python framework for creating, manipulating, and reasoning with OWL ontologies. It includes a built-in StructuralReasoner for efficient, lightweight reasoning and wrappers for well-known Java-based reasoners like HermiT, Pellet, JFact, and Openllet.

===Editors===
* Protégé is a free, open-source ontology editor and a knowledge base framework, which can use DL reasoners offering DIG Interface as a back end for consistency checks.
* , an OWL browser/editor that takes the standard web browser as the basic UI paradigm.

===Interfaces===
* , a standardized XML interface to DLs systems developed by the DL Implementation Group (DIG).
* , a Java interface and implementation for the Web Ontology Language, used to represent Semantic Web ontologies.
* , a Python interface and implementation for the Web Ontology Language, used to represent Semantic Web ontologies.</text><links>

<text>June Havoc (born Ellen Evangeline Hovick; November 8, 1912 – March 28, 2010) was a Canadian-born American actress, dancer, stage director and memoirist.

Havoc was a child vaudeville performer under the tutelage of her mother Rose Thompson Hovick, born Rose Evangeline Thompson. June later acted on Broadway and in Hollywood, and stage-directed, both on and off-Broadway. She last acted on television in 1990 in a story arc on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and she last appeared on television as herself in interviews in the &quot;Vaudeville&quot; episode of &quot;American Masters&quot; in 1997 and in &quot;The Rodgers &amp; Hart: Thou Swell, Thou Witty&quot; episode of &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 1999. Her elder sister Louise gravitated to burlesque and became the well-known striptease performer Gypsy Rose Lee.

==Early life==
Ellen Evangeline Hovick was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. For many years 1916 was cited as her year of birth. Havoc acknowledged in her later years that 1912 was likely the correct year. She was reportedly uncertain of the year. Her mother forged various birth certificates for both her daughters to evade child labor laws. Her life-long career in show business began when she was a child, billed as &quot;Baby June.&quot;

Her sister, entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee (born as Rose Louise Hovick), was called &quot;Louise&quot; by her family members. Their parents were Rose Thompson Hovick, of German descent, and John (&quot;Jack&quot;) Olaf Hovick, the son of Norwegian immigrants, who worked as an advertising agent and reporter for the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; newspaper.

==Career==
===Vaudeville===
Following their parents&#x27; divorce, the two sisters earned the family&#x27;s income by appearing in vaudeville, where June&#x27;s talent often overshadowed Louise&#x27;s. Baby June got an audition with Alexander Pantages, who had come to Seattle, Washington in 1902 to build theaters up and down the west coast of the United States. Soon, she was launched in vaudeville and also appeared in Hollywood movies. She could not speak until the age of three, but the films were all silent. She would cry for the cameras when her mother told her that the family&#x27;s dog had died.

In December 1928, Havoc, in an effort to escape her overbearing mother, eloped with Bobby Reed, a boy in the vaudeville act. Weeks later after performing at the Jayhawk Theatre in Topeka, Kansas, on December 29, 1928, June&#x27;s mother, Rose, reported Reed to the Topeka Police, and he was arrested. Rose pulled out a concealed gun when she met Bobby at the police station, intending to shoot him, but the gun didn&#x27;t fire because the safety was on. She then physically attacked her son-in-law, and the police had to pry her off the hapless Reed. June subsequently left both her family and the act. Though the marriage didn&#x27;t last long, the two remained friends.

===Film and stage===

She adopted the surname Havoc, a variant of her birth name. In 1936, Havoc got her first part on Broadway in the Sigmund Romberg operetta &quot;Forbidden Melody&quot;. In 1940, she gave a show-stopping performance as Gladys Bumps in the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, with Gene Kelly in the lead role and Van Johnson, who was in the chorus, along with future film director Stanley Donen. Based on their success, Havoc, Johnson and Kelly were beckoned by Hollywood. Havoc made her first film in 1942, and she began to alternate film roles with returns to the Broadway stage. From 1942 to 1944, Havoc appeared in 11 films, including &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; with Rosalind Russell, and &quot;No Time for Love&quot; with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray. She then returned to Broadway in the 1943–44 season, co-starring with Bobby Clark in the Cole Porter musical &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot;, for which she received the Donaldson Award for best performance by an actress in a supporting role in a musical.

In 1944, Ethel Merman was tapped to star as the title character in the musical play &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot;, with a score by Vernon Duke and Howard Dietz, directed and produced by Rouben Mamoulian. The musical play was based on the short story &quot;Rain&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham. The serious production was a departure from Merman’s string of successful musical comedies. Moreover, during rehearsals, Merman had difficulties memorizing the lyrics, and she blamed Dietz for his use of sophisticated and foreign words. She had her husband, newspaper promotion director Bob Levitt, tone down some of the lyrics. Dietz took exception to Merman’s singing the altered lyrics and gave her an ultimatum to sing his original lyrics or leave the show. In response, Merman withdrew from the production. (Some have since speculated that Merman&#x27;s departure was probably due to her reluctance to assume such a serious role in her first dramatic musical.)
Havoc left her starring role in &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot;, and assumed the role written for Merman. The production of &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; had a difficult out-of-town tryout with songs being deleted and other songs added. Indeed, even after the Broadway opening, musical numbers continued to be cut and other numbers added. &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; opened on Broadway on November 16, 1944, to mixed reviews. Havoc received almost uniformly favorable reviews. She was called the “most enjoyable asset” of the show and praised for the “consummate skill of her artistry.” Her performance was described as “surprisingly effective“ and “truly touching,” and she was deemed a “worthy successor” to Jeanne Eagels, who had famously first portrayed the role on Broadway in the play &quot;Rain&quot;. The score and the book received mixed reviews, with the score called “undistinguished.” However, one reviewer compared the show favorably to &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, which Mamoulian had also directed. Nonetheless, the show lasted only 60 performances and closed on January 6, 1945. In 1945, Havoc was featured in the film &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and starred in &quot;The Ryan Girl&quot; on Broadway.

In Hollywood, Havoc played the second female lead for three of the most popular musical movie stars in the 1940s and early 1950s: Alice Faye in &quot;Hello, Frisco, Hello&quot; with John Payne
(1943); Betty Grable in &quot;When My Baby Smiles at Me&quot; with Dan Dailey (1948); and Betty Hutton in &quot;Red, Hot, and Blue&quot; with Victor Mature (1949). She also played leading roles in several films noir: &quot;Intrigue&quot; with George Raft (1947), &quot;Chicago Deadline&quot; with Alan Ladd (1949), &quot;The Story of Molly X&quot; with John Russell (1949), and &quot;Once A Thief&quot; with Cesar Romero (1950). Havoc&#x27;s best-remembered film role was probably as the Jewish, yet closeted about her identity, secretary in the Elia Kazan Oscar-winning best film &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;.

In the late 1950s, Havoc decided that she wanted to act in classic plays. In 1956, she worked with the Phoenix Theatre Company, first starring as Queen Jocasta opposite John Kerr in &quot;The Infernal Machine&quot;, playwright Jean Cocteau’s retelling of the Oedipus myth. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson opined that her performance brought “a gravity and force that become the tragic situation.” Next Havoc played Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the American Shakespeare Festival Theater &amp; Academy. Atkinson called her Titania “conspicuously delightful” and found her performance, along with those of Barbara Barrie and Inga Swenson, “a fine Shakespeare revel.” She then returned to the Phoenix Theatre company for the production of &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot;. Atkinson observed that Havoc played Mrs. Sullen “as a lovely lady with an infectious sense of humor.”

Havoc and her sister continued to get demands for money and gifts from their mother until her death in 1954. After their mother&#x27;s death, the sisters then were free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. Lee&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, published in 1957, inspired the Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim, and Arthur Laurents Broadway musical &quot;Gypsy: A Musical Fable&quot;. Havoc did not like the way she or her mother were portrayed in the piece, which became a source of disagreement between the sisters, but did nothing to obstruct the production. Havoc and Lee were estranged for many years, but reconciled shortly before Lee&#x27;s death in 1970.

In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized the creation of the President’s Special International Program, under the United States Department of State and its agent, the International Cultural Exchange Service of America. The Program, with the American National Theatre and Academy, established the Theatre Guild American Repertory Theatre to perform a program of plays abroad. Havoc, as well as Helen Hayes, Leif Erickson and others, made six-month commitments to participate in the repertory company. Three plays were selected to be performed in repertory: &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, in which Havoc played Sabina and Hayes portrayed Mrs. Antrobus; &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;, in which Havoc portrayed Mrs. Keller; and &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, in which Hayes played the mother. The playwrights, Thornton Wilder, William Gibson and Tennessee Williams, all personally supervised the productions of their plays. In February and early March 1960, the repertory company performed the plays at the National Theater in Washington, D.C. Commencing later in March, the company toured in Europe and the Middle East, performing the plays in major cities in Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Switzerland and France. Later in the year, the repertory company toured Latin America, performing the same plays, and was the first American repertory theater company to perform in Latin America.

In 1959, Havoc&#x27;s first memoir, &quot;Early Havoc&quot;, was published. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic called the book &quot;spirited&quot; and &quot;entertaining.&quot; In the memoir, Havoc recounted her life from childhood to 1933, when she first competed in a marathon dance contest. The chapters alternated between a chronological progression and a description of the grueling marathon dance contest, detailing the desperation and degradation she experienced and observed. At the time of the book&#x27;s publication, Havoc was appearing on Broadway in the play &quot;The Warm Peninsula&quot;, co-starring Julie Harris and Farley Granger. Harris read the memoir, and was so taken with the dance contest chapters that she urged Havoc to write a play based upon that experience. At first she demurred, never having written a play. However, Harris persisted, and when she said that she would star as Havoc&#x27;s character in the play, Havoc was finally persuaded to write the play. Upon completion, the play &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; was performed in a workshop at the Actors Studio. David Merrick optioned the play for Broadway with Gower Champion set to direct. However, Havoc canceled the option, explaining that Merrick wanted to turn the play into a musical. Champion responded that Havoc had canceled the option because Merrick had wanted her to work with another writer to revise the play, and she had refused.

Havoc then planned to present &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; in the Riviera Terrace ballroom, an actual dance hall. However, when the ballroom was sold, she agreed to present her play on Broadway. As director and choreographer, Havoc turned the stage at the ANTA Theatre into a dance hall. &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; proved to be a flop, opening on December 22, 1963, running for 48 performances and closing on February 1, 1964. The play featured 34 actors, several of whom had highly successful careers, including Doris Roberts, Joe Don Baker, Conrad Janis, Gabriel Dell and Ralph Waite. The play earned four Tony nominations, including nominations for Havoc for best direction of a play and for Harris as best actress in a play.

Havoc wrote three more plays, &quot;I, Said The Fly&quot;, &quot;The Great State of Hysteria&quot; and &quot;The Great Elinor Glyn Emancipation Gun Powder Love Regatta&quot;; the book and lyrics for a musical, &quot;Oh Glorious Tintinnabulation&quot;; as well as a one-woman show and a second memoir, titled &quot;More Havoc&quot;. In reviewing &quot;More Havoc,&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic called Havoc a &quot;writer of consequence&quot; and described the book as &quot;a vivid, biting and painfully real remembrance of her own walk on the wild side of the Depression years and on up through her triumph in &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and Hollywood stardom.&quot;

In 1966, Havoc appeared as Millicent Jordan in an all-star revival of &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; on Broadway, directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie, and featuring Walter Pidgeon, Arlene Francis, Darren McGavin and Pamela Tiffin. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Walter Kerr lauded Havoc’s performance as the hostess of the dinner, noting that she was becoming this country’s Vivien Leigh. Kerr observed: “She makes the prospect of spending the entire day on the telephone rounding up a guest list, sound like work for a contented dove. That is to say, she coos cheerily, even with a pencil in her mouth, as she sets about buttering up all the people who can’t say, “no,” and she caresses her very chic white French phone with the exquisite finesse of a Victorian gentlewoman doing needlework.”

During the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, the National Endowment for the Arts and the U.S. Department of Education provided funding in 1966 for the creation of professional theater programs in three cities: Los Angeles, New Orleans and Providence, Rhode Island. In New Orleans, the professional theater company was named The Repertory Theatre, New Orleans (“the Repertory Theatre”). The program involved 48,000 high school students, who saw four plays each year after reading the plays in class. The productions included guest actors, such as Havoc, who portrayed Mrs. Malaprop in &quot;The Rivals&quot;, and also lectured in the schools.

After President Richard M. Nixon took office in January 1969, the federal funding ended. The Repertory Theatre sought to become self-sustaining and hired Havoc as the artistic director. She created a theater in a vacant 100-year-old synagogue, constructing a thrust stage with audience members seated on three sides. She also established an apprentice program for teenagers, an acting school, and a space for an African American theater group. Havoc was able to lure well-known actors to participate in productions, such as Julie Harris and Jessica Walter in &quot;The Women&quot;. After the 1970 season, Havoc resigned due to budgetary limitations. Her farewell production in November 1970 was &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, with Havoc portraying Sabina and at age 58, performing on a trapeze above the audience.

In the fall of 1982, Havoc became the eighth and final actress to portray the featured role of the villainous &quot;Miss Hannigan&quot; in the long-running original Broadway production of the musical &quot;Annie&quot;. She continued in the role until the show closed after more than four years on January 2, 1983. In 1995, she made her last New York stage appearance at age 82 as the title character in &quot;The Old Lady’s Guide to Survival&quot; at the Off-Broadway Lamb&#x27;s Theatre. Her performance was cited as one of the season&#x27;s five best by an actress in a primary role by the editors of &quot;The Best Plays of 1994–1995&quot;. At age 88, Havoc starred with Dick Cavett in the Tennessee Williams one-act play &quot;Lifeboat Drill&quot; as part of the January 26, 2002, fourth Tennessee Williams marathon at the Hartford Stage Company.

===Television and radio===
Havoc performed intermittently on the radio in the 1940s and early 1950s. Her performances ranged from full-length plays, such as &quot;Golden Boy&quot; on the prestigious Theater Guild on the Air and &quot;Skylark&quot; on NBC Best Plays, to the more popular mystery program &quot;Suspense&quot;. Under the pseudonym Armana Fargey, she also appeared on episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Sam Spade&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot;.

In the 1950s, Havoc was a frequent performer on anthology television series, both filmed, such as General Electric Theater, and live, such as the Peabody Award-winning &quot;Celanese Theatre&quot;, the Emmy Award-winning Robert Montgomery Presents and &quot;Omnibus&quot;. She starred in a weekly half hour series &quot;Willy&quot; during the 1954–1955 television season. In some respects, the show was ahead of its time in that Havoc&#x27;s character, Willa “Willy” Dodger, was an unmarried lawyer with her own legal practice in a small New England town. Lucille Ball had encouraged her to star in a weekly series, and the show was a Desilu production. Like &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Willy&quot; was filmed before a live studio audience. Her husband, William Spier, was the producer. &quot;Willy&quot; was broadcast on CBS at 10:30 p.m. on Saturdays opposite the popular NBC series, &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. Midway through the season, an attempt was made to increase ratings by having Havoc&#x27;s character relocate to New York to represent show business clients; however, the show lasted only one season.

From the 1960s through 1990, Havoc appeared occasionally on such successful television series as &quot;The Untouchables&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;; &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;; and &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, as well as an arc on the popular soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Personal life==
Havoc was married three times. Her first marriage, at age 16, was in December 1928 to Bobby Reed, a boy in her vaudeville act. Her second marriage was to Donald S. Gibbs in 1936; they divorced in December 1942. Her third marriage, to radio and television director and producer William Spier, lasted from January 25, 1948 until his death in 1973. Havoc&#x27;s sister Gypsy Rose Lee died of lung cancer in 1970, aged 59, and is interred at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. June&#x27;s only child was a daughter, April Rose Hyde, born April 2, 1932. A marriage license, dated November 30, 1928 for Ellen Hovick and Weldon Hyde would seem to indicate that Bobby Reed&#x27;s real name was Weldon Hyde. However, in her second memoir &quot;More Havoc&quot;, Havoc admitted that her daughter&#x27;s father was Jamie Smythe, a marathon dance promoter. This suggestion seems credible since she had separated from her first husband before she entered her first marathon dance contest in 1933. April became an actress known as April Kent in the 1950s, appearing in such films as &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; and &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot;. April pre-deceased her mother, dying in the Paris suburb of Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis on December 28, 1998, at the age of 66.

In 1947, Havoc was a member of the Committee for the First Amendment (“the FAC”), founded by Philip Dunne, Myrna Loy, John Huston and William Wyler, to support freedom of speech in the film industry during the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee (&quot;HUAC&quot;) . HUAC was conducting an investigation of Communist infiltration of the film industry prompted in part by the films &quot;Crossfire&quot; and &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, in which antisemitism was a focal point. Havoc had played the supporting role of a secretary who is Jewish but also expresses anti-Semitic sentiments in the latter film. On October 26, Havoc boarded a chartered plane with 22 other FAC members, including Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Danny Kaye, to Washington, D.C. to protest and attend the second week of hearings. The FAC also sponsored two network radio broadcasts, Hollywood Fights Back, on October 26, and November 2, 1947, in which Havoc and 44 other members voiced their opposition to the HUAC hearings and the existence of the committee itself.

The FAC members, including Havoc, walked to the Capitol and attended the October 27 hearing. The members were escorted past empty seats to the back of the hearing room where Rep. J. Parnell Thomas, the HUAC chairman, had reserved seats for them. They were treated to a raucous confrontation between Thomas and the subpoenaed witness, screenwriter John Howard Lawson. Lawson refused to answer whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party and was held in contempt; evidence, including Lawson’s Communist party membership card, was then introduced. Although the FAC members had planned to attend only one day of the hearings, they stayed a second day before returning to Los Angeles. On October 30, Thomas abruptly ended the hearings without calling several subpoenaed witnesses to the relief of the film industry. However, he threatened to reconvene the hearings. Moreover, the committee had held 10 screenwriters and directors in contempt and introduced their Communist Party membership cards into evidence. Moreover, the FAC members’ trip to Congress proved to be a public relations fiasco. The general public perceived the FAC members as supporting the proven Communist Party members, not their freedom of speech. As a result, movie box office receipts dropped 20%, and even established stars like Bogart were compelled to make public apologies. It is unknown whether Havoc’s film career was affected. However, the fact that she had prominent roles in three films in 1948 and three films in 1949 would suggest otherwise. One of her 1948 films was &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot;, which was an anti-communist movie produced by Daryl F. Zanuck in response to Thomas’ claims that Hollywood did not produce such films.

In 1967, Havoc founded Youthbridge, a program that provided theatrical training to adolescents, primarily African American adolescents, at the Bridgeport, Connecticut YWCA. She was the executive and artistic director of the Youthbridge program and participated in fund raising events.

In the mid-1970s, Havoc purchased for $230,000 an abandoned train depot and various pre-Civil War buildings on eight acres of land called Cannon Crossing in the Cannondale Historic District of Wilton, Connecticut. Restoring, rebuilding and re-purposing several small buildings from other locations, she worked hands-on and successfully completed this vast restoration project, which remains a popular destination today. It is home to artisan shops, galleries, boutiques, a cafe and a restaurant. Havoc sold the enclave in 1989. A long-time resident of Fairfield County (Weston, Wilton and lastly North Stamford) Connecticut, Havoc was fiercely devoted to the care and well-being of animals. Her homes were a nurturing and loving sanctuary to many orphaned geese, donkeys, cats, and dogs over the decades. Havoc set aside half of the acreage at Cannon Crossing for rescued animals, and Blessing of the Animals ceremonies were held annually just before Christmas at Cannon Crossing.

Havoc supported Democrat Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Havoc died at her home in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 28, 2010, from unspecified natural causes. She was believed to be 97 at the time of her death.

==Honors==

Havoc received the Donaldson Award for best supporting actress in a musical comedy (&quot;Mexican Hayride&quot;) in the 1943–1944 Broadway season.

In 1960, Havoc was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fameone at 6618 Hollywood Boulevard for her contributions to the motion picture industry, and the other at 6413 Hollywood Boulevard for television.

Havoc was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play in 1964 for &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot;, which she wrote.

In 1971, Havoc received a Humanitarian Award from Bridgeport University, Bridgeport, Connecticut.

For her performance in &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot;, Havoc was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for best supporting actress in a play for the 1975–76 Broadway season.

In 2000, Havoc was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==
The June Havoc Theatre, housed at the Abingdon Theatre in New York City, was named for her in 2003.

Havoc was the first American woman nominated for a Tony Award for direction of a play. 

In his autobiography &quot;Original Story&quot;, Arthur Laurents reports that June Havoc refused to sign a release for any claim regarding the content of the musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;. Havoc demanded that his script state that she was age 13 when she left the vaudeville act and eloped with one of the dancers. Laurents explains that he objected to Havoc&#x27;s demand because the audience would lose any sympathy for the character of her mother Rose. He indicates that, while the musical was in tryouts out of town, he altered the script, changing the name of Havoc&#x27;s character from Dainty June to Dainty Claire. He states that as a result, Havoc signed the release, and her character&#x27;s name was restored to Dainty June.

In her one-woman show, &quot;Elaine Stritch at Liberty&quot;, Elaine Stritch recalled that after the closing of the play &quot;Time of the Barracudas&quot; on the West Coast, she returned to New York and landed a leading role in the play &quot;Oh Glorious Tintinnabulation&quot;. Stritch recounted that the play was written and directed by June Havoc and scheduled for performance at the Lincoln Center Theater. According to Stritch, during dress rehearsal, Havoc told Stritch that &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t working out.&quot; Stritch added that she went home and that Havoc assumed the role she had been playing. She noted that this incident resulted in an article by Lee Israel, in which Stritch criticized directors, published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which led to her casting in the musical &quot;Company&quot;.

Havoc&#x27;s papers are held in the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University, and a 28-page inventory is accessible online.

<text>Gypsy Rose Lee (born Rose Louise Hovick, January 8, 1911 – April 26, 1970) was an American burlesque entertainer, stripper, actress, author, playwright and vedette, famous for her striptease act. Her 1957 memoir, &quot;&quot;, was adapted into the 1959 stage musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;.

==Early life==
Rose Louise Hovick was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 8, 1911; however, she always gave January 9 as her date of birth. She was known as Louise to her family. Her sister, actress June Havoc, was born in 1912. Their mother, Rose Thompson Hovick, forged various birth certificates for each of her daughters—older when needed to evade varying state child labor laws, and younger for reduced or free train fares. The girls were unsure until later in life what their years of birth were.

Their mother had married Norwegian-American John Olaf Hovick, a newspaper-advertising salesman and a reporter at &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;. They married on May 28, 1910, in Seattle. They divorced on August 20, 1915. Rose Thompson married her second husband, Judson Brennerman, a traveling salesman, on May 26, 1916, at a Unitarian church in Seattle, with the Rev. J. D. A. Powers officiating.

After Hovick and Brennerman divorced, June supported the family by appearing in vaudeville, being billed &quot;Tiniest Toe Dancer in the World&quot; when she was only . Rose and June went to Hollywood for two years where June appeared in short films directed by Hal Roach. Louise was left behind while June and her mother were on the road. She had an elementary education, unlike June who was taught to read by stagehands. Much to her mother&#x27;s displeasure, June eloped with Bobby Reed, a dancer in their act, in December 1928, after a performance in Topeka, Kansas, at the Jayhawk Theatre and went on to pursue a brief career in marathon dancing, a more profitable vocation than tap dancing.

==Career==
Louise&#x27;s singing and dancing talents were insufficient to sustain the act without June. Eventually, it became apparent that Louise could make money in burlesque, which earned her legendary status as an elegant and witty striptease artist. Initially, her act was propelled forward when a shoulder strap on one of her gowns gave way, causing her dress to fall to her feet despite her efforts to cover herself; encouraged by the audience&#x27;s response, she went on to make the trick the focus of her performance.

Her innovations were an almost casual stripping style compared to bump &amp; grind styles of most burlesque strippers (she emphasized the &quot;tease&quot; in &quot;striptease&quot;), and she brought a sharp sense of humor into her act as well. She became as famous for her onstage wit as for her stripping style, and—changing her stage name to Gypsy Rose Lee—she became one of the biggest stars of Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque, where she performed for four years. She was frequently arrested in raids on the Minsky brothers&#x27; shows. During the Great Depression, Lee spoke at various union meetings in support of New York laborers. According to activist Harry Fisher, her talks were among those that attracted the largest audiences.

In 1937 and 1938, billed as Louise Hovick, she made five films in Hollywood. But her acting was generally panned, so she returned to New York City where she had an affair with film producer Michael Todd and co-produced and appeared in his 1942 musical revue, &quot;Star and Garter&quot;.

Lee viewed herself as a &quot;high-class&quot; stripper, and she approved of H. L. Mencken&#x27;s term &quot;ecdysiast&quot;, which he coined as a more &quot;dignified&quot; way of referring to the profession. Her style of intellectual recitation while stripping was spoofed in the number &quot;Zip!&quot; in Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, a musical in which June Havoc had appeared on Broadway, opposite Gene Kelly. Lee performed an abbreviated version of her act (intellectual recitation and all) in the 1943 film &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot;.

In 1941, Lee wrote a mystery thriller called &quot;The G-String Murders&quot;, which was made into the sanitized 1943 film, &quot;Lady of Burlesque&quot; starring Barbara Stanwyck. While some assert this was in fact ghost-written by Craig Rice, there are those who claim that there is more than sufficient written evidence in the form of manuscripts and Lee&#x27;s own correspondence to prove that she wrote a large part of the novel herself under the guidance of Rice and others, including her editor George Davis, a friend and mentor.

Lee&#x27;s second murder mystery, &quot;Mother Finds a Body&quot;, was published in 1942. In December 1942, preliminary papers alleging breach of contract were filed in the Supreme Court against Lee by Dorothy Wheelock, associate editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine, alleging that in August 1940 she and Gypsy entered into what Wheelock described as &quot;an oral agreement to collaborate on a joint venture involving the conception, construction, development, writing and exploitation of a literary work with a burlesque background. The agreement, Miss Wheelock went on, called for a 50:50 split on all income from sale of the book. She charged that she had lined up a publisher for the book when, in November 1940, Gypsy called off the collaboration… Lee said she turned over notes and other material to Miss Wheelock and that the latter had then written &#x27;a sample book&#x27;. However this sample book is not the book that was published, Gypsy declared. She denied any resemblance between Miss Wheelock&#x27;s book and the book published under her own name, except such similarities as might stem from the notes Gypsy turned over to Miss Wheelock. Simon &amp; Schuster agreed to publish the book, Gypsy said, after the first three chapters were shown to them by Janet Flanner, a New York writer&quot;. The case was settled out of court.

==Relationships==
In Hollywood, Lee married Arnold &quot;Bob&quot; Mizzy on August 25, 1937, at the insistence of the film studio. She obtained a divorce in 1941, claiming cruelty, although biographer Noralee Frankel suggests the couple agreed that Lee could bring false charges so the divorce could go through uncontested.

In 1942, she married William Alexander Kirkland; they divorced in 1944. While married to Kirkland, she gave birth on December 11, 1944, to a son fathered by Otto Preminger. Her son was named Erik Lee, but has since been known successively as Erik Kirkland, Erik de Diego, and Erik Lee Preminger.

Gypsy married a third time in 1948, to Julio de Diego,&lt;ref name=&quot;life.com/photos-gypsy-rose-lee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but that union also ended in divorce.

In 1940, she purchased a townhouse on East 63rd Street in Manhattan with a private courtyard, 26 rooms and seven baths. Mother Rose continued to demand money from Lee and Havoc. Lee rented a ten-room apartment on West End Avenue in Manhattan for Rose, who opened a boardinghouse for women there.

On one occasion in the 1930s, Rose Thompson Hovick allegedly shot and killed a woman who was either a guest at the boardinghouse or a guest on the farm in Highland Mills in Orange County, New York, that Rose owned. A historical website cites varying reports of which place was the scene of the crime. According to Gypsy&#x27;s son, Erik Lee Preminger, who is the author of several books, the murder victim was Mother Rose&#x27;s female lover, who had allegedly made a pass at Gypsy. The violent incident was investigated and reportedly explained away as a suicide. Mother Rose was not prosecuted. Mother Rose&#x27;s biographer strongly rejects the possibility that this woman, Genevieve Augustine, was Rose&#x27;s lover, and doubts Rose&#x27;s complicity in her death in light of Augustine&#x27;s previous suicide attempts. Rose Thompson Hovick died in 1954 of colon cancer.

==Later years==

After the death of their mother, the sisters felt free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. &quot;&quot; was published in 1957 and served as inspiration for the Jule Styne, Stephen Sondheim, and Arthur Laurents 1959 musical &quot;Gypsy&quot;. June did not like the way she was portrayed in the piece, but she was eventually persuaded not to oppose it for her sister&#x27;s sake. The show and the 1962 movie adaptation assured Gypsy a steady income. The sisters became estranged for a period of time but reconciled. June, in turn, wrote &quot;Early Havoc&quot; and &quot;More Havoc&quot;, to tell her version of their history.

Gypsy Rose Lee went on to host a daytime San Francisco KGO-TV television talk show, &quot; The Gypsy Rose Lee Show&quot; (754 episodes, aired 1965–1968).&lt;ref name=&quot;nypl/research/b15809423&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nypl/research/b15454072&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The popular afternoon show featured such guests as Judy Garland, Agnes Moorehead, and Woody Allen, showcasing her love of people, pets and knitting among other interests.

Like well-known artists such as Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway, Gypsy Rose Lee was a supporter of the Popular Front movement in the Spanish Civil War and raised money for charity to alleviate the suffering of Spanish children during the conflict. &quot;She became politically active, and supported Spanish Loyalists during Spain&#x27;s Civil War. She also became a fixture at Communist United Front meetings, and was investigated by the House Committee on un-American activities.&quot; 

Lee was a Democrat who supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential election. The walls of her Los Angeles home were adorned with pictures by Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, and Dorothea Tanning, all reportedly given to her by the artists themselves.
In 1969, she performed for American troops in Vietnam, who, she said, &quot;considered her their sexy grandmother&quot;.

==Death==
Lee died of lung cancer in Los Angeles in 1970, aged 59. Upon her death, she left an estate valued at US$575,000 (US$4,678,486 in 2024). She is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

==Legacy==

*The song &quot;Zip&quot; from the musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, written by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, imagines the thoughts and musings that go through Gypsy Rose Lee&#x27;s mind while she strips onstage, as recounted by a newspaper reporter who sings of her interview with Miss Lee as having been &quot;my greatest achievement&quot; in a career full of notable celebrity interviews. Elaine Stritch regularly performed this song (as the interviewer) for many years.
* Punk band The Distillers wrote &quot;Gypsy Rose Lee&quot;, a song for their debut album in 2000.
* In 1973, Tony Orlando and Dawn recorded &quot;Say, Has Anybody Seen My Sweet Gypsy Rose&quot; by W. M. Irwin Levine &amp; L. Russell Brown. (The song refers to Lee&#x27;s profession, but is about a fictional character with a similar name.)
* In January 2012, Seattle Theater Writers (a group of arts critics for various publications) awarded the first Gypsy Rose Lee Awards, celebrating excellence in local theatre.
* The Academy Film Archive has preserved a number of Lee&#x27;s home movies, including behind-the-scenes footage from films in which she appeared.

<text>Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories. Emphasis on metamathematics (and perhaps the creation of the term itself) owes itself to David Hilbert&#x27;s attempt to secure the foundations of mathematics in the early part of the 20th century. Metamathematics provides &quot;a rigorous mathematical technique for investigating a great variety of foundation problems for mathematics and logic&quot; (Kleene 1952, p. 59). An important feature of metamathematics is its emphasis on differentiating between reasoning from inside a system and from outside a system. An informal illustration of this is categorizing the proposition &quot;2+2=4&quot; as belonging to mathematics while categorizing the proposition &quot;&#x27;2+2=4&#x27; is valid&quot; as belonging to metamathematics.

== History ==
Metamathematical metatheorems about mathematics itself were originally differentiated from ordinary mathematical theorems in the 19th century to focus on what was then called the foundational crisis of mathematics. Richard&#x27;s paradox (Richard 1905) concerning certain &#x27;definitions&#x27; of real numbers in the English language is an example of the sort of contradictions that can easily occur if one fails to distinguish between mathematics and metamathematics. Something similar can be said around the well-known Russell&#x27;s paradox (Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?).

Metamathematics was intimately connected to mathematical logic, so that the early histories of the two fields, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, largely overlap. More recently, mathematical logic has often included the study of new pure mathematics, such as set theory, category theory, recursion theory and pure model theory.

Serious metamathematical reflection began with the work of Gottlob Frege, especially his &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot;, published in 1879.

David Hilbert was the first to invoke the term &quot;metamathematics&quot; with regularity (see Hilbert&#x27;s program), in the early 20th century. In his hands, it meant something akin to contemporary proof theory, in which finitary methods are used to study various axiomatized mathematical theorems (Kleene 1952, p. 55).

Other prominent figures in the field include Bertrand Russell, Thoralf Skolem, Emil Post, Alonzo Church, Alan Turing, Stephen Kleene, Willard Quine, Paul Benacerraf, Hilary Putnam, Gregory Chaitin, Alfred Tarski, Paul Cohen and Kurt Gödel.

Today, metalogic and metamathematics broadly overlap, and both have been substantially subsumed by mathematical logic in academia.

== Milestones ==
=== The discovery of hyperbolic geometry ===
The discovery of hyperbolic geometry had important philosophical consequences for metamathematics. Before its discovery there was just one geometry and mathematics; the idea that another geometry existed was considered improbable.

When Gauss discovered hyperbolic geometry, it is said that he did not publish anything about it out of fear of the &quot;uproar of the Boeotians&quot;, which would ruin his status as &quot;princeps mathematicorum&quot; (Latin, &quot;the Prince of Mathematicians&quot;). 
The &quot;uproar of the Boeotians&quot; came and went, and gave an impetus to metamathematics and great improvements in mathematical rigour, analytical philosophy and logic.

=== &quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; ===

&quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; (German for, roughly, &quot;concept-script&quot;) is a book on logic by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879, and the formal system set out in that book.

&quot;Begriffsschrift&quot; is usually translated as &quot;concept writing&quot; or &quot;concept notation&quot;; the full title of the book identifies it as &quot;a formula language, modeled on that of arithmetic, of pure thought.&quot; Frege&#x27;s motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled Leibniz&#x27;s motivation for his calculus ratiocinator (despite that, in his &quot;Foreword&quot; Frege clearly denies that he reached this aim, and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like Leibniz&#x27;s, what Frege declares to be quite hard and idealistic, however, not impossible task). Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the foundations of mathematics, carried out over the next quarter century.

=== &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; ===

&quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, or &quot;PM&quot; as it is often abbreviated, was an attempt to describe a set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven. As such, this ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy, being one of the foremost products of the belief that such an undertaking may be achievable. However, in 1931, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem proved definitively that PM, and in fact any other attempt, could never achieve this goal; that is, for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.

One of the main inspirations and motivations for &quot;PM&quot; was the earlier work of Gottlob Frege on logic, which Russell discovered allowed for the construction of paradoxical sets. &quot;PM&quot; sought to avoid this problem by ruling out the unrestricted creation of arbitrary sets. This was achieved by replacing the notion of a general set with notion of a hierarchy of sets of different &#x27;types&#x27;, a set of a certain type only allowed to contain sets of strictly lower types. Contemporary mathematics, however, avoids paradoxes such as Russell&#x27;s in less unwieldy ways, such as the system of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

===Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem ===

Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that establish inherent limitations of all but the most trivial axiomatic systems capable of doing arithmetic. The theorems, proven by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The two results are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert&#x27;s program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible, giving a negative answer to Hilbert&#x27;s second problem.

The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an &quot;effective procedure&quot; (e.g., a computer program, but it could be any sort of algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the relations of the natural numbers (arithmetic). For any such system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that such a system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

===Tarski&#x27;s definition of model-theoretic satisfaction===

The T-schema or truth schema (not to be confused with &#x27;Convention T&#x27;) is used to give an inductive definition of truth which lies at the heart of any realisation of Alfred Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory of truth. Some authors refer to it as the &quot;Equivalence Schema&quot;, a synonym introduced by Michael Dummett.

The T-schema is often expressed in natural language, but it can be formalized in many-sorted predicate logic or modal logic; such a formalisation is called a T-theory. T-theories form the basis of much fundamental work in philosophical logic, where they are applied in several important controversies in analytic philosophy.

As expressed in semi-natural language (where &#x27;S&#x27; is the name of the sentence abbreviated to S):
&#x27;S&#x27; is true if and only if S

Example: &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white.

=== The undecidability of the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; ===

The (German for &#x27;decision problem&#x27;) is a challenge posed by David Hilbert in 1928. The asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic (possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; according to whether the statement is &quot;universally valid&quot;, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms. By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.

In 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notation of &quot;effectively calculable&quot; is captured by the functions computable by a Turing machine (or equivalently, by those expressible in the lambda calculus). This assumption is now known as the Church–Turing thesis.

<text>Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner, M.D. (22 August 1867 – 24 January 1939) was a Swiss physician and a pioneer nutritionist credited for popularizing muesli and raw food vegetarianism.

==Biography==
Maximilian Oskar Bircher-Benner was born on 22 August 1867 in Aarau, Switzerland, to Heinrich Bircher and Berta Krüsi. He attended the University of Zurich to study medicine, and later opened his own general clinic.

During the first year the clinic was open, Bircher-Benner developed jaundice, and he claimed he recovered by eating raw apples. From this observation, he experimented with the health effects raw foods have on the body, and from this he promoted muesli; a dish based on raw oats, fruits and nuts. Bircher-Benner expanded on his nutritional research and opened a sanatorium called &quot;Vital Force&quot; in 1897. He believed raw fruits and vegetables held the most nutritional value, cooked and commercially processed foods held even less, and meat held the least nutritional value. Eventually, Bircher-Benner gave up meat entirely and became a vegetarian. Other scientists of the time did not respond well to what Bircher-Benner referred to as his &quot;new food science,&quot; but was sufficiently popular with the general public that he expanded his sanatorium practice.

His nutritional habits and eating patterns steadily grew in popularity until he died on 24 January 1939 in Zürich.

==Nutrition==
At his sanatorium in Zürich, a balanced diet of raw vegetables and fruit was used as a means to heal patients, contrary to the beliefs commonly held at the end of the 19th century. Bircher-Benner believed raw foods were more nutritious because they contain direct energy from the sun. He encouraged people of good health to eat approximately 50% raw foods on a daily basis, and for those with poor health to eat 100% raw foods. Bircher-Benner&#x27;s sisters, Alice Bircher and Berta Brupbacher-Bircher, created many recipes using raw foods to help a diet of raw foods seem more appealing. Because of this help from his sisters, his sanatorium gained enormous popularity and he expanded the size of his clinic.

Bircher-Benner postulated eating fruit, vegetables and nuts instead of meat. He also advocated a spartan physical regime. At his Zürich sanatorium off Bircher-Benner-Platz, the patients had to follow a somewhat monastic daily schedule including early bedtime (21:00), physical training and active gardening work. Each meal began with a small dish of muesli, developed by Bircher-Benner, followed by mostly raw vegetables and a dessert. Patients were not allowed to consume alcohol, coffee, chocolate or tobacco while they were being treated. Bircher-Benner also recommended his patients to sunbathe, take cold showers and use a medicinal bath developed by American physician John Harvey Kellogg. His theory of life was based on harmony between people and nature, a key component of a German lifestyle reform movement, and the reason he named his clinic &quot;Vital Force.&quot;

== Criticism ==

Bircher-Benner held pseudoscientific ideas about nutrition, including vitalism. He believed that all people including babies should eat only raw food. Bircher-Benner developed the idea that cooking deprived foods of their nutritional content and destroyed their &quot;vital substance&quot;. He believed that cooked foods leave decay in the digestive tract, that may cause autointoxication.

Bircher-Benner&#x27;s work was not recognized by other scientists until the discovery of vitamins in fruits and vegetables in the 1930s. Because his ideas about nutrition were not supported by the science of his day, he was dismissed as a quack by the medical profession. A contemporaneous academic review of Bircher-Benner&#x27;s cookbook &quot;Health-Giving Dishes&quot; claims that the work contains &quot;a mixture of physiological half-truths and fantasies&quot; and concludes that the number of people capable of eating solely raw fruits and vegetables as Bircher-Benner encouraged is limited because only few humans can live as herbivores. Thomas Mann, a well-known novelist, visited the sanatorium and described it as a &quot;health jail.&quot; 

Despite disapproval from others, Bircher-Benner&#x27;s ideas caught the public&#x27;s eye and his sanatorium stayed in business until some time after his death.

==Legacy==
Shortly after his death, a second sanatorium was opened and named &quot;People&#x27;s Sanatorium for a Lifestyle Based on Nature,&quot; and was run according to Bircher-Benner&#x27;s ideas. In 1939, the Vital Force clinic was renamed the &quot;Bircher-Benner Clinic&quot; in his memory. In the late 20th century, after closure of the sanatorium, it was briefly a student hostel. It has since been purchased by Zürich Financial Services, and is named the Zürich Development Center. It is used for executive training, and also houses an extensive private art collection.

Several brands of factory-made cereals based on Bircher-Benner&#x27;s original recipe for wholegrain-fruit-and-nut muesli are widely marketed as popular breakfast and snack foods in Europe and North America.

<text>Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is the sale to business or institutional customers. A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers.

Retail markets and shops have a very ancient history, dating back to antiquity. Some of the earliest retailers were itinerant peddlers. Over the centuries, retail shops were transformed from little more than &quot;rude booths&quot; to the sophisticated shopping malls of the modern era. In the digital age, an increasing number of retailers are seeking to reach broader markets by selling through multiple channels, including both bricks and mortar and online retailing. Digital technologies are also affecting the way that consumers pay for goods and services. Retailing support services may also include the provision of credit, delivery services, advisory services, stylist services and a range of other supporting services. Retail workers are the employees of such stores.

Most modern retailers typically make a variety of strategic level decisions including the type of store, the market to be served, the optimal product assortment, customer service, supporting services, and the store&#x27;s overall market positioning. Once the strategic retail plan is in place, retailers devise the retail mix which includes product, price, place, promotion, personnel, and presentation.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;retail&quot; comes from the Old French verb , meaning &quot;to shape by cutting&quot; (). It was first recorded as a noun in 1433 with the meaning of &quot;a sale in small quantities&quot; from the Middle French verb &quot;retailler&quot; meaning &quot;a piece cut off, shred, scrap, paring&quot;. At present, the meaning of the word &quot;retail&quot; (in English, French, Dutch, German and Spanish) refers to the sale of small quantities of items to consumers (as opposed to wholesale).

==Definition and explanation==

Retail refers to the activity of selling goods or services directly to consumers or end-users. Some retailers may sell to business customers, and such sales are termed &quot;non-retail activity.&quot; In some jurisdictions or regions, legal definitions of retail specify that at least 80 percent of sales activity must be to end-users.

Retailing often occurs in retail stores or service establishments, but may also occur through direct selling such as through vending machines, door-to-door sales or electronic channels.
Although the idea of retail is often associated with the purchase of goods, the term may be applied to service providers that sell to consumers. Retail service providers include retail banking, tourism, insurance, private healthcare, private education, private security firms, legal firms, publishers, public transport, and others. For example, a tourism provider might have a retail division that books travel and accommodation for consumers plus a wholesale division that purchases blocks of accommodation, hospitality, transport, and sightseeing which are subsequently packaged into a holiday tour for sale to retail travel agents.

Some retailers badge their stores as &quot;wholesale outlets&quot; offering &quot;wholesale prices.&quot; While this practice may encourage consumers to imagine that they have access to lower prices, while being prepared to trade-off reduced prices for cramped in-store environments, in a strictly legal sense, a store that sells the majority of its merchandise directly to consumers, is defined as a retailer rather than a wholesaler. Different jurisdictions set parameters for the ratio of consumer to business sales that define a retail business.

== History ==

 Retail markets have existed since ancient times. Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying are thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th-millennium BCE. In ancient Greece, markets operated within the agora, an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls. In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum. The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop-front.

Research from July 2008 suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems. From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding were used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE. Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.

In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead, customers walked into the tradesman&#x27;s workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world&#x27;s oldest continuously operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century, the Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas.

By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the 16th- and early 17th-century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the 18th century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

By the late 18th century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due to its lack of pavement for pedestrians. While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. John Stuart Mill wrote about the rise of the co-operative retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-19th century.

The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st century. In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid- to late 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales.

In the post-war period, an American architect, Victor Gruen developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen&#x27;s vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954. Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from square feet in 1991 to square feet in 2000. By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as &quot;mega-stores&quot; and &quot;warehouse&quot; stores to reflect their growing size. The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe.

As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident. Under such competition and other issues such as business debt, there has been a noted business disruption called the retail apocalypse in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.

==Retail strategy==
The distinction between &quot;strategic&quot; and &quot;managerial&quot; decision-making is commonly used to distinguish &quot;two phases having different goals and based on different conceptual tools. Strategic planning concerns the choice of policies aiming at improving the competitive position of the firm, taking account of challenges and opportunities proposed by the competitive environment. On the other hand, managerial decision-making is focused on the implementation of specific targets.&quot;

In retailing, the strategic plan is designed to set out the vision and provide guidance for retail decision-makers and provide an outline of how the product and service mix will optimize customer satisfaction. As part of the strategic planning process, it is customary for strategic planners to carry out a detailed environmental scan which seeks to identify trends and opportunities in the competitive environment, market environment, economic environment and statutory-political environment. The retail strategy is normally devised or reviewed every three to five years by the chief executive officer. The profit margins of retailers depend largely on their ability to achieve market competitive transaction costs.

The strategic retail analysis typically includes following elements:

* Market analysis – Market size, stage of market, market competitiveness, market attractiveness, market trends
* Customer analysis – Market segmentation, demographic, geographic, and psychographic profile, values and attitudes, shopping habits, brand preferences, analysis of needs and wants, and media habits
* Internal analysis – Other capacities including human resource capability, technological capability, financial capability, ability to generate scale economies or economies of scope, trade relations, reputation, positioning, and past performance
* Competition analysis – Availability of substitutes, competitor&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, perceptual mapping, competitive trends
* Review of product mix – :: Sales per square foot, stock-turnover rates, profitability per product line
* Review of distribution channels – Lead-times between placing order and delivery, cost of distribution, cost efficiency of intermediaries
* Evaluation of the economics of the strategy – Cost-benefit analysis of planned activities

At the conclusion of the retail analysis, retail marketers should have a clear idea of which groups of customers are to be the target of marketing activities. Not all elements are, however, equal, often with demographics, shopping motivations, and spending directing consumer activities. Retail research studies suggest that there is a strong relationship between a store&#x27;s positioning and the socio-economic status of customers. In addition, the retail strategy, including service quality, has a significant and positive association with customer loyalty. A marketing strategy effectively outlines all key aspects of firms&#x27; targeted audience, demographics, preferences. In a highly competitive market, the retail strategy sets up long-term sustainability. It focuses on customer relationships, stressing the importance of added value, customer satisfaction and highlights how the store&#x27;s market positioning appeals to targeted groups of customers.

==Retail marketing==

A retail mix is devised for the purpose of coordinating day-to-day tactical decisions. The retail marketing mix typically consists of six broad decision layers including product decisions, place decisions, promotion, price, personnel and presentation (also known as physical evidence). The retail mix is loosely based on the marketing mix, but has been expanded and modified in line with the unique needs of the retail context. A number of scholars have argued for an expanded marketing, mix with the inclusion of two new Ps, namely, &quot;Personnel&quot; and &quot;Presentation&quot; since these contribute to the customer&#x27;s unique retail experience and are the principal basis for retail differentiation. Yet other scholars argue that the &quot;Retail Format&quot; (i.e. retail formula) should be included. The modified retail marketing mix that is most commonly cited in textbooks is often called the &quot;6 Ps of retailing&quot; (see diagram at right).The primary product-related decisions facing the retailer are the product assortment (what product lines, how many lines and which brands to carry); the type of customer service (high contact through to self-service) and the availability of support services (e.g. credit terms, delivery services, after sales care). These decisions depend on careful analysis of the market, demand, competition as well as the retailer&#x27;s skills and expertise.

Customer service is the &quot;sum of acts and elements that allow consumers to receive what they need or desire from [the] retail establishment.&quot; Retailers must decide whether to provide a full service outlet or minimal service outlet, such as no-service in the case of vending machines; self-service with only basic sales assistance or a full service operation as in many boutiques and speciality stores. In addition, the retailer needs to make decisions about sales support such as customer delivery and after sales customer care.

 Place decisions are primarily concerned with consumer access and may involve location, space utilisation and operating hours. Retailers may consider a range of both qualitative and quantitative factors to evaluate to potential sites under consideration. Macro factors include market characteristics (demographic, economic and socio-cultural), demand, competition and infrastructure (e.g. the availability of power, roads, public transport systems). Micro factors include the size of the site (e.g. availability of parking), access for delivery vehicles. A major retail trend has been the shift to multi-channel retailing. To counter the disruption caused by online retail, many bricks and mortar retailers have entered the online retail space, by setting up online catalogue sales and e-commerce websites. However, many retailers have noticed that consumers behave differently when shopping online. For instance, in terms of choice of online platform, shoppers tend to choose the online site of their preferred retailer initially, but as they gain more experience in online shopping, they become less loyal and more likely to switch to other retail sites. Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers across the globe have Internet access both at work and at home.
The broad pricing strategy is normally established in the company&#x27;s overall strategic plan. In the case of chain stores, the pricing strategy would be set by head office. Broadly, there are six approaches to pricing strategy mentioned in the marketing literature: operations-oriented, revenue-oriented, customer-oriented, value-based, relationship-oriented, and socially-oriented. When decision-makers have determined the broad approach to pricing (i.e., the pricing strategy), they turn their attention to pricing tactics. Tactical pricing decisions are shorter term prices, designed to accomplish specific short-term goals. Pricing tactics that are commonly used in retail include discount pricing, everyday low prices, high-low pricing, loss leaders, product bundling, promotional pricing, and psychological pricing. Two strategies to entice the buyer, money back guarantee and buy one get one free, were devised by 18th-century retail entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood. Retailers must also plan for customer preferred payment modes – e.g. cash, credit, lay-by, Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale (EFTPOS). All payment options require some type of handling and attract costs. Contrary to common misconception, price is not the most important factor for consumers, when deciding to buy a product.

Because patronage at a retail outlet varies, flexibility in scheduling is desirable. Employee scheduling software is sold, which, using known patterns of customer patronage, more or less reliably predicts the need for staffing for various functions at times of the year, day of the month or week, and time of day. Usually needs vary widely. Conforming staff utilization to staffing needs requires a flexible workforce which is available when needed but does not have to be paid when they are not, part-time workers; as of 2012 70% of retail workers in the United States were part-time. This may result in financial problems for the workers, who while they are required to be available at all times if their work hours are to be maximized, may not have sufficient income to meet their family and other obligations. Retailers can employ different techniques to enhance sales volume and to improve the customer experience, such as Add-on, Upsell or Cross-sell; Selling on value; and knowing when to close the sale.

Transactional marketing aims to find target consumers, then negotiate, trade, and finally end relationships to complete the transaction. In this one-time transaction process, both parties aim to maximize their own interests. As a result, transactional marketing raises follow-up problems such as poor after-sales service quality and a lack of feedback channels for both parties. In addition, because retail enterprises needed to redevelop client relationships for each transaction, marketing costs were high and customer retention was low. All these downsides to transactional marketing gradually pushed the retail industry towards establishing long-term cooperative relationships with customers. Through this lens, enterprises began to focus on the process from transaction to relationship.
While expanding the sales market and attracting new customers is very important for the retail industry, it is also important to establish and maintain long term good relationships with previous customers, hence the name of the underlying concept, &quot;relational marketing&quot;. Under this concept, retail enterprises value and attempt to improve relationships with customers, as customer relationships are conducive to maintaining stability in the current competitive retail market, and are also the future of retail enterprises.


Presentation refers to the physical evidence that signals the retail image. Physical evidence may include a diverse range of elements – the store itself including premises, offices, exterior facade and interior layout, websites, delivery vans, warehouses, staff uniforms. The environment in which the retail service encounter occurs is sometimes known as the &quot;retail servicescape.&quot; The store environment consists of many elements such as aromas, the physical environment (furnishings, layout, and functionality), ambient conditions (lighting, air temperature, and music) as well as signs, symbols, and artifacts (e.g. sales promotions, shelf space, sample stations, visual communications). Retail designers pay close attention to the front of the store, which is known as the &quot;decompression zone&quot;. In order to maximize the number of selling opportunities, retailers generally want customers to spend more time in a retail store. However, this must be balanced against customer expectations surrounding convenience, access and realistic waiting times. The way that brands are displayed is also part of the overall retail design. Where a product is placed on the shelves has implications for purchase likelihood as a result of visibility and access. Ambient conditions, such as lighting, temperature and music, are also part of the overall retail environment. It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market.

==Shopper profiles==
Two different strands of research have investigated shopper behaviour. One is primarily concerned with shopper motivations. The other stream of research seeks to segment shoppers according to common, shared characteristics. To some extent, these streams of research are inter-related, but each stream offers different types of insights into shopper behaviour.

Babin et al. carried out some of the earliest investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: &quot;utilitarian&quot; and &quot;hedonic.&quot; Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.

Many different shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation analyses for each unique outlet. However, it is possible to identify a number of broad shopper profiles. One of the most well-known and widely cited shopper typologies is that developed by Sproles and Kendal in the mid-1980s. Sproles and Kendall&#x27;s consumer typology has been shown to be relatively consistent across time and across cultures. Their typology is based on the consumer&#x27;s approach to making purchase decisions.
* Quality conscious/Perfectionist: Quality-consciousness is characterised by a consumer&#x27;s search for the very best quality in products; quality conscious consumers tend to shop systematically making more comparisons and shopping around.
* Brand-conscious: Brand-consciousness is characterised by a tendency to buy expensive, well-known brands or designer labels. Those who score high on brand-consciousness tend to believe that the higher prices are an indicator of quality and exhibit a preference for department stores or top-tier retail outlets.
* Recreation-conscious/Hedonistic: Recreational shopping is characterised by the consumer&#x27;s engagement in the purchase process. Those who score high on recreation-consciousness regard shopping itself as a form of enjoyment.
* Price-conscious: A consumer who exhibits price-and-value consciousness. Price-conscious shoppers carefully shop around seeking lower prices, sales or discounts and are motivated by obtaining the best value for money.
* Novelty/fashion-conscious: characterised by a consumer&#x27;s tendency to seek out new products or new experiences for the sake of excitement; who gain excitement from seeking new things; they like to keep up-to-date with fashions and trends, variety-seeking is associated with this dimension.
* Impulsive: Impulsive consumers are somewhat careless in making purchase decisions, buy on the spur of the moment and are not overly concerned with expenditure levels or obtaining value. Those who score high on impulsive dimensions tend not to be engaged with the object at either a cognitive or emotional level.
* Confused (by overchoice): characterised by a consumer&#x27;s confusion caused by too many product choices, too many stores or an overload of product information; tend to experience information overload.
* Habitual/brand loyal: characterised by a consumer&#x27;s tendency to follow a routine purchase pattern on each purchase occasion; consumers have favourite brands or stores and have formed habits in choosing; the purchase decision does not involve much evaluation or shopping around.

Some researchers have adapted Sproles and Kendall&#x27;s methodology for use in specific countries or cultural groups. Consumer decision styles are important for retailers and marketers because they describe behaviours that are relatively stable over time and for this reason, they are useful for market segmentation.

== Types of retail outlets ==

 &quot;Retail formats&quot; (also known as &quot;retail formulas&quot;) influence the consumer&#x27;s store choice and addresses the consumer&#x27;s expectations. At its most basic level, a retail format is a simple marketplace, that is; a location where goods and services are exchanged. In some parts of the world, the retail sector is still dominated by small family-run stores, but large retail chains are increasingly dominating the sector, because they can exert considerable buying power and pass on the savings in the form of lower prices. Many of these large retail chains also produce their own private labels which compete alongside manufacturer brands. Considerable consolidation of retail stores has changed the retail landscape, transferring power away from wholesalers and into the hands of the large retail chains. In Britain and Europe, the retail sale of goods is designated as a &quot;service activity.&quot; The European Service Directive applies to all retail trade including periodic markets, street traders and peddlers.

Retail stores may be classified by the type of product carried. Softline retailers sell goods that are consumed after a single-use, or have a limited life (typically under three years) in they are normally consumed. Soft goods include clothing, other fabrics, footwear, toiletries, cosmetics, medicines and stationery. Grocery stores, including supermarkets and hypermarkets, along with convenience stores carry a mix of food products and consumable household items such as detergents, cleansers, personal hygiene products. Retailers selling consumer durables are sometimes known as &quot;hardline retailers&quot; – automobiles, appliances, electronics, furniture, sporting goods, lumber, etc., and parts for them. Specialist retailers operate in many industries such as the arts e.g. green grocers, contemporary art galleries, bookstores, handicrafts, musical instruments, gift shops.

==Challenges==
To achieve and maintain a foothold in an existing market, a prospective retail establishment must overcome the following hurdles:
* regulatory barriers including:
** restrictions on real-estate purchases, especially as imposed by local governments and against &quot;big-box&quot; chain retailers
** restrictions on foreign investment in retailers, in terms of both absolute amount of financing provided and percentage share of voting stock (e.g. common stock) purchased
* unfavorable taxation structures, especially those designed to penalize or keep out &quot;big box&quot; retailers (see &quot;Regulatory&quot; above)
* absence of developed supply-chain and integrated IT management
* high competitiveness among existing market participants and resulting low profit margins, caused in part by:
** constant advances in product design resulting in constant threat of product obsolescence and price declines for existing inventory
* partially due to loss in business: lack of work-force, often including management, that is properly educated and trained
** lack of educational infrastructure enabling prospective market entrants to respond to the above challenges
* direct e-tailing (for example, through the Internet) and direct delivery to consumers from manufacturers and suppliers, cutting out any retail middle man.

==Method==
When discussing the impact of technology on shopping and retail, e-commerce is often the first thing that comes to mind for retailers. However, technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, computer vision and the Internet of Things have used data to transform every part of the shopping experience, from browsing to checkout.

It is important for organizations to embrace digital disruption in order to gain a competitive advantage. When an industry experiences digital disruption, it typically signals that consumer needs are shifting. Retailers enhance their analytics process and make better informed decisions thanks to big data, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and the Internet of Things. The use of data by retailers is mostly evident in the following aspects, based on the above-mentioned new technologies:

* Enhance marketing by Personalizing customer experience
* Optimize supply chain management
* Adjust prices to maximize profits

Many leading brands choose to target tourists who specifically travel to shop or spend money while on vacation. According to the Global Retail Tourism Market Report 2019–2023, the value of the global shopping tourism market was estimated to be around $1.2 trillion in 2018. The report also forecasts that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.7% from 2019 to 2023. In 2023 Kogan Page published a critically acclaimed book &quot;Leading Travel and Tourism Retail&quot;, which researched in depth the travel retail sector post COVID.

==Consolidation==
Among retailers and retails chains a lot of consolidation has appeared over the last couple of decades. Between 1988 and 2010, worldwide 40,788 mergers and acquisitions with a total known value of US$2.255 trillion have been announced. The largest transactions with involvement of retailers in/from the United States have been: the acquisition of Albertson&#x27;s Inc. for US$17 billion in 2006, the merger between Federated Department Stores Inc with May Department Stores valued at 16.5 bil. USD in 2005 – now Macy&#x27;s, and the merger between Kmart Holding Corp and Sears Roebuck &amp; Co with a value of US$10.9 billion in 2004.

Between 1985 and 2018 there have been 46,755 mergers or acquisitions conducted globally in the retail sector (either acquirer or target from the retail industry). These deals cumulate to an overall known value of around US$2,561 billion. The three major Retail M&amp;A waves took place in 2000, 2007 and lately in 2017. However the all-time high in terms of number of deals was in 2016 with more than 2,700 deals. In terms of added value 2007 set the record with the US$225 billion.

Here is a list of the top ten largest deals (ranked by volume) in the Retail Industry:
==Statistics==
===Global top ten retailers===

As of 2016, China was the largest retail market in the world.

=== Statistics for national retail sales ===
====United States====

The National Retail Federation and Kantar annually rank the nation&#x27;s top retailers according to sales. The National Retail Federation also separately ranks the 100 fastest-growing U.S. retailers based on increases in domestic sales.

Since 1951, the U.S. Census Bureau has published the Retail Sales report every month. It is a measure of consumer spending, an important indicator of the US GDP. Retail firms provide data on the dollar value of their retail sales and inventories. A sample of 12,000 firms is included in the final survey and 5,000 in the advanced one. The advanced estimated data is based on a subsample from the US CB complete retail and food services sample.

Retail is the largest private-sector employer in the United States, supporting 52 million working Americans.

====Central Europe====
In 2011, the grocery market in six countries of Central Europe was worth nearly €107bn, 2.8% more than the previous year when expressed in local currencies. The increase was generated foremost by the discount stores and supermarket segments, and was driven by the skyrocketing prices of foodstuffs. This information is based on the latest PMR report entitled Grocery retail in Central Europe 2012

====World====
National accounts show a combined total of retail and wholesale trade, with hotels and restaurants. in 2012 the sector provides over a fifth of GDP in tourist-oriented island economies, as well as in other major countries such as Brazil, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain. In all four of the latter countries, this fraction is an increase over 1970, but there are other countries where the sector has declined since 1970, sometimes in absolute terms, where other sectors have replaced its role in the economy. In the United States the sector has declined from 19% of GDP to 14%, though it has risen in absolute terms from $4,500 to $7,400 per capita per year. In China the sector has grown from 7.3% to 11.5%, and in India even more, from 8.4% to 18.7%. Emarketer predicts China will have the largest retail market in the world in 2016.

In 2016, China became the largest retail market in the world.

In the Republic of Armenia, retail trade has been increasing recently. In October 2022, it increased by 23.1% year by year, which was the most considerable rise since April 2021, faster than the 20.7 per cent increase recorded a month earlier. Retail dropped by 1.9% after accumulating 2.1%in the earlier month. For the first 10 months of 2022, retail sales increased by 15.5% by measuring the exact time of 2021. Among its bordering countries, on retail trade percentage of GDP, Armenia ranks more increased than Turkey, but it is still lower than Georgia.

<text>Foreign Affairs is an American magazine of international relations and U.S. foreign policy published by the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, membership organization and think tank specializing in U.S. foreign policy and international affairs. Founded on 15 September 1922, the print magazine is published every two months, while the website publishes articles daily and anthologies every other month.

&quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; is considered one of the United States&#x27; most influential foreign-policy magazines. It has published many seminal articles, including George Kennan&#x27;s &quot;X Article&quot; (1947) and Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot; (1993).

Leading academics, public officials, and members of the policy community regularly contribute to the magazine. Recent &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; authors include Robert O. Keohane, Hillary Clinton, Donald H. Rumsfeld, Ashton Carter, Colin L. Powell, Francis Fukuyama, David Petraeus, Zbigniew Brzezinski, John J. Mearsheimer, Stanley McChrystal, Christopher R. Hill and Joseph Nye.

==History==
The Council on Foreign Relations, founded in the summer of 1921, primarily counted diplomats, financiers, scholars, and lawyers among its members. Its founding charter declared its purpose should be to &quot;afford a continuous conference on international questions affecting the United States, by bringing together experts on statecraft, finance, industry, education, and science.&quot; In its first year, the Council engaged primarily in discourse via meetings and small discussion groups, however, eventually it decided to seek a wider audience and it began publishing &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; on 15 September 1922 on a quarterly basis.

The Council named Professor Archibald Cary Coolidge of Harvard University as the journal&#x27;s first editor. As Coolidge was unwilling to move from Boston to New York, Hamilton Fish Armstrong, a Princeton alumnus and a European correspondent of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, was appointed managing editor and worked New York, handling the day-to-day mechanics of publishing the journal. Armstrong chose the distinctive light blue color for the cover of the magazine, while his sisters, Margaret and Helen, designed the logo and lettering respectively.

&quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; is a successor publication of the &quot;Journal of International Relations&quot; (which ran from 1910 to 1922), which in turn was a successor to the &quot;Journal of Race Development&quot; (which ran from 1911 to 1919, the title reflecting concerns about race tensions and race &quot;mixing&quot; in a period when empires were beginning to be in question).

===1922–1945===
The lead article in the first issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was written by the former secretary of state under Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, Elihu Root. The article argued that the United States had become a world power, and that as such the general population needed to be better informed about international matters. John Foster Dulles, then a financial expert attached to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, who would later become secretary of state under Dwight D. Eisenhower, also contributed an article to the inaugural issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; on Allied debt following World War I.

In 1925, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; published a series of articles, entitled &quot;Worlds of Color&quot;, by prominent African American intellectual W. E. B. Du Bois. DuBois, a personal friend of Armstrong, wrote mainly about race issues and imperialism. Although in the early days of publication the journal did not have many female authors, in the late 1930s American journalist for &quot;Time&quot; magazine Dorothy Thompson would contribute articles.

===1945–1991===
The journal rose to its greatest prominence after World War II when foreign relations became central to United States politics, and the United States became a powerful actor on the global scene. Several extremely important articles were published in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, including the reworking of George F. Kennan&#x27;s &quot;Long Telegram&quot;, which first publicized the doctrine of containment that would form the basis of American Cold War policy.

Louis Halle, a member of the U.S. Policy Planning Staff, also wrote an influential article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; in 1950. His article, &quot;On a Certain Impatience with Latin America&quot;, created the anticommunist intellectual framework that justified U.S. policy towards Latin America in the Cold War era. Halle&#x27;s article described that the encouragement of democracy in postwar Latin America had ended. He demonstrated disgust over Latin America&#x27;s inability to assume autonomy and to become democratic. His rationalization towards Latin America was later used to justify U.S. efforts to overthrow the left-leaning Guatemalan government.

Eleven U.S. secretaries of state have written essays in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.

===1991–present===
Since the end of the Cold War, and especially after the 9/11 attacks, the journal&#x27;s readership has grown significantly. , &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; total readership is 303,000 for the print magazine and it has 1.2 million unique visitors per month for the website.

In the Summer 1993 issue, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; published Samuel P. Huntington&#x27;s influential &quot;Clash of Civilizations?&quot; article. In the article, Huntington argued that &quot;the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural.&quot;

In the November/December 2003 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, Kenneth Maxwell wrote a review of Peter Kornbluh&#x27;s book &quot;The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability&quot;, which gave rise to a controversy about Henry Kissinger&#x27;s relationship to the regime of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and to Operation Condor. Maxwell claims that key Council on Foreign Relations members, acting at Kissinger&#x27;s behest, put pressure on &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; editor James Hoge to give the last word in a subsequent exchange about the review to William D. Rogers, a close associate of Kissinger, rather than to Maxwell; this went against established &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; policy.

Then-opposition leader and former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko caused a stir by publishing an article entitled &quot;Containing Russia&quot; in the May–June 2007 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; accusing Russia under Vladimir Putin of expansionism and urging the rest of Europe to stand against him. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote an article in response, but he withdrew it, citing &quot;censorship&quot; from the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; editorial board. Tymoshenko&#x27;s party went on to win the 2007 elections and she became Prime Minister once again.

In 2009, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; launched its new website, ForeignAffairs.com, which offers both print content and online-only features.

Beginning with the January/February 2013 issue, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was redesigned including that the cover would have an image. Per &quot;Politico&quot;″s story on the redesign: &quot;As part of an effort to expand its appeal beyond the foreign policy establishment, every issue of Foreign Affairs will now feature a photograph on the cover and an extensive interview with a leading newsmaker.&quot;

==Book reviews==
Since its inception, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; has included a long book review section, typically reviewing 50 or more books per issue. The magazine&#x27;s first editor, Archibald Cary Coolidge, asked his Harvard colleague, William L. Langer, a historian and World War I veteran, to run the section. Langer initially had full control over the magazine&#x27;s book reviews and wrote all the reviews himself. A month before the reviews were due, the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; office in New York would ship approximately one hundred books to Langer for review and within two weeks he would return his completed reviews for the next issue.

Beginning with the first issue in 1922, Harry Elmer Barnes authored a reoccurring section titled “Some Recent Books on International Relations”. By 1924, the Foreign Affairs website lists Barnes as Bibliographical Editor.

In the late 1930s, the review section was broken down into several categories. Currently, the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; reviews are broken down into long review essays, which are placed at the front of the books section, and the &quot;Recent Books&quot; section, where shorter reviews are featured. The &quot;Recent Books&quot; section is further broken down into the following subject categories. 

* Political and Legal, reviewed by G. John Ikenberry
* Economic, Social, and Environmental, reviewed by Barry Eichengreen
* Military, Scientific, and Technological, reviewed by Lawrence D. Freedman
* The United States, reviewed by Jessica T. Mathews
* Western Europe, reviewed by Andrew Moravcsik
* Western Hemisphere, reviewed by Richard Feinberg
* Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Republics, reviewed by Maria Lipman
* Middle East, reviewed by Lisa Anderson
* Asia and Pacific, reviewed by Andrew J. Nathan
* Africa, reviewed by Nicolas van de Walle

The majority of the book reviews featured in the &quot;Recent Books&quot; section are reviewed by the same person; however, other reviewers contribute to the &quot;Recent Books&quot; section on occasion.

== Influence ==
&quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; is considered an important forum for debate among academics and policy makers. In 1996, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott noted: &quot;Virtually everyone I know in the foreign policy-national security area of the Government is attentive to &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary river which flows through Southwestern China, Northeastern India, and Bangladesh. It is known as Brahmaputra or Luit in Assamese, Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibetan, the Siang/Dihang River in Arunachali, and Jamuna River in Bengali. By itself, it is the 9th largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest.

It originates in the Manasarovar Lake region, near Mount Kailash, on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet where it is known as the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The Brahmaputra flows along southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh. It enters India near the village of Gelling in Arunachal Pradesh and flows southwest through the Assam Valley as the Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be confused with the Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Ganges, popularly known as the Padma in Bangladesh, and becomes the Meghna and ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal.

At long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation in the region. The average depth of the river is and its maximum depth is (at Sadiya). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in the spring when the Himalayan snow melts. The average discharge of the Brahmaputra is about ~, and floods reach about . It is a classic example of a braided river and is highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion. It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibits a tidal bore. It is navigable for most of its length.

The Brahmaputra drains the Himalayas east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet, the Patkai hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and northern Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet, is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m and hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.

The Brahmaputra&#x27;s upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. The river is often called the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.

The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name. Brahmaputra means &quot;son of Brahma&quot; in Sanskrit.

==Names==
It is known by various names in different regional languages: in Assamese; Yarlung Tsangpo; . It is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra and red river of India (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within the Tibet Autonomous Region). In its Tibetan and Indian names, the river is unusually masculine in gender.

==Geography==
===Course===
====Tibet====


The upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo from the Tibetan language, originates on the Angsi Glacier, near Mount Kailash, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet. The source of the river was earlier thought to be on the Chemayungdung glacier, which covers the slopes of the Himalayas about southeast of Lake Manasarovar in southwestern Tibet.

From its source, the river runs for nearly in a generally easterly direction between the main range of the Himalayas to the south and the Kailas Range to the north.

In Tibet, the Tsangpo receives a number of tributaries. The most important left-bank tributaries are the Raka Zangbo (Raka Tsangpo), which joins the river west of Xigazê (Shigatse), and the Lhasa (Kyi), which flows past the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and joins the Tsangpo at Qüxü. The Nyang River joins the Tsangpo from the north at Zela (Tsela Dzong). On the right bank, a second river called the Nyang Qu (Nyang Chu) meets the Tsangpo at Xigazê.

After passing Pi (Pe) in Tibet, the river turns suddenly to the north and northeast and cuts a course through a succession of great narrow gorges between the mountainous massifs of Gyala Peri and Namcha Barwa in a series of rapids and cascades. Thereafter, the river turns south and southwest and flows through a deep gorge (the &quot;Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon&quot;) across the eastern extremity of the Himalayas with canyon walls that extend upward for and more on each side. During that stretch, the river crosses the China-India line of actual control to enter northern Arunachal Pradesh, where it is known as the Dihang (or Siang) River, and turns more southerly.

====Arunachal Pradesh====


The Yarlung Tsangpo leaves the part of Tibet to enter Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the river is called Siang. It makes a very rapid descent from its original height in Tibet and finally appears in the plains, where it is called Dihang. It flows for about southward after which, it is joined by the Dibang River and the Lohit River at the head of the Assam Valley. Below the Lohit, the river is called Brahmaputra and Doima (mother of water) and Burlung-Buthur by native Bodo tribals, it then enters the state of Assam, and becomes very wide—as wide as in parts of Assam.

The reason for such an unusual course and drastic change is that the river is antecedent to the Himalayas, meaning that it had existed before them and has entrenched itself since they started rising.

====Assam====

The Dihang, winding out of the mountains, turns towards the southeast and descends into a low-lying basin as it enters northeastern Assam state. Just west of the town of Sadiya, the river again turns to the southwest and is joined by two mountain streams, the Lohit, and the Dibang. Below that confluence, about from the Bay of Bengal, the river becomes known conventionally as the Brahmaputra (&quot;Son of Brahma&quot;). In Assam, the river is mighty, even in the dry season, and during the rains, its banks are more than apart. As the river follows its braided course through the valley, it receives several rapidly flowing Himalayan streams, including the Subansiri, Kameng, Bhareli, Dhansiri, Manas, Champamati, Saralbhanga, and Sankosh Rivers. The main tributaries from the hills and from the plateau to the south are the Burhi Dihing, the Disang, the Dikhu, and the Kopili.

Between Dibrugarh and Lakhimpur Districts, the river divides into two channels—the northern Kherkutia channel and the southern Brahmaputra channel. The two channels join again about downstream, forming the Majuli island, which is the largest river island in the world. At Guwahati, near the ancient pilgrimage centre of Hajo, the Brahmaputra cuts through the rocks of the Shillong Plateau, and is at its narrowest at bank-to-bank. The terrain of this area made it logistically ideal for the Battle of Saraighat, the military confrontation between the Mughal Empire and the Ahom Kingdom in March 1671. The first combined railroad/roadway bridge across the Brahmaputra was constructed at Saraighat. It was opened to traffic in April 1962.

The environment of the Brahmaputra floodplains in Assam have been described as the Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests ecoregion.

====Bangladesh====

In Bangladesh, the Brahmaputra is joined by the Teesta River (or Tista), one of its largest tributaries. Below the Tista, the Brahmaputra splits into two distributary branches. The western branch, which contains the majority of the river&#x27;s flow, continues due south as the Jamuna () to merge with the lower Ganga, called the Padma River (). The eastern branch, formerly the larger, but now much smaller, is called the lower or Old Brahmaputra (). It curves southeast to join the Meghna River near Dhaka. The Padma and Meghna converge near Chandpur and flow out into the Bay of Bengal. This final part of the river is called Meghna.

The Brahmaputra enters the plains of Bangladesh after turning south around the Garo Hills below Dhuburi, India. After flowing past Chilmari, Bangladesh, it is joined on its right bank by the Tista River and then follows a course due south as the Jamuna River. (South of Gaibanda, the Old Brahmaputra leaves the left bank of the mainstream and flows past Jamalpur and Mymensingh to join the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar.) Before its confluence with the Ganga, the Jamuna receives the combined waters of the Baral, Atrai, and Hurasagar Rivers on its right bank and becomes the point of departure of the large Dhaleswari River on its left bank. A tributary of the Dhaleswari, the Buriganga (&quot;Old Ganga&quot;), flows past Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, and joins the Meghna River above Munshiganj.

The Jamuna joins with the Ganga north of Goalundo Ghat, below which, as the Padma, their combined waters flow to the southeast for a distance of about . After several smaller channels branch off to feed the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta to the south, the main body of the Padma reaches its confluence with the Meghna River near Chandpur and then enters the Bay of Bengal through the Meghna estuary and lesser channels flowing through the delta. The growth of the Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta is dominated by tidal processes.

The Ganga Delta, fed by the waters of numerous rivers, including the Ganga and Brahmaputra, is , one of the largest river deltas in the world.

===Hydrology===
The Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna system has the second-greatest average discharge of the world&#x27;s rivers—roughly ~, and the river Brahmaputra alone supplies about 50% of the total discharge. The rivers&#x27; combined suspended sediment load of about 1.87 billion tonnes (1.84 billion tons) per year is the world&#x27;s highest.

In the past, the lower course of the Brahmaputra was different and passed through the Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts. In an 8.8 magnitude earthquake on 2 April 1762, however, the main channel of the Brahmaputra at Bhahadurabad point was switched southwards and opened as Jamuna due to the result of tectonic uplift of the Madhupur tract.

==== Climate ====
Rising temperatures significantly contribute to snow melting in the upper Brahmaputra catchment. The discharge of the Brahmaputra River is significantly influenced by the melting of snow in the upper part of its catchment area. This increase in river flow, caused by the substantial retreat of snow, leads to a higher downstream discharge. Such a rise in discharge often results in severe catastrophic issues, including flooding and erosion.

====Discharge====
The Brahmaputra River is characterized by its significant rates of sediment discharge, the large and variable flows, along with its rapid channel aggradations and accelerated rates of basin denudation. Over time, the deepening of the Bengal Basin caused by erosion will result in the increase in hydraulic radius, and hence allowing for the huge accumulation of sediments fed from the Himalayan erosion by efficient sediment transportation. The thickness of the sediment accumulated above the Precambrian basement has increased over the years from a few hundred meters to over in the Bengal fore-deep to the south. The ongoing subsidence of the Bengal Basin and the high rate of Himalayan uplift continues to contribute to the large water and sediment discharges of fine sand and silt, with 1% clay, in the Brahmaputra River.

Climatic change plays a crucial role in affecting the basin hydrology. Throughout the year, there is a significant rise in hydrograph, with a broad peak between July and September. The Brahmaputra River experiences two high-water seasons, one in early summer caused by snowmelt in the mountains, and one in late summer caused by runoff from monsoon rains. The river flow is strongly influenced by snow and ice melting of the glaciers, which are located mainly on the eastern Himalaya regions in the upstream parts of the basin. The snow and glacier melt contribution to the total annual runoff is about 27%, while the annual rainfall contributes to about and of discharge. The highest recorded daily discharge in the Brahmaputra at Pandu was August 1962 while the lowest was in February 1968. The increased rates of snow and glacial melt are likely to increase summer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear and snowfall diminishes. This is particularly true for the dry season when water availability is crucial for the irrigation systems.

====Floodplain evolution====

The course of the Brahmaputra River has changed drastically in the past two and a half centuries, moving its river course westwards for a distance of about , leaving its old river course, appropriately named the old Brahmaputra river, behind. In the past, the floodplain of the old river course had soils which were more properly formed compared to graded sediments on the operating Jamuna river. This change of river course resulted in modifications to the soil-forming process, which include acidification, the breakdown of clays and buildup of organic matter, with the soils showing an increasing amount of biotic homogenization, mottling, the coating around Peds and maturing soil arrangement, shape and pattern. In the future, the consequences of local ground subsidence coupled with flood prevention propositions, for instance, localised breakwaters, that increase flood-plain water depths outside the water breakers, may alter the water levels of the floodplains. Throughout the years, bars, scroll bars, and sand dunes are formed at the edge of the flood plain by deposition. The height difference of the channel topography is often not more than . Furthermore, flooding over the history of the river has caused the formation of river levees due to deposition from the overbank flow. The height difference between the levee top and the surrounding floodplains is typically along small channels and along major channels. Crevasse splay, a sedimentary fluvial deposit which forms when a stream breaks its natural or artificial levees and deposits sediment on a floodplain, are often formed due to a breach in the levee, forming a lobe of sediments which progrades onto the adjacent floodplain. Lastly, flood basins are often formed between the levees of adjacent rivers.

====Flooding====

During the monsoon season (June–October), floods are a very common occurrence. Deforestation in the Brahmaputra watershed has resulted in increased siltation levels, flash floods, and soil erosion in critical downstream habitat, such as the Kaziranga National Park in middle Assam. Occasionally, massive flooding causes huge losses to crops, life, and property. Periodic flooding is a natural phenomenon which is ecologically important because it helps maintain the lowland grasslands and associated wildlife. Periodic floods also deposit fresh alluvium, replenishing the fertile soil of the Brahmaputra River Valley. Thus flooding, agriculture, and agricultural practices are closely connected.

The effects of flooding can be devastating and cause significant damage to crops and houses, serious bank erosive with consequent loss of homesteads, school and land, and loss of many lives, livestock, and fisheries. During the 1998 flood, over 70% of the land area of Bangladesh was inundated, affecting 31 million people and 1 million homesteads. In the 1998 flood which had an unusually long duration from July to September, claimed 918 human lives and was responsible for damaging of roads and embankments, and affecting of standing crops. The 2004 floods, over 25% of the population of Bangladesh or 36 million people, were affected by the floods; 800 people died; 952 000 houses were destroyed and 1.4 million were badly damaged; 24 000 educational institutions were affected including the destruction of 1200 primary schools, 2 million governments and private tube wells were affected, over 3 million latrines were damaged or washed away, this increases the risks of waterborne diseases including diarrhea and cholera. Also, of the rice crop was submerged and lost before it could be harvested, with 7% of the yearly &quot;aus&quot; (early season) rice crop lost; of grazing land was affected, 5600 livestock perished together with 254 00 poultry and of lost fish production.

Flood-control measures are taken by the water resource department and the Brahmaputra Board, but until now the flood problem remains unsolved. At least a third of the land of Majuli Island has been eroded by the river. Recently, it is suggested that a highway protected by concrete mat along the river bank and excavation of the river bed can curb this menace. This project, named the Brahmaputra River Restoration Project, is yet to be implemented by the government. Recently the Central Government approved the construction of Brahmaputra Express Highways.

===Channel morphology===
The course of the Brahmaputra River has changed dramatically over the past 250 years, with evidence of large-scale avulsion, in the period 1776–1850, of from east of the Madhupur tract to the west of it. Prior to 1843, the Brahmaputra flowed within the channel now termed the &quot;Old Brahmaputra&quot;. The banks of the river are mostly weakly cohesive sand and silts, which usually erodes through large scale slab failure, where previously deposited materials undergo scour and bank erosion during flood periods. Presently, the river&#x27;s erosion rate has decreased to per year as compared to per year from 1973 to 1992. This erosion has, however, destroyed so much land that it has caused 0.7 million people to become homeless due to loss of land.

Several studies have discussed the reasons for the avulsion of the river into its present course, and have suggested a number of reasons including tectonic activity, switches in the upstream course of the Teesta River, the influence of increased discharge, catastrophic floods and river capture into an old river course. From an analysis of maps of the river between 1776 and 1843, it was concluded in a study that the river avulsion was more likely gradual than catastrophic and sudden, and may have been generated by bank erosion, perhaps around a large mid-channel bar, causing a diversion of the channel into the existing floodplain channel.

The Brahmaputra channel is governed by the peak and low flow periods during which its bed undergoes tremendous modification. The Brahmaputra&#x27;s bank line migration is inconsistent with time. The Brahmaputra river bed has widened significantly since 1916 and appears to be shifting more towards the south than towards the north. Together with the contemporary slow migration of the river, the left bank is being eroded away faster than the right bank.

==== River engineering ====
The Brahmaputra River experiences high levels of bank erosion (usually via slab failure) and channel migration caused by its strong current, lack of riverbank vegetation, and loose sand and silt which compose its banks. It is thus difficult to build permanent structures on the river, and protective structures designed to limit the river&#x27;s erosional effects often face numerous issues during and after construction. In fact, a 2004 report by the Bangladesh Disaster and Emergency Sub-Group (BDER) has stated that several of such protective systems have &#x27;just failed&#x27;. However, some progress has been made in the form of construction works which stabilize sections of the river, albeit with the need for heavy maintenance. The Bangabandhu Bridge, the only bridge to span the river&#x27;s major distributary, the Jamuna, was thus opened in June 1998. Constructed at a narrow braid belt of the river, it is long with a platform wide, and it is used to carry railroad traffic as well as gas, power and telecommunication lines. Due to the variable nature of the river, the prediction of the river&#x27;s future course is crucial in planning upstream engineering to prevent flooding on the bridge.

China had built the Zangmu Dam in the upper course of the Brahmaputra River in the Tibet region and it was operationalised on 13 October 2015.

*Period: 1971–2000

==History==


===Earlier history===
The Kachari group called the river &quot;Dilao&quot;, &quot;Tilao&quot;. Early Greek accounts of Curtius and Strabo give its name as Dyardanes (Ancient greek Δυαρδάνης) and Oidanes. In the past, the course of the lower Brahmaputra was different and passed through the Jamalpur and Mymensingh districts. Some water still flows through that course, now called the Old Brahmaputra, as a distributary of the main channel.

A question about the river system in Bangladesh is when and why the Brahmaputra changed its main course, at the site of the Jamuna and the &quot;Old Brahmaputra&quot; fork that can be seen by comparing modern maps to historic maps before the 1800s. The Brahmaputra likely flowed directly south along its present main channel for much of the time since the last glacial maximum, switching back and forth between the two courses several times throughout the Holocene.

One idea about the most recent avulsion is that the change in the course of the main waters of the Brahmaputra took place suddenly in 1787, the year of the heavy flooding of the river Tista.

In the middle of the 18th century, at least three fair-sized streams flowed between the Rajshahi and Dhaka Divisions, viz., the Daokoba, a branch of the Tista, the Monash or Konai, and the Salangi. The Lahajang and the Elengjany were also important rivers. In Renault&#x27;s time, the Brahmaputra as a first step towards securing a more direct course to the sea by leaving the Mahdupur Jungle to the east began to send a considerable volume of water down the Jinai or Jabuna from Jamalpur into the Monash and Salangi. These rivers gradually coalesced and kept shifting to the west till they met the Daokoba, which was showing an equally rapid tendency to cut towards the east. The junction of these rivers gave the Brahmaputra a course worthy of her immense power, and the rivers to right and left silted up. In Renault&#x27;s Altas they very much resemble the rivers of Jessore, which dried up after the hundred-mouthed Ganga had cut her new channel to join the Meghna at the south of the Munshiganj subdivision.

In 1809, Francis Buchanan-Hamilton wrote that the new channel between Bhawanipur and Dewanranj &quot;was scarcely inferior to the mighty river, and threatens to sweep away the intermediate country&quot;. By 1830, the old channel had been reduced to its present insignificance. It was navigable by country boats throughout the year and by launches only during rains, but at the point as low as Jamalpur it was formidable throughout the cold weather. Similar was the position for two or three months just below Mymensingh also.

===International cooperation===
The waters of the River Brahmaputra are shared by Tibet, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was repeated speculation that mentioned Chinese plans to build a dam at the Great Bend, with a view to diverting the waters to the north of the country. This has been denied by the Chinese government for many years. At the Kathmandu Workshop of Strategic Foresight Group in August 2009 on Water Security in the Himalayan Region, which brought together in a rare development leading hydrologists from the basin countries, the Chinese scientists argued that it was not feasible for China to undertake such a diversion. However, on 22 April 2010, China confirmed that it was indeed building the Zangmu Dam on the Brahmaputra in Tibet, but assured India that the project would not have any significant effect on the downstream flow to India. This claim has also been reiterated by the Government of India, in an attempt to assuage domestic criticism of Chinese dam construction on the river, but is one that remains hotly debated. Recent years have seen an intensification of grassroots opposition, especially in the state of Assam, against Chinese upstream dam building, as well as growing criticism of the Indian government for its perceived failure to respond appropriately to Chinese hydropower plans.

In a meeting of scientists at Dhaka at 2010, 25 leading experts from the basin countries issued a Dhaka Declaration on Water Security calling for the exchange of information in low-flow periods, and other means of collaboration. Even though the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention does not prevent any of the basin countries from building a dam upstream, customary law offers some relief to the lower riparian countries. There is also the potential for China, India, and Bangladesh to cooperate on transboundary water navigation.

===Significance to people===
The lives of many millions of Indian and Bangladeshi citizens are reliant on the Brahmaputra river. Its delta is home to 130 million people and 600 000 people live on the riverine islands. These people rely on the annual &#x27;normal&#x27; flood to bring moisture and fresh sediments to the floodplain soils, hence providing the necessities for agricultural and marine farming. In fact, two of the three seasonal rice varieties (aus and aman) cannot survive without the floodwater. Furthermore, the fish caught both on the floodplain during flood season and from the many floodplain ponds are the main source of protein for many rural populations.

== Dams and hydropower projects ==
Brahmaputra and Ganges floodwaters can be supplied to most lands in India by constructing a coastal reservoir to store water on the Bay of Bengal sea area.

<text>The common loon or great northern diver (Gavia immer) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure white underparts except some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly heavier than females. During the breeding season, loons live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), and southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.

Common loons eat a variety of animal prey including fish, crustaceans, insect larvae, molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface. Loons are monogamous; that is, a single female and male often together defend a territory and may breed together for a decade or more. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of dead marsh grasses and other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A single brood is raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots which are incubated for about 28 days by both parents. Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater when just a few days old, and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.

The common loon is assessed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. The United States Forest Service has designated the common loon a species of special status because of threats from habitat loss and toxic metal poisoning in its US range.

The common loon is the provincial bird of Ontario, and it appears on Canadian currency, including the one-dollar &quot;loonie&quot; coin and a previous series of $20 bills. In 1961, it was designated the state bird of Minnesota, and appears on the Minnesota State Quarter.

==Taxonomy==
The common loon is also known as the great northern diver in Eurasia. Another former name, great northern loon, was a compromise proposed by the International Ornithological Committee. It is one of five loon species that make up the genus &quot;Gavia&quot;, the only genus of the family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is another large black-headed species, the yellow-billed loon or white-billed diver (&quot;Gavia adamsii&quot;). There are no recognized subspecies of the common loon.

Danish zoologist and mineralogist Morten Thrane Brünnich first described the common loon in 1764, as &quot;Colymbus immer&quot; in his &quot;Ornithologia Borealis&quot;. The now-defunct genus &quot;Colymbus&quot; contained grebes as well as loons, and remained in use until the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature attempted to clarify the nomenclature in 1956 by declaring &quot;Colymbus&quot; a suppressed name unfit for further use and establishing &quot;Gavia&quot;, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus name for the loons.

The current genus name &quot;Gavia&quot; was the Latin term for an unidentified seabird and the specific &quot;immer&quot; is derived from a Norwegian name for the bird, similar to the modern Icelandic word &quot;himbrimi&quot;. The word may be related to Swedish &quot;immer&quot; and &quot;emmer&quot;: the grey or blackened ashes of a fire (referring to the loon&#x27;s dark plumage); or to Latin &quot;immergo&quot;, to immerse, and &quot;immersus&quot;, submerged.

The European name &quot;diver&quot; comes from the bird&#x27;s practice of catching fish by diving. The North American name &quot;loon&quot; was first recorded in this sense in &quot;New Englands Prospect&quot; (1634) by William Wood (1580–1639); &quot;The Loone is an ill shap&#x27;d thing like a Cormorant&quot;. It may be derived from Old Norse &quot;lómr&quot;, as are modern Swedish and Danish &quot;lom&quot;, in each case referring to the distinctive call.

A number of fossil loon species are known from the Pliocene, and specimens from the Pleistocene of California and Florida appear to represent a paleosubspecies of the common loon.

==Description==
The adult common loon can range from in length with a wingspan, slightly smaller than the similar yellow-billed loon. On average, it is about long and has a wingspan of . Its weight can vary anywhere from . Sizes vary regionally, especially by body mass, with the smallest bodied loons on average from lower-central Canada and the Great Lakes, while westerly birds are similar or mildly larger, and loons breeding further east can appear to be significantly larger. Furthermore, males average up to nearly 27% more massive than females in some populations. Breeding loons in Maine averaged in females and in males, essentially the same weight as the yellow-billed loon, although the yellow-billed is still larger than in linear dimensions (especially bill length) than the Maine loons. In Ontario, 20 females averaged and 20 males averaged . In contrast, in the Gulf of Alaska, adults of both sexes reportedly averaged . Adult breeding plumage consists of a broad black head and neck with greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen. It has a black bill sometimes with a pale tip, and red eyes. The neck is encircled with a characteristic black ring and has two white necklaces of eight to ten short streaks on the upper foreneck, and a noticeable collar of white, parallel lines forming a large oval on the neck-side. The central lower foreneck is pure white, and the lower neck-sides has longitudinal white lines becoming rows of small spots and black lines becoming very narrow. The upperparts are blackish or blackish grey, and each feather has small white spots on it. The upperwing is blackish and with small white spots on the non-primary coverts, whereas the underwing is paler with white coverts except the long black shaft-streaks on the axillaries. The underparts are pure white, but have some black on the undertail coverts and vent. It has a checkered black-and-white mantle and a blackish tail. The legs are pale grey on the inner half and blackish on the outer half, and the webs between the toes are flesh colored.
Adult non-breeding plumage is brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.

The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, sometimes having a black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck is short and thick. The common loon swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to the surface. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure made up of a number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the skeleton lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.

A juvenile often has a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look darker than the pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young may not be as fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.

The common loon is distinguished from the black-throated loon (&quot;G. arctica&quot;) and the red-throated loon (&quot;G. stellata&quot;) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It is more difficult to separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.

===Moult===

The scaly juvenile plumage is retained until January or February of the year following hatching, when a lengthy moult of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly of head, body and tail feathers.

=== Genomics ===
With improved gene-sequencing technology, a draft genome of the common loon has assembled and identified at least 14,169 genes. 80.7% of chicken genes are found in the common loon genome. The physiological costs of deep-water diving and long distance aerial migration of loons have greatly affected loon evolution. Many identified genes are candidate genes for positive selection since the common loon-chicken split 90 million years ago. It is theorized that these candidate genes are related to haemoglobin affinity for oxygen, solute exchange, immunoglobulin function related to immune defence, nervous system development and a number of molecular pathways related to DNA metabolic function, and G-receptor pathways potentially involved in low-light visual acuity. For example, SLC48A, and SLC20A1 are candidate genes in the &quot;Gavia&quot; lineage for maintaining homeostasis due to maybe having a role in maintaining ion and pH balance.

==Distribution and habitat==
Common loons are mainly Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their breeding season in spring and summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, as well as in southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.

Some common loons remain in Iceland year-round, although most migrate. In North America, they winter mainly along north Atlantic and north-east Pacific coasts, many stopping off on the Great Lakes during their migration. They migrate in the day, starting about two hours after sunrise and flying at altitudes of 1500 to 2700 m above sea level, above the convective and turbulent layer of air. In winter they can be seen on North America coasts as far south as Baja California, Sonora, northern Sinaloa, southern Texas, and rarely northern Tamaulipas. In the east, several thousand winter along western European coasts, probably originating from Iceland, Greenland, and Canada. Their range extends into northwestern Europe from Finland to Portugal and southern and northwestern Spain (Galicia and Asturias), as well as the western Mediterranean off Catalonia, and off Morocco in Africa, although only a few hundred travel as far south as Iberia. Although wintering site fidelity is not well known, annually, adults are observed to return to the same wintering locations in the Pacific Ocean (Morro Bay), the Gulf of Mexico (Barataria Bay), the Atlantic Ocean (Maryland and Massachusetts), and the reservoir Lake Pateros.

They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, with birds migrating to the nearest body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. They appear in most of the inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine have some of the highest concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded inland in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.

== Behaviour ==

The common loon is an expert fisher, catching its prey underwater by diving as deep as . With its large webbed feet, the common loon is an efficient underwater pursuit predator and adroit diver. It needs a long run-up distance to gain momentum for flight take-off and is ungainly on land, sliding on its belly and pushing itself forward with its legs. Its clumsiness on land is due to the legs being positioned at the rear of its body; the pelvic muscles are well developed, ideal for swimming but not well-suited for walking. When it lands on water, it skims along on its belly to slow down, rather than braking with its feet, as they are set too far back. The common loon swims and dives well, and flies competently for hundreds of kilometres in migration. It flies with its neck outstretched, usually calling a particular tremolo that can be used to identify a flying loon. Its flying speed is as much as during migration. Particularly during the breeding season, common loons frequently engage in territorial disputes against other water birds, including ducks and geese, and will attack or drive off competitors and intruders to their territory.

=== Feeding ===

Fish account for about 80% of the diet of the common loon. It forages on fish of up to in length, including minnows, suckers, gizzard shad, rock bass, alewife, northern pike, whitefish, sauger, brown bullhead, pumpkinseed, burbot, walleye, bluegill, white crappie, black crappie, rainbow smelt, and killifish. The young typically eat small minnows, and sometimes insects and fragments of green vegetation. The freshwater diet primarily consists of pike, perch, sunfish, trout, and bass; the saltwater diet primarily consists of rock fish, flounder, sea trout, herring, Atlantic croaker, haddock, and Gulf silverside. When there is either a lack of fish or they are difficult to catch, it preys on crustaceans, crayfish, snails, leeches, insect larvae, molluscs, frogs, annelids, and occasionally aquatic plant matter such as pondweed, roots, moss, willow shoots, seeds, and algae. It has also been known to eat ducklings.

The common loon uses its powerful hind legs to propel its body underwater at high speed to catch its prey, which it then swallows head-first. If the fish attempts to evade the common loon, the bird chases it down with excellent underwater manoeuvrability due to its strong legs. Most prey are swallowed underwater, where they are caught, but some larger prey are first brought to the surface. It is a visual predator, so it is essential to hunting success that the water is clear. It normally dives , but has been recorded to dive up to . The average diving time is 42 seconds, but the maximum duration spent underwater is about .

===Breeding===

The common loon&#x27;s mating system is serially monogamous; breeding pairs jointly defend a territory consisting of an entire small lake or a protected bay within a large lake. A given male and female remain together throughout a breeding attempt, rear their own biological offspring, reunite each spring, and may breed together for many consecutive years. However, in the event of death or territorial eviction of one pair member by an intruding loon of the same sex, the other pair member quickly establishes a pair bond with the evicting bird. Hence, most adult loons have two or more different mates during their lives. Evicting individuals tend to be young males and females (5 to 9 years old), while evicted adults are often those 15 years and older.

Pairs do not remain together during winter; in addition, males usually precede females by a few days to a few weeks during spring migration, settling on their lake once a portion of it becomes ice-free. Copulation takes place ashore, often on the nest site, repeated daily until the eggs are laid. The preceding courtship is very simple, with mutual bill-dipping and dives. The displays towards intruders, such as bow-jumping (an alternation of fencing and bill-dipping postures and rushing (running &quot;along the surface with its wings either folded or half-extended and flapping at about the same speed as when taking off&quot;) are often misinterpreted as courtship.

Nesting typically begins in early May. Significantly more nesting sites are found on islands than on mainland shoreline. Breeding pairs patrol their territories routinely, even at night, defending the territory both physically and vocally. Pairs that nested together the preceding year typically reuse the nest site from the previous year, if they hatched chicks successfully there. In contrast, pairs that lost their eggs to a predator usually shift the nest to a new location. This logical behaviour pattern appears to depend upon the male, because breeding pairs consisting of last year&#x27;s male and a female not present during the preceding year continue to exhibit the behaviour; pairs composed of last year&#x27;s female and a new male tend to select a new nest site, regardless of the success or failure of the previous year&#x27;s attempt. Despite the lead role of males in nest site selection, both sexes contribute substantially to nest construction. The nest is about wide and is constructed out of dead marsh grasses and other indigenous plants, and formed into a mound along the vegetated coasts of lakes greater than . After a week of construction in late spring, one parent climbs on top to mould the interior of the nest to the shape of its body. Based on a number of studies, nesting success averages about 40%, and most newly hatched young survive due to parental care.

Eggs from first clutches are typically laid in May or early June, the timing depending largely upon the date that lakes become ice-free and inhabitable. A clutch consists of two (occasionally one) olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots. Incubation is carried out jointly by male and female and lasts about 28 days. Loons often place nests along steep lake shorelines where adults can quickly dive underwater when approached by predators. The eggs are about long and wide and the two eggs are laid with an interval of one to three days between them, and hatch .

Newly hatched chicks are dark chocolate brown in colour and have a white belly. Within hours of hatching, the young begin to leave the nest with the parents, swimming close by and sometimes riding on one parent&#x27;s back. Parents and chicks initially stay in shallow, isolated bays where the parents are able to defend the chicks better from intruding loons and eagles, which are their main predators. Male parents defend broods consisting of two chicks more vigorously than singleton chicks, chiefly with the territorial yodel call. The chicks are capable of making shallow dives from their first day but make deeper dives as they grow. Fledging takes 70 to 77 days. Usually, only one brood is raised. Both parents feed the chicks live prey from hatching to fledging. As they grow, chicks are able to catch an increasingly large proportion of their diet by themselves; they can feed and fend for themselves after about two months, although many juveniles continue to beg from adults well beyond this age. The parent birds capture small fish and hold them crosswise in their bill, call and approach the chicks with their head lowered so that the chicks can grasp them. If food is scarce, the larger chick may peck its small sibling incessantly; on small lakes with limited food, only one chick often survives. Juveniles leave the breeding ground before ice formation in the fall, weeks after their parents. A pair of loons raising two chicks have been estimated to feed on of fish during the five and a half months that they spend in their breeding territory.

=== Habitat selection ===
Loons exhibit a strong tendency to settle as breeders on a lake that resembles their natal one, a phenomenon termed natal habitat imprinting. This preference is based on two lake attributes: size and pH. The behaviour is puzzling, because it is as strong in loons hatched on small, acidic lakes as those from large lakes of neutral pH. Hence, the former group is exhibiting active preference for lakes that have been shown to result in higher chick mortality and lower breeding success.

===Vocalizations===

The common loon produces a variety of vocalizations, the most common of which are the tremolo, the yodel, the wail, and the hoot. Each of these calls communicates a distinct message. The frequency at which it vocalizes has been shown to vary based on time of day, weather, and season. It is most vocally active between mid-May and mid-June. The wail, yodel, and tremolo calls are sounded more frequently at night than during the day; calls have also been shown to occur more frequently in cold temperatures and when there is little to no rain.
The tremolo call—sometimes called the &quot;laughing&quot; call—is characterized by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes or perceived threats. It emits a tremulous series of up to 10 rather high notes &quot;(hu)-heheheheheheha&quot;. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon&#x27;s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.
The yodel is a long and complex call made only by the male. It is used in the establishment of territorial boundaries and in territorial confrontations, and the length of the call corresponds with the loon&#x27;s level of aggression. The dominant frequencies in the yodel indicate the body mass and thereby the health of males. A male that occupies a new territory appears to alter its yodel to be clearly distinguishable from the call of the previous territory owner.

A loon&#x27;s wail is a long call consisting of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf&#x27;s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given back and forth between breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or in an attempt to move closer together after being separated. It is a loud &quot;aaoo&quot;, &quot;weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea&quot;, or &quot;ooo-aaah-éééé&quot;.

The hoot is a short, soft call and is another form of contact call. It is a more intimate call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.

== Longevity and terminal investment ==
Considerable information on longevity and survival rates has been collected in the past two decades, owing to the implementation of an efficient capture protocol that permits marking and monitoring of large study populations. A rough preliminary analysis showed that common loons of both sexes survive at an annual rate of over 90% until they reach their mid-20s, but show a survival rate of only about 75% thereafter. However, a second, finer-scaled analysis made clear that male loons begin to show higher mortality, increased territory loss and lower body condition starting at age 15. Perhaps in response to their physical decline, males 15 and older show increased rates of both territorial aggression and territorial vocalization. This age-related shift in behaviour is interpreted as terminal investment, a &quot;go for broke&quot; strategy seen in senescing animals that are attempting to eke out another year or two of breeding before they die.

== Predators and parasites ==

Adult common loons have few predators, although bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter have also been recorded. When a predator approaches (either the loon&#x27;s nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator&#x27;s abdomen or the back of its head or neck, which may be deadly to predators up to the size of a fox or raccoon.

Eggs are taken by a number of mammals, including American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and raccoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water&#x27;s edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.

Chicks may be killed by common snapping turtles, large gulls, bald eagles and large fish such as northern pike and largemouth bass. The eagle in particular is a significant predator of chicks.

Internal parasites of the common loon include many species of worms, including flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, and can lead to illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by &quot;Eimeria gaviae&quot; and avian malaria have been recorded in this loon. The black fly &quot;Simulium annulus&quot; is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird&#x27;s head.

Botulism, acquired by eating infected fish, can lead to paralysis and drowning. Aspergillosis is another cause of emaciation and death. Outbreaks sometimes lead to thousands of deaths.

==Status and conservation==
Since 1998, the common loon has been rated as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it has a large range – more than – and because it has a stable population trend that does not warrant a vulnerable rating. It also has a large population size of 612,000 to 640,000 individuals. The estimated breeding population ranges from 1,400 to 2,600 mature individuals in Europe. Over half of the breeding population in North America is found in Ontario with 97,000 territorial pairs, and in Quebec with 50,000 territorial pairs. About 2,400 individuals occur in each of the maritime provinces of Canada—Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. British Columbia accounts for 25,000 territorial pairs. In far northern Canada, about 50,000 territorial pairs are known to occur, and 12,500 to 15,000 territorial pairs occur in the Prairie Provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. In the United States, the largest breeding population is present in Alaska with 3,600 to 6,000 territorial pairs. The U.S. Great Lakes region has 5,900 to 7,200 territorial pairs which accounts for over half of the breeding population in the United States. There are about 100 territorial pairs in the northwestern U.S. states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. About 2,250 territorial pairs are found in New England and New York. In winter, 3,500 to 4,500 individuals are found in the United Kingdom, and even fewer individuals are found in the western European coastline and in Iceland. Along the Pacific Coast, about 184,000 to 189,000 adults and 31,000 to 32,000 juveniles are found, and along the Atlantic Coast, 423,000 to 446,000 adults and 72,000 to 76,000 juveniles are found.

The common loon is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species, and in Article I under the European Union (EU) Birds Directive. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) is applied. In Europe it appears in 20 Important Bird Areas (IBAs), including Ireland, Svalbard, mainland Norway, Iceland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It is also a listed species in 83 Special Protection Areas in the EU Natura 2000 network. The USDA National Forest Service has designated the common loon a species of special status, and in the upper Great Lake regions of the Huron-Manistee, Ottawa, and Hiawatha national forests as a regional forester sensitive species.

=== Threats to status and conservation ===

==== Effects of mercury and acid rain pollution on health and brood productivity ====
The common loon is a key indicator of mercury deposition in aquatic environments due to its position at the top of the food chain. The main contributors to elevated mercury concentrations in aquatic environments are coal burning power plants, waste incineration, and metal production. Although environmental mercury (Hg) is naturally occurring, methylmercury (, sometimes written as ) is a biologically toxic form that accumulates throughout aquatic environments in the northeastern United States. Methylmercury, a neurotoxin, has been shown to have a wide range of behavioral, reproductive, and survival effects on the common loon. Previous research has found a correlation between mercury levels and pH, with more acidic aquatic environments being at the highest risk for elevated methylmercury concentrations. Once mercury enters the water, it is taken up by fish and spread throughout the food chain. Resulting from this transmission of mercury, there is a significant positive correlation between mercury levels in fish and mercury levels in male, female, and chick blood of common loons; consequently, an increase in mercury concentration in the blood of common loons and fish was seen with a decrease in local aquatic pH. Although there have been reductions in recent years in acidifying emissions, there has been limited biological recovery in these lakes most likely due to climate change. Research has shown that warmer summer temperatures can inhibit reestablishment of cold-water fish species in acidified lakes and droughts brought on by increased summer temperatures can further acidify lakes.

Although the common loon is able to decrease their methylmercury levels by molting and laying eggs, continued consumption of fish with raised methylmercury levels prevents these mechanisms from effectively lowering methylmercury levels. Mercury concentrations have been shown to vary by the sex and age of common loons. Male common loons were found to contain the highest blood mercury concentration likely due to the fact that they tend to consume bigger fish with higher mercury concentrations. Females contained the second highest blood mercury concentration with differences between the males likely being due to the fact that females can expel mercury into the eggs they lay. Juveniles had the lowest blood mercury concentration. Scientists found that the data from juveniles helped to best indicate the local mercury availability as they are fed exclusively from their natal territory.

Elevated levels of mercury have been associated with changes in foraging and brooding behavior among adult common loons, especially in higher concentrations. Studies have found that elevated levels of methylmercury are associated with lethargy and decreased time spent foraging in adult common loons. A different study carried out in the Adirondack Mountains found that elevated levels of methylmercury are associated with reduced diving frequency in adult common loons. One study found that brood productivity was reduced by half when female blood mercury levels exceeded 4.3 μg/g and productivity completely failed when female blood mercury levels exceeded 8.6 μg/g. These results are related to fish mercury levels of 0.21 μg/g and 0.41 μg/g, respectively. As mercury levels and pH are correlated, scientists have found that brood success decreases with decreasing pH such that environments with a pH at around 4.5 exhibited reproductive success below a calculated positive growth rate threshold. An association has also been observed between elevated blood methylmercury levels and aberrant incubation patterns. Adult common loons with high levels of methylmercury were found to spend less time incubating and in the nest, increasing the risks of predation and the eggs overheating/overcooling. Together, the effects of heightened methylmercury levels on parenting behaviors may contribute to lower chick survival rates. One study in Maine and New Hampshire found that high levels of methylmercury in parents are associated with a significant decrease in the number of fledged young, with common loons in the highest risk group producing 41% fewer fledged young than common loons with low levels of methylmercury.

==== Mercury deposition in the Adirondack Mountains ====
The common loons of the Adirondack Mountains are particularly affected by methylmercury as the acidity of the lakes provides an environment conducive to converting environmental mercury to methylmercury. One study found that 21% of the male Adirondack common loon and 8% of the female Adirondacks common loon sampled were at high risk for detrimental impacts such as behavioral and reproductive abnormalities. In the Adirondacks, bioaccumulation factors for methylmercury were found to increase up the food chain, leaving common loons at the highest risk for detrimental effects from methylmercury. Spatial analysis indicates that the highest aquatic mercury concentrations are found in the southwestern portion of the Adirondacks, an area with lakes heavily affected by acid rain. Organizations such as the Adirondack Loon Center and the Adirondack Cooperative Loon Program spearhead loon conservation efforts in the Adirondacks by performing research, engaging the public, and informing public policy.

==== Breeding range decline ====
The common loon&#x27;s breeding range has moved northward, the species breeding as far south as Iowa a century ago. It too is adversely affected by acid rain and pollution, as well as lead poisoning from fishing sinkers (especially those that are about the size of the grit stones they ingest) and mercury contamination from industrial waste. Heavy metals such as mercury may be partially removed through biological processes such as excretion or deposition in feathers, but their adverse effects are magnified through concentration of the toxic elements in organs such as the liver. Eggs shells may also contain metal contaminants, leading to low reproductive productivity. High levels of heavy metals are linked to loons being in poor condition, males being affected more because they eat larger fish.

The common loon has also faced a decline in breeding range due to hunting, predation, and water-level fluctuations, or flooding. Some environmentalists attempt to increase nesting success by mitigating the effects of some of these threats, namely terrestrial predation and water-level fluctuations, through the deployment of rafts in the loon&#x27;s breeding territories. In addition, artificial floating nesting platforms have been provided for the common loon in some lakes to reduce the impact of changing water levels due to dams and other human activities. The common loon abandons lakes that fail to provide suitable nesting habitat due to shoreline development. It is endangered by personal water-craft and powerboats that may drown newly born chicks, wash eggs away, or swamp nests. It is still considered an &quot;injured&quot; species in Alaska as a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

=== Lead poisoning ===
In a 2003 survey of New England dead loons, lead poisoning from fishing weights accounted for about half of the deaths, and other human factors directly caused the death of 52% of the observed 522 loons.

==In culture==
The common loon appears on Canadian currency, including the one-dollar &quot;loonie&quot; coin and the previous series of $20 bills. It is the provincial bird of Ontario. It was designated the state bird of the U.S. state of Minnesota in 1961, and also appears on the Minnesota State Quarter.

=== Folklore ===
The voice and appearance of the common loon has made it prominent in several Native American tales. These include an Ojibwe story of a loon that created the world, and a Mi&#x27;kmaq saga describing Kwee-moo, the loon who was a special messenger of Glooscap (Glu-skap), the tribal hero. The tale of the loon&#x27;s necklace was handed down in many versions among Pacific Coast peoples. The Delaware in the east of North America and the Buryats of Siberia also had creation stories involving the loon.

Folk names for the common loon include &quot;big loon&quot;, &quot;call-up-a-storm&quot;, &quot;greenhead&quot;, &quot;hell-diver&quot;, &quot;walloon&quot;, &quot;black-billed loon&quot;, &quot;guinea duck&quot;, &quot;imber diver&quot;, &quot;ring-necked loon&quot;, and &quot;ember-goose&quot;. An old colloquial name from New England was &quot;call-up-a-storm&quot;, as its noisy cries supposedly foretold stormy weather. Some old Scottish names such as arran hawk and carara are corruptions of old Scottish Gaelic onomatopoeic names representing the bird&#x27;s call; others, like bishop and ember goose, were used to avoid older names for this sometimes ill-omened bird.

The common loon was eaten in the Scottish Islands from the Neolithic until the eighteenth century, and its thick layer of fat beneath the skin was used as a cure for sciatica.

=== Popular culture ===
The bird is central to the plot of the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Great Northern?&quot; by Arthur Ransome (in which it is referred to throughout as &quot;great northern diver&quot;, with the then current scientific name &quot;Colymbus immer&quot;). The story is set in the Outer Hebrides, where the main characters—a group of children on holiday—notice a pair of divers apparently nesting there. Checking their bird book, they believe that these are great northern divers. However, these have not previously been seen to nest in northern Scotland, and so they ask for help from an ornithologist. He confirms that these birds are indeed the great northern; unfortunately, it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe, but wants to steal the eggs and add them to his collection; and to do this, he must first kill the birds. Published in 1947, the story is one where the conservationists are the eventual victors over the egg collector, at a time when the latter hobby was not widely considered to be harmful.

Major League Soccer club Minnesota United FC uses the loon in its crest and nickname, as well as a mascot.

Minor League Baseball team Great Lakes Loons, located in Midland, Michigan also uses the loon in its logo and name, as well as a mascot.

==== Films ====
The wailing call of the loon is widely used in film and television to evoke wilderness and suspense, and is referenced in songs such as &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot; (&quot;wanna laugh like a loon&quot;).

Loons are featured prominently in the 1981 film &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. Its distinctive sound also appeared in &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Guinevere&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Kubo and the Two Strings&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, &quot;1917&quot; and &quot;&quot;, among others.

In the 2016 Pixar movie &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, a somewhat bedraggled and dimwitted loon named Becky is persuaded to use a bucket to help two of the main characters, Nemo and Marlin, get into a marine life institute where the titular Dory is trapped.

<text>Subdeacon is a minor order of ministry for men or women in various branches of Christianity. The subdeacon has a specific liturgical role and is placed below the deacon and above the acolyte in the order of precedence.

==Subdeacons in the Eastern Orthodox Church==

A subdeacon, also called hypodeacon, is the highest of the minor orders of clergy in the Eastern Orthodox Church. This order is higher than the reader and lower than the deacon.

===Canonical discipline===
Like the reader, the clerical street-dress of the subdeacon is the cassock, which is usually black but only need be so if he is a monk. This is symbolic of their suppression of their own tastes, will, and desires, and their canonical obedience to God, their bishop, and the liturgical and canonical norms of the Church. As a concession in countries where Eastern Orthodoxy is little known, many only wear the cassock when attending liturgies or when moving about the faithful on church business. In some jurisdictions in the United States, a clergy-shirt will sometimes be worn instead of a cassock, and is commonly worn buttoned but with no collar or collar-tab to indicate a rank lower than deacon.

There is a special liturgy for the tonsuring of a subdeacon, although in contemporary practice an acolyte or a reader may receive the bishop&#x27;s blessing to vest and act as a subdeacon generally or for a particular occasion if there is no subdeacon available. This situation often arises if there is a need for a subdeacon and a likely candidate has stated an intention to marry but has not yet done so, causing a delay in their ordination. The reason for this lies in the fact that the canons prohibit subdeacons to marry after their ordination (just like deacons and priests). This latter stipulation has led, in some places, to the reservation of the formal ordination liturgy as a stepping-stone for candidates for the priesthood, although this is by no means universal. It also means that, while teenagers who show particular fervour may be ordained as acolytes and readers, the subdiaconate is usually reserved for those of more mature years; the canonical minimum age for subdiaconal ordination is twenty years.

A custom in some jurisdictions is that former seminarians who have discerned not to have a calling to the priesthood or diaconate, are, if they wish (and provided that they are married, or being unmarried, do not intend to marry), ordained subdeacons as a sign of investment, faith, and to award their service.

===Function, vesture, and ordination===
====Byzantine Rite====

In the Byzantine Rite (followed by the majority of Eastern Orthodox churches) the subdeacon&#x27;s liturgical role is primarily that of servant to the bishop. They assist the bishop during hierarchical liturgies, (at which a hierarch/bishop is present and presiding) by vesting them, by looking after and presenting the &quot;trikiri&quot; and &quot;dikiri&quot;, placing the &quot;aëtos&quot;, operating the veil and Royal Doors, and handing the bishop and relieving them of all that they need so as to enable them to perform their role of prayer undistracted. Outside of hierarchical liturgies, the subdeacon serves in the altar as any other server but, as highest-ranking of the minor clergy, is responsible for co-ordinating and leading the serving team. In addition to the above duties, the subdeacon may read the reading from the Epistle at the Divine Liturgy if there is only one deacon. The subdeacon also has practical responsibilities in the care of the altar, by cleaning it, looking after the clergy vestments and the cloths of the Holy Table, cleaning and mending them, and changing them according to the feasts, fasts, and seasons. For this reason, they have a general blessing to touch the Holy Table and the Table of Oblation, which Readers and other servers may not do. They are also responsible for the training of new servers.

The clerical street-wear of a subdeacon is the inner-cassock () and outer cassock (). Many wear the cassock only when present among the church community or attending to church business.

For liturgies, the subdeacon is vested in a &quot;sticharion&quot; with an &quot;orarion&quot; tied around their waist, up over their shoulders (forming a cross in back), and with the ends crossed over, and tucked under the section around the waist. This distinguishes them from acolytes in those jurisdictions where acolytes are ordained and blessed to wear the &quot;orarion&quot;, as the latter do not wear the &quot;orarion&quot; crossed in front but simply hanging straight down.

The ordination to the subdiaconate is performed outside of the altar and in a context other than the Divine Liturgy. The reader who is to be tonsured subdeacon is presented to the bishop by two other subdeacons, who first lead them to the nave. There they face east and makes a prostration before turning to make three prostrations towards the bishop, moving further west after each one. They are then led to stand immediately before the bishop. The subdeacons present the &quot;orarion&quot; to the bishop, who blesses it. The ordinand then kisses the &quot;orarion&quot; and the bishop&#x27;s hand, and the subdeacons vest the ordinand in the &quot;orarion&quot;.

The bishop blesses the ordinand three times with the sign of the Cross upon his head, then lays his right hand upon the ordinand&#x27;s head and prays the prayer of ordination. The new subdeacon kisses the bishop&#x27;s right hand and makes a prostration before the bishop, after which the more senior subdeacons drape a towel over his shoulders and present him with a ewer and basin, with which he washes the bishop&#x27;s hands after the usual manner. The bishop dries his hands and the three subdeacons receive the bishop&#x27;s blessing and kiss his hands.

The senior subdeacons return to the altar while the new subdeacon, still holding the ewer and basin, stands on the &quot;soleas&quot;, facing the icon of the Mother of God and saying particular prayers quietly. The Sixth Hour is completed and the Divine Liturgy continues as usual. The subdeacon remains on the &quot;soleas&quot; until the &quot;Cherubikon&quot;, when they and two senior subdeacons wash the bishop&#x27;s hands as usual.

At the Great Entrance, the new subdeacon joins on the very end of the procession, carrying the ewer and basin and, after the commemorations, takes the blessed water to the people so that they may bless themselves with it.

On occasions when there is a shortage of altar servers, the newly ordained subdeacon may be required to serve at the Liturgy, in which case the taking of the blessed water to the people may be omitted, and he may be asked not to stay on the &quot;soleas&quot; but rather to assist with serving duties in the altar and at the entrances.

====The Western Rites====
In the Western Rite, the subdeacon&#x27;s role is essentially as an assistant to the deacon in performing their diaconal role. This perhaps more clearly reflects the origins of the subdiaconate than in the Byzantine Rite, where, rather than the subdeacon assisting the deacon, many formerly diaconal functions have, over time, come to be seen as properly belonging to the subdeacon in their own right. In the Western Rite, the subdeacon is charged with reading the epistle at a High Mass (the most solemn and elaborate form of the western Eucharist) – a role that may be performed by a priest or reader at a simpler form of the mass, and with assisting the deacon with the preparation of the oblations and with carrying them to the altar, (in those western rites that retain the Offertory Procession). They also assist the deacon during the reading of the Gospel by carrying the Gospel book to and from (depending on the rite used) the place of proclamation, and by acting as a support for the book while the Gospel is read. At pontifical liturgies (at which a pontiff or bishop is present and presiding), the subdeacon also assists the deacon in the vesting of the bishop.

The usual street-wear of the subdeacon is the cassock. (There is no distinction between an inner and outer cassock in the Western Rite, and all clergy wear one cassock only).

During liturgies, the subdeacon vests in an alb, over which they wear the maniple, the cincture, and the tunicle. Unlike his brother subdeacons in the Byzantine Rite who wear the &quot;orarion&quot;, the subdeacon does not wear its western equivalent - the stole - which is reserved for deacons, priests, and bishops.

==Subdeacons in the Catholic Church==

=== Latin Church ===
Prior to the reform instituted by Pope Paul VI with his &quot;motu proprio&quot; of 15 August 1972, the subdiaconate was regarded as the lowest of the major orders of the Latin Church. He decreed that &quot;the major order of subdiaconate no longer exists in the Latin Church&quot; and that the functions previously assigned to the subdeacon are now entrusted to the acolyte and the lector; they also decreed that, where the local episcopal conference so desired, the acolyte could be called a subdeacon.

The traditional rites of ordination to the subdiaconate and the minor orders (those of acolyte, exorcist, lector and porter) are still employed for members of certain Catholic religious institutes and societies of apostolic life authorized to use the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite.

As men in major orders, subdeacons, like deacons, were styled in English-speaking countries as &quot;The Rev. Mr.&quot; In French the title of was often given to them and even to those in minor orders, as in the case of Franz Liszt.

The subdiaconate was generally considered a major order in the Latin church from the late 12th century. After that, ordination of a subdeacon did not include the laying on of hands. Instead, the bishop handed to him an empty chalice and paten, his vestments, cruets of wine and water, and the Book of the Epistles and pronounced a prayer of blessing for him. As a recipient of a major order, a subdeacon could not contract marriage, and any breach by him of the obligation to observe celibacy was classified as a sacrilege (cf. canon 132 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law). Canon 135 of the same Code of Canon Law obliged him to say all the canonical hours of the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours or Breviary).

The other major orders were those of the deacon and priest, that of bishop not being then considered an order distinct from that of priesthood. Thus, in speaking of orders, the Catechism of the Council of Trent declares : &quot;Their number, according to the uniform and universal doctrine of the Catholic Church, is seven, Porter, Reader, Exorcist, Acolyte, Sub-deacon, Deacon and Priest. [...] Of these, some are greater, which are called &#x27;Holy&#x27;, some lesser, which are called &#x27;Minor Orders&#x27;. The great or Holy Orders are Sub-deaconship, Deaconship and Priesthood; the lesser or Minor Orders are Porter, Reader, Exorcist, and Acolyte&quot;.

Today the Latin Church, as stated in the Code of Canon Law in force since 1983 (&quot;The orders are the episcopate, the presbyterate, and the diaconate&quot;), recognizes only three orders, those of bishop, priest (presbyter) and deacon, also referred to as &quot;sacred orders&quot; or &quot;holy orders&quot;. In line with Pope Paul VI&#x27;s , what were called minor orders are now called ministries.

In the Solemn High Mass form of Tridentine Mass and the Ordinariate Mass, the duties of a subdeacon included those of crucifer, singing the Epistle, holding the Book of Gospels while the deacon sings the Gospel, carrying it back to the celebrant afterwards and assisting the priest or deacon in setting the altar. Although the subdeacons were allowed to carry out numerous functions specific to the diaconate, however they were always precluded from distributing Communion, in the form of both bread and wine. The subdeacon&#x27;s specific vestment is the tunicle, in practice almost indistinguishable in form from the deacon&#x27;s dalmatic (the tunicle is sometimes somewhat longer than the dalmatic or had slightly less elaborate decoration, but this is often unnoticeable by the casual church-goer). Unlike deacon and priest, he never wears a stole. In the former Mass rites he wore a maniple and also wore a humeral veil while holding the paten from the Offertory to the &quot;Our Father&quot;; and, if the chalice and paten with host are not already on the altar, he also used the humeral veil when bringing these to the altar at the Offertory. In practice, the roles of deacon and subdeacon in Solemn High Mass were generally performed by men already ordained as priests, wearing the subdiaconal or diaconal vestments. The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter uses instituted acolytes in the role of subdeacon, but also uses men ordained as priests or deacons for the subdiaconal role.

=== Eastern Catholic Churches ===
In the Eastern Catholic Churches that use the Byzantine Rite, the order of subdeacon is the highest of the minor orders and its functions are equivalent to those of Orthodox subdeacons.

==Subdeacons in the Anglican Church==
Whilst the office of subdeacon was not included in the Orders of Clergy when the Church of England was established during the 16th century, certain churches and communities in the Anglican Communion and within the Anglican Continuing Churches assign a layperson to act as subdeacon in the celebration of the liturgy of the Holy Communion (especially Solemn High Mass). However, this is considered a liturgical function one fulfills and not an order to which one is ordained. In some dioceses and provinces, laypersons who act as subdeacons in this manner may be required to be specifically authorised by the respective bishop or archbishop. In practice, an Anglican subdeacon performs similar roles to those performed in Latin Catholic or Western Rite Orthodox churches. The proper garments of the subdeacon are the alb and tunicle.

<text>Ningxia, officially the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region in Northwestern China. Formerly a province, Ningxia was incorporated into Gansu in 1954 but was later separated from Gansu in 1958 and reconstituted as an autonomous region for the Hui people, one of the 56 officially recognised nationalities of China. Twenty percent of China&#x27;s Hui population lives in Ningxia.

Ningxia is bounded by Shaanxi to the east, Gansu to the south and west and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to the north and has an area of around . This sparsely settled, mostly desert region lies partially on the Loess Plateau and in the vast plain of the Yellow River and features the Great Wall of China along its northeastern boundary. Over about 2000 years, an extensive system of canals (with a total length of approximately 1397 kilometers) has been built from Qin dynasty. Extensive land reclamation and irrigation projects have made increased cultivation possible. The arid region of Xihaigu, which covers large parts of the province, suffers from severe water shortage, which the canals were intended to alleviate.

Ningxia was the core area of the Western Xia in the 11th–13th centuries, established by the Tangut people; its name, &quot;Peaceful Xia&quot;, derived from the Mongol conquest of the state. The Tanguts made significant achievements in literature, art, music, and architecture, particularly invented Tangut script. Long one of the country&#x27;s poorest areas, a small winemaking industry has become economically important since the 1980s. Before the arrival of viticulture, Ningxia&#x27;s 6.8 million people, 36 per cent of whom are Muslims from the Hui ethnic group, relied largely on animal grazing, subsistence agriculture and the cultivation of wolfberries used in traditional Chinese medicine. Since then, winemaking has become the premier specialty of Ningxia, and the province devotes almost 40,000 hectares to vineyards and producing 120 million bottles of wine in 2017 – a quarter of the entire nation&#x27;s production.

==History==
The earliest human activity in Ningxia can be traced back to 30,000 years ago, with remains of the Shuidonggou Culture found in Lingwu.
As a frontier zone between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers, Ningxia was a frequent seat of war and incursions by non-Chinese tribes. Ningxia and its surrounding areas were incorporated into the Qin as the Beidi Commandery as early as the 3rd century BC. To pacify the region, the imperial government established military colonies to reclaim land. In addition, horse pasturages were founded under the Imperial Stud to safeguard the supply of army horses, as early as the Western Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 9). Throughout the Han dynasty and the Tang dynasty there were several large cities established in the region. The Liang Province rebellion at the end of the Han Dynasty affected Ningxia.

By the 11th century the Tangut people had established the Western Xia dynasty on the outskirts of the then-Song dynasty. Jews also lived in Ningxia, as evidenced by the fact that in 1489, after a major flood destroyed Torah scrolls in Kaifeng, a replacement set was sent to the Kaifeng Jews by the Ningbo and Ningxia Jewish communities.

It then came under Mongol domination after Genghis Khan conquered Yinchuan in the early 13th century. Muslims from Central Asia also began moving into Ningxia from the west. By the late 17th century, Ningxia had become a weaving centre, producing many early Chinese carpets. The Muslim Dungan Revolt of the 19th century affected Ningxia.

In 1914, Ningxia was merged with the province of Gansu. In 1928, it became a separate province. Between 1914 and 1928, the Ma clique ruled the provinces of Qinghai, Ningxia and Gansu; General Ma Hongkui was the military governor of Ningxia and had absolute authority in the province. The Muslim conflict in Gansu, which lasted from 1927 to 1930, spilt over into Ningxia. In 1934, warlord and National Revolutionary Army general Sun Dianying attempted to conquer the province, but was defeated by an alliance led by the Ma clique.

From 1950 to 1958, a Kuomintang Islamic insurgency resulted in fighting throughout Northwest China, including Ningxia. In 1954, the Chinese government merged Ningxia with Gansu, but in 1958 Ningxia formally became an autonomous region of China. In 1969, Ningxia received a part of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, but this area was returned in 1979.

A number of Chinese artifacts dating from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, some of which had been owned by Emperor Zhenzong, were excavated and then came into the hands of Ma Hongkui, who refused to publicize the findings. Among the artifacts were a white marble tablet from the Tang dynasty, gold nails, and bands made out of metal. It was not until after Ma Hongkui died that his wife went to Taiwan in 1971 from America to bring the artifacts to Chiang Kai-shek, who turned them over to the Taipei National Palace Museum.

==Geography==

Present-day Ningxia is one of the nation&#x27;s smallest provincial-level units and borders the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. At 3556 meters above sea level, Aobaogeda () in the Helan Mountains is the highest point in Ningxia.

Ningxia is a relatively dry, desert-like region and features a diverse geography of forested mountains and hills, table lands, deserts, flood plains and basins cut through by the Yellow River. The Ningxia ecosystem is one of the least studied regions in the world. Significant irrigation supports the growing of wolfberries, a commonly consumed fruit throughout the region. Ningxia&#x27;s deserts include the Tengger desert in Shapotou.

The northern section, through which the Yellow River flows, supports the best agricultural land. A railroad, linking Lanzhou with Baotou, crosses the region. A highway has been built across the Yellow River at Yinchuan.

On 16 December 1920, the Haiyuan earthquake, 8.6 magnitude, at , initiated a series of landslides that killed an estimated 200,000 people. Over 600 large loess landslides created more than 40 new lakes.

===Grasslands===
It was reported that approximately 34 percent (33.85 million mu; ) of the region&#x27;s total surface consisted of grassland. This figure is down from approximately 40 percent in the 1990s. The grasslands are spread over the dry desert-steppe area in the northeast (which forms a part of the Inner Mongolian steppe region), and the hilly pastures located on the semi-arid Loess Plateau in the south. It is ascertained that the grasslands of Ningxia have been degraded to various degrees. Scientists debate the extent to which this degradation occurs over space and time. Historical research has also found limited evidence of expanding grassland degradation and desertification in Ningxia. A major component of land management in Ningxia is a ban on open grazing, which has been in place since 2003. The ecological and socio-economic effects of this Grazing Ban in relation to the grasslands and pastoralists&#x27; livelihood are contested. The ban stipulates that animal husbandry be limited to enclosed pens and no open grazing be permitted in certain time periods set by the Autonomous Region&#x27;s People&#x27;s Government.

===Climate===

The region is from the sea and has an arid continental climate on the north to humid continental climate to the south, with average summer temperatures rising to in July and average winter temperatures dropping to between in January. Seasonal extreme temperatures can reach in summer and in winter. The diurnal temperature variation can reach above , especially in spring. Annual rainfall averages from , with more rain falling in the south of the region.

===Mineral resources===
Ningxia is rich in mineral resources with proven deposits of 34 kinds of minerals, much
of which located in grassland areas. In 2011 it was estimated that the potential value per capita of these resources accounted for 163.5 percent of the nation&#x27;s average. Ningxia boasts verified coal reserves of over 30 billion tons, with an estimated reserve of more than 202 billion tons, ranking sixth nationwide. Coal deposits are spread over one-third of the total surface of Ningxia, and mined in four major fields in the Helan and Xiangshan mountains, Ningdong and Yuanzhou (or Guyuan). The region&#x27;s reserves of oil and natural gas can be found in Yanchi and Lingwu County, and are ideal for large-scale development of oil, natural gas and chemical industries. Ningxia leads China in gypsum deposits, with a proven reserve of more than 4.5 billion tons, of which the rarely found, top-grade gypsum accounts for half of the total deposits. The Hejiakouzi deposit in Tongxin County features a reserve of 20 million tons of gypsum with a total thickness of 100 meters. There is a considerable deposit of quartz sandstone, of which 17 million tons have been ascertained. In addition, there are phosphorus, flint, copper, iron, barite, other minerals and Helan stone – a special clay stone.

==Politics==

Like all governing institutions in mainland China, Ningxia has a parallel party-government system, in which the CCP Ningxia Regional Committee Secretary outranks the Government Chairman. The CCP Ningxia Regional Committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and has control over the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region People&#x27;s Government.

== Administrative divisions ==

Ningxia is divided into five prefecture-level divisions: all prefecture-level cities:

The five prefecture-level cities of Ningxia are subdivided into 22 county-level divisions (9 districts, 2 county-level cities, and 11 counties).

===Urban areas===
== Economy ==

 Rural Ningxia was for long an officially designated poverty area, and remains on the lower rungs of the developmental ladder. Its nominal GDP in 2023 was 531.50 billion yuan (US$75.43 billion) and its per capita GDP 72,957 yuan (US$10,353). It comprises 0.42% of the national economy.

===Agriculture===
Similar to other areas, Ningxia has seen a gradual decline of its peasant population due to rural–urban migration. Despite this, the great majority (62.8 percent) was still agricultural at the time of the survey. Animal husbandry is important for the regional economy. In the main pastoral county, Yanchi, it is even the leading industry when specified for the primary sector. The dominant grazing animals are sheep and goat. In the (semi-)pastoral regions, herders engage in a mixed sedentary farming operation of dryland agriculture and extensive animal husbandry, while full nomadic pastoralism is no longer practiced. Since a cattle breeding plan was implemented in 2002, the province has become one of China&#x27;s main dairy production areas.

Ningxia is the principal region of China where wolfberries are grown. Other specialties of Ningxia are licorice, products made from Helan stone, fiddlehead and products made from sheepskin.

Ningxia wines are a promising area of development. The Chinese authorities have given approval to the development of the eastern base of the Helan Mountains as an area suitable for wine production. Several large Chinese wine companies including Changyu and Dynasty Wine have begun development in the western region of the province. Together they now own 20,000 acres of land for wine plantations and Dynasty has ploughed 100 million yuan into Ningxia. In addition, the major oil company China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation has founded a grape plantation near the Helan Mountains. The household appliance company Midea has also begun participating in Ningxia&#x27;s wine industry. Vineyards have been set up in the region.

===Industries and economic zones===
Ningxia was a major recipient of China&#x27;s investment in industrial capacity during the Third Front campaign.

Yinchuan Economic and Technological Development Zone was established in 1992. Spanning , it has an annual economic output Rmb23.7 billion (25.1% up) (US$3.5 billion). Major investors are mainly local enterprises such as Kocel Steel Foundry, FAG Railway Bearing (Ningxia), Ningxia Little Giant Machine Tools, etc. Major industries include machinery and equipment manufacturing, new materials, fine chemicals and the animation industry.

Desheng Industrial Park (in Helan County) is a base for about 400 enterprises. The industrial park has industrial chains from Muslim food and commodities to trade and logistics, new materials and bio-pharmaceuticals that has 80 billion yuan in fixed assets. Desheng is looking to be the most promising industrial park in the city. It achieved a total output value of 4.85 billion in 2008, up 40 percent year-on-year. The local government plans to cut taxes and other fees to reduce the burden on local enterprises. The industrial output value reached 2.68 billion yuan in 2008, an increase of 48 percent from a year earlier.

<text>or Paul Gerhardt (12 March 1607 – 27 May 1676) was a German theologian, Lutheran minister and hymnodist.

==Biography==
Gerhardt was born into a middle-class family at Gräfenhainichen, a small town between Halle and Wittenberg. His father died in 1619, his mother in 1621. At the age of fifteen, he entered the Fürstenschule in Grimma. The school was known for its pious atmosphere and stern discipline. The school almost closed in 1626 when the plague came to Grimma, but Paul remained and graduated from there in 1627. In January 1628 he enrolled in the University of Wittenberg. There, two teachers in particular had an influence on him: Paul Röber and Jacob Martini. Both of these men were staunch Lutherans, promoting its teachings not only in the classroom but in sermons and hymns. Röber in particular often took his sermon texts from hymns. In this way Gerhardt was taught the use of hymnody as a tool of pastoral care and instruction.

Gerhardt graduated from the University of Wittenberg around 1642. Due to the troubles of the Thirty Years&#x27; War it seems he was not immediately placed as a pastor, and thus moved to Berlin where he worked as tutor in the family of an advocate named Andreas Barthold. During his time in Berlin his hymns and poems brought him to the attention of Johann Crüger, the cantor and organist at the Nicolaikirche in Berlin. Crüger was impressed by Gerhardt&#x27;s hymns and included many of them in his &quot;Praxis pietatis melica&quot;. The hymns proved popular, and Gerhardt and Crüger began a collaboration and friendship that continued for many years.

In September 1651, Gerhardt received his first ecclesiastical appointment as the new Probst at Mittenwalde (a small town near Berlin). It was during his time in Mittenwalde when he composed most of his hymns. Also while there he married Anna Maria Barthold, one of the daughters of Andreas Barthold. Their first child was born there in 1656, but died in infancy; a memorial tablet in the church shows their grief.

While Gerhardt was a devoted pastor in Mittenwalde it appears he missed Berlin. In 1657 he was called to be a Deacon (Associate Pastor) to the Nikolaikirche of Berlin. He seems to have had some hesitancy about leaving Mittenwalde since it was only after long deliberation that he accepted the appointment.

When Gerhardt came to Berlin he found a city full of strife between the Lutheran and Reformed clergy. The Elector at the time was Friedrich Wilhelm I of Brandenburg, who was Reformed. He wanted to make peace between the clerical factions, but being Reformed himself, he concentrated most of his efforts on making his lands more Calvinist. He placed only Reformed pastors into parishes, removed the Lutheran professors from the University of Frankfurt and forbade students from his lands to study at the University of Wittenberg.

He also sponsored a series of conferences between the Lutheran and Reformed clergy in the hopes of having them arrive at some consensus, but the result was the opposite: the more the two sides argued, the further apart they found themselves. Gerhardt was a leading voice among the Lutheran clergy, and drew up many of the statements in defense of the Lutheran faith. At the same time he was renowned for acting fraternally not only with the Lutherans but also with the Reformed clergy; he was respected and very well liked by all. His sermons and devotional writings were so free from controversy that many among the Reformed attended his services, and the wife of the Elector, Louisa Henrietta, was a great admirer of him and his hymns.

The Elector, however, was growing impatient with a lack of success at his conferences. He put an end to them in 1664 and published his &quot;syncretistic&quot; edict. Since the edict disallowed the Formula of Concord, one of the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the Book of Concord, many Lutheran clergy could not bring themselves to comply with the edict. Gerhardt was thus removed from his position in 1666.

The citizens of Berlin petitioned to have him restored, and owing to their repeated requests an exception to the edict was made for Gerhardt, although his conscience did not allow him to retain a post which, appeared to him, could only be held on condition of a tacit repudiation of the Formula of Concord. For over a year he lived in Berlin without fixed employment. During this time his wife also died, leaving him with only one surviving child. Ironically the edict was withdrawn a few months later, although by this time his patroness, Electress Louisa Henrietta had died as well and so he was still without a position. In October 1668 he was called as archdeacon of Lübben in the duchy of Saxe-Merseburg, where, after a ministry of eight years, he died on 27 May 1676.

Gerhardt is considered Germany&#x27;s greatest hymn writer. Many of his best-known hymns were originally published in various church hymn-books, as for example in that for Brandenburg, which appeared in 1658; others first saw the light in Johann Crüger&#x27;s &quot;Geistliche Kirchenmelodien&quot; (1647) and &quot;Praxis pietatis melica&quot;. The first complete collection is the &quot;Geistliche Andachten&quot;, published in 1666–1667 by Ebeling, music director in Berlin. No hymn by Gerhardt of a later date than 1667 is known to exist.

The life of Gerhardt has been written by Roth (1829), by Langbecker (1841), by Schultz (1842), by Wildenhahn (1845) and by Bachmann (1863); also by Kraft in Ersch&#x27;s und Gruber&#x27;s &quot;Allg. Encyc&quot; (1855). A short biography was also done by William Dallmann, reprinted in 2003. The best modern edition of the hymns, published by Wackernagel in 1843, has often been reprinted. There is an English translation by Kelly (&quot;Paul Gerhardt&#x27;s Spiritual Songs&quot;, 1867).

==Commemoration==

Paul Gerhardt is commemorated on 26 October in the Calendar of Saints used by some Lutheran churches in the United States, on which day the achievements of Philipp Nicolai and Johann Heermann are also commemorated. 

A plaque in Wittenberg marks his lodgings, close to the university.

== Hymns ==

Johann Sebastian Bach used several single stanzas of Gerhardt&#x27;s hymns in his church cantatas, motets, Passions and &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;. The hymn &quot; is the base for Bach&#x27;s chorale cantata BWV 92.

Hymn texts by Gerhardt, listed with a translation of the first line, associated hymn tune, base, liturgical occasion, the number in the current German Protestant hymnal &quot; (EG) and the Catholic &quot;Gotteslob&quot; (GL), use in Bachs works (BWV numbers between 1 and 200 are cantatas, BWV 245 is the &quot;St John Passion&quot;, BWV 244 is the &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, BWV 248 the &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot;, BWV 439–507 appear in &quot;Schemellis Gesangbuch&quot;), and/or notes:

<text>Hamam (, also known as &quot;Steam: The Turkish Bath&quot;) is a 1997 Italian–Turkish–Spanish film directed by Ferzan Özpetek about the powerful transformations certain places can cause in people.

== Synopsis ==
Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) and Marta (Francesca d&#x27;Aloja) are an uptight Rome couple running a small design firm. Their marriage, once the most important thing to both, has lost all meaning. Francesco loses interest in Marta, prompting her to start an affair with Paolo, their business partner.

Francesco&#x27;s aunt Anita, the black sheep of the family, dies in Istanbul, where Francesco goes to try to sell the property he has inherited as quickly as possible.

The family who had managed the property under Anita&#x27;s supervision and direction welcomes him with hospitality, but they are concerned about what the future holds for them. Their young son Mehmet (Mehmet Günsür) is particularly eager to show their handsome guest around.

When Francesco discovers the property includes a derelict &quot;hamam&quot;, a Turkish bath, he instead decides to restore the &quot;hamam&quot; and reopen it to the public. During the restoration, he starts a relationship with Mehmet.

Meanwhile, Marta arrives in Istanbul to get a speedy divorce from Francesco, but she is taken aback when she realizes how much Francesco has changed from his old self: both the &quot;hamam&quot; and Mehmet&#x27;s unconditional affection were just what he needed, giving him back a purpose in life. Marta falls in love with him again, causing Rome and the divorce to lose importance for her.

Francesco&#x27;s unwillingness to sell the property makes him enemies, some of whom ultimately murder him.

Marta decides to stay in Istanbul and run the &quot;hamam&quot;, the final scene suggesting she has turned into a second Anita.

<doc id="183544" wikidata="Q418896" url="?curid=183544" title="Proopiomelanocortin">
<text>Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is a precursor polypeptide with 241 amino acid residues. POMC is synthesized in corticotrophs of the anterior pituitary from the 267-amino-acid-long polypeptide precursor pre-pro-opiomelanocortin (pre-POMC), by the removal of a 26-amino-acid-long signal peptide sequence during translation. POMC is part of the central melanocortin system.

== Function ==

POMC is cut (cleaved) to give rise to multiple peptide hormones. Each of these peptides is packaged in large dense-core vesicles that are released from the cells by exocytosis in response to appropriate stimulation:
* α-MSH produced by neurons in the ventromedial nucleus has important roles in the regulation of appetite (POMC neuron stimulation results in satiety.) and sexual behavior, while α-MSH secreted from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary regulates the movement of melanin produced from melanocytes in skin. 
* ACTH is a peptide hormone that regulates the secretion of mainly glucocorticoids from the cells of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. ACTH can also regulate secretion of gonadocorticoids from the cells of the zona reticularis since they also express ACTH receptors.
* β-Endorphin and [Met]enkephalin are endogenous opioid peptides with widespread actions in the brain.

== Synthesis ==

The &quot;POMC&quot; gene is located on chromosome 2p23.3. The &quot;POMC&quot; gene is expressed in both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. This gene encodes a 285-amino acid polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes extensive, tissue-specific, post-translational processing via cleavage by subtilisin-like enzymes known as prohormone convertases. The encoded protein is synthesized mainly in corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, where four cleavage sites are used; adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), essential for normal steroidogenesis and the maintenance of normal adrenal weight, and β-lipotropin are the major end-products. However, there are at least eight potential cleavage sites within the polypeptide precursor and, depending on tissue type and the available convertases, processing may yield as many as ten biologically active peptides involved in diverse cellular functions. Cleavage sites consist of the sequences Arg-Lys, Lys-Arg, or Lys-Lys. Enzymes responsible for processing of POMC peptides include prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), prohormone convertase 2 (PC2), carboxypeptidase E (CPE), peptidyl α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase (N-AT), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP).

The processing of POMC involves glycosylations, acetylations, and extensive proteolytic cleavage at sites shown to contain regions of basic protein sequences. However, the proteases that recognize these cleavage sites are tissue-specific. In some tissues, including the hypothalamus, placenta, and epithelium, all cleavage sites may be used, giving rise to peptides with roles in pain and energy homeostasis, melanocyte stimulation, and immune modulation. These include several distinct melanotropins, lipotropins, and endorphins that are contained within the adrenocorticotrophin and β-lipotropin peptides.

It is synthesized by:
* Corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland
* Melanotrope cells of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland
* Neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus
* Smaller populations of neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus and brainstem
* Melanocytes in the skin

== Regulation by the photoperiod ==
The levels of proopiomelanocortin (&quot;pomc&quot;) are regulated indirectly in some animals by the photoperiod. It is referred to the hours of light during a day and it changes across the seasons. Its regulation depends on the pathway of thyroid hormones that is regulated directly by the photoperiod. An example are the siberian hamsters who experience physiological seasonal changes dependent on the photoperiod. During spring in this species, when there is more than 13 hours of light per day, iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2) promotes the conversion of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) through the removal of an iodine atom on the outer ring. It allows T3 to bind to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), which then binds to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the DNA sequence. The &quot;pomc&quot; proximal promoter sequence contains two thyroid-receptor 1b (Thrb) half-sites: TCC-TGG-TGA and TCA-CCT-GGA indicating that T3 may be capable of directly regulating &quot;pomc&quot; transcription. For this reason during spring and early summer, the level of pomc increases due to the increased level of T3.

However, during autumn and winter, when there is less than 13 hours of light per day, iodothyronine desiodinase 3 removes an iodine atom which converts thyroxine to the inactive reverse triiodothyronine (rT3), or which converts the active triiodothyronine to diiodothyronine (T2). Consequently, there is less T3 and it blocks the transcription of &quot;pomc&quot;, which reduces its levels during these seasons.

Influences of photoperiods on relevant similar biological endocrine changes that demonstrate modifications of thyroid hormone regulation in humans have yet to be adequately documented.

== Derivatives ==
The large molecule of POMC is the source of several important biologically active substances . POMC can be cleaved enzymatically into the following peptides:
* &quot;N&quot;-Terminal Peptide of Proopiomelanocortin (NPP, or pro-γ-MSH)
* α-Melanotropin (α-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone, or α-MSH)
* β-Melanotropin (β-MSH)
* γ-Melanotropin (γ-MSH)
* 𝛿-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (𝛿-MSH, present in sharks)
* ε-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone (ε-MSH, present in some teleosts )
* Corticotropin (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, or ACTH)
* Corticotropin-like Intermediate Peptide (CLIP)
* β-Lipotropin (β-LPH)
* Gamma Lipotropin (γ-LPH)
* β-Endorphin
* [Met]Enkephalin

Although the N-terminal 5 amino acids of β-endorphin are identical to the sequence of [Met]enkephalin, it is not generally thought that β-endorphin is converted into [Met]enkephalin. Instead, [Met]enkephalin is produced from its own precursor, proenkephalin A.

The production of β-MSH occurs in humans but not in mice or rats due to the absence of the enzymatic processing site in the rodent POMC.

== Clinical significance ==

Mutations in this gene have been associated with early onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency, and red hair pigmentation.

A study concluded that a polymorphism was associated with higher fasting insulin levels in the obese patients only. These findings support the hypothesis that the melanocortin pathway may modulate glucose metabolism in obese subjects indicating a possible gene-environment interaction. POMC variant may be involved in the natural history of polygenic obesity, contributing to the link between type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Septic patients have increased circulating plasma concentrations of POMC. The clinical significance is currently under investigation. Further augmenting systemic glucocorticoid availability via infusion of hydrocortisone in septic mice resulted in a suppression of ACTH, an endproduct of POMC, but not in a suppression of POMC.

== Dogs ==

A deletion mutation common in Labrador Retriever and Flat-coated Retriever dogs is associated with increased interest in food and subsequent obesity.

== Drug target ==

POMC is used as a target for a medication used to treat obesity in humans. The combination of bupropion and naltrexone acts via hypothalamic POMC neurons to decrease appetite.

Two humans with POMC deficiency have been treated with setmelanotide, a melanocortin-4 receptor agonist.

== Interactions ==

Proopiomelanocortin has been shown to interact with melanocortin 4 receptor. The endogenous agonists of melanocortin 4 receptor include α-MSH, β-MSH, γ-MSH, and ACTH. The fact that these are all cleavage products of POMC should suggest likely mechanisms of this interaction.

<text>The Airbus A300-600ST (Super Transporter), or Beluga, is a specialised wide-body airliner used to transport aircraft parts and outsize cargoes. It received the official name of &quot;Super Transporter&quot; early on, but its nickname, after the beluga whale, which it resembles, gained popularity and has since been officially adopted.

Due to Airbus&#x27;s manufacturing facilities being dispersed, the company had a long term need to transport sizeable components, such as wings and fuselage sections, to their final assembly lines. This had been met by a small fleet of Aero Spacelines &quot;Super Guppies&quot;, but these aircraft were aged and increasingly maintenance-intensive to keep in operation. While several different existing aircraft were studied, none were found to be fully satisfactory. Instead, the company came to favour developing a derivative of its standard A300-600. In August 1991, a new joint venture company, &quot;Super Airbus Transport International&quot; (SATIC), was formed to pursue the venture.

Construction of the first aircraft began during September 1992; it performed its maiden flight on 13 September 1994. Entering service in September 1995, the Super Transporter was a larger, faster, and more efficient aircraft than the preceding Super Guppies. A total of five aircraft were built for Airbus; while additional new-build aircraft were offered to prospective operators by SATIC during the 1990s, no other customers ordered the type. In addition to its primary task of conveying Airbus components, the Super Transporter fleet has occasionally been used for charter flights, carrying outsized cargoes for various customers and purposes, from whole helicopters to industrial equipment and humanitarian aid. On 25 January 2022, Airbus announced a service offering outsize cargo transportation using its Beluga fleet.

During the 2010s, Airbus developed a slightly larger successor, the BelugaXL, based on the Airbus A330-200. This fleet, which entered service in January 2020, is intended to eventually replace the original Beluga fleet, which was entering its third decade. However, all aircraft have remained operational as of 03 2025.

In January 2025, Airbus decided to close its Beluga Transport operations after just 14 months of getting its own AOC.

==Development==
===Background===
When Airbus commenced operations in 1970, ground vehicles were initially used to move components and sections; however, growth in production volume soon necessitated a switch to air transport. From 1972 onwards, a fleet of four highly modified Aero Spacelines &quot;Super Guppies&quot; took over. These were 1940s-era Boeing Stratocruisers that had been converted with turbine engines and custom fuselages to carry large-volume loads for NASA&#x27;s space program in the 1960s. Airbus&#x27; use of the Super Guppies led to the jest that &quot;every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing&quot;. Over time, the Super Guppies grew increasingly unsatisfactory for Airbus&#x27;s ferrying needs: their age meant that operating expenses were high and ever-increasing, and growing Airbus production required greater capacity than could be provided by the existing fleet.
Various options were studied to serve as a replacement transport medium for the Super Guppies, including methods of surface transportation by road, rail, and sea; these alternatives were discarded in favour of a principally air-based solution as they were considered time-consuming and unreliable; in addition, the assembly line in Toulouse was not conveniently accessible by any of the surface methods. A key requirement of the new air transporter was the need to accommodate every major component being manufactured by Airbus, including the then-heaviest planned part, the wing of the larger Airbus A340 variants. A speedy development program was also required to have the prospective type take over duties from the Super Guppy fleet, scheduled to be withdrawn in the mid-1990s.

Several different types of aircraft were examined for potential use, including the Antonov An-124, Antonov An-225, Ilyushin Il-86, Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III; the use of any existing aircraft was eventually ruled out due to a lack of internal space for the desired components; the use of a piggyback solution was also dismissed as impractical. Boeing made an offer to convert several Boeing 767s for the requirement, but this was viewed as less advantageous than purpose-built aircraft using Airbus&#x27; existing twin-engined Airbus A300-600R.

In August 1991, Aérospatiale and DASA, two of the major Airbus partners, formed a 50/50 joint venture company, &quot;Super Airbus Transport International&quot; (SATIC), based in Toulouse, to develop a new-build replacement for the Super Guppy fleet. The selected starting point for the design was the Airbus A300, leading to the new airframe being designated as the A300-600ST Super Transporter. Following a pre-design period by SATIC, detailed design work was performed by Aérospatiale and DASA while subcontractors were selected to complete the 15 separate work packages; amongst these subcontractors, CASA was selected to produce the upper fuselage, Dornier provided the hydraulic systems, and Sogerma performed the final assembly work. The A300-600ST was not a like-for-like replacement, being larger, faster, and more efficient than the preceding Super Guppies. Airbus elected to invest $1 billion into the program, this sum included the aircraft themselves, the cargo loading system, and program management.

===Construction and further development===

In September 1992, construction work began on the first aircraft, the maiden flight of which took place in September 1994. Following a total of 335 flight hours being performed during the test program, restricted certification of the type was awarded by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in October 1995, enabling the A300-600ST &quot;Beluga&quot; to enter service shortly thereafter. Originally a total of four aircraft were to be built along with an option for a fifth aircraft being available, which was later firmed up. Apart from the first Beluga, each airframe took an average of three years to complete from start to finish; they were built at a rate of one per year. Modification work was performed at Toulouse using components provided by the Airbus assembly line.

The fleet&#x27;s primary task is to carry Airbus components ready for final assembly across Europe between Toulouse, Hamburg, and nine other sites, and they do so 60 times per week. The Beluga fleet is owned by Airbus Transport International (ATI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus Group that was established specifically to operate the type; through this organisation, the fleet is made available for hire by third parties for charter flight. In May 1998, ATI reportedly had an annual revenue target of $15 million to be achieved via leasing spare capacity. Over time, the Beluga has been used to carry a variety of special loads, including space station components, large and delicate artwork, industrial machinery, and intact helicopters. The A300-600ST&#x27;s freight compartment is in diameter and long; maximum payload is 47 tonnes.

In late 1997, in response to the positive performance of the A300-600ST Super Transporter program, SATIC announced that it was in the process of evaluating several different prospective outsize freighter conversions; company chairman Udo Dräger indicated that a larger freighter based on the Airbus A340 could be developed in a similar manner to that of the A300-based Beluga. At the time, derivatives of both the Airbus A330 and the A340 were studied, including combining the upward-swinging hinged door of the Beluga with a conventional upper deck as an alternative to a side-mounted cargo door in traditional freighter missions. During the 1990s, as a result of reported inquiries to Airbus regarding the type, a niche market for selling Beluga-type aircraft to military customers and freight operators was also examined; but sales were considered &#x27;unlikely&#x27; to take place by the late 1990s. Its unit cost is €183 million.

In November 2014, Airbus announced that it was proceeding with the development of a larger replacement based on the Airbus A330-200, planning to replace the BelugaST fleet entirely by 2025. The BelugaXL entered service in 2020. Airbus previously considered the A330-300 and A340-500, but each required too much of the limited runway at Hawarden Airport near Broughton in Wales. In May 2015, Airbus confirmed that the new aircraft would have a wider cross-section than its predecessor and provide a 12% increase in payload. The BelugaXL is intended primarily for A350 work, designed to ship two A350 wings simultaneously. The first two aircraft were considered essential to facilitate mass production of the A350, while the following aircraft were to be progressively introduced as the A300-600 Beluga fleet was withdrawn.

==Design==
The A300-600ST Beluga shares many design similarities, although differing substantially in appearance, to the Airbus A300 upon which it was based. The wings, engines, landing gear, and the lower part of the fuselage remain identical to those used on the conventional A300, while the upper part of the fuselage forms an enormous horseshoe-shaped structure in diameter. In comparison with the Super Guppy, the payload was more than doubled and the volume increased by more than 30% The General Electric CF6-80C2 turbofan engines used are slightly uprated from those used on the standard A300 as well. The vertical stabilizer uses a modified A340 fin with a base extension while the tailplane was strengthened and fitted with auxiliary fins to maintain directional stability. The tailplane trim tank was also deleted.

To provide access to the cargo area from the front without having to disconnect all electrical, hydraulic and flight control connections (and also avoiding the lengthy recalibrations before each flight that reconnection entailed), the standard A300 cockpit was relocated down below the cargo-floor level. By relocating the cockpit in this manner, loading times were halved from those typically achieved with the Super Guppy, which had needed to disconnect and reconnect such systems. Another reason for faster loading times was the adoption of a roll-on/roll-off loading system, as well as the ability to unload the aircraft in winds of up to 40 knots. The qualities and improved capabilities of the Beluga resulted in the costs associated with transporting Airbus components dropping to one-third of those being incurred operating the Super Guppy.

The cockpit of the Beluga is pressurized but the cargo deck is not, making it inaccessible during flight and unsuitable for cargoes that require a pressurized environment, such as live animals. However, the cargo deck is fitted with a heating module to keep the cargo within an appropriate temperature range. On at least one occasion, a pressurized container has been used for cargo. The aircraft is operated by a crew of three – two pilots and a loadmaster.

The main deck cargo volume of the Beluga is greater than that of the C-5 Galaxy or the Antonov An-124, but still smaller than Antonov An-225. However, it is restricted by cargo-weight capacity of 47 tonnes, compared to 122.5 tonnes for the C-5 Galaxy and 150 tonnes for the An-124. Despite this width, the Beluga cannot carry most fuselage parts of the Airbus A380, which are instead normally transported by ship and road; nevertheless, some A380 components have been transported by Belugas.

==Operational history==
In January 1996, the Beluga formally entered service, ferrying components from various aerospace sites to the final assembly lines. The geographic location of Airbus manufacturing is not only influenced by cost and convenience; it is also a matter of aviation history and national interests. Traditionally, each of the Airbus partners makes an entire aircraft section, which would then be transported to a central location for final assembly; even after the integration of Airbus into a single firm, the arrangement had largely remained the same, with Airbus partners becoming subsidiaries or contractors of the multinational pan-European company. The details vary from one model to another, but the general arrangement is for the wings and landing gear to be made in the UK, the tail and doors in Spain, the fuselage in Germany, and the nose and centre-section in France, with final assembly in either Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; or Seville, Spain.

On 24 October 1997, the last of Airbus&#x27;s Super Guppy freighters was retired and its outsize cargo mission from that point onwards being exclusively performed by the new A300-600ST fleet. In 1997, the second year of Beluga operations, the fleet accumulated in excess of 2,500 flight hours across more than 1,400 flights. By 2012, the fleet was performing roughly 5,000 flight hours per year and further increases were being publicly anticipated by Airbus.

Various infrastructure upgrades have been made at multiple locations to better accommodate the Beluga, many of which being delivered after its entry to service. In 2011, Pau Pyrénées Airport, a site routinely visited by Belugas, became the first airport in Europe to deploy the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, which accurately guides the Beluga and other aircraft during landing. In 2015, a dedicated Beluga loading station was opened at Hawarden Airport, preventing high winds from disrupting future operations. A two-bay loading dock was opened in Toulouse in 2019, receiving 85–100 flights per week, as the five A300-600STs are operated 7,600 hours a year together. By enclosing the forward section, including the open large cargo door, a faster one hour and 20 minutes turnaround, down from two hours and 30 minutes, could be achieved, along with reduced weather-related restrictions.

In addition to its primary supply duties to Airbus&#x27; production facilities, Belugas have often performed charter flights for various purposes. In 1997, ATI claimed that it had to reject eight out of ten requests for commercial Beluga flights, the fleet being able to spare only 130 flight hours for such duties that year. But as more Beluga aircraft were put into service, availability increased drastically, rising to 600 flight hours in 1998 and around 1,000 flight hours in 1999; this effectively enabled one of the five Beluga aircraft to spend much of its operating hours performing charter flights. Amongst the early customers chartering Beluga flights was Boeing.

In June 1997, a world record was set for the most voluminous payload to be carried by an aircraft when a Beluga was used to transport a chemical tank for a merchant vessel from Clermont-Ferrand to Le Havre, France. In February 2003, a single Beluga performed the farthest distance charter flight ever, having flown for 25 hours (not including refuelling stops) to transport two complete NHI NH90 helicopters along with a single Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter from Marseille, France, to Melbourne, Australia, for the Avalon Airshow.
In 1999, a Beluga carried a large painting, &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; by Eugène Delacroix, which had hung in the Louvre in Paris since 1874. It was flown from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Kolkata in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring high by long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurized container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.

In 2004, a Beluga delivered relief supplies to the Indian Ocean region following widespread devastation of coastal areas by a major tsunami. In 2005, the type transported humanitarian aid and medical supplies from the United Kingdom and France to the Gulf Coast of the United States as part of disaster relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

The Beluga has seen recurrent use to transport bulky objects, including vehicles, for various different space programs. In 2001, sections of the unmanned Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) space vehicle were transported by a Beluga from Turin, Italy, to Amsterdam, Netherlands. In 2004, multiple Beluga flights were made to Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, to deliver Astrium-built satellites. In 2009, a Beluga was used to convey the Tranquility module of the International Space Station from Turin to Kennedy Space Center, United States.

On 25 January 2022, Airbus announced a service offering outsize cargo transportation using its BelugaST fleet. Airbus Beluga Transport saw additional demand after sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 affected Russian-operated Antonov An-124 services and the destruction of the sole Antonov An-225; the company stated that it foresaw in excess of 150 such flights being performed annually. In September 2022, Airbus began testing a new loading system for handling outsized military cargo with the BelugaST fleet. A verification exercise was conducted with the German armed forces, the system&#x27;s first customer, during which a Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion military transport helicopter was loaded into a Beluga.

<doc id="183550" wikidata="Q573710" url="?curid=183550" title="Pink Narcissus">
<text>Pink Narcissus is a 1971 American arthouse drama film directed by James Bidgood and starring (unknowns) Bobby Kendall, Don Brooks and stage actor Charles Ludlam. It visualizes the erotic fantasies of a gay male prostitute.

== Premise ==
Between visits from his keeper, or John, a handsome male prostitute (Bobby Kendall), alone in his apartment, lounges, fantasizing about worlds where he is the central character. For example, he pictures himself as a matador, a Roman slave boy and the emperor who condemns him, and the keeper of a male harem for whom another male performs a belly dance.

== Production ==
In a 2005 interview, Bidgood enumerated some of the film&#x27;s inspirations, such as the British film &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; and actress Maria Montez. Most of the film&#x27;s extras were people actor Don Brooks found on the streets when he went out of the set on &quot;talent searches&quot;.

The film is mostly shot on 8 mm film with bright, otherworldly lighting and intense colors. Aside from its last, climactic scene, which was shot in a downtown Manhattan loft, it was produced in its entirety (including outdoor scenes) in Bidgood&#x27;s small New York City apartment over a seven-year (from 1963 to 1970) period and ultimately released without the consent of the director, who therefore had himself credited as &quot;Anonymous&quot;. He said in the interview, &quot;See, why I took my name off of it was that I was protesting, which I&#x27;d heard at the time that&#x27;s what you did...&quot;

== Provenance ==
Because the name of the filmmaker was not widely known, there were rumors that Andy Warhol was behind it. In the mid-1990s, writer Bruce Benderson began a search for its maker based on several leads and finally verified that it was James Bidgood, who was still living in Manhattan and was working on a film script. In 1999, a book researched and written by Benderson was published by Taschen about Bidgood&#x27;s body of photographic and filmic work.

Bidgood&#x27;s unmistakably kitschy style was later imitated and refined by artists such as Pierre et Gilles.

In 2003, the film was re-released by Strand Releasing as the film had its 35th anniversary in 2006.

== Music ==
* Joseph Haydn: &quot;Horn Concerto No. 1&quot;
* Modest Mussorgsky: &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;
* Modest Mussorgsky: &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;
* Sergei Prokofiev: &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;

<doc id="183552" wikidata="Q1901835" url="?curid=183552" title="Seat of government">
<text>The seat of government is (as defined by &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Politics&quot;) &quot;the building, complex of buildings or the city from which a government exercises its authority&quot;.

In most countries, the nation&#x27;s capital is also seat of its government, thus that city is appropriately referred to as the national seat of government. The terms are not however, completely synonymous, as some countries&#x27; seat of government differs from the capital. The Netherlands, for example, has Amsterdam as its capital but The Hague is the seat of government; and the Philippines, with Manila as its capital but the metropolitan area of the same name (Metro Manila; also known as National Capital Region (NCR)), is the seat of government.

==Local seats of government==
Local and regional authorities usually have a seat, called an administrative centre, as well. Terms for seats of local government of various levels and in various countries include:
* County seat (United States and Canada)
* County town (United Kingdom and Ireland)
* City hall/Town hall
* &quot;Barrio-pueblo&quot; (Puerto Rico)

==Buildings as seats of government==
Examples of seats of government include:
* Canada: The suite of buildings on or near Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario: the Centre Block (legislative seat), the Langevin Block (executive seat), and 301 Wellington Street (legislative seat).
* India: Three sites in Raisina Hill, New Delhi: the Parliament House (legislative seat), the Rashtrapati Bhavan, 7, Lok Kalyan Marg (executive seat), Supreme Court of India (judicial seat).
* Philippines: Four buildings in National Capital Region (NCR)/Metro Manila, Philippines: the GSIS Building in Pasay (Senate of the Philippines) and Batasang Pambansa Complex in Quezon City: House of Representatives of the Philippines (legislative seat), the Malacañang Palace (executive seat), and Supreme Court of the Philippines (judicial seat) in Manila.
* United Kingdom: Three sites in London: the Palace of Westminster (legislative seat), 10 Downing Street (executive seat), and Middlesex Guildhall (judicial seat). 
* United States: Three sites in Washington, D.C.: the United States Capitol (legislative seat), the White House (executive seat), and the United States Supreme Court Building (judicial seat).

==List of seats of country government which are not country capitals==
There are several countries where, for various reasons, the official capital and de facto seat of government are separated:
*Benin: Porto-Novo is the official capital, but Cotonou is the seat of government.
*Bolivia: Sucre is the constitutional capital, and the supreme tribunal of justice is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. The , the national congress and national electoral court are located in La Paz, making it the seat of government.
*Eswatini (Swaziland): Lobamba is the traditional, spiritual, and legislative capital city of Eswatini, seat of the Parliament, while the capital is Mbabane.
*Israel and Palestine: Jerusalem is considered by Israel to be the national capital since 1950 but was fully declared the undivided capital of the nation from 1980 according to the Jerusalem Law, though most government offices are located in West Jerusalem. This move is not recognized by the international community and thus the vast majority of embassies are located in Tel Aviv. In addition, the State of Palestine also declares East Jerusalem or the entirety of Jerusalem as its capital but the seat of government resides in Ramallah as does the Palestinian National Authority. (&quot;For more details see: Status of Jerusalem&quot;.)
*Ivory Coast: Yamoussoukro was designated the national capital in 1983, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Abidjan.
*Malaysia: Putrajaya the federal administrative centre of the Malaysia. The seat of government was shifted in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya because of overcrowding and congestion in the former.
*Montserrat: Its official capital is Plymouth, but it was permanently abandoned in 1997 after it was completely destroyed by the eruptions of the Soufrière Hills volcano. Since 1998 the &quot;de facto&quot; capital is Brades. The move was initially intended to be temporary, but it has remained the island&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; capital ever since. Several names have been suggested for the new official capital now being constructed in the Little Bay area.
*Netherlands: Amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the Dutch government, the parliament, the supreme court, the Council of State, and the work palace of the King are all located in The Hague, as are almost all the embassies. (&quot;For more details see: Capital of the Netherlands&quot;.)
*Sri Lanka: Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, commonly known as Kotte is the official administrative capital of Sri Lanka. It is a satellite city of and located within the urban area of Sri Lanka&#x27;s de facto economic and legislative capital, Colombo.
*Tanzania: Until 1974, Dar es Salaam served as Tanzania&#x27;s capital city, at which point the capital city commenced transferring to Dodoma, by order of then-president Julius Nyerere, which was officially completed in 1996. However, , it remained focus of central government bureaucracy, although this is in the process of fully moving to Dodoma.

===Countries with no official capital===
*Nauru: Yaren District (in earlier times Makwa/Moqua), is the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Nauru; the republic does not have an official capital.
*Switzerland: , no Swiss city holds an official status of national capital. In 1848, the Federal Assembly voted to locate the seat of government in Bern, but no official status was granted to the city. The city has since been informally referred to as &quot;Federal City&quot;.
*Republic of China (Taiwan): Since 7 December 1949, Taipei has been the provisional capital and the seat of government of the Republic of China after losing the Chinese Civil War. Although Nanjing had been claimed as the nominal capital of the country, its claims were downplayed in the 1990s.

===Historical examples===
*Federal Republic of Germany: Since German reunification in 1990 at the end of the Cold War and until 1999, Berlin was its capital and Bonn was the seat of government. However, the Berlin-Bonn Act specifies that many federal government institutions are to maintain a seat in Bonn indefinitely. Prior to reunification, the question as to what was the &quot;de jure&quot; capital was complicated by questions regarding the status of Berlin.
*Kingdom of England: The traditional capital was the City of London, while Westminster, outside of the boundaries of the City of London, was the seat of government. They are both today part of the urban core of Greater London.
*Kingdom of France: The traditional capital was Paris, though in the periods 1682–1789 and 1871–1879 the seat of government was at the Palace of Versailles, located southwest of Paris.

<doc id="183554" wikidata="Q1143096" url="?curid=183554" title="Cucoloris">
<text>In lighting for film, theatre and still photography, a cucoloris (occasionally also spelled cuculoris, kookaloris, cookaloris or cucalorus) is a light modifier (tool, device) for casting shadows or silhouettes to produce patterned illumination. It is normally referred to as a &quot;cookie&quot; or sometimes as a &quot;kook&quot; or a &quot;coo-koo&quot;. The cucoloris is used to create a more natural look by breaking up the light from a man-made source. It can be used to simulate movement by passing shadows or light coming through a leafy canopy.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word is opaque, bearing a number of plausible origins. Grant Barett, a co-host of the radio show &quot;A Way with Words&quot;, suggested that the phrase is an eponym of George Cukor. Moreover, a specious claim cited by &quot;Directing and Producing Television&quot; maintained that the term arose from the Greek &quot;kukaloris&quot;, breaking of light, &quot;loris&quot; conceivably cognate with &quot;luo&quot;, &#x27;I break&#x27;. Another possibility is an origin in the German word &quot;Kokolores&quot;, which can mean &quot;nonsense&quot; or &quot;boasting&quot;, like the English word &quot;Cockalorum&quot;.

==Overview==
Generally, cookies fall into three groups: hard cookies, made from thin plywood or heavy poster board with random shapes cut out of the body; soft cookies (often called &quot;celo&quot; cookies), made from plastic impregnated screen (the same screen one might find in a storm window), also with random shapes cut or burned out; and &quot;brancholorises&quot; or &quot;dingles&quot;, which are simply tree limbs or other available things that can be placed between the light and the subject.

Many &quot;old-school&quot; grips would say that any unnatural pattern used to create a shadow is a cookie.

Cucolorises are sometimes thought of as a subset of the gobo category. Cucolorises differ from standard gobos in that they are used farther away from the lighting instrument, and therefore do not need to be as heat resistant. Cuculorises generally produce softer edges than gobos.

A similar technique to using a cookie is simulated in 3D computer graphics, where using an alpha map as a cookie (sometimes called a &quot;light texture&quot;) to cast shadows on 3D objects is simulated by applying an alpha texture to an emitting light source in the 3D scene, typically a spot light type or a directional light type, to serve as a virtual cookie that projects shadows onto 3D object(s) by emitting light only through the transparent or translucent parts of the alpha texture, thus simulating the effect of a cucoloris as used in its real-world counterpart. This effect is commonly used in both 3D computer-generated animation and video games.

== History ==
Cinematographer George J. Folsey, ASC thus recounted the history: 
While shooting a scene with an actor who was wearing a white shirt, he wanted to separate the skin tones on the actor’s face from the hue of the shirt. Folsey told a grip to hold a stepladder in front of a key light to create a shadow on the actor’s shirt. The closer that the ladder was held to the light, the softer and less defined the shadow became. The grip eventually tired of holding the ladder, so he cut a grill with the same pattern in a sheet of light wood. One day, Folsey visited Hal Rosson, ASC, who was shooting on another set. In the scene, an actress was lying on a bed swathed in white sheets. Rosson used Folsey’s wooden grill to create some shadows, which made the scene more dramatic. Later, while shooting a similar situation, Rosson asked Folsey, “Where’s that kookaloris thing?”.

<doc id="183555" wikidata="Q158289" url="?curid=183555" title="Hypericum perforatum">
<text>Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St John&#x27;s wort (sometimes perforate St John&#x27;s wort or common St John&#x27;s wort), is a flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae. It is a perennial plant that grows up to tall, with many yellow flowers that have clearly visible black glands around their edges, long stamens (male reproductive organs), and three pistils (female reproductive organs). Probably a hybrid between the closely related &quot;H. attenuatum&quot; and &quot;H. maculatum&quot; (imperforate St John&#x27;s wort) that originated in Siberia, the species is now found worldwide. It is native to temperate regions across Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of North and South America. In many areas where it is not native, &quot;H. perforatum&quot; is considered a noxious weed. It densely covers open areas to the exclusion of native plants, and is poor grazing material. As such, methods for biocontrol have been introduced in an attempt to slow or reverse the spread of the species.

The species produces numerous chemical compounds that are highly active. These chemicals are harmful to large animals, especially sheep, and help to deter herbivores from consuming the plant. Other chemicals in the plant, such as hypericin and hyperforin, have various uses in medicine. St John&#x27;s wort has been used in traditional medicine since at least the first century AD, often as a cure-all or panacea. The oil from its glands can be extracted, or its above-ground parts can be ground into a powder called herba hyperici. In modern times, its use as an antidepressant has been the focus of numerous studies and clinical trials; however, the active ingredients can be very harmful or even lethal when taken alongside other medicines.

==Description==

&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is an herbaceous perennial plant with hairless (glabrous) stems and leaves. The root of each plant is slender and woody with many small, fibrous small side roots and also extensive, creeping rhizomes. The central root grows to a depth of into the soil depending on conditions. The crown of the root is woody.

Its stems are erect and branched in the upper section, and usually range from 0.3 metres to 1 metre in height. The stems are woody near their base and look like they have segmented joints from the scars left behind after the leaves fall off. The stems of &quot;H. perforatum&quot; are rusty-yellow to rosy in color with two distinct edges and usually have bark that sheds near the base. The stems persist through the winter and sprout new growth with flower buds in the following year; first year growth does not produce flowers.

It has leaves that attach on opposite sides of the stems without a stalk (sessile). The leaves vary in shape from being very narrow and almost grass-like (linear), to a rounded oval slightly wider at the base with a rounded tip or not much of a tip (elliptic), or even narrow with the widest portion towards the end of the leaf like a reversed lance point, but still long and narrow (oblanceolate). The principle leaves range in length from 0.8 to 3.5 centimetres and 0.31–1.6 centimetres in width. Leaves borne on the branches subtend the shortened branchlets. The leaves are yellow-green in color, with scattered translucent dots of glandular tissue. The dots are clearly visible when held up to the light, giving the leaves a perforated appearance. The edges (margins) of the leaves usually have scattered black dots, often called dark glands, though sometimes they will appear away from the edges. The odor of the plant is faint, but aromatic, resembling that of resins like balsam. The taste of the plant is bitter and acrid.

===Flowering characteristics===

The flowers are conspicuous and showy, measuring about across, and are bright yellow with black dots along the edges of the petals. Each of the flowers normally has five large petals and five smaller leaf-like sepals below them. The sepals are about in length, green in color, are shaped like the head of a spear (lanceolate shape) with a pointed tip, and the same clear and black glands as the leaves. The petals are significantly longer, in length, and have an oblong shape. They completely hide the sepals from the front side of the flower. The many bright yellow stamens are united at the base into three bundles. The stalk portion of the stamens, the filaments, vary in length and stick out in every direction from the center of the flower. The pollen grains are pale brown to orange in color.

The flowers are arranged along one side of each flowering stem with two flowers at each node (a helicoid cyme) at the ends of the upper branches, between late spring and early to mid-summer. Each flowering stem bears many flowers, between 25 and 100, and also is quite leafy.

The fruit of &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is a capsule in length containing the seeds in three valved chambers. Seeds that are separated from the capsules have a much higher germination rate due to an inhibiting factor in the capsule itself. The black and lustrous seeds are rough, netted with coarse grooves. Each seed is about in size. Each plant may produce an average of 15,000 to 34,000 seeds.

===Similar species===
&quot;Hypericum maculatum&quot; is visually similar to &quot;Hypericum perforatum;&quot; however, its stems have four ridges instead of two and are also hollow. In addition, its leaves have fewer translucent glands and more dark glands. &quot;H. maculatum&quot; is native to the Old World but has also been introduced to North America.

In North America several native species may be confused with &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;. &quot;Hypericum anagalloides&quot; is a low-growing creeping plant with rounder leaves and fewer stamens. &quot;Hypericum boreale&quot; is a smaller plant with more delicate flowers. &quot;Hypericum canadense&quot; has smaller flowers with sepals that show between the petals. &quot;Hypericum concinnum&quot; has flowers with petals that bend backward at the tip and also has much narrower, gray-green leaves. Growing in riparian areas along rivers, &quot;Hypericum ellipticum&quot; has wider leaves with a more elliptic shape. &quot;Hypericum scouleri&quot; has leaves that are broader at the base and also thicker. All except for &quot;H. concinnum&quot; grow in environments that are generally more moist than where &quot;H. perforatum&quot; is found.

=== Phytochemistry ===
The most common active chemicals in &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; are hypericin and pseudohypericin (naphthodianthrones), and hyperforin (a phloroglucinol derivative). The species contains a host of essential oils, the bulk of which are sesquiterpenes. In the wild, the concentrations of any active chemicals can vary widely among individual plants and populations.

Notes:
== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; was selected to be the type species around which the genus &quot;Hypericum&quot; is based because of its wide cosmopolitan distribution; it is the most common species of the genus in many of the areas it is found, and is one of the most widely known plants among the St John&#x27;s worts in folklore and medicine. The current accepted placement of &quot;H. perforatum&quot; within its genus can be summarized as follows:

&quot;Hypericum&quot;
: &quot;Hypericum&quot; subg. &quot;Hypericum&quot;
:: &quot;Hypericum&quot; sect. &quot;Hypericum&quot;
::: &quot;Hypericum&quot; subsect. &quot;Hypericum&quot;

::::: &quot;H. tetrapterum&quot;
::::: &quot;H. tosaense&quot;
::::: &quot;H. triquetrifolium&quot;
::::: &quot;H. undulatum&quot;

=== Phylogeny ===
&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; has a chromosome count of 2n = 32. The likely reason for this is that the species is a hybrid between the very closely related &quot;H. maculatum subsp. immaculatum&quot; and &quot;H. attenuatum,&quot; which means it inherited sets of chromosomes from both parents and is allopolyploid. The two species almost certainly hybridized within Siberia, Russia. The equation for this hybridization is:
Because of its hybrid origins, &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is one of the few species within its genus that is able to further hybridize with other species, specifically those within &quot;H.&quot; ser. &quot;Hypericum&quot;. The hybrids that are descended from &quot;H. perforatum&quot; can be triploid (3 sets of chromosomes) to hexaploid (6 sets), depending on the chromosome count of the second parent species and the ploidy of the specific &quot;H. perforatum&quot; gamete that is fertilized or is fertilizing. The triploid offspring exhibit and a mix of traits from the two parents and pass them on to their offspring; the tetraploids also have a mix of traits, but often do not pass on the traits of both parents; the pentaploids are rarely distinguishable from &quot;H. perforatum&quot;. Because of this, after many generations of hybridization a wide range of traits on a spectrum between the two hybridizing species can be observed in the wild.

=== Etymology and common names===
The genus name &quot;Hypericum&quot; is possibly derived from the Greek words (above) and (picture), in reference to the tradition of hanging the plant over religious icons in the home. The specific epithet &quot;perforatum&quot; is Latin and refers to the perforated appearance of the plant&#x27;s leaves.

The common name &quot;St John&#x27;s wort&quot; comes from the fact that its flowers and buds were commonly harvested at the time of the Midsummer festival, which was later Christianized as St John&#x27;s Feast Day on 24 June. It was believed that harvesting the flower at this time made its healing and magical powers more potent. The herb would be hung on house and stall doors on St John&#x27;s Feast Day to ward off evil spirits and to safeguard against harm and sickness to people and livestock. In other traditions it was burned in bonfires for the protection of crops along with other herbs believed to be magical. Because of its supposed potency in warding off spirits, the plant was also known as &quot;fuga daemonum&quot; (loosely &quot;demon-flight&quot;). Many other similarly fanciful names have been used for it including &quot;devil&#x27;s scourge&quot;, &quot;Lord God&#x27;s wonder plant&quot;, and &quot;witch&#x27;s herb&quot;. In medieval Kent it was called &quot;herbe Ion&quot; (Ion in this case referring to &quot;John&quot;) as recorded in the poem &quot;The Feate of Gardening&quot;. Other local names for &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; include &quot;balm of the warrior&#x27;s wound&quot; in Somerset, &quot;penny John&quot; in Norfolk, &quot;rosin rose&quot; in Yorkshire, and &quot;touch-and-heal&quot; in Northern Ireland. Locally in the United States, it may also be referred to as &quot;Tipton-weed&quot;, &quot;goatweed&quot;, or &quot;Klamath weed&quot;.

In the 21st century, any species of the genus &quot;Hypericum&quot; can be referred to as St John&#x27;s wort. Therefore, it is more accurate to call &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; the &quot;common St John&#x27;s wort&quot; or &quot;perforate St John&#x27;s wort&quot;.

=== History ===
&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; has been known and used since at least the first century. Pedanius Dioscorides, an early pharmacologist, referred to either it or &quot;H. empetrifolium&quot; as &quot;akuron&quot;. The species was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in the second tome of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. In it, he gave the following brief description that would serve as the foundation for all subsequent identification of the species:

Linnaeus also noted the species&#x27; habitat in the &quot;meadows of Europe&quot; and gave a short account of previous mentions of the plant. While Linnaeus&#x27; taxonomic priority for this species is not in question, there are a number of botanical synonyms that were published in the early years of formal botanical nomenclature. Gaterau published in 1789 which described and called the species &quot;Hypericum officinale&quot;, a name now considered to be illegitimate under the principle of priority. Likewise, the name &quot;Hypericum officinarum&quot; by the botanist Heinrich Johann Nepomuk von Crantz in 1763 also postdated Linnaeus&#x27; 1753 naming and description and is considered invalid.

=== Subdivision ===

&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; exhibits a great deal of variability in its appearance across its distribution. Thus, determining the exact nature of its infraspecific taxa is difficult because of the many intermediate forms that exist.
* &quot;H. perforatum&quot; subspecies &quot;perforatum&quot; is the type form of the species. It is distributed from the origin of the species in Siberia, west to central Europe, and east to northern Mongolia. The base changes as the plant grows from round to a broad wedge shape, and the seed capsule vittae are present throughout the plant&#x27;s life cycle and are almost always narrow.
** &quot;H. perforatum&quot; variety &quot;angustifolium&quot; is a variety of the species that is found in drier climates within the range of ssp. &quot;perforatum&quot;. It has leaves that look more like those of ssp. &quot;veronense&quot;, but they have leaf stalks; the glands on the seed capsule are also distinct.
** &quot;H. perforatum&quot; var. &quot;humile&quot; can be found in parts of the southern Balkans. These plants possess smaller, more ring-shaped leaves and the seed capsules have flattish vesicles on their surface. These appear to be adaptations of ssp. &quot;perforatum&quot; in response to the mountainous habitats of the region.
* &quot;H. perforatum&quot; ssp. &quot;songaricum&quot; is likely the most primitive after ssp. &quot;perforatum&quot;. Previously described as a variety by Karl Koch, Norman Robson elevated the taxon to subspecies in his monograph of the genus. The leaves are sessile and have a heart-shaped base that partially surrounds the stem.
** &quot;H. perforatum&quot; var. &quot;gracile&quot; has smaller leaves and is found in western Kazakhstan, southern Russia, and southern Ukraine. In the drier areas of this range the variety exhibits a dull grey-green color on the underside of its leaves.
* &quot;H. perforatum&quot; ssp. &quot;veronense&quot; can be found in the Caucasus, across the Middle East to Tajikistan, and along North Africa to Macaronesia. These plants have narrower leaves and display diagonal vittae on the seed capsules. Where it meets the distribution of ssp. &quot;perforatum&quot; the two subspecies hybridize regularly.
** &quot;H. perforatum&quot; var. &quot;ellipticum&quot; retains the diagonal vittae of the subspecies but the leaves are not as narrow. The variety is distributed in areas with greater moisture such as in the mountainous areas of Turkmenistan.
* &quot;H. perforatum&quot; ssp. &quot;chinense&quot; is found across most of China and was introduced into Japan (under the synonym &quot;H. foliosissimum&quot; ). Both its leaves and flowers are smaller, and the flower clusters are smaller and more crowded on the ends of longer branches.

==Distribution and habitat==
===Distribution===
&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is thought to be native to every nation in Europe, and is only absent from the far north such as north European Russia and Svalbard. It grows in parts of North Africa and is native to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Sudan.

In the Arabian Peninsula it only grows in parts of Saudi Arabia. It is present and native to all of the Western Asia phytogeographic region from the Aegean Islands and Turkey to Israel and Palestine in the west to Afghanistan in the east, only being absent from the Sinai Peninsula. Just to the east of this area it is also native to Pakistan and the western Himalaya region of India.

In the temperate parts of Asia, &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is mostly absent from Siberia with the exception of Western Siberia, the Altai Region, and the warmest parts of Krasnoyarsk Krai. It has also been introduced to Irkutsk and Buryatia. It is a native part of the flora of Central Asia, growing in all the former Soviet republics. It also is known in almost every part of the Caucasus. In China it is native to Xinjiang (in western China), central China, and southern China, but not to Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, or Tibet. In the far east of Asia it has been introduced to Primorye in Russia, Korea, and Japan.

In North America, it is found in all of the continental US states except for Utah, Arizona, Florida, and Alabama. It has been introduced throughout much of Canada, as well as in Hawaii, Cuba, and Haiti.

In South America, it is found in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, the Juan Fernández Islands, and the more temperate parts of Brazil in the southeast. In the southern parts of Africa it has become established in South Africa, Lesotho, and Réunion. In Australia it is found in the states of South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. It has been introduced to both the North and South Islands of New Zealand.

===Habitat===
The species can be found in a variety of habitats including open woods, meadows, grasslands, steppe, riverbanks, and stony or grassy hillsides and roadsides. It prefers dry habitats or areas with strong drainage. The species thrives in areas with at least of rainfall per year; however, its distribution is restricted by temperatures too low for seed germination or seedling survival: an absolute minimum of −3°C or an annual average of 9°C. Altitudes greater than , rainfall less than , and daily mean temperatures greater than are also considered limiting thresholds.

== Ecology ==
=== Reproduction ===

St John&#x27;s wort reproduces both vegetatively and sexually. Depending on environmental and climatic conditions, and the age of the plant, St John&#x27;s wort will alter the way it grows to promote survival. Summer rains are particularly effective in allowing the plant to grow vegetatively, following defoliation by insects or grazing. St John&#x27;s wort may also produce viable seeds without fertilization. Its seeds can persist for decades while lying dormant underground in an ecosystem&#x27;s soil seed bank, germinating after they are disturbed.

=== Diseases ===
&quot;H. perforatum&quot; is affected by phytoplasma diseases, and when infected with &quot;Candidatus&quot; phytoplasma fraxini it shows visible symptoms, including yellowing and deformities called witch&#x27;s broom. Its chemical profile is also altered: naphthodianthrone, flavonoid, amentoflavone, and pseudohypericin levels are reduced; chlorogenic acid levels are increased. Additionally, phytoplasma diseases greatly reduce the essential oil yield of the plant.

Dieback among populations of St John&#x27;s wort is also caused by fungal anthracnose, such as &quot;Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.&quot; This fungus causes the stems to lose their bark (girdling) and turn brown, and dries the aboveground parts of the plant. The infection often kills the plant within the first year of its growth, or reduces productivity over a three-year deterioration.

=== Role as a herbivore food source ===
Though &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is generally avoided by mammalian herbivores, a number of insects are dependent on it and its close relatives as a food source. &quot;Chrysolina quadrigemina&quot; and &quot;C. hyperici&quot; are two beetle species that feed on plants from the genus &quot;Hypericum&quot;, including &quot;H. perforatum&quot;. &quot;Chrysolina quadrigemina&quot; can be colored metallic blue, purple, green, or bronze and is better adapted to warm and dry climates; &quot;Chrysolina hyperici&quot; is consistently smaller, metallic green, and tends to live in areas with wetter and cooler conditions. Another &quot;Hyericum&quot; specialist beetle is &quot;Agrilus hyperici&quot;, the St John&#x27;s wort root borer, whose larvae feed on the roots of &quot;H. perforatum&quot; while the adults feed on the foliage.

A moth, &quot;Aplocera plagiata&quot;, feeds heavily upon the leaves of &quot;H. perforatum&quot; as a caterpillar and is commonly known as the common St John&#x27;s wort inchworm. As adults, they are a small moth with gray wings and dark gray bands. Another moth that feeds upon &quot;H. perforatum&quot; is &quot;Euspilapteryx auroguttella&quot;. Their caterpillars start by mining the inside of the leaves and later roll the leaves into cigar shapes to feed in greater safety. &quot;Agonopterix hypericella&quot; is another small () gray moth that exclusively feeds upon &quot;Hypericum&quot;.

&quot;Zeuxidiplosis giardi&quot;, the common St. Johnswort gall midge, is a small () fly that eats &quot;H. perforatum&quot; while developing. The larvae feed upon leaf buds, which causes the plant to form a round growth called a gall where the developing insect can feed, is protected, and pupates into a mature adult.

=== Toxicity ===
&quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; is toxic to numerous domestic animals such as cows, sheep, and horses. When these animals come into contact with the plant, usually through grazing, they develop serious symptoms. The first signs are reddening of the skin accompanied by swelling, which is followed by necrosis and sloughing of the skin. Non-pigmented, white skin is most affected by the poisoning, such as the nose and ears of certain breeds of sheep. Young animals are more susceptible to &quot;H. perforatum&quot; poisoning, and the plant is most toxic in spring (when it is the most palatable to herbivores) and retains its toxic effects when dried in hay. Additionally, affected animals will become highly photosensitive, and exposure to sunlight can exacerbate their symptoms. As such, they should be moved to a dark area; administering of antihistamines or anti-inflammatory medicines may also help alleviate the symptoms.

=== Invasiveness ===

Although &quot;H. perforatum&quot; is grown commercially in some regions of southeast Europe, it is listed as a noxious weed in more than 20 countries and has introduced populations in South and North America, India, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. In pastures, St John&#x27;s wort acts as both a toxic and invasive weed. It replaces native plant communities and forage vegetation to the extent of making productive land nonviable or becoming an invasive species in natural habitats and ecosystems.

Effective herbicides for control of &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; include 2,4-D, picloram, metsulfuron, and glyphosate. Insect herbivores have also been introduced as biocontrol agents in areas outside their native range. Some of the most widely used are &quot;Chrysolina quadrigemina&quot;, &quot;Chrysolina hyperici&quot;, &quot;Agrilus hyperici&quot;, &quot;Aplocera plagiata&quot;, and &quot;Zeuxidiplosis giardi&quot;.

== Uses ==
=== Traditional medicine ===

Common St John&#x27;s wort has been used in herbalism for centuries. It was thought to have medical properties in classical antiquity and was a standard component of ancient concoctions called theriacs, from the Mithridate of Aulus Cornelius Celsus&#x27; ( CE) to the Venice treacle of in 1686. One folk use included the oily extract known as St John&#x27;s oil, a red, oily liquid extracted from &quot;H. perforatum&quot; that may have been a treatment for wounds by the Knights Hospitaller, the Order of St John. Another part of the plant that is used is the dried flower structure, which is crushed to make the medicine known as herba hyperici.

=== Medical research ===
==== Antidepressant properties====

Hyperforin, a phytochemical produced by St John&#x27;s wort, may be responsible for the plant&#x27;s antidepressant properties.
Some studies and research reviews have supported the efficacy of St John&#x27;s wort as a treatment for depression in humans. A 2015 meta-analysis review concluded that it has superior efficacy to placebo in treating depression, is as effective as standard antidepressant pharmaceuticals for treating depression, and has fewer adverse effects than other antidepressants. The authors concluded that it is difficult to assign a place for St John&#x27;s wort in the treatment of depression owing to limitations in the available evidence base, including large variations in efficacy seen in trials performed in German-speaking countries relative to other countries. A 2008 Cochrane review of 29 clinical trials concluded that it was superior to placebo in patients with major depression, as effective as standard antidepressants and had fewer side-effects. A 2016 review noted that use of St John&#x27;s wort for mild and moderate depression was better than placebo for improving depression symptoms, and comparable to antidepressant medication. A 2017 meta-analysis found that St John&#x27;s wort had comparable efficacy and safety to SSRIs for mild-to-moderate depression and a lower discontinuation rate. According to the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, St John&#x27;s wort appears to be more effective than placebo and as effective as standard antidepressant medications for mild and moderate depression, and that it is uncertain whether this is true for severe depression or for longer than 12 weeks.

In the United States, St John&#x27;s wort is considered a dietary supplement by the FDA, and is not regulated by the same standards as a prescription drug. In China, St John&#x27;s wort combined with &quot;Eleutherococcus senticosus&quot; is sold as an antidepressant under the name (), according to the &quot;Pharmacopoeia of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;. The pharmacopoeia states that it is used &quot;for mild to moderate unipolar depression&quot;. In some European nations, the use of &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot; for medicinal purposes is restricted because of its classification as a drug.

====Inability to treat cancer====
There is no clinical evidence that St John&#x27;s wort is effective to treat cancer. The National Cancer Institute has commented that &quot;the FDA has not approved the use of St. John’s wort as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition&quot;. St John&#x27;s wort may reduce the efficacy of chemotherapy.

==== Interactions with drugs and other side effects ====
St John&#x27;s wort can interfere (in potentially life-endangering ways) with the effects of prescription and over-the-counter drugs. It mainly does this by increasing CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes in the liver, leading to faster conversion of drugs. Specific consequences include reduction in the effectiveness of medicines like oral contraceptives, heart medications, HIV drugs, cancer medications, and some anticoagulants; breakthrough bleeding when taking oral contraceptives; and decreased effectiveness of immunosuppressants in those who have had organ transplants.

The increase in these enzymes have been found to be caused by high hyperforin content; consumption of St John&#x27;s wort products with minimal hyperforin causes fewer side effects and less interference. However, the concentration of St John&#x27;s wort&#x27;s constituent chemicals (including hyperforin) can vary widely between different products, and their dosage may not be properly marked on packaging.

The most common side effects of St John&#x27;s wort products (besides drug interactions) are stomach pain, fatigue, and restlessness. Other more rare effects include photosensitivity and skin irritation. Photosensitivity is linked to hypericin content.

===Dyeing pigment===

The plant generally produces a variety of yellows suitable for dyeing. When the pigments are extracted using ethanol, a violet-red colour is made which can be used to dye silk and wool when rinsed in vinegar. The colours produced are season-dependent.

The flowers produce a series of four different shades on wool, if used in the correct sequence. Wool mordanted with alum and unmordanted wool is used. The flowers are simmered to produce a deep red liquid dye. The alum-mordanted wool skein is added and simmered until green is made. If unmordanted wool is added to the same dye, it will turn reddish-maroon. The final colour produced is by continuing the method, to produce yellow or gold.

<text>The following are current and former trains in the Netherlands.

==In use==
===Diesel locomotives===

* 600 Class: Traditional shunter used in the Netherlands &amp; UK. They are still used at Crailoo (between Bussum and Hilversum) by Railpro.
* V60D: Ex Czech Railways shunting locomotives.
* V 100: Ex German locomotives operated by VolkerRail, Alstom, Rotterdam Rail Feeding and Captrain.
* 700 Class: Vossloh G400B locomotives in use by Nederlandse Spoorwegen, Train Charter Services and Strukton.
* 6400 Class: A locomotive used for both shunting and pulling trains by DB Cargo. Some are permitted to operate in Belgium (called &quot;Vlaamse Reuzen&quot;) and some in Germany (called &quot;Duitse Herders&quot;). Many are sold abroad.
* Class 66: European version of the UK Class 66 locomotives used by various freight companies.
* Vossloh G1206: Locomotives used by a number of private freight and infrastructure companies.
* Vossloh G2000 BB: Locomotives used by Lineas, Rotterdam Rail Feeding and Rail Force One.

===Electric locomotives===

* 1200 Class: These locomotives are former NS locomotive; They are operated by Railexperts for charter trains.
* 1600 Class and 1800 Class: These two types of locomotives are the same, the 1800 series got renumbered from 1600 after the partial privatisation of the NS. The 1600 are used by a number of freight companies. The 1800 were used by NS Reizigers. They are stil used by Railexperts and Rail Force One.
* 1700 Class: This locomotive is very similar to the 1600/1800 in appearance but technically different. They were frequently used in combination with DD-AR/DDM until late 2019 and the Intercity between Amsterdam and Berlin until late 2023. Currently they are operated by Volkerrail, Strukton and Train Charter Services.
* Plan mP (Motorpost): These are the trains formerly used to distribute mail. Currently they have various tasks such as measuring rails or locate gps.
* 186 Class: Since 2008, 14 TRAXX F140 AC2 locomotives have been leased by NS from Alpha Trains for operations on the HSL-Zuid. They are painted yellow with blue. The NS ordered 45 of these locomotives for use on high speed services; deliveries of these started in the Summer of 2014. The 186 is also used by a large number of freight companies.
* 189 Class: Certain locomotives of DB Cargo Class 189 are operating primarily in the Netherlands, they are distinguished by large white contrast areas on the front sides (otherwise painted red). These are also used by many private freight operators.
* Siemens Vectron: Certain locomotives of DB Cargo, Nederlandse Spoorwegen and other operators operating primarily in the Netherlands, being used for the NightJet and many freight services across the country.

===Diesel multiple units===

* Lint 41 are DMUs used by Arriva. Used on the Zutphen – Hengelo – Oldenzaal and Almelo - Hardenberg services.
* Stadler GTW are DMUs used by Arriva and Breng. They replaced the Wadlopers and Buffels. Arriva uses them in the north of the Netherlands on the diesel lines out of Groningen to Delfzijl, Rodeschool, Nieuwschans (and Leer) and Leeuwarden. They also operate out of Leeuwarden to Harlingen and Stavoren. Since 2012 Arriva also uses them on the Arnhem – Tiel, – Winterswijk, Winterswijk – Zutphen and Zutphen – Apeldoorn services. And since 2016 Arriva uses them on the Roermond – Venlo and Venlo – Nijmegen services. Breng uses these units between Arnhem and Doetinchem.

===Electric multiple units===
====High-speed services====

*The ICE 3M is a Dutch-German high-speed train that runs between Amsterdam and Arnhem in the Netherlands, onto Frankfurt and Cologne in Germany and Basel in Switzerland. ICE trains require special high-speed tracks to run at high speeds, but can also run on normal tracks at normal speeds.
*The Thalys PBA and Thalys PBKA are used for Thalys services to Paris and Lille. Thalys is a high-speed train network built around the high-speed line between Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. This track is shared with Eurostar trains that go from Paris or Brussels to London via Lille and the Channel Tunnel and with French domestic TGV trains. The system uses two models of trains, the PBA and the PBKA, which both belong to the TGV (&quot;train à grande vitesse&quot;) family of high-speed trains built by Alstom in France, although they are not identical to domestic TGV sets. Beyond Brussels, the main cities Thalys trains reach are Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Liège, Aachen and Cologne. Trains to these destinations run partly on dedicated high-speed tracks and partly on regular tracks. Since the completion of Dutch high speed line (the HSL-Zuid) the Thalys travels from Amsterdam to Schiphol, to Rotterdam and via Breda to Antwerp in Belgium.
* The British Rail Class 374 operated by Eurostar which began operating in the Netherlands on 4 April 2018. Eurostar is a high-speed railway service connecting London with Amsterdam, Avignon, Brussels, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Paris and Rotterdam. All its trains traverse the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France, owned and operated separately by Getlink.

====Intercity services====

*The Koploper (ICM) (&quot;Intercitymaterieel&quot;) is a 3- or 4-car multiple unit that when coupled with another one, allowed passengers to walk through (the name &quot;Koploper&quot; being a play on words – literally &quot;head walker&quot;, but in actual use meaning &quot;front runner&quot;). NS decided to close the doors permanently on 31 October 2005 because the mechanism broke down too often.
A scheduled modernisation of around 7 million euro will see the ICM fleet updated. The renovated ICM trains provide 13% more seats, have a new interior, a bathroom accessible by wheelchairs, airconditioning as well as upgrades to the engine and connection systems. The head doors are removed. Also, these (renovated) trains are the first trains in the NS fleet equipped with OBIS. OBIS provides a (free) WiFi-connection on board, along with in-train journey information provided through screens and (automated) vocal announcements through the trains speakers. This journey information provides the actual status, and thus, it is always up-to-date to the actual situation on its trips, and the stations it passes.

*The DDZ (&quot;Dubbeldekker zonering&quot;) (go to DUTCH page ) EMUs are converted from DDM-2/3 resembling the bilevel rail cars series DDM-1 from 1985 and operates in fixed formations of 4 or 6 coaches. All trains use an mDDM motorcar for traction, which resembles a DD-AR driving trailer but has electric motors and a single passenger deck on top; the level of this deck is higher than that of a regular single deck rail car, but lower than the upper deck of the other coaches.

*The VIRM (&quot;Verlengd Interregiomaterieel&quot;), also called Regiorunner was partially rebuilt from trainsets DD-IRM (&quot;Dubbeldeks Interregiomaterieel&quot;). DD-IRM was delivered in 3- and 4-car trainsets. 3-car trainsets got one extra coach, 4-car trainsets got two extra coaches. Also, new 4- and 6-car trainsets were built. Thus, a train consists of one or more combinations of 4 or 6 double deck coaches; each combination (multiple unit) has electric motors. More than three hundred coaches are currently operative in the Netherlands.

*The ICNG (&quot;Intercity Nieuwe Generatie&quot;) is operated by NS as of 2023.

====Local services====

*The PROTOS is a train which was built by Fahrzeugtechnik Dessau for the Valleiljn. There are 5 units of them in use with Keolis.
*The Sprinter Lighttrain or SLT is a new (2007 onwards) 4 or 6 car unit, built partly to replace Mat &#x27;64 stock. There are 131 of them. They do not have a toilet. For this reason further orders have been cancelled. Building toilets into the existing trains had been considered during the building phase, but it was judged to be too expensive. At this moment toilets are being built in to these trains.
*The electric Stadler GTW is operated by Arriva for services on electrified lines in South Limburg, together with the Stadler FLIRT. The other services of Arriva in Limburg are on non-electrified lines, and are operated by the diesel Stadler GTW. As of 9 December 2018, it&#x27;s also operated by Qbuzz on the MerwedeLingeLijn between Dordrecht and Geldermalsen.
*The Stadler FLIRT is operated by Arriva, Keolis Nederland, NS and NS R-Net
*The Sprinter New Generation or SNG is operated by NS since 9 December 2018, which is built by CAF Civity.

===Coaches===
*The railroad cars ICRm (&quot;Intercity Rijtuig&quot; = intercity carriage) were rebuilt from ICR coaches and now operate as trainsets on the high-speed line with a locomotive Class186 at both ends.
*Koninklijk rijtuig (Dutch for Royal Carriage): a modified ICR.

==Out of service==
===Steam locomotives===
* Arend: (Dutch for &quot;eagle&quot;) was the first locomotive in the Netherlands and pulled the first train between Amsterdam and Haarlem in 1839.
* Series 600: Formerly SS (Staats Spoorwegen) 255-260. Built 1866 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in Manchester. Originally built as 2-4-2 engines, but rebuilt as 0-4-2s to allow them to do shunting.
* Series 700: A class of 2-4-0 passenger engines. This class was also built in 1866 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, and renumbered after HSM (Hollandische IJzeren Spoorweg Maatschappij) and SS began to cooperate. It is considered one of the most beautiful locomotive types in the Netherlands. It was taken out of service in 1933. Formerly SS 1II-5II, 9-78, and NBDS (Noord Brabant Duitse Spoorweg) 1-5.
* Series 1300 (&#x27;Grote Groenen&#x27;): A class of 2-4-0 engines built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company from 1880 to 1895. They were nicknamed &#x27;Grote Groenen&#x27; or &#x27;Big Green&#x27;. It was designed for fast passenger and mail service over the SS lines to Germany, which competed with the NBDS and the HSM. These locomotives could pull a 15-coach train at 50 mph (75 km/h), when well fueled, which was fast for the time.
* Series 1500: was a series of high-speed train locomotives of the Dutch Railways (NS) and its predecessors Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (SS) and Nederlandsche Centraal-Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NCS).
* Series 1600 (&#x27;Rhijnboog&#x27;): A class of 4-4-0 engines built by Sharp Stewart from 1889 to 1903. These were the first engines in the Netherlands to use bogies, and were nicknamed &#x27;Rhijnboog&#x27; or &#x27;Rhine Arch&#x27;. When the SS took over the NRS (Nederlandse Rhijn Spoorweg), this class was split between the SS and the HSM. The SS sold their locomotives to the HSM because their turntables were too short. Formerly NRS 101-109, or later HSM 350-408.
* Series 1700 (&#x27;Overkoker&#x27;): A larger class of 4-4-0 engines built to pull the fast passenger services, which continued to increase in weight. These locomotives were nicknamed &#x27;Overkoker&#x27;, or &#x27;Boil Over&#x27;. Formerly SS 801-935.
* Series 2000: The first 4-4-2 (Atlantic) engines in the country, built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1900. This class was designed to pull the increasingly heavy mail trains from Vlissingen to Boxtel. Formerly SS 995-999.
* Series 2100: A class of 4-4-0 passenger trains built by Schwartzkopff between 1914 and 1920. At the time this class was built, the SS had recently bought a class of 4-6-0s (SS 700s/NS 3700s), and the HSM didn&#x27;t want to stay behind. They had to use 4-4-0s due to the length of the turntables, however. Formerly HSM 501-535.
* Series 2800: These were the first 0-6-0 freight engines on the NRS. They were built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company from 1865 to 1881. After the NRS was bought out, the engines were divided between the HSM and the SS. By the time the NS was formed, only the SS engines came into service.
* Series 2900 (&#x27;Driemaster&#x27;): A class of 0-6-0 freight engines built by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company between 1865 and 1878. They were nicknamed &#x27;Driemaster&#x27; or &#x27;Three-master&#x27;, as they were the first six-coupled freight engines built in the country. Originally owned by the SS.
* Series 3200 (&#x27;Kamer en suite&#x27;): A class of 0-6-0s designed for goods trains, built by Sharp Stewart and Werkspoor between 1895 and 1907. They quickly became the standard class for such work, and were nicknamed &#x27;Kamer en suite&#x27;/&#x27;Room en suite&#x27;, possibly due to their large cabs. Formerly HSM 601-647.
* Series 3300: Following the freight locomotives HSM 601-647 with three coupled axles from the years 1895-1907 the HSM ordered at Werkspoor about fifteen similar freight locomotives, now with superheater. These were delivered in the years 1912 (HSM 671-675), 1914 (HSM 676-680) and 1915 (HSM 681-685). The locomotives were excellent.
* Series 3500: In 1907, the NBDS was the first railway company in the Netherlands to order express train locomotives with the axle layout 2&#x27;C, which were delivered by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1908 and were put into service with the numbers 30-35. The larger companies Nederlandsche Centraal-Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NCS) and SS only arrived two years later with such express train locomotives, the NCS 71-78, later NS 3600 and SS 700, later NS 3700.
*Series 3700 (&#x27;Jumbo&#x27;): The NS 3700 series was a series of 120 4-6-0 (2&#x27;C) express steam locomotives from the Dutch Railways. Ordered by the SS and later also the NS. The locomotive were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company, Werkspoor, Henschel &amp; Sohn, Hanomag and Schwartzkopff between 1910 and 1928.
* Series 3900 (&#x27;Grote Jumbo&#x27;): The NS 3900 series was a series of express train steam locomotives from the Dutch Railways. At the end of the 1920s, the Dutch Railways needed an express train locomotive that was stronger than the 3700 series, because more and more wooden passenger cars were replaced by steel. In the meantime the axle load could also be increased from 16 tons to 18 tons. This resulted in a design that looked at both series 3600 and 3700, so with an axis division of 2 °C. The 3900 series was given the rod or bar frame of the 3600, but in terms of the design of the boiler, cylinders and operator&#x27;s house, it appeared to be an enlarged 3700, but with a more powerful boiler and cylinders with a diameter of 420 mm instead of 400 mm. With this, both the pulling power and the power increased by about 15 percent. The same boiler would later be used in the tender locomotive 6300. The tender was roughly the same as that of the 3600 series and the later-built 4-axle tenders of the 3700 series. The series was able to quickly carry the heaviest passenger trains at a speed of 100 km/h. The manufacturer, the German factory Henschel &amp; Sohn, delivered the locomotives in two series in 1929 and 1930. The first series of 22 locomotives from 1929 (3901-3922) was initially not equipped with wind deflectors to prevent the wind from blowing the smoke. The chimney would blow into the operator&#x27;s view. These were applied in 1930. The second series of ten locomotives (3923-3932) was supplied with wind deflectors immediately upon delivery.
* Series 4000: The NS 4000 series was a series of fast train steam locomotives in service with the Dutch Railways from 1945 to 1956.
* Series 4300 (II) (&#x27;Kleine Jeep&#x27; / &#x27;Dakota&#x27;) (ex-WD Austerity 2-8-0)
* Series 4500-4600:In 1914 the NBDS ordered four freight locomotives at Hohenzollern in Düsseldorf-Grafenberg with the intended numbers 118-121. Due to the outbreak of World War I in 1915, delivery was delayed. It was not until 1917 that the 118 was delivered, followed by the 119 in 1918. In 1919 the NBDS merged into the SS, where the locomotives 118 and 119 received the SS numbers 1301 and 1302. The locomotives delivered in 1920 came directly into service with the SS numbers 1303 and 1304.
* Series 4700 (&#x27;Kerstboom&#x27;): Already in World War II, the Dutch government ordered 50 steam locomotives in London at the Swedish factory Nydqvist &amp; Holm AB (NOHAB) in Trollhättan to quickly bring the fleet of locomotives greatly reduced by warfare. To save time, they opted for existing models of typically Swedish locomotives. This involved 15 express train locomotives with the axle layout 2&#x27;C and 35 freight locomotives with the axle layout D. The express train locomotives were divided into the NS 4000 series and the freight locomotives in the NS 4700 series.
* Series 5000
* Series 5000 (II) (&#x27;Grote Jeep&#x27;) (ex-WD Austerity 2-10-0)
* (&#x27;Bok&#x27;)
* Series 6100
* Series 6200
* Series 6300
* Series 6500
* Series 6700

===Diesel locomotives===

* 100 Class: The &quot;oersik&quot; was designed by the NS Service of Rolling Stock and Workshops and built by Berliner Machinenbau A.G. Due to the broad and low mounted footboards the enginedriver could easily mount and dismount. 
* 200 Class: &quot;Sik&quot;. A light shunting locomotive. Some Sikken had a crane.
* 400 Class: &quot;Grote Sik&quot; locomotives were not in service for long as they were too light for steadily increasing weight of the shunting duties. They were built after War by Werkspoor
* 500 Class and 600 Class: nicknamed &quot;Hippel&quot; or &quot;Bakkie&quot;. These are shunting locomotive currently not in use with the NS any more although a few have been sold to other companies.
* Series 700
* NS Class 2000: These locomotives were bought from the American Army after World War 2 and came into service as series 600. 20 locomotives were in use, some of them were reserve. After a few years the American engines were replaced by Werkspoor-Engines due to a lack of spareparts. The series was then renumbered to 2000. Between 1958 and 1960 most were scrapped.
* 2200 Class: Widely used diesel locomotive. Built by two consortiums in the Netherlands and France, based on the Baldwin VO-1000 design. Later some were used in Belgium for the construction of the high-speed connection between Netherlands and Belgium.
* 2400 Class: Widely used diesel locomotive. Later some were used in France for the construction of the high-speed lines. A special version of this locomotive exists called &quot;De Bisschop&quot; (2530). It had a higher constructed cab as experiment. Because of the purple colour it is nicknamed &quot;The Bishop&quot;.
* 2600 Class: The NS series 2600 &quot;Beel&quot; diesel locomotives were built by Werkspoor in Utrecht in 1958. They were mainly used on the Eindhoven – Venlo line and later on Nijmegen – Roermond as well. These locomotives were underpowered for their size, which led to them being used in pairs so that if one failed the second could take over. Their nickname &quot;Beel&quot; was given because their high front end resembled the forehead of Dutch minister Louis Beel. They were withdrawn and scrapped after only 5 years of service.
* 2800 Class: &quot;Kreupele Marie&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Crippled Marie&quot;). This prototype diesel locomotive, no. 2801, was designed by Matériel de Traction Diesel Electrique (MTDE) and built by Werkspoor in Utrecht in 1962. This firm was established by the Dutch Werkspoor and French Schneiderworks with the purpose of designing and building standardised diesel lokomotives. In 1962 the prototype came into NS service and was well known for its defects; hence it was given its nickname. It was withdrawn in 1970.
* 2900 Class: This diesel locomotive was purchased by NS from the Statemines (series 151-155) for &quot;Spoorslag &#x27;70&quot;. They were not long in service with NS, after a few years they were sold to the FEVE in Spain.
*6700 Class: Former Belgian locomotive bought by ACTS.

===Electric locomotives===
* 1000 Class: Based on a Swiss locomotive. One is still in existence in the National Rail Museum in Utrecht, the Nederlands Spoorwegmuseum.
* 1100 Class: Based on the French Class BB 8100 locomotives. After a serious accident, the locomotives were equipped with a new nose.
* Benelux 1100 Class: These are Belgian locomotives that were used for the Benelux push-pull trains in combination with ICR carriages.
* 1300 Class: Based on the French Class CC 7100 locomotives. This six axles locomotives were mainly used for freight trains.
* 1500 Class: These are former British Rail Class 77 locomotives. The seven locomotives were purchased to relieve a shortage of locomotives in 1969. Locomotive no. 1501 is preserved in the Dutch Railway Museum; with 1502 &amp; 1505 preserved in the UK.

===Diesel multiple units===

* Mat &#x27;34: The very first series of streamlined multiple units of the NS were designed by Beijnes of Haarlem and were called the Mat &#x27;34, also nicknamed &quot;Diesel Three&quot;. The streamlined form was developed during numerous trials at the Zeppelin Luftschiffahrt Gesellschaft in Friedrichshafen. The maximum speed was 140 km/h.
* DE-5: The NS dieselelectric five-car unit series DE 5 was built for fast-train services and foreign services. For this purpose they had large fueltanks sufficient for about 2000 km. The war, however, made these services impossible. In 1940 during a trialrun a speed of 172 km/h was reached. They were built by Werkspoor in Utrecht, Beijnes in Haarlem and Allan in Rotterdam; Brown Boveri from Switzerland provided the electric equipment and Maybach supplied the diesel engines.
* DE1: Nicknamed &quot;Blauwe Engel&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Blue Angel&quot;): A DMU consisting of one coach.
* DE2: A DMU consisting of 2 coaches. It was very similar to the DE 1
* DE3 or Plan U: Nicknamed &quot;Rooie Duivel&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Red Devil&quot;) because of its original red livery this was a diesel electric multiple unit consisting of three coaches. The design was rather similar to the Mat &#x27;64 EMU (electric multiple unit). Some units were sold to Slovakia.
* DE4&quot; or &quot;DE-IV: The NS DE-IV TEE 1001–1003 and SBB RAm 501–502 TEE DMUs were used for international Trans Europ Express (TEE) service.
* NS DE-20: nicknamed &quot;De Kameel&quot; (Dutch for &quot;The Camel&quot;). Originally it was in service as DMU for the board of directors, later it was for hire. Currently it is in the national railroad museum.
* DH1 and DH2: Nicknamed &quot;Wadlopers&quot; these are a diesel hydraulic multiple unit, operated in the North of the Netherlands by Arriva. There are two versions, one with two coaches, the other with one coach. One of the Wadlopers is re-painted in green, most remained yellow. These trains were used by Veolia on the &#x27;Maaslijn&#x27; Nijmegen-Roermond. After their replacement by new trains the Wadlopers were decommissioned. The majority of the wadloper-fleet was sold to Poland, Argentina and Uruguay.
* omBC 2900: A DMU that was used in 1901–1903
*Buffel (DM&#x27;90) were the last diesel trains still operated by NS. They were evidently used on the secondary diesel lines, namely Zwolle – Enschede and Zwolle – Kampen. As of 11 December 2017 their services were replaced by electric Stadler FLIRT&#x27;s after the electrification of those railway lines. One unit (3426) has become a museum train.

===Electric multiple units===

* Mat &#x27;24: In 1924, two prototype EMUs were delivered to NS, one by Werkspoor and the other by Beijnes. Both had the train composition mBD+Bec+Aec+Cec+mC. The Cecs were built by Hawa in Hanover. The Mat &#x27;24, nicknamed &#x27;Blokkendoos&#x27;, were especially for the services on the Old Line Amsterdam–Rotterdam which was electrified with 1500 V DC in this period. The third mBD5 was already delivered in 1924. Mat &#x27;24 series was built between 1923 and 1932.
* Mat &#x27;35: The first streamlined electric multiple units of NS Mat &#x27;35. They were nicknamed &#x27;Hoek van Hollanders&#x27; because they were used between Rotterdam and Hook of Holland. Eight units were built: 4 with and 4 without luggage-section. They were built by Werkspoor, Beijnes en Allan and consisted of 2 coaches.
* Mat &#x27;36: This is practically the same as the Mat &#x27;35 EMU. They were built by Werkspoor in 1937–8. Versions existed consisting of two, three or four coaches.
* Mat &#x27;40: The two- and five-car version of Mat &#x27;40 &quot;Gooimaterieel&quot; so-called because the planned deployment on Amsterdam–Amersfoort although they hardly ever used on this line. There were designed for speeds up to 160 km/h and built by Beijnes in Haarlem and Werkspoor in Utrecht between 1942 and 1944. This series was very similar to the Mat &#x27;35 series as well.
*Mat &#x27;46: The NS Mat &#x27;46s were ordered to compensate for war-lost EMUs. This series had some differences compared to its predecessors: a convergent shaped front and sliding doors in the luggagecompartment. There are versions consisting of two and four coaches. From a technical viewpoint a four-car EMU consists of two two-car EMUs. They were built by Allan, Beijnes and Werkspoor between 1949 and 1952.
*Mat &#x27;54: NS Mat &#x27;54 &quot;Hondekop&quot; (Dognose) series was extremely solidly constructed, resulting in a heavy weight. The running characteristics are very good, the trains sticks to the rails as if it is made of concrete. Calculating weight per seat (888 kg), Mat &#x27;54 is the heaviest of its kind ever built in Europe. From the beginning, much attention was paid to the workplace of the driver. The series were built by Allan of Rotterdam between 1956 and 1958. Two versions existed, consisting of two, or four coaches. To modernise the Benelux-service (Amsterdam–Brussels) and the finishing of the electrification between Roosendaal and Essen, 12 EMU were built that these EMU run in multiple unit with existing EMUs. The EMU can run under 1500 V DC and 3000 V DC. In cooperation with the NMBS the following was decided: mechanically of the same construction as the NS Mat &#x27;54 and the electrical installation would be a Belgian one. On the ABk is the 1500 V DC pantograph, on the BDk the 3000 V DC one.
*SM&#x27;90 (Stoptreinmaterieel 90): The SM&#x27;90 EMUs (railhopper) ran on the line Zwolle – Emmen. Only 9 prototype trainsets were built as the intended successor to Mat &#x27;64. Due to engine and airco failing and an increase in the number of passengers, NS chose to buy more DDM coaches. In the early years of their service, the trainsets were ridden with trouble. All 9 trainsets have been taken out of service in December 2005 and were demolished.
*Mat&#x27;64: Plan TT (build 1960), Plan T (build 1964-1965) And the recently taken out of service Plan V (build 1966 - 1976). Build by Werkspoor in Utrecht and later by Talbot in Aachen, these trains were used primarily as stoptrains, although they could were also used as intercity&#x27;s sometimes. They were unofficially called &quot;Apekop&quot; or &quot;monkeyhead&quot; because of its characteristic nose at the front and rear. These EMU&#x27;s were very solid, and proved to be essential during the harsh winters when newer trains could not be used effectively. MAT&#x27;64 was slowly replaced by the Sprinter Lighttrain from the late 2000s onwards. The last Plan T was taken out of service in July 2010 and the last plan V was taken out of service on 4 April 2015. Several units have been saved from becoming scrap. One unit is now owned by the national railway museum in Utrecht.
*The V250 was a high-speed train operated as Fyra used for high-speed services. This train served the cities Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Brussels in Belgium or vice versa and serves as their terminus and the cities of Rotterdam and Breda along their routes. Today, all units are now sent back to Italy.(See parent page for details)

*The Sprinter (SGM, &quot;Stads Gewestelijk Materieel&quot;) is a two or three car EMU, used on small distances. They are named Sprinter because they&#x27;re able to accelerate and brake quite fast, making them very suitable for &#x27;sprinter&#x27; services. They were also specifically designed for urban environments where they run commuter services. As a result, they are most commonly found in the Randstad area. The initial idea was that the Sprinter would provide somewhat of a subway/metro service but this plan failed as the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam continued to construct their own rapid transit systems. Nevertheless, in the densely populated Randstad, the Sprinters remain popular. Two car versions were revised and renamed to Citypendel. All Sprinters are now refurbished into the new white/yellow/dark blue livery. They were retired in 2021.
===Coaches===
* HSM C:The series C11 701-799, 1501-1535 was a series of 135 wooden third-class compartment cars. The coaches were built on behalf of the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij (HSM) and were transferred to the Dutch Railways at the merger in 1921. The last carriages of this series served until 1956.
*&quot;Ovalenramen Rijtuig&quot;:The ovaleramen rijtuigen (&quot;oval window-coaches&quot;) were three series of carriages, built between 1928 and 1931 for the Dutch Railways. The first delivery consisted of nine coaches with first and second class (AB 7201-7209) and six coaches with third class (C 7201-7206) in 1928. In 1930 a follow-up order of another twelve carriages with first and second class (AB) followed. 7210-7221), which was delivered in 1930 and 1931. These carriages deviated from the earlier carriages in a number of small points.
*Stalen Couper Rijtuig:The steel compartment carriages were a series of a total of 85 carriages that entered service with the Dutch Railways in the early 1930s. Only third-class coaches of this type have been built so that they always join other coaches. Originally these wagons drove together with first / second class coaches D-train carriages.
*Stalen P or &quot;Steel P&quot;: The steel postal coaches, also known by the nickname Steel Post or Steel P, is a former series of postal carriages of the Dutch Railways. These coaches were used in international trains from 1931 to 1964.
*Stalen D-treinrijtuigen:The steel D-train carriages were a series of carriages for mainly international rail connections. The carriages were built by Werkspoor for the Dutch Railways in the early 1930s. The carriages were characterized by a partial first and partial second class.
*Bolkoprijtuig:The chariot props were a series of railway carriages that were built between 1935 and 1958 for the Dutch Railways. There are four series to distinguish: the pre-war coaches, and the post-war Plan D, Plan C and Plan K.
*Stroomlijnpostrijtuig: For postal transport in Dutch trains, in the thirties, forties and fifties the stream line cars, type Pec [1], were built. These postal carriages were intended to be coupled with multiple units, and were therefore equipped with automatic couplings. They were owned by the state-owned PTT, but participated in the NS trains, which also took care of the maintenance.
*Plan C: Plan C was a collective order. In addition to the towing vehicles P 7911-7920 described here, the streamline coaches Pec 922-936 were also part of this. The order also included 50 trainsets Mat &#x27;46: 221-240 and 270-299. Plan C was a series of 10 postal cars from the PTT, derived from the Plan D carriages of the Dutch Railways. The postal cars were delivered in 1952 and decommissioned in 1979.
*Plan K: Plan K is a carriage series that was used by the Dutch Railways between 1957 and 1984.
* Stalen D: is the type designation for a series of drawn carriages that were used by the Dutch Railways between 1950 and 1987 for the transportation of luggage.
* Plan E: is a series of 196 steel coaches for long haul trains, ordered by NS by Werkspoor and Beijnes in 1954, to replace wooden carriages in the domestic service.
*Plan L: In 1958, NS ordered from Werkspoor 13 station wagons Plan L as an addition to and largely similar to the previously delivered postal carriages Plan E.
*Plan N: In 1958 Werkspoor in Utrecht delivered 25 couchettes to a new design. The construction of the heavy roundabout cars with their eight-tonne bogies was stopped and replaced by a new generation of carriages with a lighter building construction and ditto bogies. They were known as Plan N. The carriages were put into service in the familiar blue colors and were assigned the series Bc10 7001-7025.
*Plan O: Plan O is the designation for a never-built series of cars of the Dutch Railways (NS). The AB coach was designed for NS in 1957 by W. de Steur of Allan &amp; Co. They fell through their windows with rounded sides, this was due to the construction with diagonal beams that offered more strength without significantly increasing the weight. Werkspoor also created a more classic design and in 1958 produced two test bogies that temporarily ended up under carriage Bc10 7025 of Plan N. The design of these two test bogies is very similar to the later (running) bogies for the equipment of the Plans U, T, V and W.
* Plan W: second class coaches similar to the German Silberlinge coaches.
*K4:K4 was the name for a series of 84 coaches of the Belgian railways. The carriages were bought in 1994 from the French national railway company SNCF to be used in rush-hour trains in Belgium. Between 2000 and 2002, carriages of this series were used in Intercity trains of the Dutch Railways.
*M2:The M2 railway carriages of the NMBS consisted of a series of carriages for domestic traffic which operated in the Netherlands from 1954. The coaches were built in different variants from 1954, totaling 620 copies. After the influx of the diesel trainsets MW41 the last carriages were removed.
*Other Carriages:

These are other former carriages that have been operating in the Netherlands.
* IC+: The coaches for the IC+, a short-lived experimental train with more facilities, were converted from normal coaches ICR. The coaches were rebuilt to standard coaches ICRm during the revision of ICR.
* Bcm: A couchette.
* ICL: (Inter City Leased) These wagons are leased from the DB, they are now placed aside on emplacement Dijkgracht in Amsterdam, waiting to be delivered back to the DB.
* AVMZ:formerly Avmz 111, was converted as a type of intercity coach of the Dutch Railways. They are ten first-class coaches that were built by various manufacturers from 1962 onwards for use in international trains.
* ICK: (&quot;InterCity Korte termijn&quot;) These are former German cars that were bought to relieve the shortage of material NSR suffered from.
*The DD-AR (&quot;Dubbeldeksaggloregiomaterieel&quot;) EMUs were delivered as DDM-2/3 resembling the bilevel rail cars series DDM-1 from 1985 and operates in fixed formations of 3 or 4 coaches. Four car trains use a class 1700 locomotive for traction, three car trains use an mDDM motorcar, which resembles a DD-AR driving trailer but has electric motors and a single passenger deck on top; the level of this deck is higher than that of a regular single deck rail car, but lower than the upper deck of the other coaches. Three types of coaches are available: Bv (second class), ABv (first and second class) and Bvk (second class driving trailer). The DDM-2/3 series are being modernised from 2010–2013 and after modernisation the series was renamed as NID (&quot;Nieuwe Intercity Dubbeldekker&quot;).
*DDM-1: The first series of the DDM, DDM-1, was operated in fixed formations of 6 coaches, using an 1800 class locomotive for traction. The other part of the DDM series, DDM-2/3, will be modernized during 2010-2013 and after modernization will be renamed as DDZ. DDM-1 was withdrawn in September 2010 but reactivated in January 2011, due to a lack of trains, caused by harsh winter conditions.

==Configuration of seats==
Usually in 2nd class there are 2+2 seats in the width of the train, sometimes 4 with the corridor on the side; Veolia had 3+2.

==Toilet==
Trains without a toilet:
*Spurt GTW2/8 and GTW2/6 in Achterhoek/Rivierenland operated by Arriva
*Spurt GTW2/8 and GTW2/6 on the Merwede-Lingelijn, operated by Qbuzz

In 2011 Nederlandse Spoorwegen announced that in the case of an incident causing a long stop of a train without a toilet and without the possibility of passengers leaving the train, NS will supply disposable bags, and allow the passengers entrance to the unused driver cabin.

<text>Christian Thomasius (; 1 January 1655 – 23 September 1728) was a German jurist and philosopher.

== Biography ==
He was born in Leipzig and was educated by his father, Jakob Thomasius (1622–1684), at that time a junior lecturer in Leipzig University (later dean and rector, as well as head master of Thomasschule zu Leipzig). Through his father&#x27;s lectures, Christian came under the influence of the political philosophy of Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, and continued the study of law at the University of Frankfurt (Oder) in 1675, completing his doctorate in 1679. In 1680, he married Anna Christine Heyland and started a legal practice in Leipzig; the following year he began teaching at the university’s law school as well. In 1684 he became professor of natural law, soon attracting attention by his abilities, and particularly by his attack on traditional prejudices, in theology and jurisprudence. In 1685 he published a provocative dissertation, &quot;De crimine bigamiae&quot; (The crime of bigamy), in which he argued that bigamy is permissible under natural law.

In 1687 he made the daring innovation of lecturing in German instead of Latin and gave a lecture on the topic &quot;How One Should Emulate the French Way of Life,&quot; referring to the French use of their native language not only in everyday life but in scholarship as well; according to scholar Klaus Luig, this event marks the real beginning of the Enlightenment in Germany. In the following year he began publishing a monthly periodical (&quot;Scherzhafte und ernsthafte, vernüftige&quot; [sic] &quot;und einfältige Gedanken über allerhand lustige und nutzliche Bücher und Fragen&quot;) in which he ridiculed the pedantic weaknesses of the learned, taking the side of the Pietists in their controversy with the orthodox, and defending mixed marriages of Lutherans and Calvinists; he also published a volume on natural law which emphasized natural reason and a paper defending marriage between Lutherans and members of the Reformed church.

In consequence of these and other views, on 10 May 1690 he was denounced from the pulpits, forbidden to lecture or to write, and his arrest was ordered. He escaped by going to Berlin, and the elector Frederick III offered him a refuge in Halle, with a salary of 500 thaler and permission to lecture. He helped found the University of Halle (1694), where he became second and then first professor of law and (in 1710) rector of the university. He was one of the most esteemed university teachers and influential writers of his day, and in 1709 he was appointed to the privy council.

Though not a profound philosophical thinker, Thomasius prepared the way for great reforms in philosophy, as well as in law, literature, social life and theology. It was his mission to introduce a rational, common-sense point of view, and to bring the divine and human sciences to bear on the everyday world. He thus created an epoch in German literature, philosophy and law, and, along with Spittler, began the modern period of ecclesiastical history. One of the aims of his life was to free politics and jurisprudence from the control of theology. He fought bravely and consistently for freedom of thought and speech on religious matters and mediated between the academic and the public sphere. In this regard, he shared much in common with his disciple Gabriel Wagner, who subsequently objected to Thomasius&#x27; religious metaphysical beliefs. In law, he tried to prove that the rules of Roman law, which contradicted his own principles of natural law, had never actually been accepted and were therefore invalid; he also tried to legitimize his own principles by showing them to be common law built on Germanic foundations. In this way he contributed to the creation of scholarship of private law separate from that of Roman law.

Thomasius is often spoken of in German works as the author of the &quot;territorial system,&quot; or Erastian theory of ecclesiastical government; but he taught that the state may interfere with legal or public duties only, and not with moral or private ones. He would not have even atheists punished, though they should be expelled from the country, and he came forward as an earnest opponent of the prosecution of witches and of the use of torture. In theology he was not a naturalist or a deist, but a believer in the necessity of revealed religion for salvation. He came strongly under the influence of the pietists, particularly of Spener, and there was a mystic vein in his thought; but other elements of his nature were too powerful to allow him to attach himself wholly to that party.

He died in Halle in 1728.

Thomasius&#x27;s most popular and influential German publications were his periodical already referred to (1688–1689); &quot;Einleitung zur Vernunftlehre&quot; (1691, 5th ed. 1719); &quot;Vernünflige Gedanken über allerhand auserlesene und juristische Handel&quot; (1720–1721); &quot;Historie der Weisheit und Torheit&quot; (3 vols., 1693); &quot;Kurze Lehrsätze van dem Laster der Zauberei mit dem Hexenprozess&quot; (1704); &quot;Weitere Erläuterungen der neueren Wissenschaft anderer Gedanken kennen zu lernen&quot; (1711). He expressed his pedagogical principles in two main Latin works, &quot;Institutiones iurisprudentiae divinae&quot; (Institutes of Divine Jurisprudence, 1688), based on a lecture on Pufendorf’s natural law, and &quot;Fundamenta juris naturae et gentium&quot; (Foundations of the Law of Nature and Nations, 1705).

<text>Samuel [[Freiherr]] von Pufendorf (8 January 1632 – 26 October 1694) was a German jurist, political philosopher, economist and historian. He was born Samuel Pufendorf and ennobled in 1694; he was made a baron by Charles XI of Sweden a few months before his death at age 62. Among his achievements are his commentaries and revisions of the natural law theories of Thomas Hobbes and Hugo Grotius.

His political concepts are part of the cultural background of the American Revolution. Pufendorf is seen as an important precursor of Enlightenment in Germany. He was involved in constant quarrels with clerical circles and frequently had to defend himself against accusations of heresy, despite holding largely traditional Christian views on matters of dogma and doctrine.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born at Dorfchemnitz in the Electorate of Saxony. His father Esaias Elias Pufendorf from Glauchau was a Lutheran pastor, and Samuel Pufendorf himself was destined for the ministry.

Educated at the Fürstenschule at Grimma, he was sent to study theology at the University of Leipzig. The narrow and dogmatic teaching was repugnant to Pufendorf, and he soon abandoned it for the study of public law.

Leaving Leipzig altogether, Pufendorf relocated to University of Jena, where he formed an intimate friendship with Erhard Weigel, the mathematician, whose influence helped to develop his remarkable independence of character. Under the influence of Weigel, he started to read Hugo Grotius, Thomas Hobbes and René Descartes.

Pufendorf left Jena in 1658 as Magister and became a tutor in the family of Peter Julius Coyet, one of the resident ministers of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden, at Copenhagen with the help of his brother , a diplomat in the Swedish service.

At this time, Charles was endeavoring to impose an unwanted alliance on Denmark. In the middle of the negotiations he opened hostilities and the Danes turned with anger against his envoys. Coyet succeeded in escaping, but the second minister, Steno Bielke, and the rest of the staff were arrested and thrown into prison. Pufendorf shared this misfortune, and was held in captivity for eight months. He occupied himself in meditating upon what he had read in the works of Hugo Grotius and Thomas Hobbes, and mentally constructed a system of universal law. At the end of his captivity, he accompanied his pupils, the sons of Coyet, to the University of Leiden.

=== Career as author ===

At Leiden, he was permitted to publish, in 1660, the fruits of his reflections under the title of &quot;Elementa jurisprudentiae universalis libri duo&quot; (&quot;Elements of Universal Jurisprudence: Two Books&quot;). The work was dedicated to Charles Louis, elector palatine, who created for Pufendorf a new chair at the University of Heidelberg, that of the law of nature and nations. This professorship was first of its kind in the world. Pufendorf married Katharina Elisabeth von Palthen, the widow of a colleague, in 1665.

In 1667 he wrote, with the assent of the elector palatine, a tract &quot;De statu imperii germanici liber unus&quot; (&quot;On the Present State of the German Empire: One Book&quot;). Published under the cover of a pseudonym at Geneva in 1667, it was supposed to be addressed by a gentleman of Verona, Severinus de Monzambano, to his brother Laelius. The pamphlet caused a sensation. Its author directly challenged the organization of the Holy Roman Empire, denounced in the strongest terms the faults of the house of Austria, and attacked with vigour the politics of the ecclesiastical princes. Before Pufendorf, , publicist and soldier, had written, under the pseudonym of &quot;Hippolytus a Lapide&quot;, &quot;De ratione status in imperio nostro romano-germanico&quot; (&quot;On The Reason of the Present State in Our Holy Roman Empire&quot;). Inimical, like Pufendorf, to the Austrian House of Habsburg, Chemnitz had gone so far as to make an appeal to France and Sweden. Pufendorf, on the contrary, rejected all idea of foreign intervention, and advocated that of national initiative.

When Pufendorf went on to criticise a new tax on official documents, he did not get the chair of law and had to leave Heidelberg in 1668. Chances for advancement were few in a Germany that still suffered from the ravages of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618-1648), so Pufendorf went to Sweden where that year he was called to the University of Lund. His sojourn there was fruitful.

In 1672 appeared &quot;De jure naturae et gentium libri octo&quot; (&quot;On The Law of Nature and of Nations: Eight Books&quot;) and of, and in 1673 a résumé of it under the title &quot;De officio hominis et civis iuxta legem naturalem&quot; (&quot;On the Duty of Man and Citizen, according to Natural Law&quot;), which, among other topics, gave his analysis of just war theory.
In &quot;De jure naturae et gentium&quot; Pufendorf took up in great measure the theories of Grotius and sought to complete them by means of the doctrines of Hobbes and of his own ideas on jus gentium (&quot;Law of Man&quot;). His first important point was that natural law does not extend beyond the limits of this life and that it confines itself to regulating external acts. He disputed Hobbes&#x27;s conception of the state of nature and concluded that the state of nature is not one of war but of peace. But this peace is feeble and insecure, and if something else does not come to its aid it can do very little for the preservation of mankind.

As regards public law Pufendorf, while recognizing in the state (&quot;civitas&quot;) a moral person (&quot;persona moralis&quot;), teaches that the will of the state is but the sum of the individual wills that constitute it, and that this association explains the state. In this &quot;a priori&quot; conception, in which he scarcely gives proof of historical insight, he shows himself as one of the precursors of Rousseau and of the &quot;Contrat social&quot;. Pufendorf powerfully defends the idea that international law is not restricted to Christendom, but constitutes a common bond between all nations because all nations form part of humanity.

In 1677 Pufendorf was called to Stockholm as Historiographer Royal. To this new period belong &quot;Einleitung zur Historie der vornehmsten Reiche und Staaten&quot; (&quot;Introduction to the History of the Most Distinguished Kingdoms and States&quot; as well as &quot;Commentarium de rebus suecicis libri XXVI., ab expeditione Gustavi Adolphi regis in Germaniam ad abdicationem usque Christinae&quot; and &quot;De rebus a Carolo Gustavo gestis&quot;. In his historical works, Pufendorf wrote in a very dry style, but he professed a great respect for truth and generally drew from archival sources. However, his historical works were heavily pro-Swedish and he supported the claim that eastern Denmark was originally Swedish. In 1658 Denmark was forced to cede the eastern provinces of Skåne (Scania), Halland, and Blekinge (plus some Norwegian territories) to Sweden. Pufendorf defended this move and insisted that these provinces were &quot;reunited&quot; with Sweden and that the Scanian provinces had always belonged to &quot;Götaland&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Sweden’s old borders have been healed again&quot;. In &quot;De habitu religionis christianae ad vitam civilem&quot; he traces the limits between ecclesiastical and civil power. This work propounded for the first time the so-called &quot;collegial&quot; theory of church government (&quot;Kollegialsystem&quot;), which, developed later by the learned Lutheran theologian , formed the basis of the relations of church and state in Germany and more especially in Prussia.

This theory makes a fundamental distinction between the supreme jurisdiction in ecclesiastical matters (&quot;Kirchenhoheit&quot; or &quot;jus circa sacra&quot;), which it conceives as inherent in the power of the state in respect of every religious communion, and the ecclesiastical power (&quot;Kirchengewalt&quot; or &quot;jus in sacra&quot;) inherent in the church, but in some cases vested in the state by tacit or expressed consent of the ecclesiastical body. The theory was of importance because, by distinguishing church from state while preserving the essential supremacy of the latter, it prepared the way for the principle of toleration. It was put into practice to a certain extent in Prussia in the 18th century; but it was not till the political changes of the 19th century led to a great mixture of confessions under the various state governments that it found universal acceptance in Germany. The theory initially found no acceptance in the Roman Catholic Episcopate, but it nonetheless made it possible for the Protestant governments to make a working compromise with Rome in respect of the Roman Catholic Church established in their states.

In 1688 Pufendorf was called into the service of Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg. He accepted the call, but he had no sooner arrived than the elector died. His son Frederick III fulfilled the promises of his father; and Pufendorf, historiographer and privy councillor, was instructed to write a history of the Elector Frederick William (&quot;De rebus gestis Frederici Wilhelmi Magni&quot;).

The King of Sweden continued to testify his goodwill towards Pufendorf, and in 1694 created him a baron. In the same year while still in Sweden, Pufendorf suffered a stroke, and died on 26 October 1694 in Berlin. He was buried in the church of St Nicholas, where an inscription to his memory is still to be seen. He was succeeded as historiographer in Berlin by Charles Ancillon.

===&quot;De iure naturae et gentium&quot;===
In 1672 appeared &quot;De iure naturae et gentium&quot;. This work took largely the theories of Grotius and many ideas from Hobbes, adding to them Pufendorf&#x27;s own ideas to develop the law of nations. Pufendorf argues that natural law does not extend beyond the limits of this life and merely regulates only external acts. He also challenges the Hobbesian thesis of a state of nature which is a state of war or conflict. For Pufendorf too there is a state of nature, but it is a state of peace. This natural peace, however, is weak and uncertain. In terms of public law, which recognizes the state (&quot;civitas&quot;) as a moral person (&quot;persona moralis&quot;), Pufendorf argues that the will of the state is nevertheless nothing more than the sum of the individual wills that are associated within it; hence the state needs to submit to a discipline essential for human safety. This &#x27;submission&#x27;, in the sense of obedience and mutual respect, is for Pufendorf the fundamental law of reason, which is the basis of natural law. He adds that international law should not be limited or restricted only to the Christian nations, but must create a common link between all peoples, since all nations are part of humanity.

===&quot;De Officio Hominis et Civis Juxta Legem Naturalem&quot;===
In &quot;De Officio Hominis et Civis Juxta Legem Naturalem&quot; (&quot;On the Duty of Man and Citizen&quot;), Pufendorf divides duties into several categories: duties towards God, duties towards oneself, and various forms of duty towards others. Duties towards oneself were classified as &quot;duties of the soul&quot;, such as developing skills and talents, and &quot;duties of the body&quot;, which involve not doing harm to oneself.

==Legacy and reputation==

John Locke, David Hume, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Denis Diderot all recommended Pufendorf&#x27;s inclusion in law curricula, and he greatly influenced Blackstone and Montesquieu.

Pufendorf&#x27;s feuds with Leibniz diminished his reputation. Pufendorf and Leibniz shared many theological views, but differed in their philosophical foundation, with Pufendorf leaning toward Biblical fundamentalism. It was on the subject of the pamphlet of &quot;Severinus de Monzambano&quot; that their quarrel began. Leibniz once dismissed him as &quot;Vir parum jurisconsultus, &quot;minime philosophus&quot;&quot; (&quot;A man barely a jurist, &quot;let alone a philosopher&quot;&quot;).

<text>The black-throated loon (Gavia arctica), also known as the Arctic loon and the black-throated diver, is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere, primarily breeding in freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia. It winters along sheltered, ice-free coasts of the north-east Atlantic Ocean and the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. This loon was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 and has two subspecies. It was previously considered to be the same species as the Pacific loon, of which it is traditionally considered to be a sister species, although this is debated. In a study that used mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA, the black-throated loon was found to be sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and two sister species, the common loon and the yellow-billed loon.

The black-throated loon measures about in length and can weigh anywhere from . In breeding plumage, the adult of the nominate subspecies has mostly black upperparts, with the exception of some of the and , which have white squares. The head and hindneck are grey, and the sides white and striped black. Most of the throat is also black, giving this bird the name &quot;black-throated loon&quot;. The colour of the throat patch can be used to distinguish the two subspecies; the throat patch of the other subspecies, &quot;G. a. viridigularis&quot;, is green. The underparts are mostly white, including the bottom of the throat. The flanks are also white, a feature which can be used to separate this bird from the Pacific loon. When the bird is not breeding, the black patch on the throat is absent, replaced with white; most of the black lines on the throat are also missing, except those on the bottom sides, and the upperparts are unpatterned with the exception of a few white spots on the . The juvenile is similar to the non-breeding adult, except more brown overall.

The timing of the breeding season is variable; in the southern part of its range, this loon starts breeding in April, whereas in the northern portion, it waits until after the spring thaw. It builds an oval nest about across, either near the breeding lake or on vegetation emerging from it. The black-throated loon usually lays a clutch of two, rarely one or three, brown-green eggs with dark splotches. After an incubation period of 27to 29days, the chick hatches, and is fed a diet of small fish and invertebrates. The adult mostly eats fish. To catch this food, it forages by itself or in pairs, very rarely foraging in groups. It dives from the water, going no deeper than . Most dives are successful. Whether or not at least one chick will hatch from a nest is variable, ranging from 30% to 90%. Most failures come from predators and flooding. Overall, the population of this loon is declining, although the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) still rates it as least concern, because the population decline is not rapid enough. The black-throated loon is protected under both the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The black-throated loon was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Colymbus arcticus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe and America but in 1761 he restricted it to Sweden. In 1897 the American ornithologist Joel Asaph Allen suggested that the black-throated loon should be moved to the genus &quot;Gavia&quot; that had been introduced by Johann Forster in 1788. This proposal was adopted by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) in 1899. The genus name comes from the Latin for , as used by the ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific is Latin for or . The name of the subspecies &quot;viridigularis&quot; stems from the Latin , meaning , and the Latin , meaning , in reference to the green throat of this subspecies. The common name, black-throated loon, stems from its black throat patch. This loon is also called the Arctic loon and the black-throated diver.

There are two subspecies:
*&quot;Gavia arctica arctica&quot; – This subspecies is found in northern Europe, east to the center of northern Asia, and from that to the Lena River and Transbaikal. It migrates to the coasts of northwestern Europe and the coasts of the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas.
*&quot;G. a. viridigularis&quot; – This subspecies is found in eastern Russia from the Lena River and Transbaikal east to the peninsulas of Chukotka and Kamchatka and the northern portion of Sakhalin. It migrates to the northwestern Pacific coasts.

&quot;G. a. viridigularis&quot; was considered to be a separate species when described by Jonathan Dwight in 1918, but in 1919 Arthur Cleveland Bent suggested that it be moved to its current placement as a subspecies. The black-throated loon was previously considered conspecific with the North American Pacific loon, which was its subspecies, but they have now been split into two species; there was no evidence of the two interbreeding in areas where they occurred together. Furthermore, the architecture of the air sacs in the lungs of the two species are significantly different. This split was done by the AOU in 1985. The phylogeny of this species is debated, the black-throated loon and the Pacific loon traditionally being considered sister species, whereas a study using mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA supported placing the black-throated loon sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and the two sister species that are the common loon and the yellow-billed loon. This latter study is criticised on the basis that it may form a phylogeny on incomplete lineage sorting. In the former phylogeny, the split between the Pacific loon and the black-throated loon is proposed to have happened about 6.5 million years ago.

==Description==
The adult black-throated loon is in length with a wingspan and a weight of . The nominate subspecies in its has a grey head and hindneck, with a black throat and a large black patch on the foreneck, both of which have a soft purple gloss. The lower throat has a necklace-shaped patch of short parallel white lines. The sides of the throat have about five long parallel white lines that start at the side of the patch on the lower throat and run down to the chest, which also has a pattern of parallel white and black lines. The rest of the , including the centre of the chest, are pure white. The upperparts are blackish down to the base of the wing, where there are a few rows of high contrast white squares that cover the and . There are small white spots on both the lesser and median coverts. The rest of the is a blackish colour. The is paler than the upperwing, and the underwing coverts are white. The tail is blackish. The bill and legs are black, with a pale grey colour on the inner half of the legs. The toes and the webs are grey, the latter also being flesh coloured. The irides are a deep brown-red. The sexes are alike, and the subspecies &quot;viridigularis&quot; is very similar to the nominate except that the former has a green throat patch, instead of black. The subspecies &quot;viridigularis&quot; retains a purplish gloss, although less than the nominate.

The non-breeding adult differs from the breeding adult in that the cap and the back of the neck are more brownish. The non-breeding adult also lacks the patterned upperparts of the breeding adult, although some of the upperwing coverts do not lose their white spots. This results in the upperparts being an almost unpatterned black from above. The sides of the throat are usually darker at the white border separating the sides of the throat and the front of the throat; most of the time a thin dark necklace between these two areas can be seen. There is white on the sides of the head that are below the eye. The bill is a steel-grey with, similar to the breeding adult, a blackish tip.

The juvenile is similar to the non-breeding adult, but has a browner appearance. It has a buffy scaling on the upperparts that is especially pronounced on the scapulars. The lower face and front of the neck has a diffused brownish tinge. The juvenile does not have the white spots on the wing coverts, and its irides are darker and more dull in colour. The chick hatches with down feathers that range from sooty-brown to brownish-grey, usually with a slightly paler head. The abdomen is pale.

The black-throated loon can be distinguished from the Pacific loon by the white on the flanks of the former.

===Vocalizations===
The male, when breeding, vocalizes a loud and rhythmic &quot;oooéé-cu-cloooéé-cu-cloooéé-cu-cluuéé&quot; whistling song. A &quot;áááh-oo&quot; wail can also be heard, and a growling or croaking &quot;knarr-knor&quot;, a sound given especially at night. The alarm call at the nest is a rising &quot;uweek&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-throated loon has a large range, breeding taking place across northern Europe, Asia, and the Seward Peninsula in Alaska. When breeding, it is found in the area around isolated, deep freshwater lakes larger than , especially those with inlets, as it prefers to face only small stretches of open water. When it is not breeding, this loon moves in a general southward direction and towards ice-free sea, usually wintering in coasts on north-east Atlantic Ocean and those on the eastern and western Pacific Ocean, such as the coasts of Japan. During this time, its habitat is usually inshore waters along sheltered coasts, although it will sometimes be found inland, in places such as the Mediterranean and Black seas.

==Behaviour==

Like other loons, this bird does not take flight well; it takes off by pattering on a &quot;runway&quot; of water. While flying, it makes a barking &quot;kwow&quot; flight call.

===Breeding===

This species usually nests on the ground within about of the lake it breeds at. This loon also sometimes nests on vegetation, like &quot;Arctophila fulva&quot;, that has emerged from lakes. The nest site is often reused the next year. The nest itself is oval-shaped and built mostly by the female out of heaped plant material like leaves and sticks. The nest is about across. Families of black-throated loons often move their nest site from the original nest ponds they inhabited to wetlands nearby after the chicks reach two weeks of age. The journey is generally less than .

In the southern portion of its range, this loon starts to breed in April, whereas in the northern parts of its range, it waits until the spring thaw, when there is adequate water for it to take off. It usually arrives before the lake thaws, in the latter case.

Before copulation, the female hunches its neck and swims close to the shore until it finds a suitable place and then lies down on the shore. The male sometimes adopts the same posture as the female. During this time, the only vocalization made is a one note &quot;hum&quot;. During copulation, the male, coming ashore, mounts the female and occasionally flaps its wings loudly. After this, the male returns to the water and itself. The female stays ashore for a maximum of about 23 minutes and usually starts to build the nest.

The black-throated loon lays a clutch of two, very rarely one or three, eggs that are brown-green with darker speckles. These eggs are incubated by both parents for a period of 27to 29days, with the female spending the most time incubating. During incubation, this bird turns its eggs. The interval between when they are turned is very irregular, ranging from one minute to about six hours. After they hatch, the mobile young are fed by both parents for a period of weeks. The chicks fledge about 60to 65days after hatching, and achieve sexual maturity after two to three years.

Nesting success, whether or not at least one chick will hatch from any given nest, is variable year to year, ranging from under 30% to over 90%. For clutches of two eggs, the average nesting success is about 50%, whereas in clutches with only one egg, this rate is about 60%. The nesting success is influenced most by predation, and flooding. Some of the adults that lose their clutch early in the incubation period renest. Most of the time, only one chick survives to fledge, the other dying within seven days of hatching. In Scotland, a study concluded that a single pair usually fledges a chick, on average, 25% of the time per year. This can be increased by artificial means, such as constructing rafts for loons to nest on. Whether or not there is at least one chick fledged is influenced by the density of fish in the breeding lake; a lake with a higher density of fish usually reduces the chance that a pair will fledge a chick, even though this loon feeds mainly on fish. There are two factors that might contribute to this; the first being that aquatic insects, an alternative food source for chicks, are more dense when there are less fish, and the second being that a higher density of fish means more northern pike, a predator of small chicks.

===Feeding===
A top predator in the pelagic zone of some subarctic lakes, this bird feeds on fish and sometimes insects, molluscs, crustaceans, and plant matter. The black-throated loon usually forages by itself or in pairs, rarely feeding in groups with multiple species. It dives from the water, at depths of no more than . Just before diving, this loon stretches and holds up its neck until it is erect and at full length. It usually jumps slightly upwards before diving. These dives are frequent, with an average of about 1.6 dives per minute. Most dives, about 80% of them, are successful, and those that are successful are usually shorter than those that are unsuccessful, with an average of 17 seconds for each successful dive, and 27 seconds for each unsuccessful dive. These dives usually only result in small items, and those that yield larger pieces of food are usually more than 40 seconds, where this bird catches quick-swimming fish.

When it is breeding, the adult usually feeds away from the nest, foraging either at the opposite end of the breeding or at lakes near the breeding lake. When foraging for newly hatched chicks, the adult forages in the lake where the nest is or in nearby lakes, returning after a prey item has been caught. When the chicks are older, they usually accompany both of the parents, swimming a few metres behind them. The strategy that predominates immediately after hatching is generally still employed when the chicks are older, but at a reduced rate. The chicks are fed only one item of prey at a time. The young are also able to capture food themselves at least 36 days after hatching, although they are still fed daily up until about 70 days of age.

The diet of black-throated loon chicks varies, the prey in the breeding lake being a major factor. For the first eight days, chicks are usually fed three-spined sticklebacks and common minnows if they are found in the breeding lake. If they are not present, then the chicks are brought up mainly on small invertebrates until about eight days, when they are able to take trout of about in length. Although in these chicks trout makes up the majority of their diet, they are still fed invertebrates in large numbers. In all lakes, salmonids make up an important part of the chicks&#x27; diet after eight days. Salmonids, especially those between , are important in the diets of older chicks. Eels are also an important food for older chicks.

==Predators and parasites==
The black-throated loon is sometimes parasitized by &quot;Eustrongylides tubifex&quot;, a species of nematode that can cause Eustrongylidosis. Mammalian predators, such as red foxes and pine martens, are likely the cause of about 40% of clutch losses. Avian predators, such as hooded crows, also take the eggs of this loon.

==Status==
===Conservation===
Despite the fact that its population is declining, the black-throated loon is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN. This is because the species has a large population and an extremely large range, and its decline does not appear to be rapid. In the United States, it is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, while in Europe and Africa, it is protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds.

===Threats===
Acidification and heavy-metal pollution of the breeding lake possibly threatens this bird. It is also vulnerable to oil pollution, especially when near fishing grounds. Fishing nets are also a cause of mortality. This loon is sensitive to windfarms near the coast. Overall, the annual mortality rate of the adult black-throated loon is 10%.

<text>The Cyprus problem, also known as the Cyprus conflict, Cyprus issue, Cyprus dispute, or Cyprus question, is an ongoing dispute between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot community in the north of the island of Cyprus, where troops of the Republic of Turkey are deployed. This dispute is an example of a protracted social conflict. The Cyprus dispute stems from the 1974 Cypriot military coup d&#x27;état executed by the Cypriot National Guard and sponsored by the Greek military junta, and the ensuing Turkish military invasion of the island, and hence the presence of Turkish soldiers, despite a legal reinstatement of a stable government. The desire of some of the ethnic Turkish peoples for the partition of the island of Cyprus through Taksim, and mainland Turkish nationalists settling in as a show of force as a supposed means of protecting their people from what they considered to be the threat of Greek Cypriots, also plays a role in the dispute.

Initially, with the occupation of the island by the British Empire from the Ottoman Empire in 1878 and subsequent annexation in 1914, the &quot;Cyprus dispute&quot; referred to general conflicts between Greek and Turkish islanders.

However, the current international complications of the dispute stretch beyond the boundaries of the island itself and involve the guarantor powers under the Zürich and London Agreement (namely Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom), the United Nations, and the European Union. The now-defunct Czechoslovakia and Eastern Bloc had previously interfered politically.

The problem entered its current phase in the aftermath of the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, occupying the northern third of Cyprus. Although the invasion was triggered by the 1974 Cypriot coup d&#x27;état, Turkish forces refused to depart after the legitimate government was restored. The Turkish Cypriot leadership later declared independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, although only Turkey has considered the move legal, and there continues to be broad international opposition to Northern Cyprus independence. According to the European Court of Human Rights, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus should be considered a puppet state under effective Turkish occupation, and legitimately belongs to Cyprus. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 550 of 1984 calls for members of the United Nations to not recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.

As a result of the two communities and the guarantor countries committing themselves to finding a peaceful solution to the dispute, the United Nations maintains a buffer zone (known as the &quot;Green Line&quot;) to avoid further intercommunal tensions and hostilities. This zone separates the southern areas of the Republic of Cyprus (predominantly inhabited by Greek Cypriots), from the northern areas (where Turkish Cypriots and Turkish settlers now reside). There was a warming of relations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the 2010s, with a renewal of talks officially beginning in early 2014. The Crans-Montana negotiations raised hopes for a long-term solution, but they ultimately stalled. UN-led talks in 2021 similarly failed.

==Historical background before 1960==

The island of Cyprus was first inhabited in 9000 BC, with the arrival of farming societies who built round houses with floors of terrazzo. Cities were first built during the Bronze Age and the inhabitants had their own Eteocypriot language until around the 4th century BC. The island was part of the Hittite Empire as part of the Ugarit Kingdom during the late Bronze Age until the arrival of two waves of Greek settlement.

Cyprus experienced an uninterrupted Greek presence on the island dating from the arrival of Mycenaeans around 1400 BC, when the burials began to take the form of long &quot;dromos&quot;. The Greek population of Cyprus survived through multiple conquerors, including Egyptian and Persian rule. In the 4th century BC, Cyprus was conquered by Alexander the Great and then ruled by the Ptolemaic Egypt until 58 BC, when it was incorporated into the Roman Empire. In the division of the Roman Empire around the 4th century AD, the island was assigned to the predominantly Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire.

Roman rule in Cyprus was interrupted in 649, when the Arab armies of the Umayyad Caliphate invaded the island. Fighting over the island between the Muslims and Romans continued for several years, until in 668 the belligerents agreed to make Cyprus a condominium. This arrangement persisted for nearly 300 years, until a Byzantine army conquered the island in around 965. Cyprus would become a theme of the Byzantine Empire until the late 12th century.

After an occupation by the Knights Templar and the rule of Isaac Komnenos, the island in 1192 came under the rule of the Lusignan family, who established the Kingdom of Cyprus. In February 1489 it was seized by the Republic of Venice. Between September 1570 and August 1571 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, starting three centuries of Turkish rule over Cyprus.

Starting in the early 19th century, ethnic Greeks of the island sought to bring about an end to almost 300 years of Ottoman rule and unite Cyprus with Greece. The United Kingdom took administrative control of the island in 1878, to prevent Ottoman possessions from falling under Russian control following the Cyprus Convention, which led to the call for union with Greece (&quot;enosis&quot;) to grow louder. Under the terms of the agreement reached between Britain and the Ottoman Empire, the island remained an Ottoman territory.

The Christian Greek-speaking majority of the island welcomed the arrival of the British, as a chance to voice their demands for union with Greece.

When the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers, Britain renounced the Agreement, rejected all Turkish claims over Cyprus and declared the island a British colony. In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Constantine I of Greece on the condition that Greece join the war on the side of the British, which he declined.

===1918 to 1955===

Under British rule in the early 20th century, Cyprus escaped the conflicts and atrocities that went on elsewhere between Greeks and Turks during the Greco-Turkish War and the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriots consistently opposed the idea of union with Greece.

In 1925, Britain declared Cyprus a crown colony. In the years that followed, the determination of Greek Cypriots to achieve &quot;enosis&quot; continued. In 1931 this led to open revolt. A riot resulted in the death of six civilians, injuries to others and the burning of Britain&#x27;s Government House in Nicosia. In the months that followed, about 2,000 people were convicted of crimes in connection with the struggle for union with Greece. Britain reacted by imposing harsh restrictions. Military reinforcements were dispatched to the island and the constitution suspended. A special &quot;epicourical&quot; (reserve) police force was formed consisting of only Turkish Cypriots, press restrictions were instituted and political parties were banned. Two bishops and eight other prominent citizens directly implicated in the conflict were exiled. Municipal elections were suspended, and until 1943 all municipal officials were appointed by the government. The governor was to be assisted by an Executive Council, and two years later an Advisory Council was established; both councils consisted only of appointees and were restricted to advising on domestic matters only. In addition, the flying of Greek or Turkish flags or the public display of visages of Greek or Turkish heroes was forbidden.

The struggle for &quot;enosis&quot; was put on hold during World War II. In 1946, the British government announced plans to invite Cypriots to form a Consultative Assembly to discuss a new constitution. The British also allowed the return of the 1931 exiles. Instead of reacting positively, as expected by the British, the Greek Cypriot military hierarchy reacted angrily because there had been no mention of &quot;enosis&quot;. The Cypriot Orthodox Church had expressed its disapproval, and Greek Cypriots declined the British invitation, stating that &quot;enosis&quot; was their sole political aim. The efforts by Greeks to bring about &quot;enosis&quot; now intensified, helped by active support of the Church of Cyprus, which was the main political voice of the Greek Cypriots at the time. However, it was not the only organisation claiming to speak for the Greek Cypriots. The Church&#x27;s main opposition came from the Cypriot Communist Party (officially the Progressive Party of the Working People; &quot;Ανορθωτικό&quot; &quot;Κόμμα&quot; &quot;Εργαζόμενου&quot; &quot;Λαού&quot;; or AKEL), which also wholeheartedly supported the Greek national goal of &quot;enosis&quot;. However the British military forces and colonial administration in Cyprus did not see the pro-Soviet communist party as a viable partner.
During the 1940s, politically charged Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot newspaper reports, poems, and stories, including those by Dursun Cevlâni, contributed to a concerted effort to deny any Greek identity of the island and foster a political movement in support of a Turkish Cyprus. By the mid-1950s, the &quot;Cyprus is Turkish&quot; party, movement, and slogan gained force in both Cyprus and Turkey. In a 1954 editorial, Turkish Cypriot leader Dr. Fazil Kuchuk expressed the sentiment that the Turkish youth had grown up with the idea that &quot;as soon as Great Britain leaves the island, it will be taken over by the Turks&quot;, and that &quot;Turkey cannot tolerate otherwise&quot;. By 1954 a number of Turkish mainland institutions were also active in the Cyprus issue such as the National Federation of Students, the Committee for the Defence of Turkish rights in Cyprus, the Welfare Organisation of Refugees from Thrace and the Cyprus Turkish Association. Above all, the Turkish trade unions were to prepare the right climate for the then main Turkish goal, the division of the island (&quot;taksim&quot;) into Greek and Turkish parts, thus keeping the British military presence and installations on the island intact. By this time a special Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisation Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT) was also established which was to act as a counterbalance to the Greek Cypriot &quot;enosis&quot; fighting organisation of EOKA.

In 1950, Michael Mouskos, Bishop Makarios of Kition (Larnaca), was elevated to Archbishop Makarios III of Cyprus. In his inaugural speech, he vowed not to rest until union with &quot;mother Greece&quot; had been achieved. In Athens, &quot;enosis&quot; was a common topic of conversation, and a Cypriot native, Colonel George Grivas, was becoming known for his strong views on the subject. In anticipation of an armed struggle to achieve &quot;enosis&quot;, Grivas visited Cyprus in July 1951. He discussed his ideas with Makarios but was disappointed by the archbishop&#x27;s contrasting opinion as he proposed a political struggle rather than an armed revolution against the British. From the beginning, and throughout their relationship, Grivas resented having to share leadership with the archbishop. Makarios, concerned about Grivas&#x27;s extremism from their very first meeting, preferred to continue diplomatic efforts, particularly efforts to get the United Nations involved. The feelings of uneasiness that arose between them never dissipated. In the end, the two became enemies. In the meantime, on 16 August [Papagos Government] 1954, Greece&#x27;s UN representative formally requested that self-determination for the people of Cyprus be applied. Turkey rejected the idea of the union of Cyprus and Greece. Turkish Cypriot community opposed Greek Cypriot &quot;enosis&quot; movement, as under British rule the Turkish Cypriot minority status and identity were protected. Turkish Cypriot identification with Turkey had grown stronger in response to overt Greek nationalism of Greek Cypriots, and after 1954 the Turkish government had become increasingly involved. In the late summer and early autumn of 1954, the Cyprus problem intensified. On Cyprus the colonial government threatened publishers of seditious literature with up to two years imprisonment. In December the UN General Assembly announced the decision &quot;not to consider the problem further for the time being, because it does not appear appropriate to adopt a resolution on the question of Cyprus&quot;. Reaction to the setback at the UN was immediate and violent, resulting in the worst rioting in Cyprus since 1931.

===EOKA campaign and creation of TMT, 1955–1959===
In January 1955, Grivas founded the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters ( – EOKA). On 1 April 1955, EOKA opened an armed campaign against British rule in a coordinated series of attacks on police, military, and other government installations in Nicosia, Famagusta, Larnaca, and Limassol. This resulted in the deaths of 387 British servicemen and personnel and some Greek Cypriots suspected of collaboration. As a result of this a number of Greek Cypriots began to leave the police. This however did not affect the Colonial police force as they had already created the solely Turkish Cypriot (Epicourical) reserve force to fight EOKA paramilitaries. At the same time, it led to tensions between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. In 1957 the Turkish Resistance Organisation ( TMT), which had already been formed to protect the Turkish Cypriots from EOKA, took action. In response to the growing demand for , a number of Turkish Cypriots became convinced that the only way to protect their interests and identity of the Turkish Cypriot population in the event of would be to divide the island – a policy known as (&quot;partition&quot; in Turkish borrowed from () in Arabic) – into a Greek sector in the south and a Turkish sector in the north.

===Establishment of the constitution===
By now the island was on the verge of civil war. Several attempts to present a compromise settlement had failed. Therefore, beginning in December 1958, representatives of Greece and Turkey, the so-called &quot;mother lands&quot; opened discussions of the Cyprus issue. Participants for the first time discussed the concept of an independent Cyprus, i.e., neither &quot;enosis&quot; nor &quot;taksim&quot;. Subsequent talks always headed by the British yielded a so-called compromise agreement supporting independence, laying the foundations of the Republic of Cyprus. The scene then naturally shifted to London, where the Greek and Turkish representatives were joined by representatives of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots (represented by Arch. Makarios and Dr Fazıl Küçük with no significant decision-making power), and the British. The Zürich-London agreements that became the basis for the Cyprus constitution of 1960 were supplemented with three treaties – the Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Guarantee, and the Treaty of Alliance. The general tone of the agreements was one of keeping the British sovereign bases and military and monitoring facilities intact. Some Greek Cypriots, especially members of organisations such as EOKA, expressed disappointment because &quot;enosis&quot; had not been attained. In a similar way some Turkish Cypriots especially members of organisations such as TMT expressed their disappointment as they had to postpone their target for &quot;taksim&quot;, however most Cypriots that were not influenced by the three so called guarantor powers (Greece, Turkey, and Britain), welcomed the agreements and set aside their demand for &quot;enosis&quot; and &quot;taksim&quot;. According to the Treaty of Establishment, Britain retained sovereignty over 256 square kilometres, which became the Dhekelia Sovereign Base Area, to the northeast of Larnaca, and the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area to the southwest of Limassol.

Cyprus achieved independence on 16 August 1960.

==Independence, constitutional breakdown, and intercommunal talks, 1960–1974==

According to constitutional arrangements, Cyprus was to become an independent, non-aligned republic with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president. General executive authority was vested in a council of ministers with a ratio of seven Greeks to three Turks. (The Greek Cypriots represented 78% of the population and the Turkish Cypriots 18%. The remaining 4% was made up by the three minority communities: the Latins, Maronites and Armenians.) A House of Representatives of fifty members, also with a seven-to-three ratio, were to be separately elected by communal balloting on a universal suffrage basis. In addition, separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Communal Chambers were provided to exercise control in matters of religion, culture, and education. According to Article 78(2) &quot;any law imposing duties or taxes shall require a simple majority of the representatives elected by the Greek and Turkish communities respectively taking part in the vote&quot;. Legislation on other subjects was to take place by simple majority but again the President and the vice-president had the same right of veto—absolute on foreign affairs, defence and internal security, delaying on other matters—as in the Council of Ministers. The judicial system would be headed by a Supreme Constitutional Court, composed of one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot and presided over by a contracted judge from a neutral country. The Constitution of Cyprus, while establishing an independent and sovereign republic, was, in the words of de Smith, an authority on Constitutional Law, &quot;Unique in its tortuous complexity and in the multiplicity of the safeguards that it provides for the principal minority; the Constitution of Cyprus stands alone among the constitutions of the world&quot;.
Within a short period of time the first disputes started to arise between the two communities. Issues of contention included taxation and the creation of separate municipalities. Because of the legislative veto system, this resulted in a lockdown in communal and state politics in many cases.

===Crisis of 1963–1964===

Repeated attempts to solve the disputes failed. Eventually, on 30 November 1963, Makarios put forward to the three guarantors a thirteen-point proposal designed, in his view, to eliminate impediments to the functioning of the government. The thirteen points involved constitutional revisions, including the abandonment of the veto power by both the president and the vice-president. Turkey initially rejected it (although later in future discussed the proposal). A few days later, on Bloody Christmas, 21 December 1963, fighting erupted between the communities in Nicosia. In the days that followed it spread across the rest of the island, resulting in the death of 364 Turkish Cypriots and 174 Greek Cypriots, and the forced displacement of 25,000 Turkish Cypriots. At the same time, the power-sharing government collapsed. How this happened is one of the most contentious issues in modern Cypriot history. The Greek Cypriots argue that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew to form their own administration. The Turkish Cypriots maintain that they were forced out. Many Turkish Cypriots chose to withdraw from the government. However, in many cases those who wished to stay in their jobs were prevented from doing so by the Greek Cypriots. Also, many of the Turkish Cypriots refused to attend because they feared for their lives after the recent violence that had erupted. There was even some pressure from the TMT as well. In any event, in the days that followed the fighting a frantic effort was made to calm tensions. In the end, on 27 December 1963, an interim peacekeeping force, the Joint Truce Force, was put together by Britain, Greece and Turkey. After the partnership government collapsed, the Greek Cypriot led administration was recognised as the legitimate government of the Republic of Cyprus at the stage of the debates in New York in February 1964. The Joint Truce Force held the line until a United Nations peacekeeping force, UNFICYP, was formed following United Nations Security Council Resolution 186, passed on 4 March 1964.

===Peacemaking efforts, 1964–1974===
At the same time as it established a peacekeeping force, the Security Council also recommended that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the parties and the Guarantor Powers, designate a mediator to take charge of formal peacemaking efforts. U Thant, then the UN Secretary-General, appointed Sakari Tuomioja, a Finnish diplomat. While Tuomioja viewed the problem as essentially international in nature and saw &quot;enosis&quot; as the most logical course for a settlement, he rejected union on the grounds that it would be inappropriate for a UN official to propose a solution that would lead to the dissolution of a UN member state. The United States held a differing view. In early June, following another Turkish threat to intervene, Washington launched an independent initiative under Dean Acheson, a former Secretary of State. In July he presented a plan to unite Cyprus with Greece. In return for accepting this, Turkey would receive a sovereign military base on the island. The Turkish Cypriots would also be given minority rights, which would be overseen by a resident international commissioner. Makarios rejected the proposal, arguing that giving Turkey territory would be a limitation on &quot;enosis&quot; and would give Ankara too strong a say in the island&#x27;s affairs. A second version of the plan was presented that offered Turkey a 50-year lease on a base. This offer was rejected by the Greek Cypriots and by Turkey. After several further attempts to reach an agreement, the United States was eventually forced to give up its effort.

Following the sudden death of Ambassador Tuomioja in August, Galo Plaza was appointed Mediator. He viewed the problem in communal terms. In March 1965 he presented a report criticising both sides for their lack of commitment to reaching a settlement. While he understood the Greek Cypriot aspiration of &quot;enosis&quot;, he believed that any attempt at union should be held in voluntary abeyance. Similarly, he considered that the Turkish Cypriots should refrain from demanding a federal solution to the problem. Although the Greek Cypriots eventually accepted the report, despite its opposition to immediate &quot;enosis&quot;, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots rejected the plan, calling on Plaza to resign on the grounds that he had exceeded his mandate by advancing specific proposals. He was simply meant to broker an agreement. But the Greek Cypriots made it clear that if Galo Plaza resigned they would refuse to accept a replacement. U Thant was left with no choice but to abandon the mediation effort. Instead he decided to make his Good Offices available to the two sides via resolution 186 of 4 March 1964 and a Mediator was appointed. In his Report (S/6253, A/6017, 26 March 1965), the Mediator, now rejected by the Turkish Cypriot community, Dr Gala Plaza, criticized the 1960 legal framework, and proposed major amendments which were rejected by Turkey and Turkish Cypriots.

The end of the mediation effort was effectively confirmed when, at the end of the year, Plaza resigned and was not replaced.

In March 1966, a more modest attempt at peacemaking was initiated under the auspices of Carlos Bernades, the Secretary-General&#x27;s Special Representative for Cyprus. Instead of trying to develop formal proposals for the parties to bargain over, he aimed to encourage the two sides agree to settlement through direct dialogue. However, ongoing political chaos in Greece prevented any substantive discussions from developing. The situation changed the following year.

On 21 April 1967, a coup d&#x27;état in Greece brought to power a military administration. Just months later, in November 1967, Cyprus witnessed its most severe bout of intercommunal fighting since 1964. Responding to a major attack on Turkish Cypriot villages in the south of the island, which left 27 dead, Turkey bombed Greek Cypriot forces and appeared to be readying itself for an intervention. Greece was forced to capitulate. Following international intervention, Greece agreed to recall General George Grivas, the Commander of the Greek Cypriot National Guard and former EOKA leader, and reduce its forces on the island. Capitalising on the weakness of the Greek Cypriots, the Turkish Cypriots proclaimed their own provisional administration on 28 December 1967. Makarios immediately declared the new administration illegal. Nevertheless, a major change had occurred. The Archbishop, along with most other Greek Cypriots, began to accept that the Turkish Cypriots would have to have some degree of political autonomy. It was also realised that unification of Greece and Cyprus was unachievable under the prevailing circumstances.

In May 1968, intercommunal talks began between the two sides under the auspices of the Good Offices of the UN Secretary-General. Unusually, the talks were not held between President Makarios and Vice-president Kucuk. Instead they were conducted by the presidents of the communal chambers, Glafcos Clerides and Rauf Denktaş. Again, little progress was made. During the first round of talks, which lasted until August 1968, the Turkish Cypriots were prepared to make several concessions regarding constitutional matters, but Makarios refused to grant them greater autonomy in return. The second round of talks, which focused on local government, was equally unsuccessful. In December 1969 a third round of discussion started. This time they focused on constitutional issues. Yet again there was little progress and when they ended in September 1970 the Secretary-General blamed both sides for the lack of movement. A fourth and final round of intercommunal talks also focused on constitutional issues, but again failed to make much headway before they were forced to a halt in 1974.

==1974 Greek coup d&#x27;etat and Turkish invasion==

The intercommunal strife was partly overshadowed by the division of the Greeks between the pro-independence Makarios, and the enosist National Front supported by the military junta of Greece. Grivas returned in 1971 and founded the EOKA-B, a militant enosist group, to oppose Makarios. Greece demanded Cyprus submit to its influence and the dismissal of the Cypriot foreign minister. Makarios survived an assassination attempt and retained enough popular support to remain in power. Enosist pressure continued to mount; although Grivas died suddenly in January 1974, a new junta had formed in Greece in September 1973.

In July 1974, the Cypriot National Guard launched a coup d&#x27;état that installed the pro-enosis Nikos Sampson as president. Makarios fled the country with British help. Faced with Greek control of the island, Turkey demanded that Greece dismiss Sampson, withdraw its armed forces, and respect Cyprus&#x27; independence; Greece refused. From the United States, envoy Joseph Sisco could not persuade Greece to accept Ecevit&#x27;s Cyprus settlement which included Turkish-Cypriot control of a coastal region in the north and negotiations for a federal solution. The Soviet Union did not support enosis as it would strengthen NATO and weaken the left in Cyprus.

The Turkish invasion was driven by the assertive foreign policy of Bülent Ecevit, its prime minister, who was supported by his coalition partner Necmettin Erbakan. Turkey decided upon unilateral action after an invitation for joint action, made under the Treaty of Guarantee, was declined by Britain. On 20 July, Turkey invaded Cyprus with limited forces. The invasion achieved limited initial success, resulting in Greek forces occupying Turkish-Cypriot enclaves across the island. Within two days, Turkey secured a narrow corridor linking the northern coast with Nicosia, and on 23 July agreed to a cease-fire after securing a satisfactory bridgehead.

In Greece, the Turkish invasion caused political turmoil. On 23 July, the military junta collapsed and was replaced by Konstantinos Karamanlis&#x27;s civilian government. On Cyprus the same day, Sampson was replaced by Acting President Glafcos Clerides in the absence of Makarios.

Formal peace talks convened two days later in Geneva, Switzerland, between Greece, Turkey and Britain. During the next five days, Turkey agreed to halt its advance on the condition that it would remain on the island until a political settlement was reached. Meanwhile, Turkish forces continued to advance as Greek forces occupied more Turkish-Cypriot enclaves. A new cease-fire line was agreed. On 30 July, the powers declared that the withdrawal of Turkish forces should be linked to a &quot;just and lasting settlement acceptable to all parties concerned&quot;, with mentions of &quot;two autonomous administrations – that of Greek-Cypriot community and that of the Turkish-Cypriot community&quot;.

Another round of talks was held on 8 August, this time including Cypriot representatives. Turkish Cypriots, supported by Turkey, demanded geographical separation from the Greek Cypriots; it was rejected by Makarios, who was committed to a unitary state. Deadlock ensued. On 14 August, Turkey demanded that Greece accept a Cypriot federal state, which would have resulted in the Turkish Cypriots - making up 18% of the population and 10% of land ownership – receiving 34% of the island. The talks ended when Turkey refused Clerides&#x27; request for 36 to 48 hours to consult the Cypriot and Greek governments. Within hours, Turkey launched a second offensive. Turkey controlled 36% of the island by the time of the last ceasefire on 16 August 1974. The area between the combatants became a United Nations-administered buffer zone, or &quot;green line&quot;.

The Greek coup and Turkish invasion resulted in thousands of Cypriot casualties. The Government of Cyprus reported providing for 200,000 refugees. 160,000 Greek Cypriots living in the Turkish-occupied northern region fled before Turkish forces or were evicted; they had made up 82% of the region&#x27;s population. The United Nations approved the voluntary resettlement of the remaining 51,000 Turkish Cypriots in the south in the northern area; many had fled to the British areas and awaited permission to migrate to the Turkish-controlled area.

==The divided island, 1974–1997==

At the second Geneva Conference beginning 9 August 1974, Turkey pressed for a federal solution to the problem against stiffening Greek resistance. While Turkish Cypriots wanted a bi-zonal federation, Turkey, under American advice, submitted a cantonal plan involving separation of Turkish-Cypriot areas from one another. For security reasons Turkish-Cypriots did not favour cantons. Each plan embraced about thirty-four per cent of the territory.

These plans were presented to the conference on 13 August by the Turkish Foreign Minister, Turan Güneş. Clerides wanted thirty-six to forty-eight hours to consider the plans, but Güneş demanded an immediate response. This was regarded as unreasonable by the Greeks, the British, and the Americans, who were in close consultation. Nevertheless, the next day, the Turkish forces extended their control to some 36 per cent of the island, afraid that delay would turn international opinion strongly against them.

Turkey&#x27;s international reputation suffered as a result of the precipitous move of the Turkish military to extend control to a third of the island. The British prime minister regarded the Turkish ultimatum as unreasonable since it was presented without allowing adequate time for study. In Greek eyes, the Turkish proposals were submitted in the full awareness that the Greek side could not accept them, and reflected the Turkish desire for a military base in Cyprus. The Greek side went some way in their proposals by recognising Turkish &#x27;groups&#x27; of villages and Turkish administrative &#x27;areas&#x27;. But they stressed that the constitutional order of Cyprus should retain its bi-communal character based on the co-existence of the Greek and Turkish communities within the framework of a sovereign, independent and integral republic. Essentially the Turkish side&#x27;s proposals were for geographic consolidation and separation and for a much larger measure of autonomy for that area, or those areas, than the Greek side could accept.

===1975–1979===
On 28 April 1975, Kurt Waldheim, the UN Secretary-General, launched a new mission of good offices. Starting in Vienna, over the course of the following ten months Clerides and Denktaş discussed a range of humanitarian issues relating to the events of the previous year. However, attempts to make progress on the substantive issues – such as territory and the nature of the central government – failed to produce any results. After five rounds, the talks fell apart in February 1976. In January 1977, the UN succeeded in organising a meeting in Nicosia between Makarios and Denktaş. This led to a major breakthrough. On 12 February, the two leaders signed a four-point agreement confirming that a future Cyprus settlement would be based on a federation. The size of the states would be determined by economic viability and land ownership. The central government would be given powers to ensure the unity of the state. Various other issues, such as freedom of settlement and freedom of movement, would be settled through discussion. Just months later, in August 1977, Makarios died. He was replaced by Spyros Kyprianou, the foreign minister.

In 1979 the ABC plan was presented by the US, as a proposal for a permanent solution of the Cyprus problem. It projected a Bicommunal Bizonal Federation with a strong central government. It was first rejected by the Greek Cypriot leader Spyros Kyprianou and later by Turkey.

In May 1979, Waldheim visited Cyprus and secured a further ten-point set of proposals from the two sides. In addition to re-affirming the 1977 High-Level Agreement, the ten points also included provisions for the demilitarisation of the island and a commitment to refrain from destabilising activities and actions. Shortly afterwards a new round of discussions began in Nicosia. Again, they were short-lived. For a start, the Turkish Cypriots did not want to discuss Varosha, a resort quarter of Famagusta that had been vacated by Greek Cypriots when it was overrun by Turkish troops. This was a key issue for the Greek Cypriots. Second, the two sides failed to agree on the concept of &#x27;bicommunalism&#x27;. The Turkish Cypriots believed that the Turkish Cypriot federal state would be exclusively Turkish Cypriot and the Greek Cypriot state would be exclusively Greek Cypriot. The Greek Cypriots believed that the two states should be predominantly, but not exclusively, made up of a particular community.

===Turkish Cypriots&#x27; declaration of independence===

In May 1983, an effort by Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, then UN Secretary-General, foundered after the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution calling for the withdrawal of all occupation forces from Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots were furious at the resolution, threatening to declare independence in retaliation. Despite this, in August, Pérez de Cuéllar gave the two sides a set of proposals for consideration that called for a rotating presidency, the establishment of a bicameral assembly along the same lines as previously suggested, and 60:40 representation in the central executive. In return for increased representation in the central government, the Turkish Cypriots would surrender 8–13 per cent of the land in their possession. Both Kyprianou and Denktaş accepted the proposals. However, on 15 November 1983, the Turkish Cypriots took advantage of the post-election political instability in Turkey and unilaterally declared independence. Within days the Security Council passed a resolution, no.541 (13–1 vote: only Pakistan opposed) making it clear that it would not accept the new state and that the decision disrupted efforts to reach a settlement. Denktaş denied this. In a letter informing the Secretary-General of the decision, he insisted that the move guaranteed that any future settlement would be truly federal in nature. Although the &#x27;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&#x27; (TRNC) was soon recognised by Turkey, the rest of the international community condemned the move. The Security Council passed another resolution, no.550 (13–1 vote: again only Pakistan opposed) condemning the &quot;purported exchange of ambassadors between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership&quot;.

In September 1984, talks resumed. After three rounds of discussions it was again agreed that Cyprus would become a bi-zonal, bi-communal, non-aligned federation. The Turkish Cypriots would retain 29 per cent for their federal state and all foreign troops would leave the island. In January 1985, the two leaders met for their first face-to-face talks since the 1979 agreement. However, while the general belief was that the meeting was being held to agree to a final settlement, Kyprianou insisted that it was a chance for further negotiations. The talks collapsed. In the aftermath, the Greek Cypriot leaders came in for heavy criticism, both at home and abroad. After that Denktaş announced that he would not make so many concessions again. Undeterred, in March 1986, de Cuéllar presented the two sides with a Draft Framework Agreement . Again, the plan envisaged the creation of an independent, non-aligned, bi-communal, bi-zonal state in Cyprus. However, the Greek Cypriots were unhappy with the proposals. They argued that the questions of removing Turkish forces from Cyprus was not addressed, nor was the repatriation of the increasing number of Turkish settlers on the island. Moreover, there were no guarantees that the full three freedoms would be respected. Finally, they saw the proposed state structure as being confederal in nature. Further efforts to produce an agreement failed as the two sides remained steadfastly attached to their positions.

===The &quot;Set of Ideas&quot;===
In August 1988, Pérez de Cuéllar called upon the two sides to meet with him in Geneva in August. There the two leaders – George Vasiliou and Rauf Denktaş – agreed to abandon the Draft Framework Agreement and return to the 1977 and 1979 High Level Agreements. However, the talks faltered when the Greek Cypriots announced their intention to apply for membership of the European Community (EC, subsequently EU), a move strongly opposed by the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey. Nevertheless, in June 1989, de Cuellar presented the two communities with the &quot;Set of Ideas&quot;. Denktaş quickly rejected them as he not only opposed the provisions, he also argued that the UN Secretary-General had no right to present formal proposals to the two sides. The two sides met again, in New York, in February 1990. However, the talks were again short lived. This time Denktaş demanded that the Greek Cypriots recognise the existence of two peoples in Cyprus and the basic right of the Turkish Cypriots to self-determination.

On 4 July 1990, Cyprus formally applied to join the EC. The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey, which had applied for membership in 1987, were outraged. Denktaş claimed that Cyprus could only join the Community at the same time as Turkey and called off all talks with UN officials. Nevertheless, in September 1990, the EC member states unanimously agreed to refer the Cypriot application to the commission for formal consideration. In retaliation, Turkey and the TRNC signed a joint declaration abolishing passport controls and introducing a customs union just weeks later. Undeterred, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar continued his search for a solution throughout 1991. He made no progress. In his last report to the Security Council, presented in October 1991 under United Nations Security Council Resolution 716, he blamed the failure of the talks on Denktaş, noting the Turkish Cypriot leader&#x27;s demand that the two communities should have equal sovereignty and a right to secession.

On 3 April 1992, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the new UN Secretary-General, presented the Security Council with the outline plan for the creation of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation that would prohibit any form of partition, secession or union with another state. While the Greek Cypriots accepted the Set of Ideas as a basis for negotiation, Denktaş again criticised the UN Secretary-General for exceeding his authority. When he did eventually return to the table, the Turkish Cypriot leader complained that the proposals failed to recognise his community. In November, Ghali brought the talks to a halt. He now decided to take a different approach and tried to encourage the two sides to show goodwill by accepting eight confidence building measures (CBMs). These included reducing military forces on the island, transferring Varosha to direct UN control, reducing restrictions on contacts between the two sides, undertaking an island-wide census and conducting feasibility studies regarding a solution. The Security Council endorsed the approach.

On 24 May 1993, the Secretary-General formally presented the two sides with his CBMs. Denktaş, while accepting some of the proposals, was not prepared to agree to the package as a whole. Meanwhile, on 30 June, the European Commission returned its opinion on the Cypriot application for membership. While the decision provided a ringing endorsement of the case for Cypriot membership, it refrained from opening the way for immediate negotiations. The Commission stated that it felt that the issue should be reconsidered in January 1995, taking into account &quot;the positions adopted by each party in the talks&quot;. A few months later, in December 1993, Glafcos Clerides proposed the demilitarisation of Cyprus. Denktaş dismissed the idea, but the next month he announced that he would be willing to accept the CBMs in principle. Proximity talks started soon afterwards. In March 1994, the UN presented the two sides with a draft document outlining the proposed measures in greater detail. Clerides said that he would be willing to accept the document if Denktaş did, but the Turkish Cypriot leader refused on the grounds that it would upset the balance of forces on the island. Once again, Ghali had little choice but to pin the blame for another breakdown of talks on the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas would be willing to accept mutually agreed changes, but Clerides refused to negotiate any further changes to the March proposals. Further proposals put forward by the Secretary-General in an attempt to break the deadlock were rejected by both sides.

===Deadlock and legal battles, 1994–1997===
At the Corfu European Council, held on 24–25 June 1994, the EU officially confirmed that Cyprus would be included in the Union&#x27;s next phase of enlargement. Two weeks later, on 5 July, the European Court of Justice imposed restrictions on the export of goods from Northern Cyprus into the European Union. Soon afterwards, in December, relations between the EU and Turkey were further damaged when Greece blocked the final implementation of a customs union. As a result, talks remained completely blocked throughout 1995 and 1996.

In December 1996, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) delivered a landmark ruling that declared that Turkey was an occupying power in Cyprus. The case – Loizidou v. Turkey – centred on Titina Loizidou, a refugee from Kyrenia, who was judged to have been unlawfully denied the control of her property by Turkey. The case also had severe financial implications as the Court later ruled that Turkey should pay Mrs Loizidou US$825,000 in compensation for the loss of use of her property. Ankara rejected the ruling as politically motivated.

After twenty years of talks, a settlement seemed as far off as ever. However, the basic parameters of a settlement were by now internationally agreed. Cyprus would be a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation. A solution would also be expected to address the following issues:
* Constitutional framework
* Territorial adjustments
* Return of property to pre-1974 owners and/or compensation payments
* Return of displaced persons
* Demilitarisation of Cyprus
* Residency rights/repatriation of Turkish settlers
* Future peacekeeping arrangements

====August 1996 incidents====
In August 1996, Greek Cypriot refugees demonstrated with a motorcycle protest in Deryneia against the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. The ‘Motorcyclists March’ involved 2000 bikers from European countries and was organised by the Motorcyclists’ Federation of Cyprus. The rally begun from Berlin to Kyrenia (a city in Occupied Cyprus) in commemoration of the twenty-second year of Cyprus as a divided country and aimed to cross the border using peaceful means. The demonstrators&#x27; demand was the complete withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of Cypriot refugees to their homes and properties. Among them was Tassos Isaac who was beaten to death.

Another man, Solomos Solomou, was shot to death by Turkish troops while he was climbing to a flagpole to strike Turkish Flag during the same protests on 14 August 1996. An investigation by authorities of the Republic of Cyprus followed, and the suspects were named as Kenan Akin and Erdan Emanet. International legal proceedings were instigated and arrest warrants for both were issued via Interpol. During the demonstrations on 14 August 1996, two British soldiers were also shot by the Turkish forces: Neil Emery and Jeffrey Hudson, both from 39th Regiment Royal Artillery. Bombardier Emery was shot in his arm, whilst Gunner Hudson was shot in the leg by a high velocity rifle round and was airlifted to hospital in Nicosia then on to RAF Akrotiri.

====Missile crisis====
The situation took another turn for the worse at the start of 1997 when the Greek Cypriots announced that they intended to purchase the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. Soon afterwards, the Cyprus Missile Crisis started. The crisis effectively ended in December 1998 with the decision of the Cypriot government to transfer the S-300s to Crete, in exchange for alternative weapons from Greece.

==EU accession and the settlement process, 1997–present==


In 1997 the basic parameters of the Cyprus Dispute changed. A decision by the European Union to open up accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus created a new catalyst for a settlement. Among those who supported the move, the argument was made that Turkey could not have a veto on Cypriot accession and that the negotiations would encourage all sides to be more moderate. However, opponents of the move argued that the decision would remove the incentive of the Greek Cypriots to reach a settlement. They would instead wait until they became a member and then use this strength to push for a settlement on their terms. In response to the decision, Rauf Denktaş announced that he would no longer accept federation as a basis for a settlement. In the future he would only be prepared to negotiate on the basis of a confederal solution. In December 1999 tensions between Turkey and the European Union eased somewhat after the EU decided to declare Turkey a candidate for EU membership, a decision taken at the Helsinki European Council. At the same time a new round of talks started in New York. These were short lived. By the following summer they had broken down. Tensions started to rise again as a showdown between Turkey and the European Union loomed over the island&#x27;s accession.

Perhaps realising the gravity of the situation, and in a move that took observers by surprise, Rauf Denktaş wrote to Glafcos Clerides on 8 November 2001 to propose a face-to-face meeting. The offer was accepted. Following several informal meetings between the two men in November and December 2001 a new peace process started under UN auspices on 14 January 2002. At the outset the stated aim of the two leaders was to try to reach an agreement by the start of June that year. However, the talks soon became deadlocked. In an attempt to break the impasse, Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General visited the island in May that year. Despite this no deal was reached. After a summer break Annan met with the two leaders again that autumn, first in Paris and then in New York. As a result of the continued failure to reach an agreement, the Security Council agreed that the Secretary-General should present the two sides with a blueprint settlement. This would form the basis of further negotiations. The original version of the UN peace plan was presented to the two sides by Annan on 11 November 2002. A little under a month later, and following modifications submitted by the two sides, it was revised (Annan II). It was hoped that this plan would be agreed by the two sides on the margins of the European Council, which was held in Copenhagen on 13 December. However, Rauf Denktaş, who was recuperating from major heart surgery, declined to attend. After Greece threatened to veto the entire enlargement process unless Cyprus was included in the first round of accession, the EU was forced to confirm that Cyprus would join the EU on 1 May 2004, along with Malta and eight other states from Central and Eastern Europe.

Although it had been expected that talks would be unable to continue, discussions resumed in early January 2003. Thereafter, a further revision (Annan III) took place in February 2003, when Annan made a second visit to the island. During his stay he also called on the two sides to meet with him again the following month in The Hague, where he would expect their answer on whether they were prepared to put the plan to a referendum. While the Greek Cypriot side, which was now led by Tassos Papadopoulos, agreed to do so, albeit reluctantly, Rauf Denktaş refused to allow a popular vote. The peace talks collapsed. A month later, on 16 April 2003, Cyprus formally signed the EU Treaty of Accession at a ceremony in Athens.

Throughout the rest of the year there was no effort to restart talks. Instead, attention turned to the Turkish Cypriot elections, which were widely expected to see a victory by moderate pro-solution parties. In the end, the assembly was evenly split. A coalition administration was formed that brought together the pro-solution CTP and the Democrat Party, which had traditionally taken the line adopted by Rauf Denktaş. This opened the way for Turkey to press for new discussions. After a meeting between Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Kofi Annan in Switzerland, the leaders of the two sides were called to New York. There they agreed to start a new negotiation process based on two phases: phase one, which would just involve the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, being held on the island and phase two, which would also include Greece and Turkey, being held elsewhere. After a month of negotiations in Cyprus, the discussions duly moved to Burgenstock, Switzerland. The Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktaş rejected the plan outright and refused to attend these talks. Instead, his son Serdar Denktaş and Mehmet Ali Talat attended in his place. There a fourth version of the plan was presented. This was short-lived. After final adjustments, a fifth and final version of the Plan was presented to the two sides on 31 March 2004.

===The UN plan for settlement (Annan Plan)===

Under the final proposals, the Republic of Cyprus would become the United Cyprus Republic. It would be a loose federation composed of two component states. The northern Turkish Cypriot constituent state would encompass about 28.5% of the island, the southern Greek Cypriot constituent state would be made up of the remaining 71.5%. Each part would have had its own parliament. There would also be a bicameral parliament on the federal level. In the Chamber of Deputies, the Turkish Cypriots would have 25% of the seats. (While no accurate figures are currently available, the split between the two communities at independence in 1960 was approximately 80:20 in favour of the Greek Cypriots.) The Senate would consist of equal parts of members of each ethnic group. Executive power would be vested in a presidential council. The chairmanship of this council would rotate between the communities. Each community would also have the right to veto all legislation.

One of the most controversial elements of the plan concerned property. During Turkey&#x27;s military intervention/invasion in 1974, many Greek Cypriots (who owned 70% of the land and property in the north) were forced to abandon their homes. (Thousands of Turkish Cypriots were also forced to abandon their homes in the South.) Since then, the question of restitution of their property has been a central demand of the Greek Cypriot side. However, the Turkish Cypriots argue that the complete return of all Greek Cypriot properties to their original owners would be incompatible with the functioning of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal settlement. To this extent, they have argued compensation should be offered. The Annan Plan attempted to bridge this divide. In certain areas, such as Morphou (Güzelyurt) and Famagusta (Gazimağusa), which would be returned to Greek Cypriot control, Greek Cypriot refugees would have received back all of their property according to a phased timetable. In other areas, such as Kyrenia (Girne) and the Karpass Peninsula, which would remain under Turkish Cypriot control, they would be given back a proportion of their land (usually one third assuming that it had not been extensively developed) and would receive compensation for the rest. All land and property (that was not used for worship) belonging to businesses and institutions, including the Church, the largest property owner on the island, would have been expropriated. While many Greek Cypriots found these provisions unacceptable in themselves, many others resented the fact that the Plan envisaged all compensation claims by a particular community to be met by their own side. This was seen as unfair as Turkey would not be required to contribute any funds towards the compensation.

Apart from the property issue, there were many other parts of the plan that sparked controversy. For example, the agreement envisaged the gradual reduction in the number of Greek and Turkish troops on the island. After six years, the number of soldiers from each country would be limited to 6,000. This would fall to 600 after 19 years. Thereafter, the aim would be to try to achieve full demilitarisation, a process that many hoped would be made possible by Turkish accession to the European Union. The agreement also kept in place the Treaty of Guarantee – an integral part of the 1960 constitution that gave Britain, Greece and Turkey a right to intervene militarily in the island&#x27;s affairs. Many Greek Cypriots were concerned that the continuation of the right of intervention would give Turkey too large a say in the future of the island. However, most Turkish Cypriots felt that a continued Turkish military presence was necessary to ensure their security. Another element of the plan the Greek Cypriots objected to was that it allowed many Turkish citizens who had been brought to the island to remain. (The exact number of these Turkish &#x27;settlers&#x27; is highly disputed. Some argue that the figure is as high as 150,000 or as low as 40,000. They are seen as settlers illegally brought to the island in contravention of international law. However, while many accepted Greek Cypriot concerns on this matter, there was a widespread feeling that it would be unrealistic – and legally and morally problematic – to forcibly remove every one of these settlers, especially as many of them had been born and raised on the island.)

===Referendums, 24 April 2004===

Under the terms of the plan, the Annan plan would only come into force if accepted by the two communities in simultaneous referendums. These were set for 24 April 2004. In the weeks that followed there was intense campaigning in both communities. However, and in spite of opposition from Rauf Denktaş, who had boycotted the talks in Switzerland, it soon became clear that the Turkish Cypriots would vote in favour of the agreement. Among Greek Cypriots opinion was heavily weighted against the plan. Tassos Papadopoulos, the president of Cyprus, in a speech delivered on 7 April called on Greek Cypriots to reject the plan. His position was supported by the centrist Diko party and the socialists of EDEK as well as other smaller parties. His major coalition partner AKEL, one of the largest parties on the island, chose to reject the plan bowing to the wishes of the majority of the party base. Support for the plan was voiced by Democratic Rally (DISY) leadership, the main right-wing party, despite opposition to the plan from the majority of party followers, and the United Democrats, a small centre-left party led by George Vasiliou, a former president. Glafcos Clerides, now retired from politics, also supported the plan. Prominent members of DISY who did not support the Annan plan split from the party and openly campaigned against it. The Greek Cypriot Church also opposed the plan in line with the views of the majority of public opinion.

The United Kingdom (a Guarantor Power) and the United States came out in favour of the plan. Turkey signalled its support for the plan. The Greek Government decided to remain neutral. However, Russia was troubled by an attempt by Britain and the US to introduce a resolution in the UN Security Council supporting the plan and used its veto to block the move. This was done because they believed that the resolution would provide external influence to the internal debate, which they did not view as fair.

In 24 April referendum the Turkish Cypriots endorsed the plan by a margin of almost two to one. However, the Greek Cypriots resoundingly voted against the plan, by a margin of about three to one.

===The Cyprus dispute after the referendum===

In 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community was awarded &quot;observer status&quot; in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), as part of the Cypriot delegation. Since then, two Turkish Cypriot representatives of PACE have been elected in the Assembly of Northern Cyprus.

On 1 May 2004, a week after the referendum, Cyprus joined the European Union. Under the terms of accession the whole island is considered to be a member of the European Union. However, the terms of the &quot;acquis communautaire&quot;, the EU&#x27;s body of laws, have been suspended in Northern Cyprus.

After the referendum, in June 2004, the Turkish Cypriot community, despite the objection of the Cypriot government, had its designation at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, of which it has been an observer since 1979, changed to the &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;.

Despite initial hopes that a new process to modify the rejected plan would start by autumn, most of the rest of 2004 was taken up with discussions over a proposal by the European Union to open up direct trade with the Turkish Cypriots and provide €259,000,000 in funds to help them upgrade their infrastructure. This provoked considerable debate. The Greek Cypriots stated that there can be no direct trade via ports and airports in Northern Cyprus as these are unrecognised and said that Turkish Cypriots should use Greek Cypriot facilities in the south are they are internationally recognised. This was rejected by the Turkish Cypriots as insincere and mocking by Papadopoulos and his government. At the same time, attention turned to the question of the start of Turkey&#x27;s future membership of the European Union. At a European Council held on 17 December 2004, and despite earlier Greek Cypriot threats to impose a veto, Turkey was granted a start date for formal membership talks on condition that it signed a protocol extending the customs union to the new entrants to the EU, including Cyprus. Assuming this was done, formal membership talks would begin on 3 October 2005.

Following the defeat of the UN plan in the referendum there has been no attempt to restart negotiations between the two sides. While both sides have reaffirmed their commitment to continuing efforts to reach an agreement, the UN Secretary-General has not been willing to restart the process until he can be sure that any new negotiations will lead to a comprehensive settlement based on the plan he put forward in 2004. To this end, he asked the Greek Cypriots to present a written list of the changes they would like to see made to the agreement. This was rejected by President Tassos Papadopoulos on the grounds that no side should be expected to present their demands in advance of negotiations. However, it appears as though the Greek Cypriots would be prepared to present their concerns orally. Another Greek Cypriot concern centres on the procedural process for new talks. Mr. Papadopoulos said that he would not accept arbitration or timetables for discussions. The UN fears that this would lead to another open-ended process that could drag on indefinitely.

In October 2012, Northern Cyprus became an &quot;observer member&quot; country of the Economic Cooperation Organization under the name &quot;Turkish Cypriot State&quot;.

According to Stratis Efthymiou, even though defeated, the referendum had a formative impact on the Greek Cypriot community; Greek Cypriots felt that reunification is a touchable reality, and this undermined the nationalist struggle and ideas of military defence. According to Efthymiou, since the referendum, the phenomenon of draft dodging has become prevalent and the defence budget has turned into a trivial amount.

===Formula One and the Cyprus dispute===
The podium display after the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix caused a controversy, when winner Felipe Massa received the trophy from Mehmet Ali Talat, who was referred to as the &quot;President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;. The government of the Republic of Cyprus filed an official complaint with the FIA. After investigating the incident, the FIA fined the organisers of the Grand Prix $5 million on 19 September 2006. The Turkish Motorsports Federation (TOSFED) and the organisers of the Turkish Grand Prix (MSO) agreed to pay half the fined sum pending an appeal to be heard by the FIA International Court of Appeal on 7 November 2006. TOSFED insisted the move was not planned and that Talat did fit FIA&#x27;s criteria for podium presentations as a figure of world standing. It is likely that the FIA wanted to repair their impartiality in international politics, the FIA stood their ground forcing the appeal to be withdrawn.

===2008 elections in the Republic of Cyprus===

In the 2008 presidential elections, Papadopoulos was defeated by AKEL candidate Dimitris Christofias, who pledged to restart talks on reunification immediately. Speaking on the election result, Mehmet Ali Talat stated that &quot;this forthcoming period will be a period during which the Cyprus problem can be solved within a reasonable space of time – despite all difficulties – provided that there is will&quot;. Christofias held his first meeting as president with the Turkish Cypriot leader on 21 March 2008 in the UN buffer zone in Nicosia. At the meeting, the two leaders agreed to launch a new round of &quot;substantive&quot; talks on reunification, and to reopen Ledra Street, which has been cut in two since the intercommunal violence of the 1960s and has come to symbolise the island&#x27;s division. On 3 April 2008, after barriers had been removed, the Ledra Street crossing was reopened in the presence of Greek and Turkish Cypriot officials.

===2008–2012 negotiations and tripartite meetings===
A first meeting of the technical committees was set to take place on 18 April 2008. Talat and Christofias met socially at a cocktail party on 7 May 2008, and agreed to meet regularly to review the progress of the talks so far. A second formal summit was held on 23 May 2008 to review the progress made in the technical committees. At a meeting on 1 July 2008, the two leaders agreed in principle on the concepts of a single citizenship and a single sovereignty, and decided to start direct reunification talks very soon; on the same date, former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer was appointed as the new UN envoy for Cyprus. Christofias and Talat agreed to meet again on 25 July 2008 for a final review of the preparatory work before the actual negotiations would start. Christofias was expected to propose a rotating presidency for the united Cypriot state. Talat stated he expected they would set a date to start the talks in September, and reiterated that he would not agree to abolishing the guarantor roles of Turkey and Greece, with a reunification plan would be put to referendums in both communities after negotiations.

In December 2008, the Athenian socialist daily newspaper &quot;To Vima&quot; described a &quot;crisis&quot; in relations between Christofias and Talat, with the Turkish Cypriots beginning to speak openly of a loose &quot;confederation&quot;, an idea strongly opposed by South Nicosia. Tensions were further exacerbated by Turkey&#x27;s harassment of Cypriot vessels engaged in oil exploration in the island&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone, and by the Turkish Cypriot leadership&#x27;s alignment with Ankara&#x27;s claim that Cyprus has no continental shelf.

On 29 April 2009, Talat stated that if the Court of Appeal of England and Wales (that will put the last point in Orams&#x27; case) makes a decision in the same spirit as the decision of European Court of Justice (ECJ) then the negotiation process in Cyprus will be damaged in such a way that it will never be repaired once more. The European Commission warned the Republic of Cyprus not to turn Orams&#x27; legal fight to keep their holiday home into a political battle over the divided island.

On 31 January 2010, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Cyprus to accelerate talks aimed at reuniting the country. The election of nationalist Derviş Eroğlu of the National Unity Party as president in Northern Cyprus on was expected to complicate reunification negotiations; however, Eroǧlu stated that he was now also in favour of a federal state, a change from his previous positions.

A series of five tripartite meetings took place from 2010 to 2012, with Ban, Christofias and Eroǧlu negotiating, but without any agreement on the main issues. When asked about the process in March 2011, Ban replied &quot;The negotiations cannot be an open-ended process, nor can we afford interminable talks for the sake of talks&quot;. That month saw the 100th negotiation since April 2008 without any agreement over the main issues- a deadlock that continued through the next year and a half despite a renewed push for Cyprus to unite and take over the EU presidency in 2012.

Talks began to fall apart in 2012, with Ban Ki-moon stating that &quot;there is not enough progress on core issues of reunification talks for calling an international conference&quot;. Special Advisor of the Secretary-General Alexander Downer further commented that &quot;If the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot Leaders cannot agree with each other on a model for a united Cyprus, then United Nations cannot make them&quot;. Eroglu stated that joint committees with the Greek Cypriot side had been set up to take confidence-building measures in September that year, but negotiations were suspended in early 2013 because of a change of government in the Greek Cypriot community of Cyprus. On 11 February 2014, Alexander Downer, UN Secretary-General&#x27;s special adviser, stepped down. The Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders declared a Joint Communique.

===2014 renewed talks===
In February 2014, renewed negotiations to settle the Cyprus dispute began after several years of warm relations between the north and the south. On 11 February 2014, the leaders of Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, Nicos Anastasiades and Derviş Eroğlu, respectively, revealed the following joint declaration:

The governments of both Greece and Turkey expressed their support for renewed peace talks. The declaration was also welcomed by the European Union.

On 13 February 2014, Archbishop Chrysostomos lent Anastasiades his backing on the Joint Declaration.

On 14 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot negotiator Andreas Mavroyiannis and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Kudret Özersay held their first meeting and agreed to visit Greece and Turkey respectively.

Reactions among the Greek Cypriot political parties were mixed. The opposition AKEL party declared its support for the declaration. However, Nicolas Papadopoulos, the leader of DIKO, the main partner to Anastasiades&#x27; party DISY in the governing coalition, opposed the declaration, and DIKO&#x27;s executive committee voted on 21 February to recommend to the party&#x27;s central committee that the party withdraw from the coalition from 4 March. On 27 February, DIKO decided to leave the coalition government, with the explanation that the Joint Declaration had conceded separate sovereignty to Turkish Cypriots.

On 15 May 2015, in the first Akıncı–Anastasiades negotiation meeting, Northern Cyprus lifted visa requirements for Greek Cypriots, and Anastasiades presented maps of 28 minefields in the north, near the mountainous region of Pentadaktilos.

===2015–2017 talks===

The President of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, and President of Northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akıncı, met for the first time and restarted peace talks on 12 May 2015. On 7 July 2017, the UN-sponsored talks which had been held in the Swiss Alps for the previous 10 days were brought to a halt after negotiations broke down. Cyprus talks in Crans-Montana ended without a peace and reunification deal.

On 1 October 2017, former British foreign secretary Jack Straw stated that only a partitioned island would bring the dispute between Turkish and Greek Cypriots to an end. On 2 October, Turkish Cypriot FM Tahsin Ertugruloglu said federation on island is impossible.

In late 2017, Business Monitor International, part of the Fitch Group, downgraded its assessment of a new Cyprus unification deal from slim to extremely remote.

===2018–present===

In June 2018, in an attempt to jump-start the talks, UN Secretary-General António Guterres appointed Jane Holl Lute as his new adviser for Cyprus. Her mission was to consult the two Cypriot leaders, Nicos Anastasiades and Mustafa Akıncı, and the three guarantor parties (Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom) to determine if favourable conditions existed to resume UN-hosted negotiations and, if so, to prepare comprehensive &quot;terms of reference&quot;. Lute conducted a first round of consultations in September 2018, a second in October 2018, a third in January 2019, and a fourth and final round on 7 April 2019, and found that both sides were seemingly farther apart.

On 12 November 2018, the Dherynia checkpoint on the island&#x27;s east coast and the Lefka-Aplikli checkpoint 52 km west of Nicosia were opened that brought the total crossing points to nine along the island&#x27;s 180 km long buffer zone.

On 5 February 2019, Greece and Turkey stated they wanted to defuse tensions between them through dialogue, including regarding the Cyprus dispute. Another dispute over oil and gas explorations in the waters of Cyprus&#x27; exclusive economic zone between the different parties is however keeping them from renewing talks.

On 25 November 2019, Guterres, Anastasiades and Akıncı came together at an informal dinner in Berlin and discussed the next steps on the Cyprus issue. Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots could not however agree &quot;terms of reference&quot; to restart phased, meaningful, and results-oriented Cyprus negotiations.

On 20 January 2020, the United Nations special envoy for Cyprus said that &quot;there&#x27;s growing scepticism as to whether reunification is still possible&quot; as negotiations remained deadlocked.

In February 2020, Mustafa Akıncı, the President of Northern Cyprus, said in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that if the reunification efforts in Cyprus failed then northern Cyprus would grow increasingly dependent on Turkey and could end up being swallowed up, as a de facto Turkish province, adding that the prospect of a Crimea-style annexation would be &quot;horrible&quot;. Turkish officials condemned him. Turkey&#x27;s vice-president Fuat Oktay said: &quot;I condemn the remarks that target Republic of Turkey which stands with TRNC in all conditions and protect its rights and interests.&quot; Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said that Akıncı does not deserve to be president, adding that many Turkish Cypriots and Turkish soldiers lost their lives (for Cyprus) and that Turkey has no designs on the soil of any country. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gül criticised Akıncı&#x27;s remarks, which he said hurt the ancestors and martyrs. In addition, Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Ersin Tatar criticised Akıncı.

No Cyprus unity talks breakthrough were seen in 2020. Nicos Rolandis (foreign minister of Cyprus 1978–1983 and commerce minister 1998–2003) said a political settlement to Cyprus dispute is almost impossible for now. Prime Minister Ersin Tatar, who supports a two-state solution, won the 2020 Northern Cypriot presidential election.

Since the election of Ersin Tatar, both Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots insist a two-state solution is the only option. Greece, Cyprus, the EU and the United Nations maintain a federation as the only solution which has led to a freeze in talks since 2020.

On 30 January 2022, Tatar specified that sovereign equality and the equal international status of the Turkish Cypriots are non-negotiable.

On 11 November 2022, Northern Cyprus became a non-member observer state of the Organisation of Turkic States (OTS) with its official name &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;. The Cypriot government condemned this action. The European Union also condemned it and &quot;expressed strong support to the principle of territorial integrity and the UN Charter.&quot;

On 29 April 2023, Northern Cyprus became an observer member state of the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic States (TURKPA) with its official name &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;.

On 5 July 2024, the mandate of the UN Secretary General personal envoy, María Ángela Holguín, ended. Holguín found no common ground for Cyprus solution. In parting letter, Holguín called for Cypriots to &quot;think differently&quot; to find a solution to the Cyprus problem.

On 15 October 2024, the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, stated that there is no common ground between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus for negotiations.

==Opinion on solutions==
Peace scholars have suggested that a solution to the Cyprus conflict can only be found by including society on a broad base, as political elites were treating the conflict as a source of power and resources.

===Reunification of Cyprus===
An international panel of legal experts proposed the &quot;creation of a Constitutional Convention under European Union auspices and on the basis of the 1960 Cyprus Constitution to bring together the parties directly concerned in order to reach a settlement in conformity with the Fundamental Principles&quot;.
In an official White House statement on 8 June 2016, US Vice-president Joe Biden and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim reaffirmed strong support for &quot;an agreement that reunifies the island as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation&quot;. After the collapse of Crans-Montana Summit in 2017, the Turkish Cypriot leadership and Turkey changed their policy from bi-zonal, bi-communal federation to the two-state solution.

At least since 1991, the United Nations Security Council has described its desired solution as &quot;a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality&quot;. The most recent expression of this opinion, in January 2025, was unanimous.

===Two-state solution===
Turkey has often expressed its support for the two-state solution, most notably by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan during his visit to Northern Cyprus in 2020. 
A number of observers suggest partition is the best solution.

===Polls===
In April 2009, an opinion poll conducted for the CyBC showed that the majority of Greek Cypriots supported partition.

In an opinion poll in 2010, 84% of Greek Cypriots and 70% of Turkish Cypriots assumed that: &quot;the other side would never accept the actual compromises and concessions that are needed for a fair and viable settlement&quot;.

According to a January 2020 poll by Gezici, the two-state solution had a support rate of 81.3% among Turkish Cypriots.

In an opinion poll conducted in May 2021 by CyBC, 36% of Greek Cypriots considered that the best solution to the Cyprus problem was a bizonal bicommunal federation, 19% considered a unitary state, and 4% considered two separate states.

In an opinion poll conducted by Cypronetwork among Greek Cypriots on behalf of the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation (CyBC) in 2022, 36% stated that the best solution to the Cyprus problem was a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation, 18% stated two separate states was the best option, 19% preferred a &quot;unitary state&quot;, and 13% favoured the status quo.

==Relevant court cases==
International law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence, and the recognition of a country is a political issue.

* On 2 July 2013, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) decided that &quot;...notwithstanding the lack of international recognition of the regime in the northern area, a de facto recognition of its acts may be rendered necessary for practical purposes. Thus the adoption by the authorities of the &quot;TRNC&quot; of civil, administrative or criminal law measures, and their application or enforcement within that territory, may be regarded as having a legal basis in domestic law for the purposes of the Convention&quot;.
* On 9 October 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia stated that &quot;the TRNC purportedly operates as a democratic republic with a president, prime minister, legislature and judiciary&quot;.
* On 2 September 2015, ECtHR decided that &quot;...the court system set up in the &quot;TRNC&quot; was to be considered to have been &quot;established by law&quot; with reference to the &quot;constitutional and legal basis&quot; on which it operated, and it has not accepted the allegation that the &quot;TRNC&quot; courts as a whole lacked independence and/or impartiality&quot;.
* On 3 February 2017, the United Kingdom&#x27;s High Court stated &quot;There was no duty in the United Kingdom law upon the Government to refrain from recognizing Northern Cyprus. The United Nations itself works with Northern Cyprus law enforcement agencies and facilitates co-operation between the two parts of the island&quot;. and revealed that the co-operation between the United Kingdom police and law agencies in Northern Cyprus is legal.
* On 25.06.2024, The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) decided that the case of Northern Cyprus is different from the cases of Crimea, Transnistria, and Abkhazia in terms of judicial perspective:
&quot;930. Whereas the Court held that “TRNC domestic law” was based on the Anglo-Saxon legal tradition and was therefore accepted as “law” for the purposes of the Convention, in cases concerning Transdniestria (the “MRT”), the Court found “no basis for assuming that [in the ‘MRT’] there is a system reflecting a judicial tradition compatible with the Convention similar to the one in the remainder of the Republic of Moldova&quot;. The Court has reached similar conclusions regarding the &quot;law&quot; of Abkhazia and the &quot;lawfulness&quot; of Abkhaz courts.
932...Moreover, while the &quot;MRT&quot; and Abkhaz-related cases concerned the &quot;law&quot; of unrecognised entities that did not reflect &quot;a judicial tradition ... similar to the one in the remainder of the Republic of Moldova&quot; or &quot;to the rest of Georgia&quot; respectively, in Cyprus v. Turkey (merits) the Court held that &quot;the civil courts operating in the ’TRNC’ were in substance based on the Anglo‑Saxon tradition and were not essentially different from the courts operating before the events of 1974 and from those which existed in the southern part of Cyprus&quot;. This particular aspect makes the latter case similar, yet different from the present case. The Cyprus v. Turkey case concerned the continued application of pre-existing Cypriot law valid in the territory of the &quot;TRNC&quot; before Turkey had obtained actual control of that territory, whereas the present case concerns the application in Crimea of the law of the Russian Federation (or the &quot;law&quot; of the local authorities, as its derivative) replacing the previously applicable and valid Ukrainian law.&quot;

<text>The Pacific loon or Pacific diver (Gavia pacifica), is a medium-sized member of the loon, or diver, family.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Pacific loon, previously considered conspecific with the similar black-throated loon, was classified as a separate species in 1985. The genus name &quot;Gavia&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;sea mew&quot;, as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific epithet &quot;pacifica&quot; is Latin for the Pacific Ocean, the term meaning &quot;peaceful&quot;.
The phylogeny of this species is debated, with the black-throated loon and the Pacific loon traditionally being considered sister species, whereas a study using mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA supported placing the black-throated loon sister to a clade consisting of the Pacific loon and the two sister species that are the common loon and the yellow-billed loon. In the former phylogeny, the split between the Pacific loon and the black-throated loon is proposed to have happened about 6.5 million years ago.

==Description==
Breeding adults are like a smaller sleeker version of common loon. They measure in length, in wingspan and weigh . They have a grey head, black throat, white underparts and chequered black-and-white mantle. The black throat has purple reflections. Non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin and foreneck white. Its bill is grey or whitish and dagger-shaped.

In all plumages, lack of a white flank patch distinguishes this species from the otherwise very similar black-throated loon. The Pacific loon can be differentiated from the red-throated loon in winter by the latter&#x27;s paler look, the fact that the red-throated loon has less of a contrast between both the crown and hindneck and the throat, and the bill that looks to be upturned.

Like other gaviiformes, the Pacific loon&#x27;s legs are located towards the back of its body making it difficult for it to walk on land. The leg placement helps the loons efficiently forage for food underwater. The physiological structure of the Pacific loon makes taking off from land practically impossible, and the loon requires 30–50 yards on the water to successfully attain flight. This distance requirement for takeoff limits the number of lakes the Pacific loon can realistically breed and forage on.

=== Calls ===
The Pacific loon most actively calls in the spring and summer and has a wide range of calls. When feeding, the Pacific loon may produce an &quot;ark&quot;-like vocalization, a sharp, short call. Additionally, the Pacific loon has a call similar to that of its relative the common loon, it is a loud, eerie, oo-loo-lee wail or yodel that can travel for miles and is typically heard during the loon&#x27;s breeding season. The loons can also make short and harsh &quot;kok-kok-kok-kok&quot; calls along with a range of other smaller cackles, growls, barks, and clucking noises.

==Habitat and range==
The Pacific loon breeds on tundra lakes, and winters in the open ocean or other large bodies of water. It breeds primarily in northern Canada and eastern Siberia, and winters along the Pacific coast of North America.

===Movements===
Unlike other loons/divers, this bird may migrate in flocks. It winters at sea, mainly on the Pacific coast, or on large lakes over a much wider range, including China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, United States and Mexico. It has occurred as a vagrant to Greenland, Hong Kong, Great Britain, Spain, Finland and Switzerland (Dec 2015).

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The Pacific loon constructs its nest on the ground near deep lakes. This nest is made out of piled-up vegetation.

This loon lays a clutch of one to two light buff or green eggs with brown spots of various sizes. These eggs typically measure . Although the eggs are laid a few days a part, they can usually be seen to hatch at intervals not more than a day. Incubation lasts 23 to 25 days.

=== Territoriality ===
Socially monogamous Pacific loons have been found to have high territory retention rates (0.92) indicating that the loons are able to successfully defend their nesting lake from other loon pairs or individuals who may be trying to move in. Furthermore, males have a greater success at territory retention than females, but no evidence suggests that this difference is attributed to size but is rather due to fighting ability or familiarity with territory.

Pacific loons prospecting for a new lake frequently visited lakes that were already occupied, this along with high retention rates of lakes indicates that the loon population in Northern Alaska may be saturated. The Pacific loon has also been known to be very aggressive, engaging in interspecific killing of both hatch year and after hatch year individuals who intentionally or accidentally approach the loon&#x27;s nesting area.

A pair of Pacific loons will defend young as a parental unit in which one parent protects the nest or fledglings while the other parent aggressively attacks the perceived threat. If the threat is another animal on the water, the attacking loon will extend its head and neck in an aggressive manner and dive under the threat in an attempt to stab it with its beak as it resurfaces. Pacific loons are so aggressive, they have even been observed displaying threatening body language towards passing airplanes in Alaska.

===Diet===
This species, like all divers/loons, is a specialist fish-eater, catching its prey underwater. It also forages in groups, usually swimming under schools of fish and forcing them up towards the surface. It does, although, generally feed closer to the shore than other loons.

== Conservation ==
The Pacific loon population is currently increasing and is spread over a wide range of approximately 15,700,000 square kilometers. Current efforts of conservation are focused around loon population monitoring and maintaining accurate counts of populations and breeding behaviors. A recent in depth study of the Pacific loon population in the Western Alaskan Arctic found that the population of the birds there is actually ~1.5-2.0 times larger than previous aerial surveillance had indicated. The study indicated potential encroachment upon the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA), one of the Pacific loons primary breeding grounds, by natural gas and oil companies as a potential threat to Pacific loons.

One harmful environmental pollutant to the Pacific loon population is heavy metals like mercury, which can be observed in their habitat as a result of legacy mining in the areas the loons migrate through and hunt in. It has been shown that elevated levels of mercury in the environment poses a significant health risk to avian piscivores like the Pacific loon. Mercury is up-taken by small fish which is a primary source of food in a loon&#x27;s diet. When a loon eats the fish it will incorporate the mercury from the fish into its body, which can cause adverse health effects.

Additionally, it has been shown that nest visits from researchers and capture events can have a significant impact on the survival rates within Pacific loon nests. When investigators capture Pacific loons while they are breeding or incubating eggs regardless of how close they are to the nest at the time of capture, the survival rates of the eggs decrease. This is most likely due to the fact that Pacific loons nest in a traditionally remote part of Western Alaska and are not typically accustomed to human interaction of any form. The lowered survival rate of the loon&#x27;s offspring when a parent is captured or the nest is visited indicates that the population could face severe consequences from encroaching human contact.

Reports also exist of Pacific loons ingesting polluted plastic, a problem that is becoming an increasingly high concern among avians in Canada and across the globe. Luckily, the diving foraging behavior of loons keeps them at a relatively low risk of death from overconsumption of plastic, as most of the polluted debris exists floating on the surface of the water rather than in the depths.

<text>Querelle is a 1982 English-language arthouse film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The film stars Brad Davis and was adapted from French author Jean Genet&#x27;s 1947 novel &quot;Querelle of Brest&quot;. The plot centers on the Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is both a thief and murderer. It was Fassbinder&#x27;s last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.

== Plot ==
When Belgian sailor Georges Querelle&#x27;s ship, &quot;Le Vengeur&quot;, arrives in Brest, he visits the &quot;Feria&quot;, a bar and brothel for sailors run by Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle&#x27;s brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane&#x27;s husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria&#x27;s illicit affairs with the assistance of his friend Mario, the corrupt police captain.

Querelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat. After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane. He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono&#x27;s maxim: &quot;That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.&quot; Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle&#x27;s &quot;loss&quot; to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight. Afterwards, Querelle has sex with Mario.

Back on the ship we discover a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him. Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil escape. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother. Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.

A perennial undercurrent in the film is that Querelle&#x27;s superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.

The film ends with the sailors aboard &quot;Le Vengeur&quot;, presumably about to leave port. A heartbroken Lysiane, spurned by Querelle, conducts a tarot reading for Robert: she realizes that he and Querelle were never brothers after all. As Lysiane laughs maniacally, we see Querelle&#x27;s birth record transcribed on-screen.

== Cast ==
* Brad Davis as Querelle
* Franco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon
* Jeanne Moreau as Lysiane
* Laurent Malet as Roger Bataille
* Hanno Pöschl as Robert / Gil
* Günther Kaufmann as Nono
* Burkhard Driest as Mario
* Roger Fritz as Marcellin
* Dieter Schidor as Vic Rivette

* Werner Asam as Worker
* Axel Bauer as Worker
* Neil Bell as Theo
* Robert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire
* Wolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire
* Frank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire

== Production ==
According to Genet&#x27;s biographer Edmund White, &quot;Querelle&quot; was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then &quot;took the linear narrative and jumbled it up&quot;. White quotes Schidor as saying &quot;Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn&#x27;t be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it&quot;.

Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, &quot;Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.&quot;

Stylistically, the film is inspired heavily by the works of erotic artist Tom of Finland. Besides costume design and hair styles, actors were posed in silhouettes and scenarios common to Tom Of Finland artwork. &quot;The director Rainer Werner Fassbinder took obvious cues from Tom of Finland in his 1982 film adaptation of Jean Genet’s novel Querelle. As the eponymous lead, actor Brad Davis was Tom’s sailor come to life.&quot;

== Soundtrack ==
* Jeanne Moreau – &quot;Each Man Kills the Things He Loves&quot; (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot;)
* &quot;Young and Joyful Bandit&quot; (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)

== Release ==
Released after the death of the director, &quot;Querelle&quot; sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 65% calculated based on 17 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.30/10. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Vincent Canby noted that &quot;Querelle&quot; was &quot;a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.&quot; Penny Ashbrook calls &quot;Querelle&quot; Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.&quot; Edmund White considers &quot;Querelle&quot; the only film based on Genet&#x27;s book that works, calling it &quot;visually as artificial and menacing as Genet&#x27;s prose.&quot; Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting &quot;You can&#x27;t smoke at the movies.&quot;

<text>Heinrich Ernst Ferdinand Guericke (25 February 1803, Wettin – 4 February 1878, Halle an der Saale), was a German theologian.

He was born at Wettin in Saxony and studied theology at the University of Halle, where he was appointed associate professor in 1829. He disapproved of the union between the Lutheran and the Reformed churches, which had been accomplished by the Prussian government in 1817, and in 1833 he joined the Old Lutherans. In 1835 he lost his professorship, but he regained it in 1840.

== Published works ==
Among his works were a biography of August Hermann Francke, &quot;August Hermann Francke. Eine Denkschrift zur Säcularfeier seines Todes&quot; (1827) — later translated into English as: &quot;The life of Augustus Herman Franké&quot; (1837). He was also the author of:
* &quot;Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte&quot; (1833); translated into English by William G. T. Shedd (2 volumes):

<text>The red-throated loon (North America) or red-throated diver (Britain and Ireland) (Gavia stellata) is a migratory aquatic bird found in the northern hemisphere. The most widely distributed member of the loon or diver family, it breeds primarily in Arctic regions, and winters in northern coastal waters. Ranging from in length, the red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world&#x27;s loons. In winter, it is a nondescript bird, greyish above fading to white below. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive reddish throat patch which is the basis for its common name. Fish form the bulk of its diet, though amphibians, invertebrates, and plant material are sometimes eaten as well. A monogamous species, red-throated loons form long-term pair bonds. Both members of the pair help to build the nest, incubate the eggs (generally two per clutch), and feed the hatched young.

The red-throated loon has a large global population and a significant global range, though some populations are declining. Oil spills, habitat degradation, pollution, and fishing nets are among the major threats this species faces. Natural predators—including various gull species, and both red and Arctic foxes, will take eggs and young. The species is protected by international treaties.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
First described by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now-defunct genus &quot;Colymbus&quot;, which contained grebes as well as loons. By 1788, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus. Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all belong to the same genus, it differs from the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology and may be the basal lineage of the genus. It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic. Analysis of molecular data together with the fossil record suggests the lineage of the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the Miocene, and that it may be most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species &quot;Gavia howardae&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Gavia&quot; comes from the Latin for &quot;sea mew&quot;, as used by ancient Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder. The specific epithet &quot;stellata&quot; is Latin for &quot;set with stars&quot; or &quot;starry&quot;, and refers to the bird&#x27;s speckled back in its non-breeding plumage. Members of the family Gavidae are known as &quot;loons&quot; in North America and &quot;divers&quot; in Great Britain and Ireland. The International Ornithological Congress uses the name &quot;red-throated loon&quot; for this species. &quot;Diver&quot; refers to the family&#x27;s underwater method of hunting for prey, while &quot;red-throated&quot; is a straightforward reference to the bird&#x27;s most distinctive breeding plumage feature. The word &quot;loon&quot; is thought to have derived from the Swedish , the Old Norse or Icelandic , or the Old Dutch , all of which mean &quot;lame&quot; or &quot;clumsy&quot;, and is a probable reference to the difficulty that all loons have in moving about on land. A local name from Willapa Harbor, Washington, was &quot;Quaker loon&quot;.

==Description==
Like the other members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their set-back position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.

The red-throated loon is the smallest and lightest of the world&#x27;s loon species, ranging from in length with a wingspan, and weighing . Like all loons, it is long-bodied and short-necked, with its legs set far back on its body. The sexes are similar in appearance, although males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females. In breeding plumage, the adult has a dark grey head and neck (with narrow black and white stripes on the back of the neck), a triangular red throat patch, white underparts, and a dark grey-brown mantle. It is the only loon with an all-dark back in breeding plumage. The non-breeding plumage is drabber with the chin, foreneck, and much of the face white, the top of the head and back of the neck grey, and considerable white speckling on the dark mantle. Its iris is carmine-red to burgundy in colour, its legs are black on the outer half and pale on the inner half, and the webs of its feet are pinkish-brown, with darker margins.

Its bill is thin, straight, and sharp, and often held at an uptilted angle. One of the bird&#x27;s North American folk names is pegging-awl loon, a reference to its sharply pointed bill, which resembles a sailmaker&#x27;s awl (a tool also known as a &quot;pegging awl&quot; in New England). Though the colour of the bill changes from black in summer to pale grey in winter, the timing of the colour change does not necessarily correspond to that of the bird&#x27;s overall plumage change. The nostrils are narrow slits located near the base of the bill.

When it first emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon is covered with fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is slightly paler on the sides of its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile&#x27;s plumage is similar to that of the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.
In flight, the red-throated loon has a distinctive profile; its small feet do not project far past the end of its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.

===Voice===
The adult red-throated loon has a number of vocalisations, which are used in different circumstances. In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles—&quot;kaa-kaa-kaa&quot; or &quot;kak-kak-kak&quot;, at roughly five calls per second. Its warning call, if disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call—&quot;aarOOao...aarOOao...&quot;—which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10 times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water. Known as the &quot;long call&quot;, it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons; the female&#x27;s contribution is longer and softer than her mate&#x27;s.

Young have a shrill closed-bill call, which they use in begging and to contact their parents. They also have a long call used in response to (and similar to that of) the long call of adults.

===Similar species===
At medium to close range, an adult red-throated loon in either breeding or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, at certain times in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white on the head and neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.

==Habitat and distribution==
 In contrast to other loons its main fishing grounds are not the breeding lake, but larger lakes or the sea. Several nests close to each other may occur in the same breeding lake.
The red-throated loon breeds primarily in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on the eastern part of the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size outweigh the limitations.

In North America, it winters regularly along both coasts, ranging as far south as the Baja California Peninsula and the Gulf of California in north-western Mexico; it has been recorded as a vagrant in the interior Mexican state of Hidalgo. Some of its folk names in north-eastern North America—including cape race, cape brace, cape drake and cape racer, as well as corruptions such as scapegrace—originated from its abundance around Cape Race, Newfoundland. In Europe, it breeds in Iceland, northern Scotland, north-western Ireland (only a few pairs), Scandinavia and northern Russia, and winters along the coast as far south as parts of Spain; it also regularly occurs along major inland waterways, including the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Seas, as well as large rivers, lakes and reservoirs. It has occurred as a vagrant as far south as Morocco, Tunisia and the Gambia. In Asia, it breeds in the northern stretches of Siberia, and winters along the Pacific coast as far south as China, Japan and Taiwan. It has occurred as a vagrant in Mongolia.

==Behaviour==

Because its feet are located so far back on its body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use this method of covering ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above the surface of the water. It differs from other loons by nesting in small lakes but feeding in larger lakes or the sea. The nesting lake may host several nests, close to another, with much agonistic behavior among pairs. This territorial behavior is performed pairwise, with vocalisation (long call, plesiosur race).

The red-throated loon is a diurnal migrant, which travels singly or in loose groups, often high above the water. In eastern North America (and possibly elsewhere), it tends to migrate near the coast rather than farther offshore; Siberian populations travel for hundreds of miles over land en route to their southern European wintering grounds. It is a strong flier, and has been clocked at speeds between . Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon goes through a simultaneous wing moult, losing all its flight feathers at once and becoming flightless for a period of three to four weeks. Unlike other loons—which undergo this moult in late winter—the red-throated loon loses its ability to fly sometime between late summer and late autumn.

===Food and feeding===

Like all members of its family, the red-throated loon is primarily a fish-eater, though it sometimes feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic invertebrates, insects, fish spawn or even plant material. It seizes rather than spears its prey, which is generally captured underwater. Though it normally dives and swims using only its feet for propulsion, it may use its wings as well if it needs to turn or accelerate quickly. Pursuit dives range from in depth, with an average underwater time of about a minute. Its fish diet increases the red-throated loon&#x27;s vulnerability to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, both of which bioaccumulate, thus potentially causing greater problems for long-lived species (such as the loon) at or near the top of the food chain. Its main diet has also led to several of the loon&#x27;s British folk names, including &quot;sprat borer&quot; and &quot;spratoon&quot;.

For the first few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small crustaceans by both parents. After 3–4 days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.

===Breeding and survival===
The red-throated loon is a monogamous species which forms long-term pair bonds. Both sexes build the nest, which is a shallow scrape (or occasionally a platform of mud and vegetation) lined with vegetation and sometimes a few feathers, and placed within a of the edge of a small pond. The female lays two eggs (though clutches of one and three have also been recorded); they are incubated for 24–29 days, primarily by the female. The eggs, which are greenish or olive-brownish spotted with black, measure and have a mass of , of which 8% is shell. Incubation is begun as soon as the first egg is laid, so they hatch asynchronously. If a clutch is lost (to predation or flooding, for example) before the young hatch, the red-throated loon usually lays a second clutch, generally in a new nest. The young birds are precocial: upon hatching, they are downy and mobile, with open eyes. Both parents feed them small aquatic invertebrates initially, then small fish for 38–48 days. Parents will perform distraction displays to lure predators away from the nest and young. Ornithologists disagree as to whether adults carry young on their backs while swimming with some maintaining that they do and others the opposite.

In the wild, the oldest known red-throated loon lived for more than two decades. It was found, oiled and dead, on a beach in Sweden 23 years and 7 months after it had been ringed (banded).

==Conservation status and threats==
Although the red-throated loon is not a globally threatened species, as it has a large population and a significant range, there are populations which appear to be declining. Numbers counted in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys in Alaska show a 53% population decline between 1971 and 1993, for example, and survey count numbers have dropped in continental Europe as well. In Scotland, on the other hand, the population increased by some 16% between 1994 and 2006, according to surveys done by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage. In 2002, Wetlands International estimated a global population of 490,000 to 1,500,000 individuals; global population trends have not been quantified.

The red-throated loon is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies; in the Americas, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Oil spills, habitat degradation, and fishing nets are among the main threats this species faces. Because it tends to migrate close to shore—generally within of land—it may be detrimentally affected by the construction of near-shore wind farms; studies indicate a high level of avoidance of wind farm areas, though deaths due to direct strikes with the turbines appear to be uncommon. High levels of mercury in the environment have led to reproductive failures in some areas, including parts of Sweden. Studies in Sweden have also shown that they may be adversely impacted by the acidification of lakes, as the fish on which they prey are susceptible to low pH.} On the breeding grounds, Arctic and red foxes are major predators of eggs, while great skuas, Arctic skuas and various species of &quot;Larus&quot; gulls (including great black-backed gulls and glaucous gulls) are predators of both eggs and young.

The species is known to serve as host for at least 51 species of parasites, most of which are roundworms (nematodes), flatworms (digeneans) and tapeworms (cestodes) carried internally; a single species of louse is its only known external parasite. It is also known to sometimes carry significant populations of diatoms (microscopic phytoplankton) on its contour feathers. The red-throated loon is susceptible to avian influenza and Type E botulism, and is regularly killed by the ingestion of neurotoxins produced by &quot;red tide&quot; algal blooms. During a 2007 bloom, large numbers of the birds also died of hypothermia, after their plumages became matted by a protein byproduct of the algae, which reduced the insulating properties of their feathers.

==In human culture==

Used as a food source since prehistoric times, the red-throated loon is still hunted by indigenous peoples in some parts of the world today. Eggs as well as birds are taken, sometimes in significant numbers; during one study on northern Canada&#x27;s Igloolik Island, 73% of all red-throated loon eggs laid within the study site over two breeding seasons were collected by indigenous inhabitants of the island. In some parts of Russia, red-throated loon skins were traditionally used to make caps and various clothing decorations, including collars. The species was also central to the creation mythologies of indigenous groups throughout the Holarctic. According to the myth—which varies only slightly between versions, despite the sometimes-vast distances that separated the groups who believed it—the loon was asked by a great shaman to bring up earth from the bottom of the sea. That earth was then used to build the world&#x27;s dry land.

As recently as the 1800s, the behaviour of the red-throated loon was used to forecast the weather; according to the conventional wisdom of the time, birds flying inland or giving short cries predicted good weather, while those flying out to sea or giving long, wailing cries predicted rain. In the Orkney and Shetland islands of Scotland, the species is still known as the &quot;rain goose&quot; in deference to its supposed weather-predicting capabilities. The people of the Faroe Islands believed that if the red-throated loon miaowed like a cat, then rain was imminent, while a call of &#x27; or &#x27; predicted fine weather.

Bhutan, Japan, Åland (an autonomous region of Finland), and the Union of the Comoros have issued stamps featuring the red-throated loon.
