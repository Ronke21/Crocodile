<text>The Namib ( ; ) is a coastal desert in Southern Africa. According to the broadest definition, the Namib stretches for more than along the Atlantic coasts of Angola, Namibia, and northwest South Africa, extending southward from the Carunjamba River in Angola, through Namibia and to the Olifants River in Western Cape, South Africa. The Namib&#x27;s northernmost portion, which extends from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as Moçâmedes Desert, while its southern portion approaches the neighboring Kalahari Desert. From the Atlantic coast eastward, the Namib gradually ascends in elevation, reaching up to inland to the foot of the Great Escarpment. Annual precipitation ranges from in the aridest regions to at the escarpment, making the Namib the only true desert in southern Africa. Having endured arid or semi-arid conditions for roughly 55–80 million years, the Namib may be the oldest desert in the world and contains some of the world&#x27;s driest regions, with only western South America&#x27;s Atacama Desert to challenge it for age and aridity benchmarks.

The desert geology consists of sand seas near the coast, while gravel plains and scattered mountain outcrops occur further inland. The sand dunes, some of which are high and span long, are the second-largest in the world after the Badain Jaran Desert dunes in China. Temperatures along the coast are stable and generally range between annually, while temperatures further inland are variable—summer daytime temperatures can exceed while nights can be freezing. Fogs that originate offshore from the collision of the cold Benguela Current and warm air from the Hadley cell create a fog belt that frequently envelops parts of the desert. Coastal regions can experience more than 180 days of thick fog a year. While this has proved a major hazard to ships—more than a thousand wrecks litter the Skeleton Coast—it is a vital source of moisture for desert life.

The Namib is almost completely uninhabited by humans except for several small settlements and indigenous pastoral groups, including the Ovahimba and Obatjimba Herero in the north, and the Topnaar Nama in the central region. Owing to its antiquity, the Namib may be home to more endemic species than any other desert in the world. Most of the desert wildlife is arthropods and other small animals that live on little water, although larger animals inhabit the northern regions. Near the coast, the cold ocean water is rich in fishery resources and supports populations of brown fur seals and shorebirds, which serve as prey for the Skeleton Coast&#x27;s lions. Further inland, the Namib-Naukluft National Park supports population of mountain zebras, and other large mammals. Further north near the Skeleton Coast, lions, elephants and rhinos can be found. Although the outer Namib is largely barren of vegetation, lichens and succulents are found in coastal areas, while grasses, shrubs, and ephemeral plants thrive near the escarpment. Several types of trees are also able to survive the extremely arid climate.

==Etymology==

The name is of Khoekhoegowab (or Nama language) origin, and has been variously reported to mean &quot;vast place&quot; and &quot;an area where there is nothing&quot;.

== Geography and geology ==

The Namib Desert is one of the 500 distinct physiographic provinces of the South African Platform physiographic division. It occupies an area of around , stretching from the Uniab River (north) to the town of Lüderitz (south) and from the Atlantic Ocean (west) to the Namib Escarpment (east). It is about long from north to south and its east–west width varies from . To the north, the desert leads into the Kaokoveld; the dividing line between these two regions is roughly at the latitude of the city of Walvis Bay, and it consists in a narrow strip of land (about 50 km wide) that is the driest place in Southern Africa. To the south, the Namib borders the South African Karoo semi-desert.

Southern Namib (between Lüderitz and the Kuiseb River) comprises a vast dune sea with some of the tallest and most spectacular dunes in the world, ranging in color from pink to vivid orange. In the Sossusvlei area, several dunes exceed in height. The complexity and regularity of dune patterns in its dune sea have attracted the attention of geologists for decades, but it remains poorly understood.

The source of the unconsolidated sand (the most recent sand sea) is dominantly from the Orange River, which drains into the Atlantic south of the Namib Sand Sea, with minor contributions in the east from the (now ephemeral) rivers that drain into the sand sea. For this reason, the Namib Sand Sea has been referred to as the &quot;wind displaced delta of the Orange River.&quot;

Moving north from Sossusvlei, the sand gradually gives way to a rocky desert that extends from Sossusvlei to the Swakop river. This area is traversed by the Tropic of Capricorn and is mostly flat, although some scenic canyons and elevations are found in some areas, for example in the Moon Valley system. While most of the soil is rocky, sand dunes are still occasionally found in this region; for example, sand dunes occupy much of the coastline between Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.

The Namib desert is an important location for the mining of tungsten, salt, and diamonds.

Several rivers and streams run through the Namib, although all of the rivers south of the Cunene River and north of the Orange River are ephemeral and rarely or never reach the ocean. These rivers arise in the interior mountains of Namibia and flow after summer rain storms.

== Climate ==
The Namib&#x27;s aridity is caused by the descent of dry air of the Hadley cell, cooled by the cold Benguela Current along the coast. It has less than of rain annually and is almost completely barren. Besides rain being scarce, it is also unpredictable. Western Namib gets less rain (5 mm) than eastern Namib (85 mm). This is due to several factors. Winds coming from the Indian Ocean lose part of their humidity when passing the Drakensberg mountains, and are essentially dry when they reach the Namib Escarpment at the eastern end of the desert. On the other hand, winds coming from the Atlantic Ocean are pressed down by hot air from the east; their humidity thus forms clouds and fog. Morning fogs coming from the ocean and pushing inwards into the desert are a regular phenomenon along the coast, and much of the life cycle of animals and plants in the Namib relies on these fogs as the main source of water.

The dry climate of Namib reflects the almost complete lack of bodies of water on the surface. Most rivers flow underground and/or are dry for most of the year. Even when they are not, they usually drain into endorheic basins, without reaching the sea. The Swakop and the Omaruru are the only rivers that occasionally drain into the ocean.

All along the coast, but mostly in the northernmost part of it, the interaction between the water-laden air coming from the sea via southerly winds, some of the strongest of any coastal desert, and the dry air of the desert causes immense fogs and strong currents. It causes sailors to lose their way; this is testified by the remnants of several shipwrecks that can be found along the Skeleton Coast, in northern Namib. Some of these wrecked ships can be found as much as inland, as the desert slowly moves westwards into the sea, reclaiming land over many years.
Benguela&#x27;s El Niño (similar to the Pacific event in its environmental change in the seas) spreads from the Kunene estuary southward to, on occasion, south of Luderitz. Warm waters with depth and associated water flow from the northwest were first fully catalogued by Sea Fisheries researchers, in Cape Town (L V Shannon &quot;et al.&quot;). The research noted the positive effect of Benguela&#x27;s El Niño on the rainfall of the interior. Rainfall records also show positive values variously across the Namib, Desert Research Station, and Gobabeb for instance. This event recurs approximately mid-decade (recent examples are 1974, 1986, 1994, 1995, and 2006).

== Plants and animals ==
===Flora===
Several unusual species of plants and animals are found in this desert, many of which are endemic and highly adapted to the specific climate of the area.

One of the most well-known endemic plants of the Namib is the bizarre &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot;; a shrub-like plant, it grows two long strap-shaped leaves continuously throughout its lifetime. These leaves may be several meters long, gnarled, and twisted from the desert winds. The taproot of the plant develops into a flat, concave disc in age. &quot;Welwitschia&quot; is notable for its survival in the extremely arid Namib conditions, made possible by its ability to capture moisture from coastal sea fogs. Areas where &quot;Welwitschias&quot; are a common sight include the eponymous Welwitschia Plains, which are adjacent to the Husab uranium mine, one of the largest of its kind in the world.

&quot;Fairy circles&quot;, which are circular patches of land barren of plants, varying between 2 in diameter and often encircled by a ring of stimulated growth of grass, are found in the Namib, such as those near the Wolwedans desert camp.

===Fauna===
The Namib fauna mostly comprises arthropods and other small animals that can live on little water, but a few species of bigger animals are also found, including antelopes (such as gemsboks and springboks), common ostriches, and in some areas even desert elephants or lions. All these species have developed techniques to survive in the Namib environment. Several endemic darkling beetles species have different methods of collecting water droplets from morning fog; they are collectively known as &quot;fog beetles&quot;. For example, one beetle, &quot;Onymacris unguicularis,&quot; has smooth elytrons that cause humidity from the morning fogs to condense into droplets, which roll down the beetle&#x27;s back to its mouth. Another beetle, the &quot;Lepidochora discoidalis&quot;, builds &quot;water-capturing&quot; webs. Black-backed jackals lick humidity from stones. Gemsboks (also known as the South African oryx) can raise the temperature of their bodies to 40 °C in the hottest hours of the day. The desert is also home to meerkats and several species of lizards.

== Human activity ==

Before the 20th century, some San roamed the Namib, gathering edible plants on the shore, hunting in the interior, and drinking the juice of the tsamma melon for water. Today, some Herero still herd their livestock in the Kaokoveld in the Namib and take them from waterhole to waterhole. A few Nama Khoikhoi still graze their livestock on the banks of the Kuiseb River in the desert. Most of the native people have left, leaving the vast majority of the desert uninhabited.

The steppes in the southern half of the desert are mostly made up of ranches run by Europeans, who raise Karakul sheep with local help and send the pelts of the lambs to Europe for use in fur coats. Most of the rest of the desert is set aside for conservation. A vast portion of the desert, called the Sperrgebiet, was access-restricted due to the presence of diamonds, which are mined in the area at the mouth of the Orange River. Although the desert is largely unpopulated and inaccessible, there are year-round settlements at Sesriem, close to the Sossusvlei area, and other small outposts in other locations. Moçâmedes in Angola, and Lüderitz, Walvis Bay, and Swakopmund in Namibia, bordering on the desert, are the main settlements in the area.

The 2015 film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; was filmed here.

In 2019 the Namibian-German artist Max Siedentopf created an installation in the Namib consisting of a ring of large white blocks atop of which sit six speakers attached to a solar-powered MP3 player configured to continuously play the 1982 song &quot;Africa&quot; by the American band Toto. The exact location of the installation has not been disclosed.

== Namib-Naukluft National Park ==
The Namib-Naukluft National Park, which extends over a large part of the Namib Desert, is the largest game reserve in Africa and one of the largest in the world. While most of the park is hardly accessible, several well-known visitor attractions are found in the desert. The prominent attraction is the Sossusvlei area, where high orange sand dunes surround vivid white salt pans, creating a fascinating landscape.

Access to the park is either by gravel roads or dust roads (except for 60 km of concrete road from the Sesriem gate to Sossusvlei) or by light aircraft from Windhoek (the capital of Namibia, about northeast of the centre of the desert), or Swakopmund and Walvis Bay at the north end of the desert.

<text>The rotation curve of a disc galaxy (also called a velocity curve) is a plot of the orbital speeds of visible stars or gas in that galaxy versus their radial distance from that galaxy&#x27;s centre. It is typically rendered graphically as a plot, and the data observed from each side of a spiral galaxy are generally asymmetric, so that data from each side are averaged to create the curve. A significant discrepancy exists between the experimental curves observed, and a curve derived by applying gravity theory to the matter observed in a galaxy. Theories involving dark matter are the main postulated solutions to account for the variance.

The rotational/orbital speeds of galaxies/stars do not follow the rules found in other orbital systems such as stars/planets and planets/moons that have most of their mass at the centre. Stars revolve around their galaxy&#x27;s centre at equal or increasing speed over a large range of distances. In contrast, the orbital velocities of planets in planetary systems and moons orbiting planets decline with distance according to Kepler’s third law. This reflects the mass distributions within those systems. The mass estimations for galaxies based on the light they emit are far too low to explain the velocity observations.

The galaxy rotation problem is the discrepancy between observed galaxy rotation curves and the theoretical prediction, assuming a centrally dominated mass associated with the observed luminous material. When mass profiles of galaxies are calculated from the distribution of stars in spirals and mass-to-light ratios in the stellar disks, they do not match with the masses derived from the observed rotation curves and the law of gravity. A solution to this conundrum is to hypothesize the existence of dark matter and to assume its distribution from the galaxy&#x27;s center out to its halo. Thus the discrepancy between the two curves can be accounted for by adding a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy.

Though dark matter is by far the most accepted explanation of the rotation problem, other proposals have been offered with varying degrees of success. Of the possible alternatives, one of the most notable is modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), which involves modifying the laws of gravity.

==History==

In 1932, Jan Hendrik Oort became the first to report that measurements of the stars in the solar neighborhood indicated that they moved faster than expected when a mass distribution based upon visible matter was assumed, but these measurements were later determined to be essentially erroneous. In 1939, Horace Babcock reported in his PhD thesis measurements of the rotation curve for Andromeda which suggested that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially. He attributed that to either the absorption of light within the galaxy or to modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to any form of missing matter. Babcock&#x27;s measurements turned out to disagree substantially with those found later, and the first measurement of an extended rotation curve in good agreement with modern data was published in 1957 by Henk van de Hulst and collaborators, who studied M31 with the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory&#x27;s newly commissioned 25-meter radio telescope. A companion paper by Maarten Schmidt showed that this rotation curve could be fit by a flattened mass distribution more extensive than the light. In 1959, Louise Volders used the same telescope to demonstrate that the spiral galaxy M33 also does not spin as expected according to Keplerian dynamics.

Reporting on NGC 3115, Jan Oort wrote that &quot;the distribution of mass in the system appears to bear almost no relation to that of light... one finds the ratio of mass to light in the outer parts of NGC 3115 to be about 250&quot;. On page 302–303 of his journal article, he wrote that &quot;The strongly condensed luminous system appears imbedded in a large and more or less homogeneous mass of great density&quot; and although he went on to speculate that this mass may be either extremely faint dwarf stars or interstellar gas and dust, he had clearly detected the dark matter halo of this galaxy.

The Carnegie telescope (Carnegie Double Astrograph) was intended to study this problem of Galactic rotation.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Vera Rubin, an astronomer at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, worked with a new sensitive spectrograph that could measure the velocity curve of edge-on spiral galaxies to a greater degree of accuracy than had ever before been achieved. Together with fellow staff-member Kent Ford, Rubin announced at a 1975 meeting of the American Astronomical Society the discovery that most stars in spiral galaxies orbit at roughly the same speed, and that this implied that galaxy masses grow approximately linearly with radius well beyond the location of most of the stars (the galactic bulge). Rubin presented her results in an influential paper in 1980. These results suggested either that Newtonian gravity does not apply universally or that, conservatively, upwards of 50% of the mass of galaxies was contained in the relatively dark galactic halo. Although initially met with skepticism, Rubin&#x27;s results have been confirmed over the subsequent decades.

If Newtonian mechanics is assumed to be correct, it would follow that most of the mass of the galaxy had to be in the galactic bulge near the center and that the stars and gas in the disk portion should orbit the center at decreasing velocities with radial distance from the galactic center (the dashed line in Fig. 1).

Observations of the rotation curve of spirals, however, do not bear this out. Rather, the curves do not decrease in the expected inverse square root relationship but are &quot;flat&quot;, i.e. outside of the central bulge the speed is nearly a constant (the solid line in Fig. 1). It is also observed that galaxies with a uniform distribution of luminous matter have a rotation curve that rises from the center to the edge, and most low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSB galaxies) have the same anomalous rotation curve.

The rotation curves might be explained by hypothesizing the existence of a substantial amount of matter permeating the galaxy outside of the central bulge that is not emitting light in the mass-to-light ratio of the central bulge. The material responsible for the extra mass was dubbed dark matter, the existence of which was first posited in the 1930s by Jan Oort in his measurements of the Oort constants and Fritz Zwicky in his studies of the masses of galaxy clusters. 

== Dark matter ==

While the observed galaxy rotation curves were one of the first indications that some mass in the universe may not be visible, many different lines of evidence now support the concept of cold dark matter as the dominant form of matter in the universe. Among the lines of evidence are mass-to-light ratios which are much too low without a dark matter component, the amount of hot gas detected in galactic clusters by x-ray astronomy, measurements of cluster mass with the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect and with gravitational lensing. Models of the formation of galaxies are based on their dark matter halos. The existence of non-baryonic cold dark matter (CDM) is today a major feature of the Lambda-CDM model that describes the cosmology of the universe and matches high precision astrophysical observations.

==Further investigations==
The rotational dynamics of galaxies are well characterized by their position on the Tully–Fisher relation, which shows that for spiral galaxies the rotational velocity is uniquely related to their total luminosity. A consistent way to predict the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy is to measure its bolometric luminosity and then read its rotation rate from its location on the Tully–Fisher diagram. Conversely, knowing the rotational velocity of a spiral galaxy gives its luminosity. Thus the magnitude of the galaxy rotation is related to the galaxy&#x27;s visible mass.

While precise fitting of the bulge, disk, and halo density profiles is a rather complicated process, it is straightforward to model the observables of rotating galaxies through this relationship. So, while state-of-the-art cosmological and galaxy formation simulations of dark matter with normal baryonic matter included can be matched to galaxy observations, there is not yet any straightforward explanation as to why the observed scaling relationship exists. Additionally, detailed investigations of the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies (LSB galaxies) in the 1990s and of their position on the Tully–Fisher relation showed that LSB galaxies had to have dark matter haloes that are more extended and less dense than those of galaxies with high surface brightness, and thus surface brightness is related to the halo properties. Such dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxies may hold the key to solving the dwarf galaxy problem of structure formation.

Very importantly, the analysis of the inner parts of low and high surface brightness galaxies showed that the shape of the rotation curves in the centre of dark-matter dominated systems indicates a profile different from the NFW spatial mass distribution profile. This so-called cuspy halo problem is a persistent problem for the standard cold dark matter theory. Simulations involving the feedback of stellar energy into the interstellar medium in order to alter the predicted dark matter distribution in the innermost regions of galaxies are frequently invoked in this context.

==Halo density profiles==
In order to accommodate a flat rotation curve, a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated. Newton&#x27;s version of Kepler&#x27;s Third Law implies that the spherically symmetric, radial density profile is:
formula_1
where is the radial orbital velocity profile and is the gravitational constant. This profile closely matches the expectations of a singular isothermal sphere profile where if is approximately constant then the density to some inner &quot;core radius&quot; where the density is then assumed constant. Observations do not comport with such a simple profile, as reported by Navarro, Frenk, and White in a seminal 1996 paper.

The authors then remarked that a &quot;gently changing logarithmic slope&quot; for a density profile function could also accommodate approximately flat rotation curves over large scales. They found the famous Navarro–Frenk–White profile, which is consistent both with N-body simulations and observations given by
formula_2
where the central density, , and the scale radius, , are parameters that vary from halo to halo. Because the slope of the density profile diverges at the center, other alternative profiles have been proposed, for example the Einasto profile, which has exhibited better agreement with certain dark matter halo simulations.

Observations of orbit velocities in spiral galaxies suggest a mass structure according to:
formula_3
with the galaxy gravitational potential.

Since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of Kepler&#x27;s laws, they do not match the distribution of luminous matter. This implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or, alternatively, the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales. The additional invisible component becomes progressively more conspicuous in each galaxy at outer radii and among galaxies in the less luminous ones.

A popular interpretation of these observations is that about 26% of the mass of the Universe is composed of dark matter, a hypothetical type of matter which does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is believed to dominate the gravitational potential of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Under this theory, galaxies are baryonic condensations of stars and gas (namely hydrogen and helium) that lie at the centers of much larger haloes of dark matter, affected by a gravitational instability caused by primordial density fluctuations.

Many cosmologists strive to understand the nature and the history of these ubiquitous dark haloes by investigating the properties of the galaxies they contain (i.e. their luminosities, kinematics, sizes, and morphologies). The measurement of the kinematics (their positions, velocities and accelerations) of the observable stars and gas has become a tool to investigate the nature of dark matter, as to its content and distribution relative to that of the various baryonic components of those galaxies.

== Alternatives to dark matter ==

There have been a number of attempts to solve the problem of galaxy rotation by modifying gravity without invoking dark matter. One of the most discussed is modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), originally proposed by Mordehai Milgrom in 1983, which modifies the Newtonian force law at low accelerations to enhance the effective gravitational attraction. MOND has had a considerable amount of success in predicting the rotation curves of low-surface-brightness galaxies, matching the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation, and the velocity dispersions of the small satellite galaxies of the Local Group.

Using data from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database, a group has found that the radial acceleration traced by rotation curves (an effect given the name &quot;radial acceleration relation&quot;) could be predicted just from the observed baryon distribution (that is, including stars and gas but not dark matter). This so-called radial acceleration relation (RAR) might be fundamental for understanding the dynamics of galaxies. The same relation provided a good fit for 2693 samples in 153 rotating galaxies, with diverse shapes, masses, sizes, and gas fractions. Brightness in the near infrared, where the more stable light from red giants dominates, was used to estimate the density contribution due to stars more consistently. The results are consistent with MOND, and place limits on alternative explanations involving dark matter alone. However, cosmological simulations within a Lambda-CDM framework that include baryonic feedback effects reproduce the same relation, without the need to invoke new dynamics (such as MOND). Thus, a contribution due to dark matter itself can be fully predictable from that of the baryons, once the feedback effects due to the dissipative collapse of baryons are taken into account. MOND is not a relativistic theory, although relativistic theories which reduce to MOND have been proposed, such as tensor–vector–scalar gravity (TeVeS), scalar–tensor–vector gravity (STVG), and the f(R) theory of Capozziello and De Laurentis.

Attempts to model of galaxy rotation based on a general relativity metric, showing that the rotation curves for the Milky Way, NGC 3031, NGC 3198 and NGC 7331 are consistent with the mass density distributions of the visible matter and other similar work have been disputed.

According to recent analysis of the data produced by the Gaia spacecraft, it would seem possible to explain at least the Milky Way&#x27;s rotation curve without requiring any dark matter if instead of a Newtonian approximation the entire set of equations of general relativity is adopted.

<text>The following is a list of notable unsolved problems grouped into broad areas of physics.

Some of the major unsolved problems in physics are theoretical, meaning that existing theories seem incapable of explaining a certain observed phenomenon or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.

There are still some questions beyond the Standard Model of physics, such as the strong CP problem, neutrino mass, matter–antimatter asymmetry, and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Another problem lies within the mathematical framework of the Standard Model itself—the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of general relativity, to the point that one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known spacetime singularities like the Big Bang and the centres of black holes beyond the event horizon).

== General physics ==
* Theory of everything: Is there a singular, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe?
* Dimensionless physical constants: At the present time, the values of various dimensionless physical constants cannot be calculated; they can be determined only by physical measurement. What is the minimum number of dimensionless physical constants from which all other dimensionless physical constants can be derived? Are dimensional physical constants necessary at all?

== Quantum gravity ==
* Quantum gravity: Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)? Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete? Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)? Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity mechanism?
* Black holes, black hole information paradox, and black hole radiation: Do black holes produce thermal radiation, as expected on theoretical grounds? Does this radiation contain information about their inner structure, as suggested by gauge–gravity duality, or not, as implied by Hawking&#x27;s original calculation? If not, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point, leaving black hole remnants? Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow, if such a structure even exists?
* The cosmic censorship hypothesis and the chronology protection conjecture: Can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon, known as &quot;naked singularities&quot;, arise from realistic initial conditions, or is it possible to prove some version of the &quot;cosmic censorship hypothesis&quot; of Roger Penrose which proposes that this is impossible? Similarly, will the closed timelike curves which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity (and which imply the possibility of backwards time travel) be ruled out by a theory of quantum gravity which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics, as suggested by the &quot;chronology protection conjecture&quot; of Stephen Hawking?
* Holographic principle: Is it true that quantum gravity admits a lower-dimensional description that does not contain gravity? A well-understood example of holography is the AdS/CFT correspondence in string theory. Similarly, can quantum gravity in a de Sitter space be understood using dS/CFT correspondence? Can the AdS/CFT correspondence be vastly generalized to the gauge–gravity duality for arbitrary asymptotic spacetime backgrounds? Are there other theories of quantum gravity other than string theory that admit a holographic description?
* Quantum spacetime or the emergence of spacetime: Is the nature of spacetime at the Planck scale very different from the continuous classical dynamical spacetime that exists in General relativity? In loop quantum gravity, the spacetime is postulated to be discrete from the beginning. In string theory, although originally spacetime was considered just like in General relativity (with the only difference being supersymmetry), recent research building upon the Ryu–Takayanagi conjecture has taught that spacetime in string theory is emergent by using quantum information theoretic concepts such as entanglement entropy in the AdS/CFT correspondence. However, how exactly the familiar classical spacetime emerges within string theory or the AdS/CFT correspondence is still not well understood.
* Problem of time: In quantum mechanics, time is a classical background parameter, and the flow of time is universal and absolute. In general relativity, time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime, and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer. How can these two concepts of time be reconciled?

== Quantum physics ==
* Yang–Mills theory: Given an arbitrary compact gauge group, does a non-trivial quantum Yang–Mills theory with a finite mass gap exist? (This problem is also listed as one of the Millennium Prize Problems in mathematics.)
* Quantum field theory (this is a generalization of the previous problem): Is it possible to construct, in a mathematically rigorous way, a quantum field theory in 4-dimensional spacetime that includes interactions and does not resort to perturbative methods?

== Cosmology and general relativity ==
* Fine-tuned universe: The values of the fundamental physical constants are in a narrow range necessary to support carbon-based life. Is this because there are an infinite number of other universes with different constants, or are our universe&#x27;s constants the result of chance, intelligent design (by a personal being such as the theist&#x27;s &quot;God&quot;), or some other factor or process? (See also the anthropic principle.)
* Cosmic inflation: Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical scalar field that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations, and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?
* Horizon problem: Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the Big Bang theory seems to predict larger measurable anisotropies of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological inflation is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a variable speed of light more appropriate?
* Origin and future of the universe: How did the conditions for anything to exist arise? Is the universe heading towards a Big Freeze, a Big Rip, a Big Crunch, or a Big Bounce?
* Size of universe: The diameter of the observable universe is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe? Is the universe infinite?
* Matter–antimatter asymmetry Theoretical models suggest that the early universe should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. However, observations indicate no significant primordial antimatter. Understanding the mechanisms that led to this asymmetry is a major unsolved problem in physics.
* Cosmological principle: Is the universe homogeneous and isotropic at large enough scales, as claimed by the cosmological principle and assumed by all models that use the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, including the current version of the ΛCDM model, or is the universe inhomogeneous or anisotropic? Is the CMB dipole purely kinematic, or does it signal anisotropy of the universe, resulting in the breakdown of the FLRW metric and the cosmological principle? Is the Hubble tension evidence that the cosmological principle is false? Even if the cosmological principle is correct, is the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric the right metric to use for our universe? Are the observations usually interpreted as the accelerating expansion of the universe rightly interpreted, or are they instead evidence that the cosmological principle is false?
* Cosmological constant problem: Why does the zero-point energy of the vacuum not cause a large cosmological constant? What cancels it out?

* Dark matter: What is the identity of dark matter? Is it a particle? If so, is it a WIMP, axion, the lightest superpartner (LSP), or some other particle? Or, do the phenomena attributed to dark matter point not to some form of matter but actually to an extension of gravity? Despite extensive research, the exact composition of dark matter remains unknown. It is inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the universe&#x27;s large-scale structure. Understanding its properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the universe.
* Dark energy: What is the cause of the observed accelerating expansion of the universe (the de Sitter phase)? Are the observations rightly interpreted as the accelerating expansion of the universe, or are they evidence that the cosmological principle is false? Why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time; could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the right time? Is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of quintessence such as phantom energy applicable?
* Dark flow: Is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe?
* Shape of the universe: What is the 3-manifold of comoving space, i.e., of a comoving spatial section of the universe, informally called the &quot;shape&quot; of the universe? Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be &quot;close&quot; to zero on observable scales. Is the shape unmeasurable; the Poincaré space; or another 3-manifold?
* Extra dimensions: Does nature have more than four spacetime dimensions? If so, what is their size? Are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws? Can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions?

== High-energy/particle physics ==

* Hierarchy problem: Why is gravity such a weak force? It becomes strong for particles only at the Planck scale, around  GeV, much above the electroweak scale (100 GeV, the energy scale dominating physics at low energies); why are these scales so different from each other? What prevents quantities at the electroweak scale, such as the Higgs boson mass, from getting quantum corrections on the order of the Planck scale? Is the solution supersymmetry, extra dimensions, or just anthropic fine-tuning?
* Magnetic monopoles: Did particles that carry &quot;magnetic charge&quot; exist in some past, higher-energy epoch? If so, do any remain today? (Paul Dirac showed the existence of some types of magnetic monopoles would explain charge quantization.)
* Neutron lifetime puzzle: While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of consilience on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods (&quot;bottle&quot; versus &quot;beam&quot;).
* Proton decay and spin crisis: Is the proton fundamentally stable? Or does it decay with a finite lifetime as predicted by some extensions to the standard model? How do the quarks and gluons carry the spin of protons?
* Grand Unification: Are the electromagnetic and nuclear forces different aspects of a Grand Unified Theory? If so, what symmetry governs this force and its behaviours?
* Supersymmetry: Is spacetime supersymmetry realized at TeV scale? If so, what is the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking? Does supersymmetry stabilize the electroweak scale, preventing high quantum corrections? Does the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) comprise dark matter?
* Color confinement: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) color confinement conjecture is that color-charged particles (such as quarks and gluons) cannot be separated from their parent hadron without producing new hadrons. Is it possible to provide an analytic proof of color confinement in any non-abelian gauge theory?

* The QCD vacuum: Many of the equations in non-perturbative QCD are currently unsolved. These energies are the energies sufficient for the formation and description of atomic nuclei. How thus does low energy /non-pertubative QCD give rise to the formation of complex nuclei and nuclear constituents?
* Generations of matter: Why are there three generations of quarks and leptons? Is there a theory that can explain the masses of particular quarks and leptons in particular generations from first principles (a theory of Yukawa couplings)?
* Neutrino mass: What is the mass of neutrinos, whether they follow Dirac or Majorana statistics? Is the mass hierarchy normal or inverted? Is the CP violating phase equal to 0?
* Reactor antineutrino anomaly: There is an anomaly in the existing body of data regarding the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors around the world. Measured values of this flux appears to be only 94% of the value expected from theory. It is unknown whether this is due to unknown physics (such as sterile neutrinos), experimental error in the measurements, or errors in the theoretical flux calculations.
* Strong CP problem and axions: Why is the strong nuclear interaction invariant to parity and charge conjugation? Is Peccei–Quinn theory the solution to this problem? Could axions be the main component of dark matter?
* Anomalous magnetic dipole moment: Why is the experimentally measured value of the muon&#x27;s anomalous magnetic dipole moment (&quot;muon &quot;) significantly different from the theoretically predicted value of that physical constant?
* Proton radius puzzle: What is the electric charge radius of the proton? How does it differ from a gluonic charge?
* Pentaquarks and other exotic hadrons: What combinations of quarks are possible? Why were pentaquarks so difficult to discover? Are they a tightly bound system of five elementary particles, or a more weakly-bound pairing of a baryon and a meson?
* Mu problem: A problem in supersymmetric theories, concerned with understanding the reasons for parameter values of the theory.
* Koide formula: An aspect of the problem of particle generations. The sum of the masses of the three charged leptons, divided by the square of the sum of the roots of these masses, to within one standard deviation of observations, is . It is unknown how such a simple value comes about, and why it is the exact arithmetic average of the possible extreme values of (equal masses) and 1 (one mass dominates).
* Strange Matter: Does Strange Matter exist? Is it stable? Can they form Strange Stars? Is strange matter stable at &quot;0&quot; pressure (i.e in the vacuum)?
* Glueballs: Do they exist in nature?
* The gallium anomaly: The measurements of the charged-current capture rate of neutrinos on Ga from strong radioactive sources have yielded results below those expected, based on the known strength of the principal transition supplemented by theory.

== Astronomy and astrophysics ==

* Solar cycle: How does the Sun generate its periodically reversing large-scale magnetic field? How do other solar-like stars generate their magnetic fields, and what are the similarities and differences between stellar activity cycles and that of the Sun? What caused the Maunder Minimum and other grand minima, and how does the solar cycle recover from a minima state?
* Coronal heating problem: Why is the Sun&#x27;s corona (atmosphere layer) so much hotter than the Sun&#x27;s surface? Why is the magnetic reconnection effect many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models?
* Astrophysical jet: Why do only certain accretion discs surrounding certain astronomical objects emit relativistic jets along their polar axes? Why are there quasi-periodic oscillations in many accretion discs? Why does the period of these oscillations scale as the inverse of the mass of the central object? Why are there sometimes overtones, and why do these appear at different frequency ratios in different objects?
* Diffuse interstellar bands: What is responsible for the numerous interstellar absorption lines detected in astronomical spectra? Are they molecular in origin, and if so which molecules are responsible for them? How do they form?
* Supermassive black holes: What is the origin of the M–sigma relation between supermassive black hole mass and galaxy velocity dispersion? How did the most distant quasars grow their supermassive black holes up to 10 solar masses so early in the history of the universe?
* Kuiper cliff: Why does the number of objects in the Solar System&#x27;s Kuiper belt fall off rapidly and unexpectedly beyond a radius of 50 astronomical units?
* Flyby anomaly: Why is the observed energy of satellites flying by planetary bodies sometimes different by a minute amount from the value predicted by theory?

* Supernovae: What is the exact mechanism by which an implosion of a dying star becomes an explosion?
* p-nuclei: What astrophysical process is responsible for the nucleogenesis of these rare isotopes?
* Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray: Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess energies that are impossibly high, given that there are no sufficiently energetic cosmic ray sources near the Earth? Why is it that (apparently) some cosmic rays emitted by distant sources have energies above the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit?
* Rotation rate of Saturn: Why does the magnetosphere of Saturn exhibit a (slowly changing) periodicity close to that at which the planet&#x27;s clouds rotate? What is the true rotation rate of Saturn&#x27;s deep interior?
* Origin of magnetar magnetic field: What is the origin of magnetar magnetic fields?
* Large-scale anisotropy: Is the universe at very large scales anisotropic, making the cosmological principle an invalid assumption? The number count and intensity dipole anisotropy in radio, NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue is inconsistent with the local motion as derived from cosmic microwave background and indicate an intrinsic dipole anisotropy. The same NVSS radio data also shows an intrinsic dipole in polarization density and degree of polarization in the same direction as in number count and intensity. There are several other observations revealing large-scale anisotropy. The optical polarization from quasars shows polarization alignment over a very large scale of Gpc. The cosmic-microwave-background data shows several features of anisotropy, which are not consistent with the Big Bang model.
* Age–metallicity relation in the Galactic disk: Is there a universal age–metallicity relation (AMR) in the Galactic disk (both &quot;thin&quot; and &quot;thick&quot; parts of the disk)? Although in the local (primarily thin) disk of the Milky Way there is no evidence of a strong AMR, a sample of 229 nearby &quot;thick&quot; disk stars has been used to investigate the existence of an age–metallicity relation in the Galactic thick disk, and indicate that there is an age–metallicity relation present in the thick disk. Stellar ages from asteroseismology confirm the lack of any strong age–metallicity relation in the Galactic disc.
* The lithium problem: Why is there a discrepancy between the amount of lithium-7 predicted to be produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the amount observed in very old stars?
* Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs): What powers X-ray sources that are not associated with active galactic nuclei but exceed the Eddington limit of a neutron star or stellar black hole? Are they due to intermediate-mass black holes? Some ULXs are periodic, suggesting non-isotropic emission from a neutron star. Does this apply to all ULXs? How could such a system form and remain stable?
* Fast radio bursts (FRBs): What causes these transient radio pulses from distant galaxies, lasting only a few milliseconds each? Why do some FRBs repeat at unpredictable intervals, but most do not? Dozens of models have been proposed, but none have been widely accepted.
Origin of Cosmic Magnetic Fields 
Observations reveal that magnetic fields are present throughout the universe, from galaxies to galaxy clusters. However, the mechanisms that generated these large-scale cosmic magnetic fields remain unclear. Understanding their origin is a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics.
== Nuclear physics ==

* Quantum chromodynamics: What are the phases of strongly interacting matter, and what roles do they play in the evolution of the cosmos? What is the detailed partonic structure of the nucleons? What does QCD predict for the properties of strongly interacting matter? What determines the key features of QCD, and what is their relation to the nature of gravity and spacetime? Does QCD truly lack CP violations?
* Quark–gluon plasma: Where is the onset of deconfinement: 1) as a function of temperature and chemical potentials? 2) as a function of relativistic heavy-ion collision energy and system size? What is the mechanism of energy and baryon-number stopping leading to creation of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions? Why is sudden hadronization and the statistical-hadronization model a near-to-perfect description of hadron production from quark–gluon plasma? Is quark flavor conserved in quark–gluon plasma?

What is the nature of exotic excitations in nuclei at the frontiers of stability and their role in stellar processes? What is the nature of neutron stars and dense nuclear matter? What is the origin of the elements in the cosmos? What are the nuclear reactions that drive stars and stellar explosions? What is the heaviest possible chemical element?

*Turbulent flow: Is it possible to make a theoretical model to describe the statistics of a turbulent flow (in particular, its internal structures)?

* Liquid crystals: Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a universal phase transition?
* Semiconductor nanocrystals: What is the cause of the nonparabolicity of the energy-size dependence for the lowest optical absorption transition of quantum dots?
* Metal whiskering: In electrical devices, some metallic surfaces may spontaneously grow fine metallic whiskers, which can lead to equipment failures. While compressive mechanical stress is known to encourage whisker formation, the growth mechanism has yet to be determined.

* Topological qubits: Topological quantum computers are promising but can they be built? Can we demonstrate Majorana zero modes conclusively?
* Temperature: Can quantum computing be performed at non-cryogenic temperatures? Can we build room temperature quantum computers?

* Post-quantum cryptography: Can we prove that some cryptographic protocols are safe against quantum computers?
* Quantum capacity: The capacity of a quantum channel is in general not known.

== Plasma physics ==
* Plasma physics and fusion power: Fusion energy may potentially provide power from an abundant resource (e.g. hydrogen) without the type of radioactive waste that fission energy currently produces. However, can ionized gases (plasma) be confined long enough and at a high enough temperature to create fusion power? What is the physical origin of H-mode?
* The injection problem: Fermi acceleration is thought to be the primary mechanism that accelerates astrophysical particles to high energy. However, it is unclear what mechanism causes those particles to initially have energies high enough for Fermi acceleration to work on them.
* Alfvénic turbulence: In the solar wind and the turbulence in solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and magnetospheric substorms are major unsolved problems in space plasma physics.

== Biophysics ==
* Stochasticity and robustness to noise in gene expression: How do genes govern our body, withstanding different external pressures and internal stochasticity? Certain models exist for genetic processes, but we are far from understanding the whole picture, in particular in development where gene expression must be tightly regulated.
* Quantitative study of the immune system: What are the quantitative properties of immune responses? What are the basic building blocks of immune system networks?
* &quot;Homochirality&quot;: What is the origin of the preponderance of specific enantiomers in biochemical systems?
* Magnetoreception: How do animals (e.g. migratory birds) sense the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field?
* Protein structure prediction: How is the three-dimensional structure of proteins determined by the one-dimensional amino acid sequence? How can proteins fold on microsecond to second timescales when the number of possible conformations is astronomical and conformational transitions occur on the picosecond to microsecond timescale? Can algorithms be written to predict a protein&#x27;s three-dimensional structure from its sequence? Do the native structures of most naturally occurring proteins coincide with the global minimum of the free energy in conformational space? Or are most native conformations thermodynamically unstable, but kinetically trapped in metastable states? What keeps the high density of proteins present inside cells from precipitating?
* Quantum biology: Can coherence be maintained in biological systems at timeframes long enough to be functionally important? Are there non-trivial aspects of biology or biochemistry that can only be explained by the persistence of coherence as a mechanism?

== Foundations of physics ==
* Interpretation of quantum mechanics: How does the quantum description of reality, which includes elements such as the superposition of states and wavefunction collapse or quantum decoherence, give rise to the reality we perceive? Another way of stating this question regards the measurement problem: What constitutes a &quot;measurement&quot; which apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state? Unlike classical physical processes, some quantum mechanical processes (such as quantum teleportation arising from quantum entanglement) cannot be simultaneously &quot;local&quot;, &quot;causal&quot;, and &quot;real&quot;, but it is not obvious which of these properties must be sacrificed, or if an attempt to describe quantum mechanical processes in these senses is a category error such that a proper understanding of quantum mechanics would render the question meaningless. Can the many worlds interpretation resolve it?
* Arrow of time (e.g. entropy&#x27;s arrow of time): Why does time have a direction? Why did the universe have such low entropy in the past, and time correlates with the universal (but not local) increase in entropy, from the past and to the future, according to the second law of thermodynamics? Why are CP violations observed in certain weak force decays, but not elsewhere? Are CP violations somehow a product of the second law of thermodynamics, or are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of causality? Is there a single possible past? Is the present moment physically distinct from the past and future, or is it merely an emergent property of consciousness? What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?
* Locality: Are there non-local phenomena in quantum physics? If they exist, are non-local phenomena limited to the entanglement revealed in the violations of the Bell inequalities, or can information and conserved quantities also move in a non-local way? Under what circumstances are non-local phenomena observed? What does the existence or absence of non-local phenomena imply about the fundamental structure of spacetime? How does this elucidate the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of quantum physics?
* Quantum mind: Do quantum mechanical phenomena, such as entanglement and superposition, play an important part in the brain&#x27;s function and can it explain critical aspects of consciousness?

== Problems solved in the past 30 years ==
=== General physics/quantum physics ===

* Perform a loophole-free Bell test experiment (1970–2015): In October 2015, scientists from the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience reported that the failure of the local hidden-variable hypothesis is supported at the 96% confidence level based on a &quot;loophole-free Bell test&quot; study. These results were confirmed by two studies with statistical significance over 5 standard deviations which were published in December 2015.
* Create Bose–Einstein condensate (1924–1995): Composite bosons in the form of dilute atomic vapours were cooled to quantum degeneracy using the techniques of laser cooling and evaporative cooling.

=== Cosmology and general relativity ===

* Existence of gravitational waves (1916–2016): On 11 February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging, which was also the first detection of a stellar binary black hole.
* Numerical solution for binary black hole (1960s–2005): The numerical solution of the two body problem in general relativity was achieved after four decades of research. Three groups devised the breakthrough techniques in 2005 (annus mirabilis of numerical relativity).
*Cosmic age problem (1920s–1990s): The estimated age of the universe was around 3 to 8 billion years younger than estimates of the ages of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. Better estimates for the distances to the stars, and the recognition of the accelerating expansion of the universe, reconciled the age estimates.

=== High-energy physics/particle physics ===

* Existence of pentaquarks (1964–2015): In July 2015, the LHCb collaboration at CERN identified pentaquarks in the channel, which represents the decay of the bottom lambda baryon into a J/ψ meson , a kaon and a proton (p). The results showed that sometimes, instead of decaying directly into mesons and baryons, the decayed via intermediate pentaquark states. The two states, named and , had individual statistical significances of 9 σ and 12 σ, respectively, and a combined significance of 15 σ—enough to claim a formal discovery. The two pentaquark states were both observed decaying strongly to , hence must have a valence quark content of two up quarks, a down quark, a charm quark, and an anti-charm quark (), making them charmonium-pentaquarks.
* Existence of quark-gluon plasma, a new phase of matter was discovered and confirmed in experiments at CERN-SPS (2000), BNL-RHIC (2005) and CERN-LHC (2010).
*Higgs boson and electroweak symmetry breaking (1963–2012): The mechanism responsible for breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry, giving mass to the W and Z bosons, was solved with the discovery of the Higgs boson of the Standard Model, with the expected couplings to the weak bosons. No evidence of a strong dynamics solution, as proposed by technicolor, has been observed.
* Origin of mass of most elementary particles: Solved with the discovery of the Higgs boson, which implies the existence of the Higgs field giving mass to these particles.

=== Astronomy and astrophysics ===

* Origin of short gamma-ray burst (1993–2017): From binary neutron stars merger, produce a kilonova explosion and short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A was detected in both electromagnetic waves and gravitational wave GW170817.
*Missing baryon problem (1998–2017): proclaimed solved in October 2017, with the missing baryons located in hot intergalactic gas.
*Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (1993–2003): Long-duration bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar. However, there are also long-duration GRBs that show evidence against an associated supernova, such as the Swift event GRB 060614.
*Solar neutrino problem (1968–2001): Solved by a new understanding of neutrino physics, requiring a modification of the Standard Model of particle physics—specifically, neutrino oscillation.
* Saturn&#x27;s core spin was determined from its gravitational field.

=== Nuclear physics ===

* Hagedorn temperature recognized as phase transformation temperature between hadronic confined phase and deconfined phase of matter.

=== Rapidly solved problems ===
* Existence of time crystals (2012–2016): The idea of a quantized time crystal was first theorized in 2012 by Frank Wilczek. In 2016, Khemani et al. and Else et al. independently of each other suggested that periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour. Also in 2016, Norman Yao at Berkeley and colleagues proposed a different way to create discrete time crystals in spin systems. This was then used by two teams, a group led by Christopher Monroe at the University of Maryland and a group led by Mikhail Lukin at Harvard University, who were both able to show evidence for time crystals in the laboratory setting, showing that for short times the systems exhibited the dynamics similar to the predicted one.
*Photon underproduction crisis (2014–2015): This problem was resolved by Khaire and Srianand. They show that a factor 2 to 5 times large metagalactic photoionization rate can be easily obtained using updated quasar and galaxy observations. Recent observations of quasars indicate that the quasar contribution to ultraviolet photons is a factor of 2 larger than previous estimates. The revised galaxy contribution is a factor of 3 larger. These together solve the crisis.
* Hipparcos anomaly (1997–2012): The High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite (Hipparcos) measured the parallax of the Pleiades and determined a distance of 385 light years. This was significantly different from other measurements made by means of actual to apparent brightness measurement or absolute magnitude. The anomaly was due to the use of a weighted mean when there is a correlation between distances and distance errors for stars in clusters. It is resolved by using an unweighted mean. There is no systematic bias in the Hipparcos data when it comes to star clusters.
* Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly (2011–2012): In 2011, the OPERA experiment mistakenly observed neutrinos appearing to travel faster than light. On 12 July 2012 OPERA updated their paper after discovering an error in their previous flight time measurement. They found agreement of neutrino speed with the speed of light.
* Pioneer anomaly (1980–2012): There was a deviation in the predicted accelerations of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft as they left the Solar System. It is believed that this is a result of previously unaccounted-for thermal recoil force.

<text>Many mathematical problems have been stated but not yet solved. These problems come from many areas of mathematics, such as theoretical physics, computer science, algebra, analysis, combinatorics, algebraic, differential, discrete and Euclidean geometries, graph theory, group theory, model theory, number theory, set theory, Ramsey theory, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations. Some problems belong to more than one discipline and are studied using techniques from different areas. Prizes are often awarded for the solution to a long-standing problem, and some lists of unsolved problems, such as the Millennium Prize Problems, receive considerable attention.

This list is a composite of notable unsolved problems mentioned in previously published lists, including but not limited to lists considered authoritative, and the problems listed here vary widely in both difficulty and importance.

== Lists of unsolved problems in mathematics ==
Various mathematicians and organizations have published and promoted lists of unsolved mathematical problems. In some cases, the lists have been associated with prizes for the discoverers of solutions.


=== Millennium Prize Problems ===
Of the original seven Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2000, six remain unsolved to date:

* Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
* Hodge conjecture
* Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness
* P versus NP
* Riemann hypothesis
* Yang–Mills existence and mass gap

The seventh problem, the Poincaré conjecture, was solved by Grigori Perelman in 2003. However, a generalization called the smooth four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture—that is, whether a &quot;four&quot;-dimensional topological sphere can have two or more inequivalent smooth structures—is unsolved.

=== Notebooks ===
* The Kourovka Notebook () is a collection of unsolved problems in group theory, first published in 1965 and updated many times since.

<text>Gavriil (Gavrila) Romanovich Derzhavin (; 14 July 1743 – 20 July 1816) was one of the most highly esteemed Russian poets before Alexander Pushkin, as well as a statesman. Although his works are traditionally considered literary classicism, his best verse is rich with antitheses and conflicting sounds in a way reminiscent of John Donne and other metaphysical poets.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===

Derzhavin was born in the Kazan Governorate into a landed family of impoverished Russian nobility. His family descended from a 15th-century Tatar nobleman named &quot;Morza&quot; Bagrim, who converted to Christianity and became a vassal of Grand Prince Vasily II. Bagrim was rewarded with lands for his service to the prince, and from him descended noble families of Narbekov, Akinfov and Keglev (or Teglev).

A member of the Narbekov family, who received the nickname &quot;Derzhava&quot; (Russian for &quot;orb&quot; or &quot;power&quot;), was the patriarch of the Derzhavin family. The Derzhavins once held profitable estates along the Myosha River, about from the capital city of Kazan, but over time they were divided, sold or mortgaged. By the time Gavrila Derzhavin&#x27;s father, Roman Nikolayevich Derzhavin, was born in 1706, he stood to inherit only a few parcels of land, occupied by few peasants. Roman joined the military and in 1742, at age 36, he married a widowed distant relative Fyokla Andreyevna Gorina (&quot;née&quot; Kozlova). She was from a similar background and also possessed a few scattered estates. The estates were the source of constant lawsuits, fights and feuds with neighbors, sometimes resulting in violence.

Derzhavin was born nearly nine months after his parents were wed, but the location of his birth remains a point of dispute. Derzhavin considered himself a native of Kazan—which proudly proclaims itself as the city of his birth—but he was possibly born at one of his family&#x27;s estates in Sokury or Karmachi, in Laishevsky County. The Laishevsky District is informally known as the Derzhavinsky District because of its association with Derzhavin. He was named Gavriil (Russian for Gabriel), as his birth was 10 days before the Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel, celebrated on 13 July in Slavic Orthodoxy. He was a sickly child, and his parents followed the traditional practice of the era and &quot;baked the baby&quot; ()—an ancient ceremony in which sickly or premature babies are placed on a bread peel and put in and out of the oven three times.

Derzhavin&#x27;s father was transferred to Yaransk and then Stavropol. Two more children were born,
a boy and a girl, although the latter died young.

===Education===
As members of the nobility, albeit minor, the Derzhavins were required to educate their children, but options were limited given their poverty and the few educational institutions in Russia at the time. Male members of the nobility were expected to enter government roles as civil servants or military officers at age 20. Nobility unable to send their children to one of the three educational institutions were given a waiver to educate their children at home, but the children were given examinations at 7, 12 and 16 to inspect their progress. Known as Ganyushka, Gavrila&#x27;s education began at age 3 when he was taught to read and write by local churchmen (as his mother was essentially illiterate). When he was 8, the family was sent to Orenburg near present-day Kazakhstan. The Russian Empire, eager to extend its reach, sent convicts to Orenburg to construct the city. A German named Joseph Rose opened a coeducational school to instruct the children of the nobility. Rose, in addition to being a criminal, had no formal education and was only able to instruct the children in the German language, which was then the most desirable language among the enlightened class in Russia.

When Gavrila was 10, the Derzhavins moved back to their estates in Kazan after two years in Orenburg. In the fall of 1753, he made his first trip to Moscow. Roman Derzhavin, who was suffering from consumption, needed to formally apply for retirement in Moscow, and then planned to continue to Saint Petersburg to register his son for future enlistment as required. However, he was delayed in Moscow until early January; by the time he received his discharge, he had no money to continue the journey to Saint Petersburg. They were forced to return to Kazan, where his father died later that year. His father owned half the land in Sokury, which Gavrila inherited along with other estates in Laishevsky. However, they provided very little income and the neighbors continued to encroach on their lands, flooding their estates or simply seizing land for themselves. His mother, a penniless widow with no powerful relatives, was unable to get any redress in the courts and was snubbed by judges. Derzhavin later wrote that his &quot;mother&#x27;s suffering from injustice remained eternally etched on his heart.&quot; Nevertheless, his mother was able to hire two tutors to teach her sons geometry and arithmetic.

In 1758, a new school opened in Kazan, saving his mother the difficulty of sending him to Saint Petersburg. The grammar school offered instruction in Latin, French, German, and arithmetic, as well as dancing, fencing and music. The instruction quality was still poor overall, with no textbooks. The school also offered opportunities for the students to perform tragedies by Molière and Alexander Sumarokov. Derzhavin eventually excelled in geometry and was informed he would be joining the corps of engineers in Saint Petersburg. However, a bureaucratic mistake led to him being made a private in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, the bodyguards of the royal family.

===Career===

In Saint Petersburg, Derzhavin rose from the ranks as a common soldier to the highest offices of state under Catherine the Great. He first impressed his commanders during Pugachev&#x27;s Rebellion. Politically astute, his career advanced when he left the military service for civil service. He rose to the position of governor of Olonets (1784) and Tambov (1785), personal secretary to the Empress (1791), President of the College of Commerce (1794), and finally the Minister of Justice (1802).

In 1800, Derzhavin wrote the political work &quot;Opinion&quot; in response to a request by Emperor Paul I to investigate recent famines in Mogilev Governorate. In the &quot;Opinion&quot;, Derzhavin blamed Belarusian famines on the &quot;mercenary trades&quot; of Jews, who exploited peasants through leaseholding of estates and distilling of alcohol, as well as the indifference of the local magnates who allowed this exploitation to occur. In response to these issues, Derzhavin proposed a series of reforms to substantially restrict the freedoms of the magnates, abolish the Jewish &quot;Qahal&quot;, end the autonomy of the Russian Jewish community, and resettle Russian Jews in colonies along the Black Sea. The &quot;Opinion&quot; became an influential source of information during the early reign of Alexander I, who eventually implemented several of Derzhavin&#x27;s suggested reforms in the 1804 &quot;Statute Concerning the Organization of the Jews&quot;.

He was dismissed from his post in 1803 and spent much of the rest of his life in the country estate at Zvanka near Novgorod, writing idylls and anacreontic verse. At his Saint Petersburg house, he held monthly meetings of the conservative Lovers of the Russian Word society. He died in 1816 and was buried in the Khutyn Monastery near Zvanka, reburied by the Soviets in the Novgorod Kremlin, and then reinterred at Khutyn.

==Works==

Derzhavin is best remembered for his odes, dedicated to the Empress and other courtiers. He paid little attention to the prevailing system of genres, and many a time would fill an ode with elegiac, humorous, or satiric contents. In his grand ode to the Empress, for instance, he mentions searching for fleas in his wife&#x27;s hair and compares his own poetry with lemonade.

Unlike other Classicist poets, Derzhavin found delight in carefully chosen details, such as a colour of wallpaper in his bedroom or a poetic inventory of his daily meal. He believed that French was a language of harmony but that Russian was a language of conflict. Although he relished harmonious alliterations, sometimes he deliberately instrumented his verse with cacophonous effect.

Derzhavin&#x27;s major odes were the impeccable &quot;On the Death of Prince Meschersky&quot; (1779); the playful &quot;Ode to Felica&quot; (1782); the lofty &quot;God&quot; (1785), which was translated into many European languages; &quot;Waterfall&quot; (1794), occasioned by the death of Prince Potemkin; and &quot;Bullfinch&quot; (1800), a poignant elegy on the death of his friend Suvorov. He also provided lyrics for the first Russian national anthem, &quot;Let the thunder of victory sound!&quot;
== Influence ==

According to D. S. Mirsky, &quot;Derzhavin&#x27;s poetry is a universe of amazing richness; its only drawback was that the great poet was of no use either as a master or as an example. He did nothing to raise the level of literary taste or to improve the literary language, and as for his poetical flights, it was obviously impossible to follow him into those giddy spheres.&quot; Nevertheless, Nikolai Nekrasov professed to follow Derzhavin rather than Pushkin, and Derzhavin&#x27;s line of broken rhythms was continued by Marina Tsvetaeva in the 20th century. In 1995, Tambov State University was named after Gavrila Derzhavin.

<doc id="183098" wikidata="Q132936" url="?curid=183098" title="Okayama Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūgoku region of Honshu. Okayama Prefecture has a population of 1,906,464 (1 February 2018) and has a geographic area of 7,114 km2 (2,746 sq mi). Okayama Prefecture borders Tottori Prefecture to the north, Hyōgo Prefecture to the east, and Hiroshima Prefecture to the west.

Okayama is the capital and largest city of Okayama Prefecture, with other major cities including Kurashiki, Tsuyama, and Sōja. Okayama Prefecture&#x27;s south is located on the Seto Inland Sea coast across from Kagawa Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, which are connected by the Great Seto Bridge, while the north is characterized by the Chūgoku Mountains.

== History ==

Prior to the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the area of present-day Okayama Prefecture was divided between Bitchū, Bizen and Mimasaka Provinces. Okayama Prefecture was formed and named in 1871 as part of the large-scale administrative reforms of the early Meiji period (1868–1912), and the borders of the prefecture were set in 1876.

== Geography ==

Okayama Prefecture borders Hyōgo Prefecture, Tottori Prefecture, and Hiroshima Prefecture. It faces Kagawa Prefecture in Shikoku across the Seto Inland Sea and includes 90 islands in the sea.

Okayama Prefecture is home to the historic town of Kurashiki. Most of the population is concentrated around Kurashiki and Okayama. The small villages in the northern mountain region are aging and declining in population - more than half of the prefecture&#x27;s municipalities are officially designated as depopulated.

As of 1 April 2014, 11% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Daisen-Oki and Setonaikai National Parks; the Hyōnosen-Ushiroyama-Nagisan Quasi-National Park; and seven Prefectural Natural Parks.

<doc id="183107" wikidata="Q105588044" url="?curid=183107" title="Sausage roll">
<text>A sausage roll is a savoury dish, popular in current and former Commonwealth nations, consisting of sausage meat wrapped in puff pastry. Although variations are known throughout Europe and in other regions, the sausage roll is most closely associated with British cuisine.

==Composition==
The basic composition of a sausage roll is sheets of puff pastry formed into tubes around sausage meat and glazed with egg or milk before being baked. They can be served either hot or cold. In the 19th century, they were made using shortcrust pastry instead of puff pastry.

A vegetarian or vegan approximation of a sausage roll can be made in the same manner, using a meat substitute.

==Sales==

In the UK, the bakery chain Greggs sells around 2.5 million sausage rolls per week, or around 140 million per year.

==History==
The wrapping of meat or other foodstuffs into dough can be traced back to the Classical Greek or Roman eras. 
Early versions of the roll with pork as a filling proved popular in London during the Napoleonic Wars and it became identified as an English dish.

On 20 September 1809, the &quot;Bury and Norwich Post&quot; mentions T. Ling, aged 75, (an industrious vendor of saloop, buns, and sausage rolls). &quot;The Times&quot; first mentions the food item in 1864 when William Johnstone, &quot;wholesale pork pie manufacturer and sausage roll maker&quot;, was fined £15 (£ in 2021), under the Nuisances Removal Act (Amendment) Act 1863, for having on his premises a large quantity of meat unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food. In 1894, a theft case provided further insights into the Victorian sausage roll production whereby the accused apprentice was taught to soak brown bread in red ochre, salt, and pepper to give the appearance of beef sausage for the filling.

==National variants==
Similar meat and pastry recipes include the Czech &quot;klobásník&quot;, the Belgian &quot;worstenbroodje&quot;, the Dutch &quot;saucijzenbroodje&quot;, the German &quot;Münsterländer Wurstbrötchen&quot; and sausage bread in the United States.

Hong Kong has developed its own style of sausage roll. Instead of having sausage meat wrapped in puff pastry like the traditional western style, the Hong Kong style &quot;sausage bun&quot; (Chinese: 腸仔包) consists of a sausage wrapped inside a soft milk bread style bun.

==In popular culture==
* The 1896 Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; features sausage rolls as a plot device, where conspirators recognise one another by eating sausage rolls.
*From 2018 to 2022, English YouTuber LadBaby had five consecutive Christmas number ones on the UK Singles Chart with cover versions of songs where the lyrics were rewritten to reference sausage rolls, including &quot;I Love Sausage Rolls&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Eatin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Sausage Rolls for Everyone&quot;.

<text>Red Rooster is an Australian fast food chain. It sells roast chicken alongside common fast food items, such as burgers, chips, salads, and beverages. Since 2021, it has offered fried chicken.

In 1972, Peter and Theo Kailis opened the first Red Rooster in Kelmscott, Western Australia, a suburb of Perth. They sought to compete with American fast food chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken, which came to Australia in 1968, by emulating their standardised model. Red Rooster proved successful, growing to 45 stores in Western Australia and Victoria before Myer bought it in 1981. Myer&#x27;s 1986 purchase and merger of another chain, Big Rooster, into Red Rooster expanded it into the eastern states.

In 2002, Chicken Treat owner Australian Fast Foods (AFF) acquired Red Rooster. It changed hands between private equity firms several times and is currently owned by Craveable Brands, a holding company of PAG Asia Capital which also owns Chicken Treat and Oporto. In 2010, most Red Roosters were converted into franchises. While it has experienced a decline in popularity in recent years, as of 2021, Red Rooster is the sixth-most popular fast food restaurant in Australia.

==History==

=== Beginnings (19721981) ===
In 1972, Peter and Theo Kailis opened the first Red Rooster in Kelmscott, a suburb of Perth. The brothers were inspired by a chicken shop on Wanneroo Road. It marked a departure from their family background in fishing, pearling, and seafood. Unlike local restaurants, Red Rooster sought to compete with American fast food chains by emulating their standardised menu, branding, and marketing strategies.

At the time, American franchises such as McDonald&#x27;s were yet to expand to Western Australia. They entered the Australian market in 1968, when Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) opened in Sydney, proving popular with the country&#x27;s fledgling restaurant scene.

Red Rooster quickly proved successful. In July 1981, when the Myer Emporium bought the chain for $8.97 million, it was the fourth-largest fast food group in Australia. It had 28 locations in Western Australia and 12 in Victoria, alongside five Red Bull hamburger outlets, which were separate buildings on the same site as Red Roosters. After the deal, Peter Kailis retained his positions as chairman and general manager. 

=== Myer (19822002) ===
In 1986, Coles Myer bought the Big Rooster chain to expand into the eastern states (except non-Steggles&#x27; Queensland stores, formerly known as &quot;Big Rooster&quot;, which were purchased in 1992), and renamed the stores &quot;Red Rooster&quot;. Big Rooster remains operational in Papua New Guinea. 

=== Modern era (2003) ===
In 2002, Red Rooster was purchased by Western Australian company Australian Fast Foods, which owned the competing Chicken Treat fast food chain. In 2007, both chains were sold for $180 million to a consortium formed by the management and Quadrant Private Equity.

In 2009, the Red Rooster chain in New Zealand closed its stores. The first New Zealand outlet, in Takanini, had opened in December 2004.

In 2010, Red Rooster changed company-owned stores to franchises. In 2011, Quadrant Private Equity sold parent company Quick Service Restaurant Holdings (later renamed Craveable Brands) to Archer Capital. 

In 2019, ownership switched to PAG Asia Capital, a private equity group based in Hong Kong, who bought Craveable Brands for about $500 million. In Queensland later that year, seven Red Rooster stores on the Sunshine Coast closed when the franchisee went into voluntary administration.

The demographer Bernard Salt has noted that Red Rooster restaurants in Sydney are almost all in Greater Western Sydney, with the &#x27;Red Rooster Line&#x27; dividing the city between the richer east and north, and the poorer west and south.

==Marketing and promotions==

In 2009, Red Rooster ran an advertising campaign called &quot;They don&#x27;t get it in America&quot; featuring comedian Tom Gleeson in the United States asking people about Red Rooster.

In 2010, Red Rooster was a sponsor of Supercars Championship team Holden Racing Team. In 2016, the team returned as the title sponsor of the Sydney SuperNight 300.

In 2011, Red Rooster changed to promoting its restaurants as healthy, fresh and quick.

Red Rooster launched its trial delivery service through Menulog in September 2014 from the Baulkham Hills, New South Wales restaurant, in partnership with Menulog. As well as delivery to homes, it was announced delivery options to businesses, sporting clubs and local organisations would be available.

<doc id="183116" wikidata="Q125863" url="?curid=183116" title="Yamagata Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Tōhoku region of Honshu. Yamagata Prefecture has a population of 1,028,055 (1 August 2023) and has a geographic area of 9,325 km2 (3,600 sq mi). Yamagata Prefecture borders Akita Prefecture to the north, Miyagi Prefecture to the east, Fukushima Prefecture to the south, and Niigata Prefecture to the southwest.

Yamagata is the capital and largest city of Yamagata Prefecture, with other major cities including Tsuruoka, Sakata, and Yonezawa. Yamagata Prefecture is located on Japan&#x27;s western Sea of Japan coast and its borders with neighboring prefectures are formed by various mountain ranges, with 17% of its total land area being designated as Natural Parks. Yamagata Prefecture formed the southern half of the historic Dewa Province with Akita Prefecture and is home to the Three Mountains of Dewa, which includes the Haguro Five-story Pagoda, a recognised National Treasure of Japan.

== History ==

The aboriginal people once inhabited the area now known as Yamagata. Yamagata and Akita Prefecture were known as Dewa Province until the Meiji Restoration.

During the Heian period (794–1185), the family ruled the area. Yamagata City flourished during the Edo period (1603–1867) due to its status as a castle town and post station, famous for&quot; beni&quot; (red safflower dye used in the production of handspun silk). In 1689, the famous haiku poet, Matsuo Bashō visited Yamagata during his five-month trip to the northern regions of Japan.

== Geography ==
Yamagata Prefecture is located in the southwest corner of Tōhoku, facing the Sea of Japan. It borders Niigata Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture on the south, Miyagi Prefecture on the east, and Akita Prefecture on the north. All of these boundaries are marked by mountains, with most of the population residing in a limited central plain.

As of 31 March 2020, 17 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Bandai-Asahi National Park; Chōkai, Kurikoma, and Zaō Quasi-National Parks; and Goshōzan, Kabusan, Kennan, Mogamigawa, Shōnai Kaihin, and Tendō Kōgen Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Cities===

Thirteen cities are located in Yamagata Prefecture:
===Towns and villages===

These are the towns and villages in each district:
===Mergers===
== Climate ==
The climate of Yamagata Prefecture is characterized by long, hot, and humid summers and long, snowy winters. Both spring and autumn are short, the former often cold, the latter often warm, but both quite dry and sunny. Yamagata Prefecture, along with northern parts of Miyagi and Iwate are the transition areas from humid subtropical climate (Koppen &quot;Cfa&quot;/&quot;Cwa&quot;) to humid continental within the Japan mainland. Winter temperatures rarely fall below in populated areas; they frequently rise above in July and August. Precipitation falls all year round and the remnants of one or perhaps two typhoons usually pass through between August and October. The winters see heavy snowfall especially at higher elevations, though the Japan Sea coast (Sakata) is milder and has more rain. Snowfall for Shinjō is typical of populated mountainous areas, snowfall for Yamagata City typical of the valleys. The central mountains around Gassan may see as much as of snow in a season with depths up to at higher elevations.



== Economy ==

===Fruit===


Yamagata Prefecture is the largest producer of cherries and pears in Japan. A large quantity of other kinds of fruits such as grapes, apples, peaches, melons, persimmons and watermelons are also produced.

== Demographics ==

As of October 2020, Yamagata Prefecture had a population of 1,068,027. As of October 2019, 33.4% of the population was over 65 with 15.5% aged between 65 and 74 and 17.9% over 75. This is an increase of 8.5% over census data from 2004 where 12.8% of the population was aged between 65 and 74, and 12.1% was over 75.

Yamagata prefecture experienced its greatest growth period following the end of World War II, but then quickly began to slow down and eventually decline steadily. Today, the population is nearly the same as it was in 1930.

==City life==
Yamagata City is the central hub for Yamagata Prefecture and has many shops and restaurants around its main station. It is also the location with the most western hotels and the primary place of lodging for visitors visiting this region. This city serves as a good hub to visit the surrounding cities and towns around this prefecture with bus lines and train lines linking almost every part of Yamagata from the station.

There are also many bars near the station giving this city a good night life for visitors to enjoy at the front of the station as well as the nanukamachi district in the downtown area of the city. 

===Festivals and events===
Yamagata Prefecture has a number of annual festivals and events.

The largest is the Yamagata Hanagasa Festival (花笠祭り) which takes place in Yamagata City on the first weekend in August, when thousands of people perform the hanagasa dance in the city centre and attracts up to 300,000 spectators. Yamagata City is the home of the bi-annual Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in October.

In February, a snow lantern festival is held in Yonezawa at the Uesugi Shrine. Hundreds of candle-lit lanterns light pathways dug into the snow around the shrine. Yonezawa is also the site of the &quot;Uesugi Festival&quot; (上杉祭り, &quot;uesugi matsuri&quot;) in mid-spring. The festival&#x27;s highlight is a re-enactment of the Battle of Kawanakajima on the banks of the Matsukawa River.

In September, Yamagata Prefecture is famous for its imoni, a taro-root stew popular in Northern Japan during the autumn. Imonikai, taro-root soup parties, are very popular during this season, and many tourists come to Yamagata Prefecture specifically for its particular style of imoni.

===Art===
Beginning in 2003, Yamagata city officials with the aid of Tōhoku University of Art and Design began a three-year project in which the Buddhist art of the city&#x27;s temples would be catalogued and compared to a set of guidelines in order to identify &quot;cultural assets&quot;. One hundred and ninety temples have had their works of art examined and several significant examples of Buddhist sculpture have been discovered. At Heisenji Temple, in the Hirashimizu district, a particularly rare statue, a seated Vairocana Buddha made from zelkova wood, was found. Other significant works include sculptures from the Heian period (794–1185) and Kamakura period (1192–1333).

The Yamagata Museum of Art, located in Yamagata City, was opened in 1964 through the efforts of a foundation led by Yoshio Hattori, the president of Yamagata Shimbun and Yamagata Broadcasting Co, Ltd. The permanent collection consists of three types of art: Japanese and Asian, regional, and French. Special exhibitions are held periodically.

===Language===
Yamagata Prefecture is known for its local dialect Yamagata-ben, sometimes thought of as backward sounding in other parts of Japan. The 2004 movie &quot;Swing Girls&quot; (スウィングガールズ), co-written and directed by Shinobu Yaguchi, is set in Yamagata and makes use of Yamagata-ben for comedic purposes.

Mount Zaō is a famous winter ski resort, also known for its &quot;snow monsters&quot; (frozen snow-covered trees) in the winter, and the &quot;Okama crater lake&quot;, also known as the &quot;Goshiki Numa&quot; (Five Color Lake) because its colour changes according to the weather.

<text>Overpressure (or blast overpressure) is the pressure caused by a shock wave over and above normal atmospheric pressure. The shock wave may be caused by sonic boom or by explosion, and the resulting overpressure receives particular attention when measuring the effects of nuclear weapons or thermobaric bombs.

== Effects ==

According to an article in the journal &quot;Toxicological Sciences&quot;,

Blast overpressure (BOP), also known as high energy impulse noise, is a damaging outcome of explosive detonations and firing of weapons. Exposure to BOP shock waves alone results in injury predominantly to the hollow organ systems such as auditory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems.

An EOD suit worn by bomb disposal experts can protect against the effects of BOP.

The above table details the effects of overpressure on the human body in a building affected by a blast of overpressure waves, as clarified later in the journal. 

According to documents released by the United States Military Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC),
== Calculation for an enclosed space ==
Overpressure in an enclosed space is determined using &quot;Weibull&#x27;s formula&quot;:

formula_1

where:
*22.5 is a constant based on experimentation
*formula_2 = (kilograms) net explosive mass calculated using all explosive materials and their relative effectiveness
*formula_3 = (cubic meters) volume of given area (primarily used to determine volume within an enclosed space)

<text>William Knox D&#x27;Arcy (11 October 18491 May 1917) was a British-Australian businessman who was one of the principal founders of the oil and petrochemical industry in Persia (Iran). The D’Arcy Concession was signed in 1901 and allowed D&#x27;Arcy to explore, obtain, and market oil, natural gas, asphalt, and ozokerite in Persia.

==Early life==
He was born in Newton Abbot, Devon, England and was the son of a solicitor. He attended Westminster School until 1866, when the family emigrated to Australia following his father&#x27;s bankruptcy, settling in Rockhampton, Queensland. D&#x27;Arcy continued his studies and chose to follow law, later joining his father&#x27;s business. He did well and began to speculate, initially in land.

He married Elena Birkbeck of Rockhampton at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Parramatta on 23 October 1872. Elena was born in Mexico in 1840, the only daughter of Damiana de Barre Valdez and Samuel Birkbeck, a mining engineer from Illinois in the United States, who was in Mexico managing a silver mine. He was descended from the English Birkbecks, a Quaker family with an interest in education.

==Mining in Australia and New Zealand==

In 1882 he became a partner, with Walter Russell Hall and Thomas Skarratt Hall, in a syndicate with Thomas, Frederick and Edwin Morgan when they opened a mine on Ironstone Mountain (later renamed Mount Morgan), in Queensland, south of Rockhampton. There was a significant deposit at Mount Morgan Mine. In October 1886, the syndicate became the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, with D&#x27;Arcy a director and the largest shareholder. He held 125,000 shares in his own name and 233,000 in trust. At one stage the shares reached £17/1s/- each, making them worth more than £6 million (an amount equivalent to £ in present-day terms). The company also worked a rich gold mine at Matakanui, Central Otago, New Zealand, through its subsidiary the Mount Morgan Sluicing Company.

==Oil exploration in Persia==
In 1889, with a substantial fortune, D&#x27;Arcy and his family moved to England, where he bought the Stanmore Hall mansion, Bylaugh Park, and a house on Grosvenor Square. His wife, Elena, died in 1897 and, in 1899, he married Nina Boucicault (a first cousin of her namesake, celebrated Irish stage and film actress Nina Boucicault), with whom he lavishly entertained guests. He had acquired a strong interest in horse-racing while in Australia, and maintained a private box at Epsom racecourse.

In 1900, he agreed to fund a search for oil and minerals in Persia headed by Wolff, Ketabchee and Cotte, although D&#x27;Arcy never visited Persia himself. Negotiations with the Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar began in 1901, and with the offer of £20,000 (£ million today), for a sixty-year concession to explore for oil later, the D&#x27;Arcy Concession was secured in May, covering , and stipulated that D&#x27;Arcy would have the oil rights to the entire country except for five provinces in Northern Iran. In exchange, the Iranian government was given 16% of the oil company&#x27;s annual profits, an agreement that would remain in effect until the nationalisation of the industry by the Iranian government in March 1952.

A drilling team under George B. Reynolds was sent to Chiah Surkh and drilling commenced at the end of 1902. Despite drilling a producer in January 1904, D&#x27;Arcy had already spent £160,000, and was overdrawn at Lloyds Bank by £177,000. D&#x27;Arcy was forced to find further financial support, and in 1905 the Concession Syndicate was established with Burmah Oil Company Ltd. as a major investor, and D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s operation a subsidiary. More importantly, operations moved to the Shardin region in 1906.

Drilling in southern Persia at Shardin continued until 1907, when the search was switched to Masjed Soleyman (Masjed-e-Sulayman in Persian مسجد سلیمان), in a place named &quot;Maydon-e-Naftune&quot;. Drilling began at one site in January 1908, and at another nearby in March. By April, with no success, the venture close to collapse, and D&#x27;Arcy almost bankrupt, he decided, with Burmah, to abandon exploration in Iran. In early May 1908, they sent Reynolds a telegram stating that they had run out of money and ordering him to &quot;cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost of transporting to the coast for re-shipment, and come home&quot;. Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil at shortly after on 26 May 1908.

In April 1909, D&#x27;Arcy was appointed a director of the newly founded Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), which would later become British Petroleum (BP). By 1911, APOC had run a pipeline from the find to a refinery at Abadan. In 1912, the Mount Morgan company was listed in London, and D&#x27;Arcy was made chairman of that board.

The financial support given by Burmah Oil and the British Admiralty meant that D&#x27;Arcy could no longer put his name to the new company despite the best efforts of his wife, and so was a shareholder.

==Later life==
Later in life he lived at Stanmore Hall, Middlesex. It was enlarged by Brightwen Binyon in 1888–91. A billiard room and new dining room were created. Then he commissioned from William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones a suite of tapestries, &#x27;The Quest of the Holy Grail&#x27;, that were displayed in the hall but are now dispersed. He also owned paintings by Frank Dicksee and Frederick Goodall.

He died on 1 May 1917, aged 67.

D&#x27;Arcy was posthumously inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2012.

<text>Christopher Tucker (born August 31, 1971) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. Tucker made his debut in 1992 as a stand-up performer on the HBO comedy series &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot;, where he frequently appeared on the show during the 1990s. He made his feature film debut in &quot;House Party 3&quot; in 1994 and gained greater recognition in &quot;Friday&quot; the following year. In 1997, he co-starred in the films &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;Money Talks&quot;, and appeared in a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. Tucker later achieved international fame in the 2000s for playing Detective James Carter in the &quot;Rush Hour&quot; film series.

==Early life, education, and career==
Christopher Tucker was born in Atlanta on August 31, 1971, the youngest son of Mary Louise (&quot;née&quot; Bryant) and Norris Tucker. One of six children, Tucker learned early in life that humor had the power to draw attention to himself both at school and at home. His father was an independent businessman who owned a janitorial service. Tucker grew up in a Pentecostal Christian household; his parents were members of the Church of God in Christ during his childhood.

Tucker grew up in Decatur, Georgia, and after graduating from Columbia High School, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue his comedy career. His comedy influences were Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy, and Tucker was known by his teachers and high school classmates for making people laugh by doing impressions of Murphy, Michael Jackson, and others.

==Career==

Tucker began showcasing his comedy skills before an audience in local Atlanta comedy clubs until he decided to move to Los Angeles in 1990 to further pursue his stand-up comedy career. In 1992, Tucker was a frequent performer on the HBO comedy series &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot;. He made his cinematic debut in &quot;House Party 3&quot; in 1994 and gained greater film recognition alongside N.W.A rapper Ice Cube in &quot;Friday&quot; the following year. In 1997, he co-starred in the films &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;Money Talks&quot;. He also played a supporting role in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; and had a starring role in the spy comedy &quot;Double-O-Soul&quot;, but the latter was never released.

Along with Hong Kong actor and martial artist Jackie Chan, Tucker starred as LAPD detective James Carter in the martial arts action comedy film series &quot;Rush Hour&quot;. After the commercial success of the first &quot;Rush Hour&quot; film, he held out for a $20 million salary for &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, and was paid $25 million for &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;. The latter was part of a $40 million two-movie contract with New Line Cinema that also included an unnamed future film. He was also to receive 20% of the gross from &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;.

Tucker did not reprise his role as Smokey in &quot;Next Friday&quot; (2000) or &quot;Friday After Next&quot; (2002) for religious reasons, later explaining that he didn&#x27;t want to encourage others to smoke marijuana. He starred in Michael Jackson&#x27;s video &quot;You Rock My World&quot; and made a cameo appearance in Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;California Love&quot;. On February 13, 2009, Tucker participated in the NBA All-Star Weekend&#x27;s Celebrity Game. Other celebrities participating included rapper Master P, NBA Hall of Famers Clyde Drexler and Dominique Wilkins, wide receiver Terrell Owens, and four Harlem Globetrotters.

Tucker was announced in 2007 to star in the New Line drama film &quot;Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra&quot;, directed by Brett Ratner and based on George Jacobs&#x27;s autobiography of working as Frank Sinatra&#x27;s valet during the Rat Pack era of 1953–68.

In 2011, Tucker made a comeback to stand-up comedy. The next year, he returned to film in &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot;, co-starring Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, and Robert De Niro. Tucker&#x27;s performance in the film was well received by critics and audiences alike. The film itself received numerous nominations and awards including the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast. He also hosted the 2013 BET Awards. In 2016, he appeared in &quot;Billy Lynn&#x27;s Long Halftime Walk&quot;. In 2023, he portrayed Nike executive Howard White in the film &quot;Air&quot;.

==Philanthropy and political views==
He endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries.

In 2021, Tucker joined the Heal Los Angeles Foundation as an official ambassador. The Foundation is co-founded by Michael Jackson’s son, Prince Jackson, and their purpose is to help inner-city youth in Los Angeles by ending homelessness, child abuse, and hunger in the city.

During the 2022 Halloween Thriller Night hosted by the Heal Los Angeles Foundation, Tucker and Steve Harvey were honored and received the inaugural &quot;Man in The Mirror&quot; Award. The award is given to influential individuals using their platforms for good. Tucker accepted the award that was presented by Prince Jackson.

==Personal life==
Tucker has a son named Destin with his ex-wife Azja Pryor. He divides his time between Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Atlanta.

Tucker is good friends with fellow &quot;Rush Hour&quot; co-star Jackie Chan. He was also close with singer Michael Jackson: introducing and dancing with him at his 30th Anniversary Celebration; appearing in his video &quot;You Rock My World&quot; from the 2001 album &quot;Invincible&quot;; testifying on Jackson’s behalf during his 2005 trial, and attending his memorial service. Tucker&#x27;s career was also influenced by Jackson, as he is seen dancing and singing to &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop &#x27;Til You Get Enough&quot; in a scene in &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and imitating Jackson&#x27;s dancing style in &quot;Friday&quot;.

Tucker participated in Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s 2006 PBS documentary on the genetic makeup of African Americans, &quot;African American Lives&quot;, that specifically focused on stories of Native American heritage in African-American communities. Tucker&#x27;s DNA test results showed African, European, and &quot;likely some Native American&quot; ancestors. Tucker&#x27;s patrilineal ancestry was also traced back to the Ambundu ethnic group of Angola and one line of his mother&#x27;s to the Bamileke of Cameroon. He also traced his family tree back to the 1830s. Tucker and Gates were shown visiting Angola, the birthplace of some of his ancestors.

In 2014, Tucker settled a $2.5 million tax debt. A representative blamed &quot;poor accounting and business management&quot;. In November 2021, the IRS sued Tucker, seeking $9.6 million in back taxes.

Also in 2014, Tucker told an interviewer that he refrains from using harsh profanity in his performances due to his Christian faith.

Tucker&#x27;s connection to Jeffrey Epstein was covered in the 2020 Netflix documentary series &quot;Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich&quot;. In 2002, Tucker traveled in Epstein&#x27;s airplane alongside Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey for humanitarian purposes in combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.

<text>Altena (; Westphalian: &quot;Altenoa&quot;) is a town in the district of Märkischer Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The town&#x27;s castle is the origin for the later Dukes of Berg. Altena is situated on the Lenne river valley, in the northern stretches of the Sauerland.

==History==

Altena Castle was built in the early 12th century, as a stronghold of the older Counts of Berg. A short time later a village was founded beneath the hill, with the castle alongside the river Lenne, which feeds into the river Ruhr. After the distribution of the Berg family estates in 1161, Altena became the centre of the County of Altena. The first Count of Altena became Eberhard I, Count of Berg-Altena. In 1180, after the death of the first count, the county was divided between the two oldest sons: Arnold of Altena and Friedrich of Altena. The third son, Adolf of Altena, became Archbishop of Cologne. Arnold was provided with on half of the Castle and County of Altena, the Castle Hövel and some estates as fiefdoms of the Archbishops of Cologne and bailiwicks of the Abbey Essen. Near the Village and Castle of Hövel, he built the Castle and town of Nienbrügge (Novus Ponte) on the Lippe riverbanks. His family branch renamed themselves after selling their half of Altena to the Archbishop of Cologne as &quot;de Nienbrügge&quot; or &quot;de Novus Ponte&quot;, their new principal residence about forty kilometers to the north. The heir of Arnold was Friedrich de Novus Ponte (Nienbrügge) who changed his title to Isenberg after his new castle in Hattingen. He was sentenced to death as head of a conspiracy to murder Engelbert I. Archbishop of Cologne, Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke of Westphalia and Count of Berg, a close relative, in 1226. The Archbishop was ambushed and slain on his way from his City of Soest to City of Cologne by Friedrich and his men near Gevelsberg in a hollow way. Both had a dispute over the bailiwicks of Essen Abbey.

The junior branch of the Counts of Altena, was founded by Friedrich de Altena. He was provided with the other half of Altena and a vassal to his brother the Archbishop of Cologne. In or around 1170 he bought the &quot;Oberhof Mark&quot; or was rewarded with it by the Archbishop. The Oberhof was a mayor manor without fortifications in the village of Mark, between the Lippe and Ahse rivers less than five kilometers to the east of the Nienbrügge Castle and about seven kilometers southeast of Hövel Castle. Today, about a 1,5 kilometers to the east of the centre of the city of Hamm. Before or in 1198 he built the Castle of Mark. His son Adolf I. named himself in 1202 &quot;puer comes de marca&quot; and became the first Count of Mark. He sometimes used the old title Altena in combination with Mark. His principal residence was the Castle of Mark. After the execution of his cousin Friedrich de Isenberg in Cologne, he destroyed the Castle of Neinbruegge and took over the possessions of the senior family branch.

After 1202, Altena Castle was only one of several Stronghold of the family of Altena-Mark. During a feud in 1323 between the Prince-Bishop of Münster and the Count of Mark, the Bishop was captured and held for ransom in Altena. In 1367 the settlement below the castle received limited town rights through Engelbert III. Count de la Mark. Since 1392 Altena remained only the seat of the bailiff for bailiwick Altena. The castle was also used as an archive for documents and patents for the county.

In 1609, the last count died childless. His realm, the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg were practically divided into a Catholic and a Protestant part. The Duchy of Cleves and the counties of Mark and Ravensberg, and the Dominion of Ravenstein were inherited by the Protestant Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, Margrave of Brandenburg, and Duke of Prussia Johann Sigismund of Hohenzollern. The catholic Duchy of Jülich-Berg were inherited by the Count Palatine Wolfgang Wilhelm of Neuburg.

During the Napoleonic occupation of the Rhineland and Westphalia, Altena was re-joined with the now elevated Grand Duchy of Berg. After the Congress of Vienna the County of Mark was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and reorganized as a district (Kreis) and government district (Regierungsbezirk). Altena became part of the Regierungsbezirk Hamm and was seat of the Kreis Altena. Within the year 1815 the Government moved the quarters from Hamm to Arnsberg, and changed the name into Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg.

With the start of the year 1969, the Kreis Altena and the town Lüdenscheid were merged to form the new Kreis Lüdenscheid. Lüdenscheid became the new administrative center of the district. Only six years later the Kreis Lüdenscheid was reformed and enlarged. In reminiscence of the County of Mark it was renamed as Märkischer Kreis.

In May 2017, Chancellor Merkel awarded Altena Mayor Andreas Hollstein the &quot;National Prize for Integration&quot; for taking in 370 refugees, i.e. 100 more than the mandatory quota. Six months later, even though Mayor Hollstein had been stabbed by a man with a knife who reportedly was upset over his immigration policy, he remained determined to promote policies aimed at helping refugees assimilate into the town.

==Points of interest==

The town&#x27;s biggest attraction is the castle: &quot;Burg Altena&quot;. After being un-used for centuries it was in ruins, although part of the buildings was used as a hospital. A complete restoration was undertaken in 1909 to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Prussian incorporation of the county of Mark into Prussia (Brandenburg). However, most of the work did not finish before 1914; the celebrations were then held at Hohensyburg Castle.

In 1912 the world&#x27;s first youth hostel was created by Richard Schirrmann inside the castle. The old rooms are still on display, and new rooms inside the castle area are still part of the hostel today.

The dominant industry in Altena was wire production, and thus it has a museum dedicated to this industry only, the &quot;Drahtmuseum&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows Catherine of Alexandria, the patron saint of the church built in 1310. She is depicted with a sword and a wheel, as she was killed in 307 by these two items. The choice of patron saint goes back to a vow made by Count Engelbert III of the Mark made at the burial place of Catherine in Jerusalem. The red and white checked fess refers to the coat of arms of the Counts of the Mark.

The coat of arms is quite old: a seal from the 15th century already depicts the same elements. In its current design it was created by Otto Hupp in 1938.

<text>In geology and sedimentology, connate fluids are liquids that were trapped in the pores of sedimentary rocks as they were deposited. These liquids are largely composed of water, but also contain many mineral components as ions in solution.

As rocks are buried, they undergo lithification and the connate fluids are usually expelled. If the escape route for these fluids is blocked, the pore fluid pressure can build up, leading to overpressure.

== Significance ==

An understanding of the geochemistry of connate fluids is important if the diagenesis of the rock is to be quantified. The solutes in the connate fluids often precipitate and reduce the porosity and permeability of the host rock, which can have important implications for its hydrocarbon . The chemical components of the connate fluid can also yield information on the provenance of aquifers and of the thermal history of the host rock. Minute bubbles of fluid are often trapped within the crystals of the cementing material. These fluid inclusions provide direct information about the composition of the fluid and the pressure-temperature conditions that existed during diagenesis of the sediments.

Similar, but different in origin, is the concept of fossil water, which is used to describe very old groundwater found in deep aquifers or bedrock. Typically it was recharged during a different climatic period (e.g., the last ice age) so is also very old, but possibly not of the same genesis as the rock.

<doc id="183143" wikidata="Q203472" url="?curid=183143" title="Frigatebird">
<text>Frigatebirds are a family of seabirds called Fregatidae which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans. The five extant species are classified in a single genus, Fregata. All have predominantly black plumage, long, deeply forked tails and long hooked bills. Females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red gular pouch, which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females. Their wings are long and pointed and can span up to , the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird.

Able to soar for weeks on wind currents, frigatebirds spend most of the day in flight hunting for food, and roost on trees or cliffs at night. Their main prey are fish and squid, caught when chased to the water surface by large predators such as tuna. Frigatebirds are referred to as kleptoparasites as they occasionally rob other seabirds for food, and are known to snatch seabird chicks from the nest. Seasonally monogamous, frigatebirds nest colonially. A rough nest is constructed in low trees or on the ground on remote islands. A single egg is laid each breeding season. The duration of parental care is among the longest of any bird species; frigatebirds are only able to breed every other year.

The Fregatidae are a sister group to Suloidea which consists of cormorants, darters, gannets, and boobies. Three of the five extant species of frigatebirds are widespread (the magnificent, great and lesser frigatebirds), while two are endangered (the Christmas Island and Ascension Island frigatebirds) and restrict their breeding habitat to one small island each. The oldest fossils date to the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Classified in the genus &quot;Limnofregata&quot;, the three species had shorter, less-hooked bills and longer legs, and lived in a freshwater environment.

==Taxonomy==

===Etymology===
The term &quot;Frigate Bird&quot; itself was used in 1738 by the English naturalist and illustrator Eleazar Albin in his &quot;A Natural History of the Birds&quot;. The book included an illustration of the male bird showing the red gular pouch. Like the genus name, the English term is derived from the French mariners&#x27; name for the bird &quot;la frégate&quot;—a frigate or fast warship. The etymology was mentioned by French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre when describing the bird in 1667.
Alternative names and spellings include &quot;frigate bird&quot;, &quot;frigate-bird&quot;, &quot;frigate&quot;, &quot;frigate-petrel&quot;.

Christopher Columbus encountered frigatebirds when passing the Cape Verde Islands on his first voyage across the Atlantic in 1492. In his journal entry for 29 September he used the word &quot;rabiforçado&quot;, modern Spanish &quot;rabihorcado&quot; or forktail. In the Caribbean frigatebirds were called Man-of-War birds by English mariners. This name was used by the English explorer William Dampier in his book &quot;An Account of a New Voyage Around the World&quot; published in 1697:
The Man-of-War (as it is called by the English) is about the bigness of a Kite, and in shape like it, but black; and the neck is red. It lives on Fish yet never lights on the water, but soars aloft like a Kite, and when it sees its prey, it flys down head foremost to the Waters edge, very swiftly takes its prey out of the Sea with his Bill, and immediately mounts again as swiftly; never touching the Water with his Bill. His Wings are very long; his feet are like other Land-fowl, and he builds on Trees, where he finds any; but where they are wanting on the ground.

===Classification===
Frigatebirds were grouped with cormorants, and sulids (gannets and boobies) as well as pelicans in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; by Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He described the distinguishing characteristics as a straight bill hooked at the tip, linear nostrils, a bare face, and fully webbed feet. The genus &quot;Fregata&quot; was introduced by French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The type species was designated as the Ascension frigatebird by French zoologist François Marie Daudin in 1802. Louis Pierre Vieillot described the genus name &quot;Tachypetes&quot; in 1816 for the great frigatebird. The genus name &quot;Atagen&quot; had been coined by German naturalist Paul Möhring in 1752, though this has no validity as it predates the official beginning of Linnaean taxonomy.

In 1874, English zoologist Alfred Henry Garrod published a study where he had examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical Pelecaniformes), he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics more in common with Procellariiformes than Pelecaniformes, though concluded they still belonged in the latter group (as suborder Fregatae), albeit as an early offshoot. Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on behavioural characteristics of the traditional Pelecaniformes, calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets, darters and cormorants, and tropicbirds the most distant lineage. The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes, united by feet that are totipalmate (with all four toes linked by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The DNA–DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins, loons, petrels and albatrosses. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.

Molecular studies have consistently shown that pelicans, the namesake family of the Pelecaniformes, are actually more closely related to herons, ibises and spoonbills, the hamerkop and the shoebill than to the remaining species. In recognition of this, the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.

In 1994, the family name Fregatidae, cited as described in 1867 by French naturalists Côme-Damien Degland and Zéphirin Gerbe, was conserved under Article 40(b) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in preference to the 1840 description Tachypetidae by Johann Friedrich von Brandt. This was because the genus names &quot;Atagen&quot; and &quot;Tachypetes&quot; had been synonymised with &quot;Fregata&quot; before 1961, resulting in the aligning of family and genus names.

===Fossil record===

The Eocene frigatebird genus &quot;Limnofregata&quot; comprises birds whose fossil remains were recovered from prehistoric freshwater environments, unlike the marine preferences of their modern-day relatives. They had shorter less-hooked bills and longer legs, and longer slit-like nasal openings. Three species have been described from fossil deposits in the western United States, two—&quot;L. azygosternon&quot; and &quot;L. hasegawai&quot;—from the Green River Formation (48–52 million years old) and one—&quot;L. hutchisoni&quot;—from the Wasatch Formation (between 53 and 55 million years of age). Fossil material indistinguishable from living species dating to the Pleistocene and Holocene has been recovered from Ascension Island (for &quot;F. aquila&quot;), Saint Helena Island, both in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and also from various islands in the Pacific Ocean (for &quot;F. minor&quot; and &quot;F. ariel&quot;). A tarsometatarsus and pedal phalanx from the Lower Eocene London Clay of the Walton-on-the-Naze resembles &quot;Limnofregata&quot;, but being notably larger and distinct in other ways, was tentatively referred to &quot;Marinavis longirostris&quot; due to similar stratigraphy, geography, size, and presumed frigatebird affinities.

A cladistic study of the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with &quot;Limnofregata&quot;. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17. The age of &quot;Limnofregata&quot; indicates that these lineages had separated by the Eocene.

===Living species and infrageneric classification===

The type species of the genus is the Ascension frigatebird (&quot;Fregata aquila&quot;). For many years, the consensus was to recognise only two species of frigatebird, with larger birds as &quot;F. aquila&quot; and smaller as &quot;F. ariel&quot;. In 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews delineated five species, which remain valid. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the five species had diverged from a common ancestor only recently—as little as 1.5 million years ago. There are two species pairs, the great and Christmas Island frigatebirds, and the magnificent and Ascension frigatebirds, while the fifth species, the lesser frigatebird, is an early offshoot of the common ancestor of the other four species. Two subspecies of the magnificent, three subspecies of the lesser and five subspecies of the great frigatebird are recognised.


==Description==

Frigatebirds are large slender mostly black-plumaged seabirds, with the five species similar in appearance to each other. The largest species is the magnificent frigatebird, which reaches in length, with three of the remaining four almost as large. The lesser frigatebird is substantially smaller, at around long. Frigatebirds exhibit marked sexual dimorphism; females are larger and up to 25 percent heavier than males, and generally have white markings on their underparts. Frigatebirds have short necks and long, slender hooked bills. Their long narrow wings (male wingspan can reach ) taper to points. Their wings have eleven primary flight feathers, with the tenth the longest and eleventh a vestigial feather only, and 23 secondaries. Their tails are deeply forked, though this is not apparent unless the tail is fanned. The tail and wings give them a distinctive &#x27;W&#x27; silhouette in flight. The legs and face are fully feathered. The totipalmate feet are short and weak, the webbing is reduced and part of each toe is free.

The bones of frigatebirds are markedly pneumatic, making them very light and contributing only 5% to total body weight. The pectoral girdle is strong as its bones are fused. The pectoral muscles are well-developed, and weigh as much as the frigatebird&#x27;s feathers—around half the body weight is made up equally of these muscles and feathers. The males have inflatable red-coloured throat pouches called gular pouches, which they inflate to attract females during the mating season. The gular sac is, perhaps, the most striking frigatebird feature. These can only deflate slowly, so males that are disturbed will fly off with pouches distended for some time.

Frigatebirds remain in the air and do not settle on the ocean. They produce very little oil from their uropygial glands so their feathers would become sodden if they settled on the surface. In addition, with their long wings relative to body size, they would have great difficulty taking off again.

==Distribution and habitat==
Frigatebirds are found over tropical oceans, and ride warm updrafts under cumulus clouds. Their range coincides with availability of food such as flying fish, and with the trade winds, which provide the windy conditions that facilitate their flying. They occur as rare vagrants to temperate regions and are not found in polar latitudes. Adults are generally sedentary, remaining near the islands where they breed. However, male frigatebirds have been recorded dispersing great distances after departing a breeding colony—one male great frigatebird relocated from Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel to the Maldives away, and a male magnificent frigatebird flew from French Guiana to Trinidad. In 2015, a magnificent frigatebird was spotted as far north as Michigan. Great frigatebirds marked with wing tags on Tern Island in the French Frigate Shoals were found to regularly travel the to Johnston Atoll, although one was reported in Quezon City in the Philippines. Genetic testing seems to indicate that the species has fidelity to their site of hatching despite their high mobility. Young birds may disperse far and wide, with distances of up to recorded.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Having the largest wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, frigatebirds are essentially aerial. This allows them to soar continuously and only rarely flap their wings. One great frigatebird, being tracked by satellite in the Indian Ocean, stayed aloft for two months. They can fly higher than 4,000 meters in freezing conditions. Like swifts they are able to spend the night on the wing, but they will also return to an island to roost on trees or cliffs. Field observations in the Mozambique Channel found that great frigatebirds could remain on the wing for up to 12 days while foraging. Highly adept, they use their forked tails for steering during flight and make strong deep wing-beats, though not suited to flying by sustained flapping. Frigatebirds bathe and clean themselves in flight by flying low and splashing at the water surface before preening and scratching afterwards. Conversely, frigatebirds do not swim and with their short legs cannot walk well or take off from the sea easily.

According to a study in the journal &quot;Nature Communications&quot;, scientists attached an accelerometer and an electroencephalogram testing device on nine great frigatebirds to measure if they slept during flight. The study found the birds do sleep, but usually only using one hemisphere of the brain at a time and usually sleep while ascending at higher altitudes. The amount of time mid-air sleeping was less than an hour and always at night.

The average life span is unknown but in common with seabirds such as the wandering albatross and Leach&#x27;s storm petrel, frigatebirds are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.

Despite having dark plumage in a tropical climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly as they are exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.

Unlike most seabirds, frigatebirds are thermal soarers, using thermals to glide. This is in contrast to birds like albatrosses, which are dynamic soarers, using winds produced by the waves to stay aloft.

===Breeding behaviour===
Frigatebirds typically breed on remote oceanic islands, generally in colonies of up to 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals. Breeding can occur at any time of year, often prompted by commencement of the dry season or plentiful food.

Frigatebirds have the most elaborate mating displays of all seabirds. The male birds take up residence in the colony in groups of up to thirty individuals. They display to females flying overhead by pointing their bills upwards, inflating their red throat pouches and vibrating their outstretched wings, showing the lighter wing undersurfaces in the process. They produce a drumming sound by vibrating their bills together and sometimes give a whistling call. The female descends to join a male she has chosen and allows him to take her bill in his. The pair also engages in mutual &quot;head-snaking&quot;.

After copulation it is generally the male who gathers sticks and the female that constructs the loosely woven nest. The nest is subsequently covered with (and cemented by) guano. Frigatebirds prefer to nest in trees or bushes, though when these are not available they will nest on the ground. A single white egg that weighs up to 6–7% of mother&#x27;s body mass is laid, and is incubated in turns by both birds for 41 to 55 days. The altricial chicks are naked on hatching and develop a white down. They are continuously guarded by the parents for the first 4–6 weeks and are fed on the nest for 5–6 months. Both parents take turns feeding for the first three months, after which the male&#x27;s attendance trails off leaving the mother to feed the young for another six to nine months on average. The chicks feed by reaching their heads in their parents&#x27; throat and eating the part-regurgitated food. It takes so long to rear a chick that frigatebirds generally breed every other year.

The duration of parental care in frigatebirds is among the longest for birds, rivalled only by the southern ground hornbill and some large accipitrids. Frigatebirds take many years to reach sexual maturity. A study of great frigatebirds in the Galapagos Islands found that they only bred once they have acquired the full adult plumage. This was attained by female birds when they were eight to nine years of age and by male birds when they were ten to eleven years of age.

Frigatebirds&#x27; feeding habits are pelagic, and they may forage up to 500 km (310 mi) from land. They do not land on the water but snatch prey from the ocean surface using their long, hooked bills. They mainly catch small fish such as flying fish, particularly the genera &quot;Exocoetus&quot; and &quot;Cypselurus&quot;, that are driven to the surface by predators such as tuna and dolphinfish, but they will also eat cephalopods, particularly squid. Menhaden of the genus &quot;Brevoortia&quot; can be an important prey item where common, and jellyfish and larger plankton are also eaten. Frigatebirds have learned to follow fishing vessels and take fish from holding areas. Conversely tuna fishermen fish in areas where they catch sight of frigatebirds due to their association with large marine predators. Frigatebirds also at times prey directly on eggs and young of other seabirds, including boobies, petrels, shearwaters and terns, in particular the sooty tern.

Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, particularly the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents. They may either assail their targets after they have caught their food or circle high over seabird colonies waiting for parent birds to return laden with food. Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic feeding behaviour, kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.

Unlike most other seabirds, frigatebirds drink freshwater when they come across it, by swooping down and gulping with their bills.

===Parasites===
Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in that they often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne protozoa of the genus &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; have been recovered from four of the five species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus &quot;Pectinopygus&quot; and amblyceran genus &quot;Colpocephalum&quot; and species &quot;Fregatiella aurifasciata&quot; have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.

A heavy chick mortality at a large and important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year&#x27;s progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named &quot;Fregata magnificens&quot; herpesvirus, though it was unclear whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.

==Status and conservation==

===Populations and threats===
Two of the five species are considered at risk. In 2003, a survey of the four colonies of the critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebirds counted 1200 breeding pairs. As frigatebirds normally breed every other year, the total adult population was estimated to lie between 1800 and 3600 pairs. Larger numbers formerly bred on the island, but the clearance of breeding habitat during World War II and dust pollution from phosphate mining have contributed to the decrease. The population of the vulnerable Ascension frigatebird has been estimated at around 12,500 individuals. The birds formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. The birds continued to breed on a rocky outcrop just off the shore of the island. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 eradicated the feral cats and a few birds have returned to nest on the island.

The other three species are classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;. The populations of all three are large, with that of the magnificent frigatebird thought to be increasing, while the great and lesser frigatebird decreasing. Monitoring populations of all species is difficult due to their movements across the open ocean and low reproductivity. The status of the Atlantic populations of the great and lesser frigatebirds are unknown and possibly extinct.

As frigatebirds rely on large marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they are vulnerable to local disasters that could wipe out the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.

===Hunting===
In Nauru, catching frigatebirds was an important tradition still practised to some degree. Donald W. Buden writes: &quot;Birds typically are captured by slinging the weighted end of a coil of line in front of an approaching bird attracted to previously captured birds used as decoys. In a successful toss, the line becomes entangled about the bird&#x27;s wing and bringing [sic] it to ground.&quot; Marine birds including frigatebirds were once harvested for food on Christmas Island but this practice ceased in the late 1970s. Eggs and young of magnificent frigatebirds were taken and eaten in the Caribbean. Great frigatebirds were eaten in the Hawaiian Islands and their feathers used for decoration.

==Cultural significance==

The frigate bird appears on the national Flag of Kiribati. The design is based on its former colonial Gilbert and Ellice Islands coat of arms. The bird also appears on the flag of Barbuda, and is the national bird of Antigua and Barbuda.

There are anecdotal reports of tame frigatebirds being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A bird that had come from one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home, hence would be used as a speedy way to relay a message there. There is evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu.

The great frigatebird was venerated by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island; carvings of the birdman Tangata manu depict him with the characteristic hooked beak and throat pouch. Its incorporation into local ceremonies suggests that the now-vanished species was extant there between the 1800s and 1860s.

Maritime folklore around the time of European contact with the Americas held that frigatebirds were birds of good omen as their presence meant land was near.

<text>Animal sacrifice is the ritual killing and offering of animals, usually as part of a religious ritual or to appease or maintain favour with a deity. Animal sacrifices were common throughout Europe and the Ancient Near East until the spread of Christianity in Late Antiquity, and continue in some cultures or religions today. Human sacrifice, where it existed, was always much rarer.

All or only part of a sacrificial animal may be offered; some cultures, like the ancient and modern Greeks, eat most of the edible parts of the sacrifice in a feast, and burnt the rest as an offering. Others burnt the whole animal offering, called a holocaust. Usually, the best animal or best share of the animal is the one presented for offering.

Animal sacrifice should generally be distinguished from the religiously prescribed methods of ritual slaughter of animals for normal consumption as food.
During the Neolithic Revolution, early humans began to move from hunter-gatherer cultures toward agriculture, leading to the spread of animal domestication. In a theory presented in &quot;Homo Necans&quot;, mythologist Walter Burkert suggests that the ritual sacrifice of livestock may have developed as a continuation of ancient hunting rituals, as livestock replaced wild game in the food supply.

==Prehistory==
Ancient Egypt was at the forefront of domestication, and some of the earliest archeological evidence suggesting animal sacrifice comes from Egypt. However, animal sacrifice was not a central practice of Egyptian religion, but was rather a peripherical occurrence that happened away from worshippers. The oldest Egyptian burial sites containing animal remains originate from the Badari culture of Upper Egypt, which flourished between 4400 and 4000 BCE. Sheep and goats were found buried in their own graves at one site, while at another site gazelles were found at the feet of several human burials. At a cemetery uncovered at Hierakonpolis and dated to , the remains of a much wider variety of animals were found, including non-domestic species such as baboons and hippopotami, which may have been sacrificed in honor of powerful former citizens or buried near their former owners. According to Herodotus, later Dynastic Egyptian animal sacrifice became restricted to livestock – sheep, cattle, swine and geese – with sets of rituals and rules to describe each type of sacrifice.

By the end of the Copper Age in , animal sacrifice had become a common practice across many cultures, and appeared to have become more generally restricted to domestic livestock. At Gath, archeological evidence indicates that the Canaanites imported sacrificial sheep and goats from Egypt rather than selecting from their own livestock. At the Monte d&#x27;Accoddi in Sardinia, one of the earliest known sacred centers in Europe, evidence of the sacrifice of sheep, cattle and swine has been uncovered by excavations, and it is indicated that ritual sacrifice may have been common across Italy around and afterwards. At the Minoan settlement of Phaistos in ancient Crete, excavations have revealed basins for animal sacrifice dating to the period 2000 to 1700 BCE. However, remains of a young goat were found in Cueva de la Dehesilla (es), a cave in Spain, related to a funerary ritual from the Middle Neolithic period, dated to between 4800 and 4000 BCE.

==Ancient Near East==
Animal sacrifice was general among the ancient Near Eastern civilizations of Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Persia, as well as the Hebrews (covered below). Unlike the Greeks, who had worked out a justification for keeping the best edible parts of the sacrifice for the assembled humans to eat, in these cultures the whole animal was normally placed on the fire by the altar and burned, or sometimes it was buried.

==Ancient Greece==

Worship in ancient Greek religion typically consisted of sacrificing domestic animals at the altar with hymn and prayer. The altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all. The animal, which should be perfect of its kind, is decorated with garlands and the like, and led in procession to the altar, a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife leading the way. After various rituals the animal is slaughtered over the altar, as it falls all the women present &quot;must cry out in high, shrill tones&quot;. Its blood is collected and poured over the altar. It is butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity&#x27;s portion of the offering, while the meat is removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasting it on the spot. The temple usually kept the skin, to sell to tanners. The fact that the humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity had not escaped the Greeks, and is often the subject of humour in Greek comedy.

The animals used are, in order of preference, bull or ox, cow, sheep (the most common), goat, pig (with piglet the cheapest mammal), and poultry (but rarely other birds or fish). Horses and asses are seen on some vases in the Geometric style (), but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to Greece, and it has been suggested that Greek preferences in this matter go very far back. The Greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviours as showing this. Divination by examining parts of the sacrificed animal was much less important than in Roman or Etruscan religion, or Near Eastern religions, but was practiced, especially of the liver, and as part of the cult of Apollo. Generally, the Greeks put more faith in observing the behaviour of birds. For a smaller and simpler offering, a grain of incense could be thrown on the sacred fire, and outside the cities farmers made simple sacrificial gifts of plant produce as the &quot;first fruits&quot; were harvested. Although the grand form of sacrifice called the hecatomb (meaning 100 bulls) might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands. The enormous Hellenistic structures of the Altar of Hieron and Pergamon Altar were built for such occasions.
The evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient Greek literature, especially in Homer&#x27;s epics. Throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the favor of the gods. For example, in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; Eumaeus sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master Odysseus. However, in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, which partly reflects very early Greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice.

These sacrificial practices, described in these pre-Homeric eras, share commonalities to the 8th century forms of sacrificial rituals. Furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war. Before setting out for Troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. Odysseus offers Zeus a sacrificial ram in vain. The occasions of sacrifice in Homer&#x27;s epic poems may shed some light onto the view of the gods as members of society, rather than as external entities, indicating social ties. Sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine.

It has been suggested that the Chthonic deities, distinguished from Olympic deities by typically being offered the holocaust mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native Pre-Hellenic religion and that many of the Olympian deities may come from the Proto-Greeks who overran the southern part of the Balkan Peninsula in the late third millennium BCE.

In the Hellenistic period after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, several new philosophical movements began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice.

==Scythians==
According to the unique account by the Greek author Herodotus (), the Scythians sacrificed various kinds of livestock, though the most prestigious offering was considered to be the horse. The pig, on the other hand, was never offered in sacrifice, and apparently the Scythians were loath to keep swine within their lands. Herodotus describes the Scythian manner of sacrifice as follows:

Herodotus goes on to describe the human sacrifice of prisoners, conducted in a different manner.

==Ancient Rome==

The most potent offering in Ancient Roman religion was animal sacrifice, typically of domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep and pigs. Each was the best specimen of its kind, cleansed, clad in sacrificial regalia and garlanded; the horns of oxen might be gilded. Sacrifice sought the harmonisation of the earthly and divine, so the victim must seem willing to offer its own life on behalf of the community; it must remain calm and be quickly and cleanly dispatched.
Sacrifice to deities of the heavens (&quot;di superi&quot;, &quot;gods above&quot;) was performed in daylight, and under the public gaze. Deities of the upper heavens required white, infertile victims of their own sex: Juno, a white heifer (possibly a white cow); Jupiter, a white, castrated ox (&quot;bos mas&quot;) for the annual oath-taking by the consuls. &quot;Di superi&quot; with strong connections to the earth, such as Mars, Janus, Neptune and various &quot;genii&quot; – including the Emperor&#x27;s – were offered fertile victims. After the sacrifice, a banquet was held; in state cults, the images of honoured deities took pride of place on banqueting couches and by means of the sacrificial fire consumed their proper portion (&quot;exta&quot;, the innards). Rome&#x27;s officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.

Chthonic gods such as Dis pater, the &quot;di inferi&quot; (&quot;gods below&quot;), and the collective shades of the departed &quot;(di Manes)&quot; were given dark, fertile victims in nighttime rituals. Animal sacrifice usually took the form of a holocaust or burnt offering, and there was no shared banquet, as &quot;the living cannot share a meal with the dead&quot;. Ceres and other underworld goddesses of fruitfulness were sometimes offered pregnant female animals; Tellus was given a pregnant cow at the Fordicidia festival. Color had a general symbolic value for sacrifices. Demigods and heroes, who belonged to the heavens and the underworld, were sometimes given black-and-white victims. Robigo (or Robigus) was given red dogs and libations of red wine at the Robigalia for the protection of crops from blight and red mildew.

A sacrifice might be made in thanksgiving or as an expiation of a sacrilege or potential sacrilege (&quot;piaculum&quot;);
a &quot;piaculum&quot; might also be offered as a sort of advance payment; the Arval Brethren, for instance, offered a &quot;piaculum&quot; before entering their sacred grove with an iron implement, which was forbidden, as well as after.
The pig was a common victim for a &quot;piaculum&quot;.
The same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it, and so might be placated in advance. Divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey, or encounters with banditry, piracy and shipwreck, with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return. In times of great crisis, the Senate could decree collective public rites, in which Rome&#x27;s citizens, including women and children, moved in procession from one temple to the next, supplicating the gods.

Extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice: in one of the many crises of the Second Punic War, Jupiter Capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring (see &quot;ver sacrum&quot;), to be rendered after five more years of protection from Hannibal and his allies. The &quot;contract&quot; with Jupiter is exceptionally detailed. All due care would be taken of the animals. If any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice, they would count as already sacrificed, since they had already been consecrated. Normally, if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain, the offered sacrifice would be withheld. In the imperial period, sacrifice was withheld following Trajan&#x27;s death because the gods had not kept the Emperor safe for the stipulated period. In Pompeii, the Genius of the living emperor was offered a bull: presumably a standard practise in Imperial cult, though minor offerings (incense and wine) were also made.

The &quot;exta&quot; were the entrails of a sacrificed animal, comprising in Cicero&#x27;s enumeration the gall bladder (&quot;fel&quot;), liver (&quot;iecur&quot;), heart (&quot;cor&quot;), and lungs (&quot;pulmones&quot;). The &quot;exta&quot; were exposed for litatio (divine approval) as part of Roman liturgy, but were &quot;read&quot; in the context of the &quot;disciplina Etrusca&quot;. As a product of Roman sacrifice, the &quot;exta&quot; and blood are reserved for the gods, while the meat &quot;(viscera)&quot; is shared among human beings in a communal meal. The &quot;exta&quot; of bovine victims were usually stewed in a pot (&quot;olla&quot; or &quot;aula&quot;), while those of sheep or pigs were grilled on skewers. When the deity&#x27;s portion was cooked, it was sprinkled with &quot;mola salsa&quot; (ritually prepared salted flour) and wine, then placed in the fire on the altar for the offering; the technical verb for this action was &quot;porricere&quot;.

==Albanians==

Animal sacrifices (Albanian: &quot;ritual slaughering&quot; and &quot;sacrifice&quot;) have been common practices performed by Albanians during their feasts and ritual pilgrimages on mountain tops.

Animal sacrifices for new buildings is a pagan practice widespread among Albanians. At the beginning of the construction of the new house, the foundation traditionally starts with prayers, in a &#x27;lucky day&#x27;, facing the Sun (Dielli), starting after sunrise, during the growing Moon (Hëna), and an animal is slaughered as a sacrifice. The practice continues with variations depending on the Albanian ethnographic area. For instance in Opojë the sacrificed animal is placed on the foundation, with its head placed towards the east, where the Sun rises. In Brataj the blood of the sacrificed animal is poured during the slaughter in the corner that was on the east side, where the Sun rises; in order for the house to stand and for good luck, the owner of the house throws silver or golden coins in the same corner of the house; the lady of the house throws there unwashed wool. These things are to remain buried in the foundation of the house that is being built. The relatives of the house owner throw money on the foundation of the house as well, but that money is taken by the craftsman who builds the house. In Dibra a ram is slaughered at the foundation, and the head of the ram is placed on the foundation. In the Lezha highlands a ram or a rooster is slaughered on the foundation and then their heads are buried there; the owners of the house throw coins as well as seeds of different plants on the foundation.

On the occasion of the beginning of plowghing the wheat field, a chicken is slaughtered on the tail of the plough. The head of the chicken is mixed with the seed and the earth obtained from the first pass of the ploughing. Those animal sacrifices are made for soil fertility and production, prosperity, health of the animals, etc.

According to an old Albanian custom practiced until recently in various villages in Tomorr, Mirdita, and perhaps also in other areas, from the middle of May families with a lot of cattle slaughtered young cattle as sacrifices in order to make the earth fertile, so that the cattle would not be harmed during the summer and would have abundant milk during the harvest time in the mountains. Such a ritual burial ceremony was also found among other Balkan peoples, and it has been interpreted as a trace of the cult of an agricultural deity, for it was a sacrifice that allowed the renewal of the products of the soil, giving force to the vegetation of the fields, trees and vines.

==Celtic peoples==
There is evidence that ancient Celtic people sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals, as part of ancient Celtic religion. The idea seems to have been that ritually transferring a life-force to the Otherworld pleased the gods and established a channel of communication between the worlds. Animal sacrifices could be acts of thanksgiving, appeasement, to ensure good health and fertility, or as a means of divination. It seems that some animals were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part set aside).

Archaeologists have found evidence of animal sacrifice at some Gaulish and British sanctuaries, and at the Irish site Uisneach. Accounts of Celtic animal sacrifice come from Roman and Greek writers. Julius Caesar and Strabo wrote of the Gauls burning animal sacrifices in a large wickerwork figure, known as a wicker man, while Pliny the Elder wrote of druids performing a &#x27;ritual of oak and mistletoe&#x27; which involved sacrificing two white bulls.

Some animal sacrifice or ritual slaughter continued among Celtic peoples long after they converted to Christianity. Until the 19th century, on St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November) in rural Ireland a rooster, goose or sheep would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, and was eaten as part of a feast. Bull sacrifices at the time of the Lughnasa festival were recorded as late as the 18th century at Cois Fharraige in Ireland (where they were offered to Crom Dubh) and at Loch Maree in Scotland (where they were offered to Saint Máel Ruba).

Many scholars believe that the Irish and Manx tradition of killing, elaborately displaying and burying a wren on St. Stephen&#x27;s Day is a survival of animal sacrifice (see Wren Day).

==Germanic peoples==

Animal sacrifice, or &quot;blót&quot;, was an important ritual in Old Norse religion. The blood was sprinkled on altars, idols and the walls of temples. A &quot;blót&quot; was made at seasonal festivals as well as at funerals, before battles and perilous journeys, or after the conclusion of business between traders.

In the 11th century, Adam of Bremen wrote that human and animal sacrifices were made at the Temple at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden. He wrote that every ninth year, nine men and nine of every animal were sacrificed and their bodies hung in a sacred grove.

==Abrahamic traditions==
===Judaism===

In Judaism, the is any of a variety of sacrificial offerings described and commanded in the Torah. The most common usages are animal sacrifice ( זֶבַח), (the peace offering) and (the &quot;holocaust&quot; or burnt offering). A was an animal sacrifice, such as a bull, sheep, goat, or a dove that underwent &quot;shechita&quot; (Jewish ritual slaughter). Sacrifices could also consist of grain, meal, wine, or incense.

The Hebrew Bible says that Yahweh commanded the Israelites to offer offerings and sacrifices on various altars. The sacrifices were only to be offered by the hands of the Kohanim. Before building the Temple in Jerusalem, when the Israelites were in the desert, sacrifices were offered only in the Tabernacle. After building Solomon&#x27;s Temple, sacrifices were allowed only there. After the Temple was destroyed, sacrifices was resumed when the Second Temple was built until it was also destroyed in 70 CE. After the destruction of the Second Temple sacrifices were prohibited because there was no longer a Temple, the only place allowed by &quot;halakha&quot; for sacrifices. Offering of sacrifices was briefly reinstated during the Jewish–Roman wars of the second century CE and was continued in certain communities thereafter.

The Samaritans, a group historically related to the Jews, practice animal sacrifice in accordance with the Law of Moses.

===Christianity===

Christianity has long opposed all forms of animal sacrifice, and the practice&#x27;s &quot;very possibility ... has been generally rejected as unreasonable and hostile to Christian theology&quot;. Most Christian denominations believe that the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ permanently abolished animal sacrifice, primarily based on the teaching in the Epistle to the Hebrews that Jesus was the &quot;Lamb of God&quot; to whom all ancient sacrifices pointed. Most Christians believe that the &quot;bloodless&quot; sacrifice of the Eucharist, or Lord&#x27;s Supper, entirely replaces the Old Testament system of sacrifices. Consequently, animal sacrifice is rarely practiced in Christianity.

Some villages in Greece sacrifice animals to Orthodox saints in a practice known as &quot;kourbania&quot;. Sacrifice of a lamb, or less commonly a rooster, is a common practice in Armenian Church, and the Tewahedo Church of Ethiopia and Eritrea. This tradition, called &quot;matagh&quot;, is believed to stem from pre-Christian pagan rituals. Additionally, some Mayans following a form of Folk Catholicism in Mexico today still sacrifice animals in conjunction with church practices, a ritual practiced in past religions before the arrival of the Spaniards.

===Islam===

Muslims engaged in the Hajj (pilgrimage) are obliged to sacrifice a lamb or a goat or join others in sacrificing a cow or a camel during the celebration of the Eid al-Adha, an Arabic term that means &quot;Feast of Sacrifice&quot;, also known as &quot;al-Id al-Kabir&quot; (Great Feast), or &quot;Qurban Bayrami&quot; (Sacrifice Feast) in Turkic influenced cultures, &quot;Bakar Id&quot; (Goat Feast) in Indian subcontinent and &quot;Reraya Qurben&quot; in Indonesia. Other Muslims not on the Hajj to Mecca also participate in this sacrifice wherever they are, on the 10th day of the 12th lunar month in the Islamic calendar. It is understood as a symbolic re-enactment of Abraham&#x27;s sacrifice of a ram in place of his son. Meat from this occasion is divided into three parts, one part is kept by the sacrificing family for food, the other gifted to friends and family, and the third given to the poor Muslims. The sacrificed animal is a sheep, goat, cow or camel. The feast follows a communal prayer at a mosque or open air.
The animal sacrifice during the Hajj is a part of nine step pilgrimage ritual. It is, states Campo, preceded by a statement to intention and body purification, inaugural circumambulation of the Kaaba seven times, running between Marwa and Safa hills, encampment at Mina, standing in Arafat, stoning the three Mina satanic pillars with at least forty nine pebbles. Thereafter, animal sacrifice, and this is followed by farewell circumambulation of the Kaaba. The Muslims who are not on Hajj also perform a simplified ritual animal sacrifice. According to Campo, the animal sacrifice at the annual Islamic festival has origins in western Arabia in vogue before Islam. The animal sacrifice, states Philip Stewart, is not required by the Quran, but is based on interpretations of other Islamic texts.
The Eid al-Adha is major annual festival of animal sacrifice in Islam. In Indonesia alone, for example, some 800,000 animals were sacrificed in 2014 by its Muslims on the festival, but the number can be a bit lower or higher depending on the economic conditions. According to Lesley Hazleton, in Turkey about 2,500,000 sheep, cows and goats are sacrificed each year to observe the Islamic festival of animal sacrifice, with a part of the sacrificed animal given to the needy who did not sacrifice an animal. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, nearly 10,000,000 animals are sacrificed in Pakistan every year on Eid. Countries such as Saudi Arabia transport nearly a million animals every year for sacrifice to Mina (near Mecca). The sacrificed animals at Id al-Adha, states Clarke Brooke, include the four species considered lawful for the Hajj sacrifice: sheep, goats, camels and cattle, and additionally, cow-like animals initialing the water buffalo, domesticated banteng and yaks. Many are brought in from north Africa and parts of Asia.

Other occasions when Muslims perform animal sacrifice include the &quot;&#x27;aqiqa&quot;, when a child is seven days old, is shaved and given a name. It is believed that the animal sacrifice binds the child to Islam and offers protection to the child from evil.

Killing of animals by dhabihah is ritual slaughter rather than sacrifice.

==Hinduism==
Practices of Hindu animal sacrifice are mostly associated with Shaktism, Shaiva Agamas and in currents of folk Hinduism called Kulamarga strongly rooted in local tribal traditions. Animal sacrifices were carried out in ancient times in India. Most Puranas and other scriptures forbid animal sacrifice though the upapurana, Kalika Purana, describes it in detail.

=== Shaktism traditions ===

Animal sacrifices are performed mainly at temples following the Shakti school of Hinduism where the female nature of Brahman is worshipped in the form of Kali and Durga. These traditions are followed in parts of eastern states of India at Hindu temples in Assam and West Bengal India and Nepal where goats, chickens and sometimes water buffalos are sacrificed. 

Animal sacrifice is a part of Durga puja celebrations during the Navratri in eastern states of India. The goddess is offered sacrificial animal in this ritual in the belief that it stimulates her violent vengeance against the buffalo demon. According to Christopher Fuller, the animal sacrifice practice is rare among Hindus during Navratri, or at other times, outside the Shaktism tradition found in the eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. Further, even in these states, the festival season is one where significant animal sacrifices are observed. In some Shakta Hindu communities, the slaying of buffalo demon and victory of Durga is observed with a symbolic sacrifice instead of animal sacrifice.

Animal sacrifice &quot;en masse&quot; occurs during the three-day-long Gadhimai festival in Nepal. In 2009 it was speculated that more than 250,000 animals were killed while 5 million devotees attended the festival. However, this practise was later banned in 2015.

=== Rajput traditions ===
The Rajput of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses on Navratri, and formerly offered a sacrifice of a goat to a goddess revered as Kuldevi – a practice that continues in some places. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The &quot;Kuldevi&quot; among these Rajput communities is a warrior-pativrata guardian goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

The tradition of animal sacrifice is being substituted with vegetarian offerings to the Goddess in temples and households around Banaras in Northern India.

=== Folk traditions ===
In some sacred groves of India, particularly in western Maharashtra, animal sacrifice is practiced to pacify female deities that are supposed to rule the groves.

In India, ritual of animal sacrifice is practised in many villages before local deities or certain powerful and terrifying forms of the Devi. In this form of worship, animals, usually goats, are decapitated and the blood is offered to deity often by smearing some of it on a post outside the temple. For instance, &quot;Kandhen Budhi&quot; is the reigning deity of Kantamal in Boudh district of Orissa, India. Every year, animals like goat and fowl are sacrificed before the deity on the occasion of her annual &quot;Yatra&quot;/&quot;Jatra&quot; (festival) held in the month of &quot;Aswina&quot; (September–October). The main attraction of &quot;Kandhen Budhi Yatra&quot; is &quot;Ghusuri Puja&quot;. &quot;Ghusuri&quot; means a child pig, which is sacrificed to the goddess every three years. Kandhen Budhi is also worshipped at Lather village under Mohangiri GP in Kalahandi district of Orissa, India. (Pasayat, 2009:20–24).

The religious belief of &quot;Tabuh Rah&quot;, a form of animal sacrifice of Balinese Hinduism includes a religious cockfight where a rooster is used in religious custom by allowing him to fight against another rooster in a religious and spiritual cockfight, a spiritual appeasement exercise of &quot;Tabuh Rah&quot;. The spilling of blood is necessary as purification to appease the evil spirits, and ritual fights follow an ancient and complex ritual as set out in the sacred &quot;lontar&quot; manuscripts.

=== Tantrik traditions ===
Human sacrifice is also mentioned in Hinduism in the Kalika Purana. Chapters 67 through 78 of the text constitute the Rudhiradhyaya, which discusses bali (animal sacrifice) and of Vamacara Tantrism. The Rudhiradhyaya section is notable for its uncommon discussion of human sacrifice. The text states that a human sacrifice may be performed to please the goddess, but only with the consent of prince before a war or cases of imminent danger. However, it was not until 2014 that the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) started collecting data on human sacrifice. According to the bureau, there were 51 cases of human sacrifice spread across 14 states between 2014 and 2016. An alleged case of human sacrifice was recorded as late as 2020.

==East Asian traditions==
=== Han Chinese ===
==== Ancient China ====
During Shang and Zhou dynasties, the nobles used to practice a complicated and hierarchical sacrificial system and only the king could sacrifice to heaven and earth and the four sacred mountains including Mount Tai including his nine temples for his family. The Dukes sacrificed to the altar of land and grain and to the various rivers and streams and mountains in their territory and their family temples. The common person didn&#x27;t have a temple but sacrificed to their father or grandfather or relevant family in their apartment or house and could only sacrifice to family because of the burden of the luxurious animals. The noble would sacrifice pigs, goats or sheep, cows, mainly oxen, dogs or wild dogs, and other livestock at different times of the year; in bad years the sacrifices were less.

The ancient kings, Confucius and Confucian scholars framed the sacrificing scale of every strata from the Zhou system, not including human sacrifice, in &quot;The Book of Rites&quot;. The names of the offering scales from honorable to low are &#x27;Tai-lao&#x27;(太牢), &#x27;Shao-lao&#x27;(少牢), &#x27;Te-sheng&#x27;(特牲), &#x27;Te-shi&#x27;(特豕), &#x27;Te-tun&#x27;(特豚), &#x27;Yu&#x27;(魚), &#x27;La&#x27;(臘), &#x27;Dou&#x27;(豆) and else. The Tai-lao class, now only practiced in the ceremony of worshipping Huang Di or Confucius, use whole cows, whole goats and whole pigs in Taiwan

It is said Hou ji offered a sacrifice with lamb millet and southern wood and black millet wine with fragrant herbs mainly southern wood.

==== Modern-day China ====
Buddhism prohibits all forms of killing, rituals, sacrifices and worship and Taoism generally prohibit killing of animals. In Kaohsiung, Taiwan, animal sacrifices are banned in Taoist temples.
Some animal offerings, such as fowl, pigs, goats, fish, or other livestock, are accepted in some Taoism sects and beliefs in Chinese folk religion. The offerings would be placed at the altar or the temple after being slaughtered. The amount sacrificed is up to the worshippers, who can eat all of the offerings after the rite. In folk religion some regions believe that high-status deities prefer vegetarian food more, while ghosts, low-status gods, and other unknown supernatural spirits like meat. Therefore, whole pigs, whole goats, whole chickens, and whole ducks will be sacrificed in the ghost festival. Some vegetarian believers make dummy pigs or dummy goats from vegetarian food like bread or rice for sacrifice.
=== Japan ===
Before Buddhism came to Japan, some Shinto festivals included bear, deer, horse, and green pheasant sacrifice. 
Iomante (イオマンテ), sometimes written as Iyomante (イヨマンテ), is an Ainu ceremony in which a brown bear is sacrificed.

==Traditional Sub-Saharan and Afro-American religions==
Animal sacrifice is regularly practiced in traditional African and Afro-American religions.

The U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1993 decision &quot;Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah&quot; upheld the right of Santería adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice in the United States of America.
Likewise in Texas in 2009, legal and religious issues that related to animal sacrifice, animal rights and freedom of religion were taken to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of &quot;Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless.&quot; The court ruling that the Merced case of the freedom of exercise of religion was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of Euless, Texas from enforcing its ordinances that burdened his religious practices relating to the use of animals (see Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 110.005(a)(2)).

== Austronesian ==
=== Utux ===
Atayal, Seediq and Taroko people believe that bad-luck or punishments of &#x27;Utux&#x27;, which refers to any kind of supernatural spirits or ancestors, would infect the relatives. When a member in relatives has violated a taboo or met with misfortune, a ritual will be held. It must be done in the ritual to sacrifice a pig, which means the misfortune and sin would be washed away by the blood, and apologize to the Utux with gift.

<text>Mikhail Tal (9 November 1936 – 28 June 1992) was a Soviet and Latvian chess player and the eighth World Chess Champion. He is considered a creative genius and is widely regarded as one of the most influential players in chess history. Tal played in an attacking and daring combinatorial style. His play was known above all for improvisation and unpredictability. Vladislav Zubok said of him, &quot;Every game for him was as inimitable and invaluable as a poem&quot;.

His nickname was &quot;Misha&quot;, a diminutive for Mikhail, and he earned the nickname &quot;The Magician from Riga&quot;. Both &quot;The Mammoth Book of the World&#x27;s Greatest Chess Games&quot; and &quot;Modern Chess Brilliancies&quot; include more games by Tal than any other player. He also held the record for the longest unbeaten streak in competitive chess history with 95 games (46 wins, 49 draws) between 23 October 1973 and 16 October 1974, until Ding Liren&#x27;s streak of 100 games (29 wins, 71 draws) between 9 August 2017 and 11 November 2018. In addition, Tal was a highly regarded chess writer.

Tal died on 28 June 1992 in Moscow, Russia. The Mikhail Tal Memorial chess tournament has been held in Moscow annually since 2006.

==Early years==

Tal was born in Riga, Latvia, into a Jewish family. According to his friend Gennadi Sosonko, his true father was a family friend identified only as &quot;Uncle Robert&quot;; however, this was vehemently denied by Tal&#x27;s third wife Angelina. Uncle Robert had been a taxi driver in Paris in the 1920s and had lost all his family in World War II. His mother, Ida Grigoryevna, was the eldest of four sisters; Tal frequently visited the Netherlands to see his aunt, Riva, and another of his aunts settled in the United States but visited Riga.
As a child, Tal joined the Riga Palace of Young Pioneers chess club. In 1949, he played Ratmir Kholmov, a young master who had recently competed in the prestigious Chigorin Memorial in 1947, in a simultaneous exhibition. Tal used an imaginative combination to win his game at the age of 13.

Alexander Koblents began tutoring him in 1949, after which Tal&#x27;s game rapidly improved, and by 1951 he had qualified for the Latvian Championship. In the 1952 Latvian Championship, Tal finished ahead of his trainer. Tal won his first Latvian title in 1953, and was awarded the title of Candidate Master. He became a Soviet Master in 1954 by defeating Vladimir Saigin in a qualifying match. That same year he also scored his first win over a grandmaster when Yuri Averbakh lost on time in a drawn position. Tal graduated in Literature from the University of Latvia, writing a thesis on the satirical works of Ilf and Petrov, and taught school in Riga for a time in his early twenties. He was a member of the Daugava Sports Society, and represented Latvia in internal Soviet team competitions.

In 1959, he married 19-year-old Salli Landau, an actress with the Riga Youth Theatre; they divorced in 1970. In 2003, Landau published a biography in Russian of her late ex-husband.

==Soviet champion==
Tal made his first significant appearance at the 1956 USSR Chess Championship, sharing 5th–7th place with Lev Polugaevsky and Ratmir Kholmov. Grigory Levenfish called him &quot;the most colourful figure of the championship&quot; and a &quot;great talent&quot; who strove for &quot;sharp and complicated play&quot;. However, he was criticised by the media for taking unnecessary risks and having restricted creative views. Tal then went to play on board three at the students&#x27; championship in Sweden, scoring 6 out of 7.

He became the youngest player to win the 1957 USSR Chess Championship, at the age of 20. He had not played in enough international tournaments to qualify for the title of Grandmaster, but FIDE decided at its 1957 Congress to waive the normal restrictions and award him the title because of his achievement in winning the Soviet Championship. At that time the Soviet Union was dominant in world chess, and Tal had beaten several of the world&#x27;s top players to win the tournament.

Tal made three appearances for the USSR at Student Olympiads in 1956–1958, winning three team gold medals and three board gold medals. He won nineteen games, drew eight, and lost none, for 85.2 percent.

He retained the title of champion at the 1958 USSR Chess Championship, and competed in the World Chess Championship 1960 for the first time. He won the 1958 Interzonal tournament at Portorož, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, then helped the Soviet Union to win the 13th Chess Olympiad, being its fourth consecutive victory in Munich, West Germany.

==World Champion==

In 1959, Tal won a very strong tournament in Zurich, Switzerland. Following the Interzonal, the top players carried on to the Candidates&#x27; Tournament, Yugoslavia, 1959. Tal won with 20/28 points, ahead of Paul Keres with 18½, followed by Tigran Petrosian, Vasily Smyslov, Bobby Fischer, Svetozar Gligorić, Friðrik Ólafsson, and Pal Benko. Tal&#x27;s victory was attributed to his dominance over the lower half of the field; whilst scoring only one win and three losses versus Keres, he won all four individual games against Fischer, and took 3½ points out of 4 from each of Gligorić, Olafsson, and Benko. When Benko arrived for his match with Tal, he wore dark glasses in order to avert the gaze of Tal, which could be intimidating. In response and as a joke, Tal wore large sunglasses which he borrowed from a member of the crowd.

In 1960, at the age of 23, Tal defeated the strategically-minded Mikhail Botvinnik in a World Championship match, held in Moscow, by 12½–8½ (six wins, two losses, and thirteen draws), making him the youngest-ever World Champion (a record later broken by Garry Kasparov, who earned the title at 22, and broken again by Gukesh Dommaraju who earned the title at age 18). Botvinnik, who had never faced Tal before the title match began, won the return match against Tal in 1961, also held in Moscow, by 13–8 (ten wins to five, with six draws). In the period between the matches Botvinnik had thoroughly analysed Tal&#x27;s style, and turned most of the return match&#x27;s games into slow wars of maneuver or endgames, rather than the complicated tactical melees which were Tal&#x27;s happy hunting ground. Tal&#x27;s chronic kidney problems contributed to his defeat, and his doctors in Riga advised that he should postpone the match for health reasons. Yuri Averbakh claimed that Botvinnik would agree to a postponement only if Tal was certified unfit by Moscow doctors, and that Tal then decided to play. His short reign atop the chess world made him one of the two so-called &quot;winter kings&quot; who interrupted Botvinnik&#x27;s long reign from 1948 to 1963 (the other was Smyslov, world champion 1957–58).

His highest Elo rating was 2705, achieved in 1980. His highest Historical Chessmetrics Rating was 2799, in September 1960.

==Later achievements==

Soon after losing the rematch with Botvinnik, Tal won the 1961 Bled supertournament in SFR Yugoslavia, by one point over Fischer, despite losing their individual game, scoring 14½ from nineteen games (+11−1=7) with the world-class players Petrosian, Keres, Gligorić, Efim Geller, and Miguel Najdorf among the other participants.

Tal played in a total of six Candidates&#x27; Tournaments and match cycles, though he never again earned the right to play for the world title. In 1962 at Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, he had serious health problems, having undergone a major operation shortly before the tournament, and had to withdraw three-quarters of the way through, scoring just seven points (+3−10=8) from 21 games. He tied for first place at the 1964 Amsterdam Interzonal to advance to matches. Then in 1965, he lost the final match against Boris Spassky, after defeating Lajos Portisch and Bent Larsen in matches. Exempt from the 1967 Interzonal in Sousse, Tunisia, he defeated Gligorić 5½-3½ in Belgrade in 1968, but then lost the semi-final match against Viktor Korchnoi in Moscow.

Poor health caused a slump in his play from late 1968 to late 1969, but he recovered his form after having a kidney removed. He won the 1979 Riga Interzonal with an undefeated score of 14/17, but the next year lost a quarter-final match to Lev Polugaevsky, one of the players to hold a positive score against him. He also played in the 1985 Montpellier (France) Candidates&#x27; Tournament, a round-robin of 16 qualifiers, finishing in a tie for fourth and fifth places, and narrowly missing further advancement after drawing a playoff match with Jan Timman, who held the tiebreak advantage from the tournament proper.

From July 1972 to April 1973, Tal played a record 86 consecutive games without a loss (47 wins and 39 draws). Between 23 October 1973 and 16 October 1974, he played 95 consecutive games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws), shattering his previous record. These were the two longest unbeaten streaks in competitive chess for more than four decades, until Ding Liren broke the record in 2018 with 100 games, although with far fewer wins than either of Tal&#x27;s streaks (29 wins, 71 draws).

Tal remained a formidable opponent as he got older. He played Anatoly Karpov 22 times, 12 of them during the latter&#x27;s reign as World Champion, with a record of +0−1=19 in classical games and +1−2=19 overall.

One of Tal&#x27;s greatest achievements during his later career was an equal first place with Karpov (whom he seconded in a number of tournaments and world championships) in the 1979 Montreal (Canada) &quot;Tournament of Stars&quot;, with an unbeaten score of (+6−0=12), the only undefeated player in the field, which also included Spassky, Portisch, Vlastimil Hort, Robert Hübner, Ljubomir Ljubojević, Lubomir Kavalek, Jan Timman and Larsen.

Tal played in 21 Soviet Championships, winning it six times (1957, 1958, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978). He was also a five-time winner of the International Chess Tournament in Tallinn, Estonian SSR, with victories in 1971, 1973, 1977, 1981, and 1983.

Tal also had successes in blitz chess; in 1970, he took second place to Fischer, who scored 19/22, in a blitz tournament at Herceg Novi, SFR Yugoslavia, ahead of Korchnoi, Petrosian and Smyslov. In 1988, at the age of 51, he won the second official World Blitz Championship (the first was won by Kasparov the previous year in Brussels, Belgium) at Saint John, Canada, ahead of such players as Kasparov, the reigning world champion, and ex-champion Anatoly Karpov. In the final, he defeated Rafael Vaganian by 3½–½.

On 28 May 1992, at the Moscow blitz tournament (which he left the hospital to play), he defeated Kasparov. He died one month later.

==Team competitions==
In Chess Olympiad play, Mikhail Tal was a member of eight Soviet teams, each of which won team gold medals (1958, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1972, 1974, 1980, and 1982), won 65 games, drew 34, and lost only two games (81.2%). This percentage makes him the player with the best score among those participating in at least four Olympiads. Individually, Tal won seven Olympiad board medals, including five gold (1958, 1962, 1966, 1972, 1974), and two silver (1960, 1982).

Tal also represented the Soviet Union at six European Team Chess Championships (1957, 1961, 1970, 1973, 1977, 1980), winning team gold medals each time, and three board gold medals (1957, 1970, and 1977). He scored 14 wins, 20 draws, and three losses, for 64.9%.
Tal played board nine for the USSR in the first match against the Rest of the World team at Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia in 1970, scoring 2 out of 4. He was on board seven for the USSR in the second match against the Rest of the World team at London, United Kingdom in 1984, scoring 2 out of 3. The USSR won both team matches. He was an Honoured Master of Sport.

From 1950 (when he won the Latvian junior championship) to 1991, Tal won or tied for first in 68 tournaments (see table below). During his 41-year career he played about 2,700 tournament or match games, winning over 65% of them.

==Health problems and death==
Tal was a heavy drinker and chain smoked. His already fragile health suffered as a result, and he spent a great deal of time in the hospital, including an operation to remove a kidney in 1969. He was also briefly addicted to morphine, prescribed due to intense pain.

On 28 June 1992, Tal died in a Moscow hospital, officially of a hemorrhage in the esophagus. His friend and fellow Soviet grandmaster Gennadi Sosonko reported that &quot;effectively his entire organism had ceased to function.&quot;

Tal had the congenital deformity of ectrodactyly in his right hand (visible in some photographs). Despite this, he was a skilled piano player.

==Playing style==
Tal was known as &quot;The Magician from Riga&quot;, and his style of play was very aggressive and involved heavy calculation. His approach over the board was very pragmatic—in that respect, he is one of the heirs of ex-world champion Alexander Alekhine. He often sacrificed in search of activity and initiative which is defined as the ability to make threats to which the opponent must respond. Many masters found it difficult to refute Tal&#x27;s ideas, looking at how many problems he created, though deeper post-game analysis found flaws in some of his calculations. The famous sixth game of his first world championship match with Botvinnik is typical in that regard: Tal sacrificed a knight with little compensation but prevailed when the unsettled Botvinnik failed to find the correct response. Tal&#x27;s style of play was so intimidating that James Eade listed Tal as one of the three players whom contemporaries were most afraid of playing against (the others being Capablanca and Fischer). However, while Capablanca and Fischer were feared because of their extreme technical skill, Tal was feared because of the possibility of being on the wrong side of a soon-to-be-famous brilliancy. Although Tal&#x27;s sacrifices were formidable, his style of play was very risky, contributing to his negative record against world-class defensive players. These included Spassky, Petrosian, Polugaevsky, Korchnoi, Keres, Smyslov, and Stein. (Tal has a positive record against Fischer with his four wins from the 1959 candidates tournament, when Fischer was only 16 years old, but never beat Fischer again.)

Although his playing style at first was scorned by ex-world champion Vasily Smyslov as nothing more than &quot;tricks&quot;, Tal convincingly beat many notable grandmasters with his trademark aggression. Prevailing against Tal&#x27;s aggression required extraordinary ability. It is also notable that he adopted a more sedate and positional style in his later years; for many chess lovers, the apex of Tal&#x27;s style corresponds with the period (approximately from 1971 to 1979) when he was able to integrate the solidity of classical chess with the imagination of his youth.

Of the current top-level players, the Latvian Alexei Shirov has been most often compared to Tal. In fact, he studied with Tal as a youth. Many other Latvian grandmasters and masters, for instance Alexander Shabalov and Alvis Vītoliņš, have played in a similar vein, causing some to speak of a &quot;Latvian School of Chess&quot;.

Tal contributed little to opening theory, despite having a deep knowledge of most systems, the Sicilian and the Ruy Lopez in particular. There are a few openings named after him, however, such as the Tal Variation in the Caro-Kann and in the Sicilian Scheveningen. But his aggressive use of the Modern Benoni, particularly in his early years, led to a complete re-evaluation of this variation. A variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defence also bears his name.

==Notable games==
*Tal vs. Alexander Tolush, USSR Championship, Moscow 1957, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Sämisch Variation (E81), . In a critical last-round game, Tal spares no fireworks as he scores the win that clinches his first Soviet title.
*Boris Spassky vs. Tal, USSR Championship, Riga 1958, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Sämisch Variation (E26), . Spassky plays for a win to avoid a playoff for an Interzonal berth, but Tal hangs on by his fingernails before turning the tables in a complex ; with the win, he captures his second straight Soviet title.
*Tal vs. Vasily Smyslov, Yugoslavia Candidates&#x27; Tournament 1959, Caro–Kann Defence (B10), 1–0. A daring piece sacrifice to win a .
*Robert James Fischer vs. Tal, Belgrade, Candidates&#x27; Tournament 1959, Sicilian Defence, Fischer–Sozin Attack (B87), 0–1. Their games from this period are full of interesting tactics.
*Mikhail Botvinnik vs. Tal, World Championship Match, Moscow 1960, 6th game, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, Fianchetto Variation, Classical Main line (E69), 0–1. An excellent sample of Tal&#x27;s style from the first Botvinnik–Tal match. Tal sacrifices a knight for the attack and Botvinnik is unable to find a good defence in the given time; his 25th move is a mistake that spoils his game.
*István Bilek vs. Tal, Moscow 1967, King&#x27;s Indian Attack, Spassky Variation (A05), 0–1. A risky is crowned with success, winning a brilliancy prize.
*Boris Spassky vs. Tal, Tallinn tt 1973, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Leningrad Variation (E30), 0–1. A game fuelled with tactics from its first moves. Black attacks in the and then starts a .
*Tal vs. Tigran Petrosian, 8th Soviet Team Cup, Moscow 1974, rd 5, Pirc Defence, Classical System, (B08), 1–0. Tal destroys perhaps the greatest defensive player of all time in a .
*Tal vs. Joel Lautier, Barcelona 1992. In his final tournament before his death at age 55, the Magician from Riga produces one last masterpiece against a Grandmaster from the next generation.

==Writings==

Tal was a prolific and highly respected chess writer, penning a number of books and serving as editor of the Latvian chess magazine &quot;Šahs&quot; (&quot;Chess&quot;) from 1960 to 1970. His books are renowned for the detailed narrative of his thinking during the games. American Grandmaster Andrew Soltis reviewed his book on the world championship match as &quot;simply the best book written about a world championship match by a contestant. That shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise because Tal was the finest writer to become world champion.&quot; New Zealand Grandmaster Murray Chandler wrote in the introduction to the 1997 reissued algebraic edition of &quot;The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal&quot; that the book was possibly the best chess book ever written.

<text>The River Liffey (Irish: &quot;An Life&quot;, historically &quot;An Ruirthe(a)ch&quot;) is a river in eastern Ireland that ultimately flows through the centre of Dublin to its mouth within Dublin Bay. Its major tributaries include the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac. The river supplies much of Dublin&#x27;s water and supports a range of recreational activities.

==Name==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river, perhaps the Liffey, which he labelled Οβοκα (&quot;Oboka&quot;). Ultimately this led to the name of the River Avoca in County Wicklow.

According to &quot;Place Names from our Older Literature - IV.&quot; by Boswell, C. S. (1904 Connradh na Gaedhilge) the river takes its name from Magh Life, i.e. the plain of Kildare through which the Life flows. This in turn takes its name from Life, daughter of Canann Curthach, who eloped with and married Deltbanna mac Druchta, cup-bearer to Conaire Mór High King of Ireland. Life took a liking to this plain, and demanded that it should bear her name, and Deltbanna refused to serve any more drink to the men of Éire till the request was granted.

The Liffey was previously named &quot;An Ruirthech&quot;, meaning &quot;fast (or strong) runner&quot;. The word &quot;Liphe&quot; (or &quot;Life&quot;) referred originally to the name of the plain through which the river ran, but eventually came to refer to the river itself. The word may derive from the same root as Welsh &quot;llif&quot; (flood, flow, stream), namely Proto-Indo-European &quot;lē̆i-4&quot;, referring to the historic propensity of areas such as Phoenix Park and Waterstown Park to be inundated, but Gearóid Mac Eoin has more recently proposed that it may derive from a non-Indo-European word borrowed from the original language spoken in Ireland before the arrival of the Celts. It was also known as the &quot;Anna Liffey&quot;, possibly from an anglicisation of &quot;Abhainn na Life,&quot; the Irish phrase that translates into English as &quot;River Liffey&quot;. James Joyce embodies the river in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; as &quot;Anna Livia Plurabelle&quot;.

== Course and system ==

The Liffey rises in the Liffey Head Bog between the mountains of Kippure and Tonduff in the northern section of the Wicklow Mountains, forming from many streamlets near the Sally Gap. It flows for through counties Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin before entering the Irish Sea at its mouth at the midpoint of Dublin Bay, on a line extending from the Baily lighthouse to the Muglin Rocks. It crosses from County Wicklow into County Kildare at Poulaphouca and from County Kildare into County Dublin at Leixlip, with the greatest part of its length being in Kildare.

The catchment area of the Liffey is . The long term average flow rate of the river is .

===Tributaries===
The Liffey system includes dozens of smaller rivers and more than 100 named streams. Early tributaries include the Athdown Brook, Shankill River, Ballylow Brook, Brittas River and Woodend Brook. The substantial King&#x27;s River, which formerly joined the Liffey near Blessington, and may in fact have held the larger flow, now merges in within Poulaphouca Reservoir.

Downstream of Poulaphouca are the Lemonstown Stream, Kilcullen Stream and Pinkeen Stream, followed by the Painestown River (with tributaries including the Morell River), the Rye Water (with tributaries including the Lyreen) at Leixlip, and the Griffeen River and Silleachain Stream in Lucan.

Within Dublin are the various Phoenix Park streams on the left bank, interspersed with right bank tributaries such as the Glenaulin Stream and Creosote Stream.

Within the quays area tributaries include the River Camac, possibly Colman&#x27;s Brook, the Bradogue River, River Poddle, Stein River and the River Dodder, some of which have numerous tributaries of their own.

In earlier times, the River Tolka was also arguably a tributary of the Liffey or at least shared its mouth, but it now enters Dublin Bay distinctly, some distance to the north.

===Dams, reservoirs and falls===
There are dams for three ESB hydroelectric power stations along the river, at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip. Major reservoir facilities also exist at Poulaphouca. The Liffey does not feature natural lakes and has few islands.

Significant falls at Poulaphouca and at Golden Falls were flooded by reservoir construction. There remain areas of rapids, including as the river approaches Dublin city.

===Settlements===

Towns along the river include Blessington, Ballymore Eustace, Kilcullen, Athgarvan, Newbridge, Caragh, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip and Lucan before the river passes the suburb of Chapelizod and then runs through the city of Dublin all the way to its mouth.

==Navigation and uses==

The River Liffey in Dublin city has been used for many centuries for trade, from the Viking beginnings of the city up to recent times. It is connected to the River Shannon via the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal. There is no major navigation on the river itself above the East-Link bridge in modern times, but shipping used to enter Dublin city centre, with major docking points up to the St James&#x27; Gate area.

Since its construction in 1978, the Talbot Memorial Bridge marks the furthest point up to the Liffey to which tall ships may travel, as all bridges downriver of it are either swingbridges or bascule.

===Water supply===
Around 60% of the Liffey&#x27;s flow is abstracted for drinking water and to supply industry. Much of this makes its way back into the river after purification in wastewater treatment plants. Despite a misconception that the Guinness brewery is one such commercial user, the facility uses water piped from the Wicklow Mountains.

===Electricity generation===
ESB hydroelectric power stations exist along the river, at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip, in addition to a number of minor private installations.

===Traffic===

A well-known sight on the Liffey up to the 1990s, the &quot;Lady Patricia&quot; and &quot;Miranda Guinness&quot; cargo ships were used to export Guinness from the St. James&#x27;s Gate Brewery.

As of the early 21st century, the only regular traffic on the river within the city is the &quot;Liffey Voyage&quot; water tour bus service, which runs guided tours along the River Liffey through Dublin City centre. Departing from the boardwalk downstream of the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge, the &quot;Spirit of the Docklands&quot; was built by &quot;Westers Mekaniska&quot; in Sweden as a 50-passenger water taxi. Its variable ballast tanks (not unlike a submarine) and low air draught mean that at low tide it can float high, but at high tide it can ride low and still pass below the Liffey&#x27;s bridges.

Downstream of the East-Link bridge, the river is still mainly used for commercial and ferry traffic, with some recreational use also. High speed trips out the mouth of the Liffey were also previously available from Sea Safari.

===Recreational use===

Upstream from the city, at Chapelizod, the river is used by private, university and Garda rowing clubs.

The Liffey Descent Canoe Race, held each year since 1960, covers a course from Straffan to Islandbridge. The Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river is Islandbridge (weir). The Liffey Swim takes place every year in late August or early September between Watling Bridge and The Custom House. The Islandbridge stretch of river accommodates a number of rowing clubs including Trinity College, UCD, Commercial, Neptune, and the Garda rowing club.

The Liffey is widely used for recreational activities – such as canoeing, rafting, fishing, swimming, significant facilities are at Poulaphouca, Kilcullen, Newbridge, where a seven-acre Liffey Linear Park has been developed, and other facilities are located further downriver at Leixlip and other towns.

==Crossings==

===History===
The earliest stone bridge over the Liffey in Dublin of which there is solid evidence was the Bridge of Dublin, which replaced a wooden bridge, Dubhghall&#x27;s Bridge, dating to the 11th century, and was in turn replaced – the site is now occupied by Fr. Mathew Bridge). The Bridge of Dublin was built by the Dominicans in 1428, and survived well into the 18th century. This four-arch bridge included various buildings such as a chapel, bakehouse and possibly an inn. Island Bridge (a predecessor of the current bridge) was added in 1577 at the upper tidal extremities of the river between Islandbridge and western Chapelizod.

With the development of commercial Dublin in the 17th century, four new bridges were added in Dublin between 1670 and 1684: Barrack, or Bloody Bridge, (the forerunner of the current Rory O&#x27;More Bridge), Essex Bridge (Grattan Bridge), Ormond Bridge (O&#x27;Donovan Rossa Bridge) and Arran Bridge. Flooding in December 1801 following 36 hours of rain destroyed the oldest bridge which connected Church Street and Bridge Street. It was replaced with Whitworth Bridge in 1816.

The oldest bridge still standing is Mellows Bridge, (originally Queens Bridge) constructed in 1764 on the site of Arran Bridge, which was destroyed by floods in 1763. The first iron bridge was the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge built in 1816. Farmleigh Bridge, also iron, was built around 1872 at the end of a tunnel and connected Farmleigh estate to Palmerstown.

The Millennium Bridge was opened in December 1999, and 21st century additions include Seán O&#x27;Casey Bridge (2005), Samuel Beckett Bridge (2009), and Rosie Hackett Bridge (2014).

There are records regarding several bridges in County Kildare. A bridge was built in Kilcullen in 1319. There are also a number of historic private and disused bridges over the Liffey. One such stone bridge, at Harristown Estate in County Kildare, was built for John LaTouche in 1788. This remains in private use and is near the disused Harristown viaduct (over the Liffey) which was on the Sallins Tullow rail line and was last used in 1959.

===Present day===
Dividing the Northside of Dublin from the Southside, the Liffey is today spanned by numerous bridges, mostly open to vehicular traffic. These include the West-Link Bridge on the M50 motorway, Seán Heuston Bridge and O&#x27;Connell Bridge. There are 3 pedestrian bridges in the city: the Millennium Bridge, Seán O&#x27;Casey Bridge and the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge. 21st century additions include the Samuel Beckett Bridge (2009) and James Joyce Bridge (2003), both designed by Santiago Calatrava.

Crossings further upriver include the Liffey Bridge at Celbridge, &quot;The Bridge at 16&quot; (a 19th-century pedestrian suspension bridge at what is now the K Club), and the Leinster Aqueduct – which carries the Grand Canal over the Liffey at Caragh.

Art works along the river and its quays include the Famine Memorial Statues (near the IFSC) and the World Hunger Stone.

==Quays==

The song about &quot;Seamus Rafferty&quot; refers to the &quot;bowsies on the quay&quot;; However, from the late 20th-century there was some renewed development on the quays, with the addition of linear parks and overhanging boardwalks.

There are quays on the north and south banks of the Liffey, extending from the weir at Islandbridge to Ringsend bridge over the river Dodder, just before the East-Link toll bridge.

From west to east, the quays on the north bank are:
:Bridgewater, Wolfe Tone, Sarsfield, Ellis, Arran, Inns, Ormond Upper, Ormond Lower, Bachelors Walk, Eden, Custom House, and North Wall.

From west to east, the quays on the south bank are:
:Victoria, Usher&#x27;s Island, Usher&#x27;s, Merchants, Wood, Essex, Wellington, Crampton, Aston, Burgh, George&#x27;s, City, Sir John Rogerson&#x27;s, and Great Britain.

==Annalistic references==
In the Annals of Inisfallen for the year 808, an entry reads:
:&quot;AI808.2 A defeat [inflicted] by the Laigin on Áed, son of Niall, at the river of Liphe.&quot;

==Popular culture references==
From Joyce to Radiohead, the Liffey is often referenced in literature and song:

That is the first of a number of references to the Liffey in the Wake: insofar as the book has characters, the female protagonist of the novel, Anna Livia Plurabelle, is herself an allegory of the river.

<text>The BMW 801 was a powerful German air-cooled 14-cylinder-radial aircraft engine built by BMW and used in a number of German Luftwaffe aircraft of World War II. Production versions of the twin-row engine generated between 1,560 and 2,000 PS (1,540–1,970 hp, or 1,150–1,470 kW). It was the most produced radial engine of Germany in World War II with more than 61,000 built.

The 801 was originally intended to replace existing radial types in German transport and utility aircraft. At the time, it was widely agreed among European designers that an inline engine was a requirement for high performance designs due to its smaller frontal area and resulting lower drag. Kurt Tank successfully fitted a BMW 801 to a new fighter design he was working on, and as a result the 801 became best known as the power plant for the famous Focke-Wulf Fw 190. The BMW 801 radial also pioneered the use of what would today be designated an engine control unit: its &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; engine management system took over the operation of several aviation engine management control parameters of the era, allowing proper operation of the engine with just one throttle lever.

==Design and development==

===Precursor design===
In the 1930s, BMW took out a license to build the Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet engines. By the mid-30s they had introduced an improved version, the BMW 132. The BMW 132 was widely used, most notably on the Junkers Ju 52, which it powered for much of that design&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1935 the RLM funded prototypes of two much larger radial designs, one from Bramo, the Bramo 329, and another from BMW, the BMW 139. BMW&#x27;s design used many components from the BMW 132 to create a two-row engine with 14 cylinders, supplying 1,550 PS (1,529 hp, 1,140 kW). After BMW bought Bramo in 1939 both projects were merged into the BMW 801, learning from the problems encountered in both projects.

The BMW 139 was originally intended to be used in roles similar to those of the other German radials, namely bombers and transport aircraft, but midway through the program the Focke-Wulf firm&#x27;s chief designer, Kurt Tank suggested it for use in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter project. Radial engines were rare in European designs as they were considered to have too large a frontal area for good and would not be suitable for high speed aircraft. They were most popular on naval aircraft, where their easier maintenance and improved reliability were highly valued. Efforts to improve these designs led to new cowling designs that reduced the concerns about drag. Tank felt that attention to detail could result in a streamlined radial that would not suffer undue drag, and would be competitive with inlines.

The main concern was providing cooling air over the cylinder heads, which generally required a very large opening at the front of the aircraft. Tank&#x27;s solution for the BMW 139 was to use an engine-driven fan behind an oversized, flow-through hollow prop-spinner open at the extreme front, blowing air past the engine cylinders, with some of it being drawn through S-shaped ducts over a radiator for oil cooling. However this system proved almost impossible to operate properly with the BMW 139; early prototypes of the Fw 190 demonstrated terrible cooling problems. Although the problems appeared to be fixable, since the engine was already fairly dated in terms of design, in 1938 BMW proposed an entirely new engine designed specifically for fan-cooling that could be brought to production quickly.

===801 emerges===

The new design was given the name BMW 801 after BMW was given a new block of &quot;109-800&quot; engine numbers by the RLM to use after their merger with Bramo. The 801 retained the 139&#x27;s older-style single-valve intake and exhaust, while most in-line engines of the era had moved to either three (as Junkers had done) or four valves per cylinder, or in British use for their own radials, sleeve valves. Several minor advances were worked into the design, including the use of sodium-cooled valves and a direct fuel injection system, manufactured by Friedrich Deckel AG of Munich.

The supercharger was rather basic in the early models, using a single-stage two-speed design directly geared to the engine (unlike the DB 601&#x27;s hydraulically clutched version) which led to rather limited altitude performance, in keeping with its intended medium-altitude usage. One key advancement for the 801 was the &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; (command-device), a mechanical-hydraulic unit that automatically adjusted engine fuel flow, propeller pitch, supercharger setting, mixture and ignition timing in response to a single throttle lever, dramatically simplifying engine control. The &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; could be considered to be a precursor to the engine control units used for many vehicles&#x27; internal combustion engines of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

There was a considerable amount of wind tunnel work done on the engine and BMW-designed forward cowling (incorporating the engine&#x27;s oil cooler) at the &quot;Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt&quot; (&quot;LFA&quot;) facility in Völkenrode, leading to the conclusion it was possible to reduce drag equivalent to . It also maximized the use of positive air pressure to aid cooling of cylinders, heads, and other internal parts.

=== 801A and 801B ===
The first BMW 801As ran in April 1939, only six months after starting work on the design, with production commencing in 1940. The 801B was to be identical to the 801A except for the gearbox, which reversed the direction of the propeller rotation to counterclockwise as seen from behind the engine. The A and B models were intended to be used in pairs on twin-engine designs, cancelling out net torque and making the plane easier to handle. There is no evidence the 801B ever left the prototype stage. The BMW 801A/B engines delivered 1,560 PS (1,539 hp, 1,147 kW) for takeoff. Major applications of the 801A/L engines include multiple variants of the Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217.

==== 801C and 801L ====
The BMW 801C was developed for use in single- or multi-engined fighters and included a new hydraulic prop control and various changes intended to improve cooling, including cooling &quot;gills&quot; on the cowling behind the engine in place of the original slots. The 801C was almost exclusively used in early variants of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A. The BMW 801L was an A model with the hydraulic prop control mechanism introduced with the 801C engine. The C and L models delivered the same power as the original A model.

=== 801D-2 and 801G-2 ===

The 801C was replaced with the BMW 801 D-2 series engines in early 1942, which ran on C2/C3 100 octane fuel instead of the A/B/C/L&#x27;s B4 87 octane, boosting takeoff power to 1,700 PS (1,677 hp, 1,250 kW). The BMW 801G-2 and H-2 models were D-2 engines modified for use in bomber roles with lower gear ratios for driving larger propellers, clockwise and counterclockwise respectively. As with the 801B engine design, however, the 801H-2 engine did not leave the prototype stage.

The newer, 100 octane D-2 series and its derivatives had higher gear ratios, and higher compression ratios, than the earlier, 87 octane versions. The compression ratio of the 100 octane series was raised to 7.2 from the 6.5 of the 87 octane versions. This was possible because of the better fuel and the better (domed) shape of the combustion chamber. 

The D-2 models were tested with a system for injecting a 50–50 water-methanol mixture known as MW50 into the supercharger primarily for its anti-detonation effect, allowing the use of increased boost pressures. Secondary effects were cooling of the engine and charge cooling. Some performance was gained, but at the cost of engine service life. This was replaced by a system that injected fuel instead of MW50, known as C3-injection, and this was used until 1944. The serious fuel shortage in 1944 forced installation of MW50 instead of C3-injection. With MW50 boosting turned on, takeoff power increased to 2,000 PS (1,470 kW), the C3-injection was initially only permitted for low altitude use and increased take-off power to 1,870 PS. Later C3-injection systems were permitted for low-to-medium altitude use and raised take-off power to more than 1,900 PS.

=== Supercharger development ===

With the engine being used in higher-altitude fighter roles, a number of attempts were made to address the limited performance of the original supercharger. The BMW 801E was a modification of the D-2 using different gear ratios, of 6:1 at low speed and 8.3:1 at high speed, that tuned the supercharger for higher altitudes. Although takeoff power was unaffected, cruise power increased over 100 hp (75 kW) and &quot;high power&quot; modes for climb at nearly 1,500 to 1,650 PS; and combat were likewise improved by up to 150 hp (110 kW). The E model was also used as the basis for the BMW 801R, which included a much more complex and powerful two-stage four-speed supercharger, as well as die cast hydronalium cylinder heads, strengthened crankshaft and pistons, and chromed cylinders and exhaust valves; it was anticipated this version would produce over , or over with MW 50 methanol-water injection.

The 801R, with its 2-stage, 4-speed supercharger, had a critical altitude of 11,000 meters. Above that altitude, the R could use additional boost by nitrous-oxide (GM-1) injection. The R was also bi-fuel. At its critical altitude, the R could deliver 1,400 PS.

In spite of these improvements, the E model was not widely used. Instead, continued improvements to the basic E model led to the BMW 801F, which dramatically improved performance across the board, with takeoff power increasing to 2,400 hp (1,790 kW), making the 801 the only German aviation engine of an existing type that had a producible subtype that could exceed 1,500 kW from a proven military aircraft powerplant. It was planned to use the F on all late-model Fw 190s, but the war ended before production started.

The 801F&#x27;s supercharger had higher critical altitude, than the earlier D-2 series. The improved gear ratios increased the engine&#x27;s critical altitude to between 7,000 and 8,000 meters. The 801F also had a stronger cranckshaft and a fuel-injector pump of higher capacity. The engine, in the TF powerplant form also had better internal and external aerodynamics. On the test bench, the 801F could deliver 2,600 PS in 1945.

The 801F was 25 centimeters longer, than the earlier 801 versions. The reason for this was to keep the balance of gravity of the Ta 152 aircraft.

In 1944, the strongest production verison of the 801, the 801S went into production. It had the same gear ratios, as the 801E, and it&#x27;s supercharger used swirl-throttling. It used the parts of the earlier D-2, and in some parts, the above mentioned more advanced versions (E and F). The S also had an improved and simplified master controller and different magneto timing. The 801S also had altered valve-timing. In special-emergency mode, it could deliver 2,200 PS at sea-level. 

===Importance of continued development===

BMW had been required to create priorities for the 14-cylinder production 801 radial, the 18-cylinder BMW 802 and liquid-cooled 28-cylinder BMW 803 radial engines.

The first priority was for the 801 to be developed &quot;to its limits&quot;, with the second priority the 802&#x27;s design and prototype construction, and lastly the complex 803 four-row radial only receiving attention to its design-development.

By contrast, Allied equivalents such as the American Wright &quot;Twin Cyclone&quot;, and the Soviet Shvetsov ASh-82 radials never needed to be developed beyond 1,500 kW as these nations possessed larger-displacement 18-cylinder radial aviation engines capable of more power.

=== Turbocharger development ===

As just one result of the highest level of priority given to the successful 801 design&#x27;s further development, a number of attempts were made to use turbochargers on the BMW 801 series as well. The first used a modified BMW 801D to create the BMW 801J, delivering 1,810 PS (1,785 hp, 1,331 kW) at takeoff and 1,500 hp (1,103 kW) at , an altitude where the D was struggling to produce 630 hp (463 kW). The BMW 801E was likewise modified to create the BMW 801Q, delivering a superb 1,715 hp (1,261 kW) at , power ratings no existing Allied radial engine of a similar displacement could match.

The turbocharger was fitted behind the engine at a 30° forward tilt off a vertical axis, possessed hollow turbine blades in the exhaust section, and in a photo from &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, appears to have intercooler units fitted around the inner circumference of the rear cowl, just behind the rear row of cylinders.

Not many of these engines ever entered production due to high costs, and the various high-altitude designs based on them were forced to turn to other engines, typically the Junkers Jumo 213.

=== Surviving and operational examples ===

A sizable number of BMW 801s exist in museums, some on display by themselves, with some 20 of them associated with surviving examples of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190s that they powered in World War II. The first original Fw 190 to be restored to flight condition in the 21st century is the Fw 190A-5 discovered near St. Petersburg, Russia in 1989, bearing &quot;Werknummer&quot; 151 227 and formerly serving with JG 54, was restored to flight condition along with its original BMW 801 powerplant. As of 2011, it is once again airworthy and located in Seattle, Washington, USA. The sole surviving Ju 388, in the hands of the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian, has a pair of complete BMW 801J turbocharged engines still in its nacelles.

There is an 801-ML (801L) on display mounted in a Dornier 217 nacelle, essentially a complete surviving &quot;Motoranlage&quot; unitized powerplant, at the New England Air Museum, Bradley International Airport, Windsor Locks, CT. Likewise, the Ju 88R-1 night fighter at the
Royal Air Force Museum London (see photo above) also has unitized BMW 801 radials installed.

==Description==
The 801 was a radial engine with two rows of seven cylinders. The cylinders had both bore and stroke of , giving a total capacity of , just a bit less than the American Wright Cyclone 14 twin-row radial of some 1,600 to 1,900 hp output. The unit (including mounts) weighed from 1,010 to 1,250 kg and was about 1.29 m (51 in) across, depending on the model.

The BMW 801 was cooled by forced air with the cooling fan made from a magnesium alloy (probably Elektron), 10-bladed in the initial models, but 12-bladed in most engines. The fan rotated at 1.72 times the crankshaft speed (3.17 times the propeller speed). Air from the fan was blown into the center of the engine in front of the propeller gearing housing, and the shape of the housing and the engine itself carried the air to the outside of the cowling and across the cylinders. A set of slots or gills at the rear of the cowling allowed the hot air to escape. This provided effective cooling although at the cost of about 70 PS (69 hp, 51.5 kW) required to drive the fan when the aircraft was at low speed. Above , the fan absorbed little power directly as the vacuum effect of the airflow past the air exits provided the needed flow.

The 801 used a relatively complex system, integral to the BMW-designed, matching forward cowling system, to cool the lubricating oil. A ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler&#x27;s core was in contact with the main cowling&#x27;s sheetmetal, to possibly act as a heat sink. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side on the inside of the oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped airflow path, with the oil cooler&#x27;s core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine outward and forward within the cowl&#x27;s frontmost inner area just behind the fan, flowing forward across the oil cooler core in a separate airflow path from the rearwards-direction flow that cooled the engine&#x27;s cylinders, just to provide cooling for the 801&#x27;s oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring slightly forward or aft in order to open or close the gap.

The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to eliminate any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding oil cooler would produce, in this case eliminating the extra drag factor by enclosing it within the engine&#x27;s forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler&#x27;s circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the oil cooler behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the oil cooler was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.

===Engine mounting formats===

The design of the BMW 801&#x27;s cowling was key to its proper cooling, which BMW designed and built themselves and supplied with the engine. The design evolved throughout the war, including an extension to the engine mounts that allowed for larger cooling gills. This factory-supplied cowling also improved the simplicity of engine replacement in the field in more completely &quot;unitizing&quot; a BMW 801 radial engine, with as many of its auxiliary systems as possible being simultaneously replaceable with the engine itself, as opposed to opening or removing a &quot;separate&quot; cowling attached to the fuselage of the aircraft.

Engines were typically delivered from BMW complete in their cowling, ready to be bolted to the front of the aircraft or nacelle, since 1942 as &quot;Motoranlage (M)&quot; and 1944/1945 as &quot;Triebwerksanlage (T)&quot;. The Motoranlage was the original form of the interchangeable &quot;Kraftei&quot;, or &quot;power-egg&quot;, unitized powerplant installation concept used in many German wartime aircraft. It was most often used with twin and multi-engined designs, with some need for external add-ons. The more comprehensive Triebwerksanlage format for unitization consolidated more of the engine&#x27;s required accessory systems beyond what the earlier Motoranlage concept could, plus some external mountings, such as an integrally complete exhaust system (including a turbocharger, if fitted as part of the design), as a completely interchangeable unit. Both M and T formats were also used with various inline engines, like the Daimler-Benz DB 603 used for both the inline-engined versions of the Do 217 and the enormous BV 238 flying boat, and the Junkers Jumo 213 powerplants used for later marks of the Ju 88 multirole aircraft.

The M and T unitized engine formats added secondary designator suffixes, which especially for the 801 radial (and perhaps others), did not always match the letter suffix that designated the bare radial engine used for a particular unitized installation, confusing the naming of the 801 engine series&#x27; subtypes considerably. These suffix designators initially referred to these complete kits and their &quot;bare&quot; engine counterparts almost interchangeably. The A, B and L models were known (logically) as &quot;Motoranlage&quot; style MA, MB and ML engines in this form, but the common D-2 was instead known as the MG. As the war wore on the confusion increased, the E model was delivered as the &quot;Triebwerksanlage&quot; style TG or TH, seemingly suggesting a relation to the G and H engines, but in fact those were delivered as the TL and TP. It is rather common to see the turbocharged versions referred to only with the T for the more completely unitized &quot;Triebwerksanlage&quot; installations, notably the (most notoriously of all) TJ for the BMW 801J turbocharged radial subtype, and the TQ models, further confusing the issue.

== Similar designs: BMW 804 and BMW 805 ==
Despite producing an as succesful engine, as the BMW 801, the company&#x27;s designers designed similar, although more powerful and improved engines. Two of these were the BMW 804 and the BMW 805.

The BMW 804 was similar to the BMW 801, but it had increased stroke and bore, which increased the displacement froom 41.8 liters to 45.5 liters. The takeoff-rating would have benn 2000 PS with a single-stage supercharger.

The BMW 805 was also similar to the BMW 801, but with a two-stage, four-speed supercharger. The 805 would also had increased revolutions (2900/min) and other improvements, like a new cranckcase (for the increased revs) and bigger valves. The takeoff-rating would have been 2400 PS with a 12000 meters critical altitude. 

None of these two engines reached production status.

<doc id="183157" wikidata="Q263107" url="?curid=183157" title="Judenburg">
<text>Judenburg (; ) is a historic town in Styria, Austria.

It is the administrative centre of the Murtal district, which was created on 1 January 2012 from the former Judenburg District and former Knittelfeld District. Until 31 December 2011, it was the capital of the Judenburg District.

On 1 January 2015, the adjoining municipalities of Oberweg and Reifling were merged into Judenburg.

==Geography==
It is located in the Upper Styrian region, on the western end of the Aichfeld basin, stretching along the Mur River from Judenburg down to Knittelfeld in the east. The broad valley is bound by the Niedere Tauern range in the north and the Noric Alps (Lavanttal Alps) in the south.

The municipal area also comprises the cadastral communities of Tiefenbach and Waltersdorf, a former municipality incorporated in 1963.

The municipal area includes the following ten villages (populations as of January 1, 2020):
* Auerling (129)
* Feeberg (176)
* Gasselsdorf (28)
* Judenburg (8,386)
* Oberweg (517)
* Ossach (45)
* Reifling (57)
* Ritzersdorf (15)
* Strettweg (367)
* Waltersdorf (133)

==History==

Archaeological findings indicate that the area was settled at least since the days of the Celtic kingdom of Noricum. Judenburg itself was first mentioned in a 1074 staple right deed as , a market town within the estates of Eppenstein Castle, the ancestral seat of the Bavarian Eppensteiner noble family, who ruled as Styrian margraves in the 11th century. The name literally means &quot;Jews&#x27; Borough&quot;, referring to the town&#x27;s origin as a trading outpost on the route from the Mur Valley across the Obdach Saddle mountain pass to Carinthia, in which Jews played an important role, being represented in the city&#x27;s coat of arms.

Upon the extinction of the Eppensteiner dynasty in 1122, the estates passed to the Styrian Otakars and in 1192 to the House of Babenberg, Dukes of Austria since 1156. Judenburg received town privileges in 1224 and the right to collect tolls in 1277. The town grew to an important commercial centre for iron ore mined at nearby Eisenerz, but also for valeriana celtica used in perfumes during the 13th and 14th centuries. Judenburg was even granted a valeriana trade monopoly by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III in 1460. After several pogroms, all Jews were expelled from the Duchy of Styria by order of Emperor Maximilian I in 1496. Following his breakthrough in Italy, General Napoléon Bonaparte made his headquarters at Judenburg and it was there, on the night of 7–8 April 1796, that he signed the Truce of Judenburg with the Austrians.

In the beginning of the 20th century, the town was one of the centres of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s steel industry and also a garrison city of the Austro-Hungarian Army. From 1910 to 1914 one of the first trolleybusses in Austria connected Judenburg station with the town&#x27;s centre. Little remains of the former industry today, but Judenburg remains an industrial and trade centre. In May 1918, the city was the site of a failed military mutiny.

In 1938, with the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Judenburg became part of the Third Reich. Due to the presence of the word (&quot;Jew&quot;) in the town&#x27;s name, many possible new names were suggested, including (after &quot;Zirbe&quot;, the German name for the Swiss pine tree) and (in honor of Adolf Hitler). However, the planned renaming was indefinitely postponed after the outbreak of war and ultimately never happened.

During the Second World War, a subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp was located nearby, where a displaced persons&#x27; reception centre was established after the war. Judenburg was also one of several towns that saw the handover of Cossacks to the Red Army.

==Politics==

Seats in the municipal assembly () as of the 2020 elections:
*Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 13
*Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP): 7
*Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ): 2
*The Greens - The Green Alternative (die Grüne): 2
*Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 1

==International relations==
===Twin towns - Sister cities===
Judenburg is a member of the Douzelage, a unique town twinning association of 24 towns across the European Union. This active town twinning began in 1991 and there are regular events, such as a produce market from each of the other countries and festivals. Discussions regarding membership are also in hand with three further towns (Agros in Cyprus, Škofja Loka in Slovenia, and Tryavna in Bulgaria).

<text>Herford (; ) is a town in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, located in the lowlands between the hill chains of the Wiehen Hills and the Teutoburg Forest. It is situated in the cultural region of Ostwestfalen-Lippe (OWL) and the administrative region of Detmold. It is the capital of the district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) of Herford.

== Geography ==

=== Geographic location ===
The former Hanseatic town of Herford is situated in the chain of hills south of the Wiehen Hills (Ravensberg Hills). The highest place is the Dornberg (240 m) in the Schwarzenmoor district; the lowest point (56 m) is located in the Werretal in the Falkendiek district. The River Aa joins the river Werre in the centre of the town. The Stuckenberg is located east of the town.

==History==
The town was founded in 789 by Charlemagne in order to guard a ford in the narrow Werre river. A century later, Matilda, daughter of Dietrich of Ringelheim, a count of Saxony, grew up in the abbey of Herford; she was a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind. In Herford she met Henry the Fowler, who later became king of Germany.

In late medieval times Herford was a member of the Hanseatic League. It was a Free Imperial City, i.e. it was directly subordinated to the emperor. This status was lost after the Peace of Westphalia (1648), when Herford was annexed by Brandenburg-Prussia. It was administered within the Province of Westphalia following the Napoleonic Wars, and made part of the new state North Rhine-Westphalia after World War II.

<text>The Aker Stadion (known as Molde Stadion for UEFA competitions and prior to sponsorship) is an all-seater football stadium located at Reknes in Molde, Norway, and is the home of Eliteserien club Molde. The stadium has a current capacity of 11,249 spectators.

The building was designed by architect Kjell Kosberg. It cost , most of which was paid for by club-owner Kjell Inge Røkke—after whom the ground has been nicknamed &quot;Røkkeløkka&quot;. The main construction work took place 1997, and the stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998 in a league game against Lillestrøm, replacing Molde idrettspark as Molde&#x27;s home ground. The stadium was nominated for the FIABCI Prix D&#x27; Excellence and awarded the City Prize in 1999. The record attendance of 13,308 was set in a league match against Rosenborg in 1998. The same year, the arena hosted its first international match, where Norway beat Saudi Arabia 6–0. The following year, when Molde reached the UEFA Champions League, the stadium was converted to an all-seater, reducing its capacity. Since May 2006, the stadium name has been sponsored by Røkke&#x27;s company Aker. The grass pitch was replaced with artificial turf in 2014.

==History==
Since 1955, Molde had been playing their home games at Molde idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue. A new stadium was proposed to be located at the waterfront at Reknes. There were many local protests, including complaints about the size of the structure. Construction of the land fillings and preparation of the construction site started in March 1997, before final approval had been granted by the municipality.
The stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998, when the stadium was officially opened by Prime Minister and Molde-fan Kjell Magne Bondevik. In the opening match, Molde beat Lillestrøm 4–0 in their first home game of the season, attracting 13,010 spectators. During the season, this was the match in the country with the most spectators not hosted at Rosenborg&#x27;s home ground Lerkendal. On 27 May, the arena hosted its first international match, with Norway beating Saudi Arabia 6–0 in a 1998 World Cup friendly. On 11 August, CSKA Sofia visited Molde for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, for which Molde failed to qualify. The all-time spectator record was set on 26 September, when Molde hosted Rosenborg BK in front of 13,308 people.

During the fall of 1999, Molde played two qualification games for UEFA Champions League at the stadium. Following the aggregated victories over CSKA Moscow and Mallorca, Molde qualified for the group stage, where they played Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos. Following entry into Champions League, the stadium was converted to an all-seater, with seats being installed on the lower sections of the short end stands. The reduced the attendance capacity permanently, because the club chose to not remove the seats afterwards.

In 2006, an agreement was made where Røkke&#x27;s company Aker became the stadium name sponsor, with the stadium being renamed Aker stadion. The same season, the club was relegated to the First Division, where the team played in 2007. Despite the relegation, average attendance increased, and Molde won the league. Since 2008, the team has again played in the top flight.

Molde later entered the UEFA Cup four times (renamed to Europa League in 2010), in 2000–01, 2003–04 and 2006–07, 2010–11, playing a total of eight home games, before they in 2012 again played qualification for the Champions League and Ventspils and Basel visited Aker Stadion. Molde were eliminated by Basel, but managed to qualify for the Europa League group stage and played against Heerenveen, Stuttgart, Steaua Bucuresti and Copenhagen at Aker Stadion. In 2015–16, Ajax, Fenerbahçe and Celtic visited Molde during the Europa League group stage, after they&#x27;ve beaten Standard Liège in the Play-off and before Sevilla came to Aker Stadion in the Round of 32 in February 2016. On 19 November 2013, Aker Stadion hosted its second international match, a friendly Norway were defeated 1–0 by Scotland.

Aker Stadion has been proposed used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway&#x27;s largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management. The issue was intensified in 2004, when a much smaller arena was used for a quickly sold-out Stevie Wonder concert. On 6 October 2007, StatoilHydro arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near-by processing plant for the gas field Ormen Lange. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players&#x27; Association among away-team captains, Aker Stadion was found to be the league&#x27;s fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from one to five.

The club decided on 4 October 2013 to lay artificial turf on the field, which it hoped would be in place ahead of the 2014 season. The club was especially concerned with the poor surface during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year. The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators. It was the first time since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium, Ullevaal Stadion. In October 2017, the artificial turf was changed to a newer generation.

==Facilities==
The stadium was designed by Kjell Kosberg of Kosbergs Arkitektkontorer. In addition to featuring the stadium, the complex has of commercial space. The whole structure cost NOK 212 million, of which NOK 160 million was for the stadium itself. The stadium is located at Reknes, just west of the city center, on the shore of the Moldefjord. The exterior of the building is clad with two colors of granite, glass and aluminum. The building was financed by Kjell Inge Røkke, although NOK 10 million was paid by the municipality and NOK 2.7 million by Norsk Tipping. In 1999, the structure won the City Prize, that is awarded to the Norwegian building project that is both profitable, innovative and increases the value of the surrounding area. The stadium was also nominated to FIABCI&#x27;s Prix D&#x27; Excellence.

There are four stands in two tiers built as a continual whole and a capacity of 11,167. Prior to 1999, the lower tiers along the short sides had terraces, allowing an initial capacity of 13,308. There are 13 entrances, 52 toilets and 9 kiosks. The stadium has thirteen executive boxes in the north stand, varying in size between . The arena is , measuring . It includes a restaurant and café, in addition to a medical clinic. The pitch is of natural grass, with 4% artificial turf sown in. Floodlight is provided with 176 lamps, mounted at a low . The speaker system has 32 kW.

There is no public transport that serves the arena, but all city and regional buses serve the city center&#x27;s bus terminal, which is within walking distance. On game days, Aukra Auto operates a bus service from Aukra, while Nettbuss operates from Eidsvåg, Kleive, Batnfjordsøra and Sjøholt. Tide Sjø operates a fast ferry to Helland and Vikebukt. There are a very limited number of parking spaces at the stadium, and these are limited to holders of VIP tickets.

==Attendance==

<text>The bilander, also spelled billander or bélandre, is a two-masted vessel. The foremast carries square rigs on all of its yards, and its taller mainmast has a long lateen mainsail yard with a corresponding trapezoidal sail and rig inclined at about 45°, with square rigs on the yards above that. The lowermost is secured at the corners by a crossjack.

==History==
A bilander was a small European merchant ship with two masts. It was used in the Netherlands for coast and canal traffic and occasionally seen in the North Sea but more frequently in the Mediterranean Sea. In England, the use of the bilander can be dated back as far as the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The mainmast was lateen-rigged with a trapezoidal mainsail, but the foremast carried the conventional square course and square topsail. Displacement was typically under 100 tons. However, the design was eventually replaced by more efficient sailing ship designs, leading it to be regarded as simply a precursor to the brig. The design was popular in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as around New England in the first half of the 18th century, but was soon surpassed by better designs. It is considered the forerunner of the brig. Few examples survive.

<text>The 1996 Cricket World Cup, also called the Wills World Cup 1996 for sponsorship reasons, was the sixth Cricket World Cup organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The tournament was won by Sri Lanka, who defeated Australia by seven wickets in the final on 17 March 1996 at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan.

==Hosts==

The competition was played in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. India hosted 17 matches at 17 venues, Pakistan hosted 16 matches at six venues and four matches were played at three Sri Lankan venues

Australia and the West Indies refused to send their teams to Sri Lanka following the bombing of Central Bank in Colombo by the Tamil Tigers in January 1996. After extensive negotiations, the ICC ruled that Sri Lanka would be awarded both games on forfeit. As a result of this decision, Sri Lanka automatically qualified for the quarter-finals before playing a game.

===India===
===Pakistan===
===Sri Lanka===

* Two matches were scheduled to be played at Premadasa Stadium, but neither took place as Australia and the West Indies declined to play in Sri Lanka.

==Squads==
==Teams==
All the Test-playing nations participated in the competition, including Zimbabwe, who became the ninth Test-status member of the ICC following the last World Cup. The three Associate teams (previously one) to qualify through the 1994 ICC Trophy – the United Arab Emirates, Kenya and the Netherlands – also made their World Cup debuts in 1996. The Netherlands lost all of their five matches, including a defeat to the UAE, while Kenya recorded a surprise victory over the West Indies in Pune.

==Summary==
The Sri Lankans, coached by Dav Whatmore and captained by Arjuna Ranatunga, used Man of the Series Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana as opening batsmen to take advantage of the fielding restrictions during the first 15 overs of each innings. At a time when 50 or 60 runs in the first 15 overs was considered adequate, Sri Lanka scored 117 runs in those overs against India, 123 against Kenya, 121 against England in the quarter-final and 86 against India in the semi-final. Against Kenya, Sri Lanka made 398 for 5, a new record for the highest team score in a One Day International that stood until April 2006. Gary Kirsten scored 188 not out against United Arab Emirates at Rawalpindi, Pakistan. This became the highest individual score ever in any World Cup match until it was surpassed by first Chris Gayle of the West Indies, and later Martin Guptill of New Zealand, who scored 215 and 237 respectively in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

Sri Lanka won the first semi-final over India at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, in front of a crowd unofficially estimated at 110,000. After they had lost both openers cheaply, Sri Lanka launched a counter-attack, led by Aravinda de Silva, to post a strong total of 251 for the loss of 8 wickets. India began their chase promisingly but after the loss of Sachin Tendulkar, the Indian batting order collapsed. After India had slumped to 120 for 8 in the 35th over, sections of the crowd began to throw fruit and plastic bottles onto the field. The players left the field for 20 minutes in an attempt to quieten the crowd. When the players returned for play, more bottles were thrown onto the field and fires were lit in the stand. Match referee Clive Lloyd awarded the match to Sri Lanka, the first default ever in a Test or One Day International.

In the second semi-final in Mohali, Australia recovered from 15/4 to reach 207/8 from their 50 overs. The West Indians had reached 165/2 in the 42nd over before losing their last eight wickets for 37 runs in 50 balls.

Sri Lanka won the toss in the final and sent Australia in to bat despite the team batting first having won all five previous World Cup finals. Mark Taylor top scored with 74 in Australia&#x27;s total of 241/7. Sri Lanka won the match in the 47th over with Aravinda de Silva following his 3 for 42 with an unbeaten 107 to win the Player of the Match award. It was the first time a tournament host or co-host had won the cricket World Cup.

A warm-up match was played between South Africa and Pakistan on 8 February 1996 in which South Africa defeated Pakistan by 65 runs.

==Final==
Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to field. Mark Taylor (74 from 83 balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Ricky Ponting (45 from 73 balls, 2 fours) shared a second-wicket partnership of 101 runs. When Ponting and Taylor were dismissed, however, Australia fell from 137/1 to 170/5 as the famed four-pronged spin attack of Sri Lanka took its toll. Despite the slump, Australia struggled on to 241/7 from their 50 overs.

<text>The Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquila) is a seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae which breeds on Boatswain Bird Island and Ascension Island in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

The Ascension frigatebird is a large lightly built seabird with brownish-black plumage and a deeply forked tail. It has a wingspan of around . The male has a striking red gular sac which he inflates to attract a mate. The female is slightly larger than the male and has a brown breast-band and sometimes a white belly. They feed on fish taken in flight from the ocean&#x27;s surface (mostly flying fish), and sometimes indulge in kleptoparasitism, harassing other birds to force them to regurgitate their food.

==Taxonomy==
The Ascension frigatebird was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus aquilus&quot;. His specimen had been collected from the Ascension Island by the Swedish explorer Pehr Osbeck.

The names &quot;frigatebird&quot; and &quot;Fregata&quot; derive from the French mariners&#x27; name for the bird &quot;La Frégate&quot;, a frigate or fast warship. The specific &quot;aquila&quot; is Latin for an eagle, and refers to the dark plumage and rapacious habits.&quot;

The genus &quot;Fregata&quot; formerly included all four species of large frigatebirds but in 1914 the Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews split off the other three species leaving &quot;Fregata aquila&quot; to denote the Ascension frigatebird. An analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicates that within the genus &quot;Fregata&quot;, the Ascension frigatebird is most closely related to the magnificent frigatebird.

==Description==
The Ascension frigatebird is a dark coloured seabird with long slender pointed wings, a long deeply forked tail and a long hooked bill. It measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs around . Male birds are entirely black except for the nape, mantle and scapulars that are covered with elongated lanceolate feathers that have a green metallic sheen. The birds have a striking red gular sack that they inflate to attract a mate. Their bills are pale blueish grey, their eyes are dark brown with a black eye-ring and their legs are grey. Female birds are brownish black and lack the green lanceolate feathers. Birds with the more common dark morph have a brown panel on the front that stretches from the collar down to the chest. Their eye-rings and the base of the bill are pale blue. Birds with the pale morph have some white on their chest. It is possible that they are young breeding females that have not yet acquired the full adult plumage.

==Distribution==
The bulk of the Ascension frigatebird population nests on a plateau on top of Boatswain Bird Island, which lies off the northeast coast of Ascension Island. The species formerly bred on Ascension Island itself, but the colonies were exterminated by feral cats introduced in 1815. A program conducted between 2002 and 2004 successfully eliminated all the feral cats and, as a result, two pairs of frigatebirds returned to nest on Ascension Island in 2012. In 2014 twelve nests were reported on Letterbox Peninsula at the extreme east end of the island.

As with other frigatebirds, its movements outside the breeding season are little known because of identification problems within this difficult group, but it occurs off West Africa. It feeds on fish and similar surface prey such as small turtles.

A juvenile frigatebird found dying in 1953 in Tiree, Scotland was identified at the time as magnificent frigatebird but the specimen was re-examined in 2002 and found to be an Ascension frigatebird. In July 2013 a juvenile was photographed at Bowmore on the island of Islay in Scotland. In late June 2014 one was tracked by satellite to within 100 nautical miles of the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, some 200 miles from the South American mainland.

==Status==
A census of the Ascension frigatebird population on the islet of Boatswain conducted in 2001–2002 recorded around 6,250 breeding females. As female frigatebirds normally only breed every other year, this implied a total population of 12,500 birds. This number is similar to an earlier estimate of between 8,000 and 10,000 birds obtained in a study conducted in 1957–1959. The species is classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as it breeds on just a single tiny island.

<doc id="183181" wikidata="Q6805868" url="?curid=183181" title="Media of Canada">
<text>The media of Canada is highly autonomous, uncensored, diverse, and very regionalized. Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in English films, television shows, and magazines—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States. As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).

Canadian mass media, both print and digital, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a &quot;handful of corporations&quot;. The largest of these corporations is the country&#x27;s national public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating its own radio and TV networks in both English and French. In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as TVOntario and Télé-Québec.

The 1991 &quot;Broadcasting Act&quot; declares &quot;the system should serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political, social, and economic fabric of Canada&quot;. The promotion of multicultural media began in the late 1980s as multicultural policy was legislated in 1988. In the &quot;Multiculturalism Act&quot;, the federal government proclaimed the recognition of the diversity of Canadian culture. Thus, multicultural media became an integral part of Canadian media overall. Upon numerous government reports showing lack of minority representation or minority misrepresentation, the Canadian government stressed separate provision be made to allow minorities and ethnicities of Canada to have their own voice in the media.

Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing. Canadian tax laws limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.

== Media consumption ==

According to data from the 2020 General Social Survey on Social Identity, Canadians use various news sources, including newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and the Internet. The Internet is the most popular method for following news at 80%, followed by television at 67%. Other sources include radio (40%), newspapers (36%), and magazines (11%).

People with a university degree are more likely to use the Internet, newspapers, and magazines for news. Specifically, 90% of university graduates use the Internet, compared to 46% using newspapers and 17% using magazines. Among immigrants, media usage for news increases the longer they have been in Canada. The survey shows that daily news consumption varies: 39% of immigrants who arrived in Canada 0 to 5 years ago, 40% for 6 to 10 years, 58% for 11 or more years, and 60% for those not immigrants.

Internet use is higher among younger individuals (15 to 34 years) at 95%, while those 55 years and older prefer television, with 88% following news on this platform. In the younger demographic, there are no gender differences for Internet use; however, in older age groups, more men use the Internet compared to women. Among those aged 55 and older, 67% of men and 59% of women use the Internet. Television viewership is higher among women in all age groups.

== History ==

The history of Canadian media performers goes back to the first days of radio. In the 1940s, the Radio Artists of Toronto Society (RATS) was formed. Radio performers in Montreal, Winnipeg, and Vancouver also organized to fight for artists&#x27; rights, working conditions, and better fees. In 1943, the Association of Canadian Radio Artists (ACRA) was formed as a loose national coalition of actors&#x27; groups. Over the years, ACRA evolved into the Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists, followed by the Canadian Council of Authors and Artists, then the Association of Canadian Television and Radio Artists, and, in 1984, to the Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists, its present name.

The Canadian &quot;Broadcasting Act&quot;, historically and in its modern conception, is based on the fact that, since the start of the 20th century, it was important for broadcasters to ensure that information flowed freely and reflected the diversity of Canadian points of view, as opposed to the classic approach, which gives media owners more freedom to express their views. The Canadian broadcasting system as it exists today &quot;would probably not exist if we had allowed the marketplace to regulate ownership rights.&quot;

In August 2015, the Canadian Media Guild, the union representing CBC journalists, became a registered third party in order to campaign for increased taxpayer funding of the CBC in the 2015 election. After the Liberal Party of Canada won the election, it increased taxpayer funding of the CBC by CA$150 million. In 2017, the federal government announced a five-year $50-million program to help struggling local newspapers. In 2018, it announced $595 million in tax credits to help struggling newspapers and television networks adapt to competition from online news sources.

In 2013, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; wrote an article noting the influence that Quebecor and owner Pierre Karl Péladeau have on the Quebec media system. The article noted that Quebecor behaves like a counterpart to the federalist , owned by the Desmarais family&quot;.&quot; In November 2018, Unifor, the other major union for Canadian journalists, announced that it would campaign against the Conservative Party of Canada in the 43rd Canadian federal election. In February 2019, former Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould gave testimony to the House of Commons Justice Committee raising further speculation of political interference from the Liberal Party in journalism. As part of the testimony, Jessica Prince, the Wilson-Raybould&#x27;s chief of staff revealed that Katie Telford, chief of staff to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said: &quot;If Jody is nervous, we would, of course, line up all kinds of people to write op-eds saying that what she is doing is proper.&quot;

Postmedia has faced questions from both Maclean&#x27;s and Canadaland, regarding whether recent changes to their editorial staff was singling a shift that they were pushing &quot;conservative views&quot; onto their audience. In 2019, Kathy English, the public editor for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, admitted that &quot;The Star&quot; has failed to meet its journalistic standards by stating &quot;call for reporting fairly and accurately and reflecting the pertinent facts and diversity of views on matters of public debate.&quot;

English defended &quot;The Star&quot;, arguing that there is &quot;no such a thing as objectivity in journalism.&quot;

A report released from the Digital Democracy Project, a joint venture between the Public Policy Forum and McGill University&#x27;s School of Public Policy revealed that non-partisans with high exposure to traditional media gave roughly 50% more wrong answers than those with low exposure. &quot;Strong partisans&quot;, however, gave almost twice as many.

=== The Electronic Age and Marshall McLuhan ===
In &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, Marshall McLuhan writes that:

&quot;if a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&quot;

He gives great importance to the introduction of electronic media into the realm of people&#x27;s everyday lives. According to McLuhan, the introduction of electronic media was one of the main media revolutions. He claims that technology evoked an emotional response from audiences although it technically had no moral bias. Technology in the electronic age shapes an individual&#x27;s (as well as a society&#x27;s) self-realization. In other words, McLuhan writes about three major revolutions in his various works and gives great importance to the electronic one. Electronic mass media clearly have a large impact on Canadian society and affect audiences in a variety of ways.

=== Print Media and Marshall McLuhan ===
According to McLuhan&#x27;s dichotomies of hot and cool media, print media occupy mostly a visual space, rather than other senses such as that of hearing (which is involved in media like television). He writes that this makes print media a hot medium, as it provides the reader with complete involvement without considerable stimulus. Because print media are hot media, they involve relatively little interaction from users. McLuhan discussed three main media revolutions, one of them coming about with the invention of the printing press. He explained that with texts being mass-produced there was a new level of immediacy, accessibility, and a subsequent rise in literacy; in manuscript culture, access to texts was limited to a privileged few, whereas in print culture, literature increasingly became a commodity. For this reason, print media was revolutionary at the time. However, with the more recent electronic revolution, the importance of print began to decline, as discussed below.

==Regulation==
The Canadian government regulates media ownership and the state of media through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Section 3(d)(iii) of the Canadian &quot;Broadcasting Act&quot; states that media organizations should reflect &quot;equal rights, the linguistic duality and multicultural and multiracial nature of Canadian society and the special place of aboriginal peoples within that society.&quot;
== Identity and Mass Media ==
According to John A. Irving, mass media functions differently in Canadian society because of a lack of collective identity; this is in reference to Canada&#x27;s languages (and related cultures) as well as its proximity to the United States. Irving states that such cultural dualism means that only some of the population responds to the mass media in English, while the other portion remain uninfluenced by English-based media. In terms of the proximity to the United States, he explains that &quot;most of the difficulties that threaten the mass media in Canada are the direct outcome of American economic and cultural imperialism.&quot; Because of the United States&#x27; overwhelming influence on Canadian mass media, Canada has not been able to form its own identity in the media. These two factors have slowed down the process of the creation of a Canadian community. Mass media help in forming a community through communication. When a large group of people is in communication with one another through media, an identifiable culture is formed. Individuals in dialectic experience a sense of membership and collective identity. A creative culture exists in Quebec for French Canadians, but English Canadians (that is, those who are not exposed to French culture) are hardly aware of it. The published works of French Canadian authors remain relatively unknown in nine of the ten provinces and have little influence outside of Quebec. In addition to this, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates two separate networks for radio and television; listeners and watchers of the English stations rarely listen to the French stations, and vice versa.

Irving claims that the most important problem facing Canada in terms of forming a genuine identity comes from its close proximity to the United States. It is difficult for a bilingual or multilingual country, such as Canada, Switzerland, or Belgium, to be so close to a country with one common language, such as the United States and England, because of the latter&#x27;s influence on the former. Over ninety percent of the periodicals displayed on newsstands which sell more than 10,000 copies a month are American. Because of this overwhelming influence of the powerful United States, Canada has been significantly slowed down in forming its own unique identity.

Irving also mentions a third, less important reason for Canada&#x27;s inability to form a genuine identity in history: distance and geographical regionalism. There are six distinct regions within the domain of Canada: the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, the Prairies, British Columbia, and the northern territories. Because of the large distances between these regions, media could not spread throughout the whole country as effectively in the past. In the time of canoe transportation, this distance was a barrier to communication; with the age of the telegraph-railway, Canada finally began to edge towards becoming a proper, connected nation.

== Business Model ==
Media often consists of a two-sided market model. In such cases, each side of the market is expected to provide a form of benefit to the other in return for the same. It is a mutual system of benefit in which there are two end-users or beneficiaries. A lot of times, mass media works in this way (in Canadian society as well as in any other). For example, television requires the viewer and advertisers to provide mutual network benefits. Printed books require the publisher and author to provide readers with quality work; in return, readers provide feedback and increase the popularity of the book through purchases. A newspaper&#x27;s advertisers and readers mutually benefit from one another; readers provide business for advertisers while advertisers provide readers with information (since a significant portion of newspapers&#x27; funding comes from advertisers). The more successful a newspaper is, the better it gets at providing its readers with a well-rounded accumulation of news. All advertising-based media are two-sided markets. Bob Garfield explains that there are two issues with this model: widespread access to certain content has significantly lowered the amount that consumers are willing to spend on it; the audience becomes fragmented. The second issue is that the rise in available content has lowered the prices that advertisers are willing to pay in order to access a portion of the market.

Special attention must be paid to the importance of advertising, particularly in newspapers. Newspapers typically generate about 70 – 80 percent of their revenue from advertising, while the remainder comes from subscriptions and sales. However, with the recent move to online publishing, there have been problems. Online advertising is not nearly as effective as print advertising, according to Eric Clemons. Although he discusses advertising in relation to newspapers in the United States, similar problems exist in Canada. He claims that Internet advertising will fail for three reasons:

* Consumers do not trust advertising – Messages coming from commercial sources have proven to be considered less credible by audiences and therefore have a less powerful impact. Company sponsored blogs are among the least trusted sources of information on products and services.
* Consumers are not interested in viewing advertisements – They visit websites for the main content and do not want to see things which attempt to distract them from this.
* Consumers do not need advertising – If users need a product or service, they have their own sources on the Internet and prefer to use these as opposed to advertisements on websites which are not solely dedicated to the product or service.

Clemons suggests alternative methods for earning money through the Internet, namely selling content and selling access to virtual communities. However, one might argue that this would not be effective in current society; since content and access has been available for free for as long as the Internet has been around, sudden charges might cause an uproar among users of the Internet. Furthermore, a portion of Internet users may not be able to afford paying for content and access, which will limit the amount of revenue businesses will bring in.

In August 2015, the Canadian Media Guild, the union representing CBC journalists, became a registered third party in order to campaign for increased taxpayer funding of the CBC in the 2015 election. After the Liberal Party of Canada won the election, it increased taxpayer funding of the CBC by $150 million.
In 2017, the federal government announced a five-year $50 million program to help struggling local newspapers. In 2018, it announced $595 million in tax credits to help struggling newspapers and television networks.

=== Journalism model ===
The face of print journalism in Canada is undergoing change. Evening newspapers are no longer popular (one of the only surviving ones is tonight Newspaper), while morning newspapers (including the Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, the National Post, and free newspapers such as Metro and 24) have survived and continued to bring in an audience. Before the 1970s, The Globe and Mail was one of the few surviving morning papers, while most popular newspapers were distributed in the evening in Toronto. Nowadays, most newspapers have joined The Globe and Mail and are published in the morning.

The newspaper industry in Canada (similar to the newspaper industry in other developed countries including the United States) is controlled by a small number of individual or corporate owners. This is referred to as concentrated ownership. Private or partially private ownership of competitive forms of news media helps to create a great amount of freedom of expression, according to Peter Desbarats. However, it may be argued that even these privately owned media outlets have their own agenda, and have therefore only contributed to a limited amount of freedom of expression. Robert A. Hackett discusses this, as well as the differences between publicly owned and privately owned media outlets. It may also be argued that publicly owned media contribute more to freedom of expression than privately owned media; Simeon Djankov, Caralee McLeish, Tatiana Nenova, and Andrei Schleifer, in a joint Harvard-World Bank study, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of publicly owned media outlets in relation to privately owned media outlets. They write that one of the first principles of media is that it is in the public interest, and it is therefore necessary to have outlets owned by the public. In this way, the public keeps a check on the agenda of publications. If there is too much of a bias, the owners (which in this case consists of the public) react and demand a change through various forms of feedback. In contrast, privately owned outlets only have a limited number of voices to give feedback, and these voices may have their own biased agendas. Two characteristics of electronic journalism in Canada set it apart from print journalism: firstly, broadcasting is a regulated industry (which is important to consider in relation to news sources such as radio and television). This means that in order to start a broadcast station, one must have a licence from the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Commission. This regulated industry also affects news content because it is constantly being monitored by the agency. Secondly, many radio stations and television stations in Canada are publicly owned. Print journalism has almost always been conducted by private enterprise in Canada, and radio also started as a private enterprise which was subject to regulation by the state. It became a hybrid of private and public broadcasters.

Nowadays, online journalism is on the rise. It provides a new platform for readers to interact instantly with news sources through blog comments and feedback. There are also various multimedia options which are not available with print journalism. For example, videos can be embedded into websites. Alexandre Gamela, a freelance journalist, says that &quot;The print product is pretty much the same as it was 20, 30, 40 years ago, it is not well adapted to these new circumstances, therefore it needs to be re-thought and re-designed.&quot; For these reasons, online journalism continues to gain popularity. However, as will be discussed under the section on newspapers, readerships for print newspapers in Canada seems to be steady.

The &quot;Digital Democracy Project&quot; reports that Canadians both consume and somewhat trust print, broadcast and online media sources. They also consume news from social networks such as Twitter, but they mostly recognize the biased tendencies of people who actively post news on such networks. People with strong political opinions are at risk of becoming misinformed by depending only on news sources that they agree with (primarily social media, but also traditional media).
==Television==
The history of television in Canada begins in Montreal and Toronto, where the first television stations were started in 1952. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired its first broadcast on September 6, 1952 from Montreal&#x27;s station, CBFT. The program was bilingual. As mentioned by Irving, and supported by Arthur Siegel, modern media such as television and radio have become agents of denationalization because of the spillover of U.S. influence and fragmentation of media within Canada. Siegel implies that because of this, the state of television in Canada (i.e. whether it is healthy or dying) depends on the state of television in the United States.

Television was welcomed when it was first introduced into society. It brought about a change from communication which was previously limited to only audio. If one wanted to view something on a screen, one would have to visit the cinema; the television provided a way of sitting at home and having visual communication as well as entertainment. Nowadays, however, with the introduction of smartphones and the Internet, television is headed towards obsolescence according to Rabab Khan. He writes that because smartphones and computers allow one do what a television and radio combined allow, the need for the latter two media is declining. However, he writes that television allows for a shared experience which computers and smartphones do not allow. Henry Blodget also addresses this issue and claims that because revenue and profits of the television industry are still steadily coming in, people are in denial about its inevitable failure. He states that like the newspaper industry, television is beginning to migrate to the web and investing in digital platforms.

The Canadian television broadcasting industry is split between public and private ownership. Canada currently has 130 originating television stations, which broadcast on 1,456 transmitters across the country, on both the VHF and UHF bands.

In addition to the public Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada, which operates both English (CBC Television) and French (Ici Radio-Canada Télé) television networks, there are five major private TV networks. CTV, Global, and Citytv broadcast in English, and are available throughout the country. TVA and Noovo (formerly &#x27;V&#x27;) broadcast in French and operate over-the-air in French-language markets (including Quebec and parts of Ontario and New Brunswick), although are also available across Canada via pay television. Most network stations are owned and operated by the networks themselves, although all networks have some affiliates with different ownership.

In addition, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN), a service devoted mainly to programming of interest to the Indigenous peoples of Canada, is considered a network by the CRTC, although the network airs terrestrially only in the 3 Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller television systems, such as CTV Two (a compliment to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and Omni Television—a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.

Several provinces maintain provincial public broadcasting networks in addition to the CBC, including Télé-Québec, TVOntario, TFO, and Knowledge (British Columbia). Citytv Saskatchewan and CTV Two Alberta were formerly provincial public broadcasters (SCN and Access), but both have since been privatized and amalgamated into commercial networks operated by their current owners (Rogers and Bell). While both outlets devote a portion of their schedules to their networks&#x27; respective, advertising-supported entertainment programming, both networks are still required to adhere to an educational remit in the majority of their programming. Unlike in the United States, where a statewide public network is usually the state&#x27;s primary PBS member station, the provincially owned public systems in Canada are independent of each other and have their own programming.

Only CBC/Radio-Canada, TVA and APTN are officially considered national networks by the CRTC, while V is a provincial network in Quebec. City, CTV and Global are legally considered &quot;television services&quot; even though they operate as networks for all practical purposes. As well, there are a few independent stations, including CFTU in Montreal, CJON in St. John&#x27;s and CJIL in Lethbridge. However, most of these are not general entertainment stations like independent stations in the United States, but are instead specialty community channels or educational services. CJON is the only independent commercial station currently operating in Canada, although CJON sublicenses a mix of programming from Global, CTV and other sources rather than purchasing program rights independently.

TV station callsigns in Canada are usually made up of four letters, although two stations have three call letters (CKX in Brandon and CKY in Winnipeg) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always &quot;C&quot;, and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the two-letter combinations of &quot;CF&quot;, &quot;CH&quot;, &quot;CI&quot;, &quot;CJ&quot;, or &quot;CK&quot;. The combinations &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;CY&quot;, &quot;CZ&quot; and several combinations beginning with &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of rebroadcasters—some are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as &quot;semi-satellites&quot;, which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, a limited amount of distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.

CBC-owned stations use call letters beginning with the combination &quot;CB&quot; (through a special agreement with the government of Chile); private affiliates of the CBC use the same combinations as other private stations. The CBC has also sometimes directly acquired former private affiliate stations; these usually (although not always) retain their historic call sign rather than changing to a CB call. While Canadian TV stations are technically required to identify themselves over the air by their call letters, the rule is rarely enforced by the CRTC. As a result, most TV stations never use their call letters for any purpose other than official CRTC business, and instead brand under regional names such as CTV Northern Ontario or Global Regina. Even then, most network-owned stations may only use these brands for station identification and newscasts, and promote the majority of their programming under the network brand without any disambiguation.

Due to their proximity to American media markets, a number of Canadian cities and regions receive US broadcasters as part of their local media. This has required special dispensation for Canadian content for broadcasters in the Windsor, Ontario region (due to it falling within the Detroit media footprint), and there have also been cases of US-based broadcasters (KCND-TV of Pembina, North Dakota, now CKND-DT of Winnipeg; also KVOS-TV of Bellingham, Washington) targeting its programming and advertising at Canadian viewers.

Although all broadcast networks in Canada are required to produce and air some Canadian content, only the English and French networks of the CBC run predominantly Canadian-produced schedules, though, the English network does run some imported programming from the United Kingdom, most notably &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. The private networks, CTV, Global and Citytv, have all at times faced criticism over their level of commitment to producing and airing Canadian programming. The commercial networks often find it easier to purchase rights to hit American series than to invest in Canadian productions, which are often prohibitively costly for the comparatively small size of the Canadian market. The French-language networks traditionally have had less difficulty meeting their Canadian content obligations, as the language difference makes francophone audiences much more readily receptive to home-grown programming than to dubbed American imports.

Digital television is an emerging technology in Canada. Although some TV stations have begun broadcasting digital signals in addition to their regular VHF or UHF broadcasts, this is not yet as widespread as in the United States. Although most markets have digital channel assignments already in place, to date digital broadcasts have only launched in the largest metropolitan areas. Digital television sets are available in Canadian stores, but are not universally present in all Canadian homes.

Several broadcasters, including the CBC, have argued that there is no viable business case for a comprehensive digital conversion strategy in Canada. At CRTC hearings in 2007 on the future direction of regulatory policy for television, broadcasters proposed a number of strategies, including funding digital conversion by eliminating restrictions on the amount of advertising that television broadcasters are permitted to air, allowing terrestrial broadcasters to charge cable viewers a subscription fee similar to that already charged by cable specialty channels, permitting license fees similar to those which fund the BBC in the United Kingdom, or eliminating terrestrial television broadcasting entirely and moving to an exclusively cable-based distribution model.

In May 2007, the CRTC set August 31, 2011 as the deadline for digital conversion in Canada. This is approximately two years later than the cutoff date in the United States. The CRTC ultimately decided to relax restrictions on advertising as the funding mechanism. However, a CRTC statement issued in June 2008 indicated that as of that date, only 22 digital transmitters had been fully installed across the entire country, and expressed the regulator&#x27;s concern that Canada&#x27;s television broadcasters were not adequately preparing for the shift to digital broadcasting.

===Cable television===
Cable television is a very common method of television programming delivery in Canada. By 1997, already 77% of Canadian homes subscribed to a cable television service. Vancouver, with 93% of its homes connected to cable, had one of the highest cable connection rates in the world.

There are currently 739 licensed cable distributors in Canada. This significant decline from over 2,000 just a few years ago is attributable both to major cable companies acquiring smaller distributors and to a recent change in CRTC rules by which independent cable operators with fewer than 2,000 subscribers are no longer required to operate under full CRTC licences. (However, the CRTC does retain some regulatory authority over these operators. This is an exemption granted by the CRTC to previously licensed companies that continue to meet certain conditions, and does &quot;not&quot; mean that anybody can simply set up their own small cable company without CRTC approval.)

Major Canadian cable companies include Rogers, Shaw, Cogeco, Vidéotron and EastLink/Persona. Most Canadian cities are served by only one cable company per market; in the few cities that are served by more than one cable company, each company is restricted to a specific geographical division within the market. For instance, in Hamilton, Cogeco Cable, Rogers Cable and Source Cable are all licensed operators, but each has a monopoly in a specific area of the city.

However, two major companies offer direct broadcast satellite delivery as an alternative to cable: Bell Satellite TV, which is a division of BCE Inc., and Shaw Direct, which is a division of Shaw. &quot;Grey market&quot; DBS dishes can also be obtained from American services such as DirecTV and Dish Network, but as these are not licensed Canadian providers, stores that sell those packages—and users who buy them—are at risk of criminal charges.

In some remote communities in the Territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut), cable delivery is prohibitively costly. As such, similar services are offered through MMDS technology.

An English-language &#x27;basic cable&#x27; package in Canada traditionally includes:

* CTV, CTV Two, Global, City – the major English-language Canadian commercial networks;
* CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé – the English- and French-language CBC networks;
* a provincial educational broadcast undertaking (e.g. TVO in Ontario), if available (not all provinces have one);
* a community channel, produced by the particular cable company, which usually includes public affairs and information programming as well as community events listings (c.f. public-access television in the United States);
* APTN – a network devoted to Aboriginal programming;
* TVA – one of the two private French-language broadcasters in Quebec;
* nearby independent channels or channels from smaller television systems such as Omni Television or Yes TV;
* CPAC – a channel that broadcasts parliamentary sessions and committee meetings, along with some political public-affairs programming;
* a similar channel to CPAC, but broadcasting the proceedings of the provincial legislature;
* network affiliates (typically from the nearest major American city) of ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and PBS;
* a mixture of Canadian and American special-interest channels (e.g. TSN, MuchMusic, CNN, CTV News Channel, Showcase).

A further set of Canadian and American special-interest channels are offered as &#x27;extended cable&#x27; packages, which are available for additional fees. In the past, cable companies have engaged in the controversial practice of negative option billing, in which a subscriber is automatically given and billed for the new services unless he or she specifically declines them, but this is now illegal.

A package of &#x27;pay TV&#x27; channels is also available for additional fees, including movie networks such as Crave TV, Movie Central, Super Channel, and Super Écran; and American superstations such as WSBK, WPIX, WGN, and KTLA (which are often affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV.) These services, however, require a descrambler box.

A study in 2006 said that the CRTC had licensed 44 digital specialty services and 5 ethnic specialty- and pay-television services across the country.

Cable companies now offer digital cable packages in most Canadian cities, including a number of channels which have been licensed exclusively for digital package distribution. Digital cable also typically includes a range of audio broadcast services such as Galaxie and Max Trax. In some markets, digital cable service may also include local radio stations; where this is offered, it has largely &quot;replaced&quot; the availability of cable FM service. Digital cable, however, is provided only if a customer chooses to subscribe to that package. As of 2016, cable companies are also now required to offer a &quot;skinny basic&quot; option, whereby a small selection of channels typically the main over-the-air networks, along with &quot;public service&quot; channels such as The Weather Network and CPAC are packaged for a maximum fee of $25 with additional channels available on a pick and pay basis at the subscriber&#x27;s discretion. Although this package has had some popularity, the traditional larger and more expensive cable packages remain the dominant subscription mode.

Although this is sometimes controversial, Canadian cable companies are required by the CRTC to practise simultaneous substitution when a Canadian channel and a non-Canadian channel (which is usually American) are airing the same program at the same time. Programming on an American service may also be blocked if it has significant bearing on a Canadian legal matter (e.g., one episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, inspired by the trials of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, was blocked in Canada) or if it interferes with a Canadian channel&#x27;s broadcast rights (such as &quot;James Bond&quot; movies airing on Spike TV; the Canadian broadcast rights are held by Bell Media.)

Many cable companies also offer high speed cable Internet service.

=== Notes ===
==Radio==

The first radio broadcast station in Canadian history was WXA in Montreal, later called CINW. The first broadcast was on May 20, 1920. Canada&#x27;s first national radio network was established by a railway; the national radio was a product of the CNR, a state agency. Through this national radio, its creators saw a way of fostering and promoting immigration, enhancing the image of radio, and supporting the nation through communication with large groups of listeners.

Canada is served by approximately 2,000 radio stations, on both the AM and FM bands.

As with television stations, radio callsigns in Canada are made up of four letters beginning with the two-letter combinations of &quot;CF&quot;, &quot;CH&quot;, &quot;CI&quot;, &quot;CJ&quot;, or &quot;CK&quot;, although a few stations use three-letter callsigns. In addition to private stations CKX and CKY, some CBC stations have three-letter callsigns, generally in major cities where the stations first aired in the 1930s. Newer CBC stations have normal four-letter callsigns, however. As with CBC television, CBC radio uses callsigns beginning with &quot;CB&quot;, through a special arrangement with the government of Chile. A few exceptions, such as CKSB in Winnipeg and CJBC in Toronto, exist where the CBC acquired an existing station with a historically significant callsign.

The combinations &quot;CG&quot;, &quot;CY&quot;, &quot;CZ&quot; and several combinations beginning with &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are also assigned to Canada. Only four Canadian radio stations, all in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, have taken call signs in those ranges. Three of these stations, VOAR, VOWR and VOCM, began broadcasting before Newfoundland was a Canadian province, and retained their &quot;VO&quot; call letters when Newfoundland joined Canadian Confederation in 1949. The other station, VOCM-FM, adopted the callsign in 1981 because of its ownership association with VOCM. With the exception of VOCM-FM, radio stations licensed in Newfoundland after 1949 use the same &quot;CF&quot;-&quot;CK&quot; range as other Canadian stations.

The future of &quot;VO&quot; callsigns in Canada is unknown. It would not be at all unusual for Industry Canada to simplify all callsigns used in Canada as part of the ongoing modernization and simplification of domestic telecom regulations.

There is no clear rule for the call letters of repeater stations—some repeaters are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters VE or VF followed by four numbers.

As of 2020, the four largest major commercial radio broadcast groups in Canada are Stingray Group, Rogers Radio, Corus Radio, and Bell Media Radio. However, many smaller broadcasters operate radio stations as well. Most genres of music are represented on the Canadian commercial radio spectrum, including pop, rock, hip hop, country, jazz and classical. News, sports, talk radio and religious stations are also available in many cities. In addition, many Canadian universities and colleges have licensed campus radio stations, and some communities also have community radio stations or Christian radio stations licensed to non-profit groups or co-operatives. Canada has approximately 14 full-time ethnic radio stations, based primarily in the major metropolitan markets of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.

As well, the publicly owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates four national radio networks, two each in English and French. The English Radio One and the French &quot;Ici Radio-Canada Première&quot; provide news and information programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or FM band. The English CBC Music and French &quot;Ici Musique&quot; provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.

Music-based commercial radio stations in Canada are mandated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to reserve at least 35 per cent of their playlists for Canadian content, although exemptions are granted in some border cities (e.g. Windsor, Ontario) where the competition from American stations threatens the survival of Canadian broadcasters, and for stations whose formats may not have enough Canadian recordings available to meet the 35 per cent target (e.g. classical, jazz or pop standards).

In recent years, a notable trend in Canadian radio has been the gradual abandonment of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the FM band. In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) have a much more pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that cable companies which offer cable FM services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.

Digital audio broadcasting, or DAB, is an emerging technology in Canada. Although many radio stations in major metropolitan markets offer digital subchannels with distinct programming from the primary station, not many consumers yet own digital radios and digital broadcasting is usually not available in midsized or small markets. No Canadian radio broadcaster currently operates exclusively in DAB format.

On November 1, 2004, the CRTC began hearing applications for satellite radio services. Three applications were filed: one by XM Radio Canada, one by Sirius Canada, and one by the partnership of CHUM Limited and Astral Media. These services, which were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005, were Canada&#x27;s first official satellite radio services, although a small &quot;grey market&quot; already existed for American satellite radio receivers. Sirius and XM both launched in December 2005. The CHUM-Astral service, however, was never launched, and its license expired on June 16, 2007; CHUM stated that its business plan was based in part on the expectation that in the interests of Canadian content, the CRTC would have rejected the Sirius and XM applications, approving &quot;only&quot; the CHUM-Astral service. The two active services, XM and Sirius, merged into Sirius XM Canada in 2011, several months after a similar merger between their American counterparts.

The consensus about radio in Canada as well as in most parts of the world is that it is a dying medium. With innovations such as television and the Internet, which have allowed for audio communication paired with visual, there has been less need for radio. Furthermore, the introduction of personalized and portable listening devices (namely mp3 players) have replaced bulkier radios for many. Whereas Internet advertising revenues have steadily increased over recent years, advertising revenue for radio only increased by about 1.5 percent from 2006 to 2007, and this rate is likely to be even smaller now. However, it is not fair to assume that radio is going to become obsolete in the near future; new forms, including online and satellite radio, have been introduced which provide new benefits for listeners. The fact that the radio industry has been able to hold its ground for so many years after the introduction of television is a testament to its longevity.

==Newspapers==
The first period of Canadian journalism spanned from 1752–1807; the second period spanned from 1807–1858; the third period spanned from 1858–1900; the fourth period spans from the beginning of the twentieth century to current day. The first period consisted of newspapers brought and inserted into Canadian society by colonies in New England. The first was the Halifax Gazette, issued on March 23, 1752. The second period began as settlers arrived from Britain and the United States; newspapers began to gain popularity in the Maritime regions. During the third period, the discovery of gold brought settlers to the Pacific Coast region, and there was a growing interest in domestic affairs. Finally, the twentieth century saw a substantial change in Canadian newspapers. After the two world wars, as well as the industrial developments that followed these wars, the circulation of French and English newspapers in Canada increased to more than 5.7 million in 1989. By the mid-1980s, there were 110 daily newspapers. Nowadays, there are 105.

Although online readership has been on the rise, studies by NADbank show that print readership is &quot;business as usual.&quot; Nearly 8 in 10 Canadians read a daily newspaper each week, and print readership continues to grow at about 2 percent each year. However, website readership is growing faster, at a rate of 4 percent. Although print readership is currently larger, website readership is growing at a faster rate, suggesting that a takeover is possible in the future. The baby boomer generation, who are over 50 years old, continue to prefer print to online journalism, while younger adults are more likely to read online newspapers due to easier access and limits on time. Furthermore, paid daily newspapers dominate the market but free dailies are gaining popularity in recent times. Advertisers continue to rely on print newspapers to reach Canadians in their home or work environments. For these reasons, print newspapers as a mass medium do not seem to be dying in Canada. They might not be as healthy as they were without any competition from online sources, but they are holding their own ground, according to Statistics Canada.

Canada currently has two major national newspapers: &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and &quot;National Post&quot;. Though not widely read outside Quebec, &quot;Le Devoir&quot; is the French-language counterpart to the national newspapers. The newspaper with the highest circulation overall is the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, while the newspaper with the highest readership per capita is the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; (with the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; running a very close second).

In addition, almost all Canadian cities are served by at least one daily newspaper, along with community and neighbourhood weeklies. In large cities that have more than one daily newspaper, usually at least one daily is a tabloid format; bilingual cities like Montreal and Ottawa have important papers in both French and English.

Canadian newspapers are mostly owned by large chains. At various times there have been concerns about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, as well as more recently when Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger acquired Southam Newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased by a variety of new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for the first time in many years.

Additionally, the 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of city-based alternative weekly newspapers, geared toward a younger audience with coverage of the arts and alternative news. In recent years, many of these weeklies have also been acquired or driven out of business by conglomerates like Canwest, Quebecor and Brunswick News. Smaller newspapers like &quot;The Dominion&quot;, publishing primarily online but in a newspaper format, have attempted to fill gaps in Canada&#x27;s journalistic coverage while avoiding the vulnerabilities of the previous generation of alternative media.

In the 2000s, a number of online news and culture magazines also launched with the goal of providing alternative sources of journalism. Some important online publications include &quot;rabble.ca&quot;, &quot;The Tyee&quot;, &quot;The Vancouver Observer&quot;, and &quot;SooToday.com&quot;. Similarly, as of 2006, Canada had over 250 ethnic newspapers.

The late 2010s have seen an expansion in online news partisan outlets with ties to the major political parties in Canada, such as &quot;North99&quot; with the Liberal Party, &quot;The Post Millennial&quot; with the Conservatives, and &quot;PressProgress&quot; with the NDP have received attention though their massive mostly social-based following.

==Films==
Given Canada&#x27;s small market and its position next to the United States—the dominant producer of feature films—the Canadian film industry receives substantial assistance from the government. In the 2000s, about half of the budget of a typical Canadian film came from various federal and provincial government sources.

According to the Canadian Encyclopedia:
&quot;The first Canadian films were produced in the fall of 1897, a year after the first public exhibition of motion pictures on 27 June 1896 in Montréal. They were made by James Freer, a Manitoba farmer, and depicted life on the Prairies. In 1898–99, the Canadian Pacific Railway showed them throughout the UK to promote immigration. They were so successful that the federal government sponsored a second tour by Freer in 1902 and the CPR began directly financing production of immigration films.&quot;

Most of Canada&#x27;s film (and television) industry produces output geared towards mainstream North American audiences, with Entertainment One and Elevation Pictures in particular enjoying significant successes in recent years. Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver are major production centres, with Vancouver being the second largest film and television production centre in North America (after Los Angeles). The Toronto International Film Festival is considered one of the most important events in North American cinema, showcasing both Canadian talent and Hollywood films.

According to an article in the Toronto Star, the Canadian film industry has always had problems with creating a popular culture because of the shadow of the United States&#x27; film industry. For this reason, Canadian films have failed due to a lack of an export market. Canadian actors frequently relocate to Hollywood to further their careers. Also, unlike radio and television, there is no protection for Canadian content in movie theatres. It is clear that Hollywood movies are a lot more popular in Canada than Canadian-made movies. As a whole, the film industry (Hollywood) continues to make substantial profits in Canada as well as around the world; it can, therefore, be said that the medium is not dying.

Alliance was by far the largest and most successful Canadian film studio, both as a film and television production house (the company&#x27;s television properties include &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; and &quot;&quot;), and as the major Canadian distributor of independent American and international films. On January 9, 2013, the company was acquired by Entertainment One.

Canada also produces films of a characteristically &quot;Canadian&quot; nature, and of all Canadian cultural industries, the English-Canadian segment of the film industry has the hardest time escaping the shadow of its (North) American counterpart. Between the marketing budgets of mainstream films, and the largely American-controlled film distribution networks, it has been nearly impossible for most distinctively English-Canadian films to break through to a wide audience. In many Canadian cities, in fact, moviegoers do not even have the &quot;option&quot; of seeing such films, as there are no theatres screening them. As a result, a Canadian film is usually considered a runaway hit if it makes as little as $1 million at the box office.

French-Canadian films, on the other hand, are often more successful—as with French-language television, the language difference makes Quebec audiences much more receptive to Canadian-produced film. In many years, the top-grossing Canadian film is a French-language production from Quebec.

As a result of the economic challenges involved in Canadian film production, film funding is often provided by government bodies such as Telefilm Canada, and television services such as CBC Television, Crave or Super Channel are often a Canadian film&#x27;s most lucrative potential market. However, there is an established network of film festivals which also provide important marketing and audience opportunities for Canadian films. In addition to the Toronto International Film Festival, the smaller Vancouver International Film Festival features films from around the world, and other major festivals in Montréal, Calgary, Edmonton and Greater Sudbury—among other cities—are also important opportunities for Canadian filmmakers to gain exposure among more populist film audiences.

One particular film production house, the National Film Board of Canada, has become internationally famous for its animation and documentary production.

==Publishing==
===Books===
The first incident of printing in Canada came in 1752 with the Halifax Gazette. The history of the printed book is slightly different. In 1761, Anton Heinrich took over John Bushell&#x27;s printing shop in Halifax. James Rivingston, a member of a family involved with bookselling and stationery in London, advertised a large stock of books and stationery for sale in Halifax. The first printing shop was established in 1764 by William Brown and Thomas Gilmore in Quebec. The earliest recorded almanac published in Canada was , printed by Brown and Gilmore in 1765.

There are many who think that with the introduction of the Internet and e-reading, the printed book is on the decline for reasons of practicality; e-readers (such as the Kindle and Kobo) allow one to carry many books at once, are as portable as printed books, and provide instantaneous access to books (as opposed to having to search for printed books in a store). They can also be interactive, containing audio and image components and allowing readers to change font styles to suit their own preference.

Certain people think that despite the introduction of e-books, the printed book is not a dying medium. The death of the book was predicted with the advent of radio, then film, then with television, and more recently with the Internet. Because of its history of perseverance, some people have hope that it will survive despite the e-book&#x27;s various advantages. More people around the world have access to books in printed form than to computers. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that reading off of a screen for long periods of time is less comfortable in the long run than reading print off of a page. For these reasons, whether or not the printed book is a dying medium in Canada can be debated either way; however, for now it seems that they are surviving and adapting (for example, through the use of more attractive graphics) despite such competition.

Canada is home to a robust book publishing industry that operates in both official languages.

English Language Publishers In Canada

* McClelland and Stewart
* which made its name in the 1970s as the leading publisher of English language Canadian literature. English Canada also has many smaller publishing houses, including Coach House Press, the Porcupine&#x27;s Quill, House of Anansi, Key Porter Books, Hidden Brook Press, and Douglas &amp; McIntyr
Foreign Publishers With Branches In Canada

Major francophone publishers in Quebec include Bibliothèque québécoise, Alire, Québec-Amérique, Éditions Guérin and Groupe Beauchemin. Several small francophone publishers also operate outside of Quebec, including Éditions Le Nordir and Prise de parole.

Canada&#x27;s largest English science fiction genre publisher is EDGE Science Fiction and Fantasy Publishing. EDGE now also owns the Tesseract Books imprint, which is well known for producing excellent Canadian speculative fiction.

===Magazines===

The first Canadian periodicals were established in Nova Scotia by people from New England. The first Canadian magazine was called &quot;Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature, Politics, and News&quot;. It was edited by William Cochran and printed by John Howe. Publication began in 1789 and lasted three years. This magazine dealt mostly with affairs concerning the British public, despite its being published at a time of colonization in Canada. After this first publication, most magazines over the next fifty years in Canada only lasted a few years, often only a few months. The first ever bilingual magazine, published in 1792, was entitled &quot;Le Magasin de Québec&quot;; it was published by Samuel Neilson. Journalist and historian Michel Bibaud published &quot;La Bibliothèque Canadienne&quot; from 1825 to 1830, and John Lovell published the &quot;Literary Garland&quot; from 1838 to 1851. These were the most well-known exceptions to the rule that magazines lasted only a few years. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the pace of magazine publishing in Canada picked up significantly. George Desbarats launched &quot;Canadian Illustrated News&quot; in 1869 and it lasted until 1883. &quot;Canadian Illustrated News&quot; was closely identified with a new emerging sense of Canadian nationalism, like other magazines of the time. Through the use of many pictures, Desbarats felt that the magazine would instill a sense of pride in readers for their Canadian name and society.

According to David Renard, &quot;Over the next 10 years, the magazine industry will experience deep-rooted change from primarily a print-oriented business to one where digital products will represent the largest share of a smaller periodical industry. We expect digital to be the primary source of revenue for magazines past the 2016–2017 time frame.&quot; He claims that although print is not dead, the magazine industry might become obsolete. Although he is referring to periodicals in the United States, similar patterns exist in Canada, since over ninety percent of the most popular periodicals sold in Canada are American. Some say that magazines are evolving rather than dying; they are adapting to new technology by creating online versions. For example, iPad versions of magazines have been created recently. However, this still implies that the printed medium of periodicals is dying while online versions are gaining popularity.

A notable controversy in Canadian magazine publishing in recent years has been the existence of &quot;split run&quot; magazines, where a title published in another country, such as &quot;TIME&quot; or &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, is republished in Canada with a few pages of special Canadian content, in order to take advantage of Canadian advertising sales revenues. The government of Canada imposed a special excise tax on split run publications in 1995 to discourage the practice, although this continues to be controversial.

==Online media==

In the 1950s and 1960s, with the creation of computers, is where the history of the Internet begins. In 1969 came the invention of ARPANET, the first network to run on packet-switching technology. These were the first hosts on what would one day become the Internet. The concept of email was first created by Ray Tomlinson in 1971, and this innovation was followed by Project Gutenberg and eBooks. Tim Berners-Lee is considered the inventor of the World Wide Web; he implemented the first successful communication between a HyperText Transfer Protocol client and a server.

Because the Internet allowed users ease of access to information about practically any topic, the medium has seen immense popularity ever since its inception. There has never been a point in its relatively short history (it has only been around for about 40 years) when it has declined in popularity. Of all mass media discussed, it seems to be the least threatened. There are various reasons for this: firstly, the Internet provides for its audiences a compilation of almost everything that other electronic media provide, in one convenient medium (a computer). For example, one can watch television shows, films, and listen to the radio online. There is little need for separate devices when everything is available in one. Secondly, the Internet allows for portability and accessibility of information. One no longer has to go to the library for information or go to a theatre in order to watch a film. Thirdly, most content on the Internet is available for free, which makes it more convenient for users. The foremost priority for the Internet has always been to better communication, and it does provide easy and fast communication through email, chat rooms, and online communities; it is also interactive in these ways. There are, however, disadvantages of this medium which do not exist in other electronic media: potential theft of personal information, spamming, and unwanted explicit content. However, as all of these disadvantages can be blocked through the use of protection software, they are not enough to override its advantages. For this reason, the Internet seems to be a healthy and thriving medium to this day in Canada as well as around the world.

The rise of online media platforms has inevitably disrupted the need for print media consumption. The concern, however, lies in whether or not these online platforms, whether hyperlocal or national, have appropriate practices to enforce standard journalism practices in place, avoiding situations of &#x27;fake news&#x27;. For example, some platforms have been known to use scare-tactics to drive web traffic.

<doc id="183182" wikidata="Q901608" url="?curid=183182" title="Usagi Yojimbo">
<text>is a comic book series created by Stan Sakai. It is set primarily at the beginning of the Edo period of Japanese history and features anthropomorphic animals replacing humans. The main character is a rabbit &quot;rōnin&quot;, Miyamoto Usagi, whom Sakai based partially on the famous swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. Usagi wanders the land on a &quot;musha shugyō&quot; (warrior&#x27;s pilgrimage), occasionally selling his services as a bodyguard.

&quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; is heavily influenced by Japanese cinema; it has included references to the work of Akira Kurosawa (the title of the series is derived from Kurosawa&#x27;s 1961 film &quot;Yojimbo&quot;), as well as to icons of popular Japanese cinema, such as Lone Wolf and Cub, Zatoichi, and Godzilla. The series is also influenced somewhat by &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot; by Sergio Aragonés (Sakai is the letterer for that series), but the overall tone of &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; is more serious and reflective. The series follows the standard traditional Japanese naming-convention for all featured characters: their family names followed by their given names.

The books are primarily episodic, with underlying larger plots which create long extended storylines, though there are some novel-length narratives. The stories include many references to Japanese history and Japanese folklore, and sometimes include mythical creatures. The architecture, clothes, weapons and other objects are drawn with a faithfulness to period style. There are often stories whose purpose is to illustrate various elements of Japanese arts and crafts, such as the fashioning of kites, swords, and pottery. Those efforts have been successful enough for the series to be awarded a Parents&#x27; Choice Award in 1990 for its educational value through Sakai&#x27;s &quot;skillful weaving of facts and legends into his work.&quot;

&quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; first appeared in &quot;Albedo Anthropomorphics&quot; #2, published by Thoughts and Images in November 1984. Early positive reviews and an advertisement in Bud Plant&#x27;s Spring Catalog in 1985 helped propel the character&#x27;s popularity. Stan Sakai accepted an offer to move his warrior rabbit to Fantagraphics Books where he appeared in several issues of the new anthropomorphic anthology series &quot;Critters&quot;. Usagi&#x27;s popularity influenced Fantagraphics to then release the &quot;Usagi Yojimbo Summer Special&quot; in October 1986 and then to give the &quot;ronin&quot; rabbit his own ongoing series with issue #1 being published in July 1987. Usagi was named the 31st-greatest comic book character by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine and was ranked 92nd in IGN&#x27;s list of the top 100 comic book heroes. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Usagi Yojimbo no. 43 in their &#x27;50 Best Non-Superhero Graphic Novels&#x27;.

==Publishing history==
Sakai originally planned for Usagi and other characters to be human in stories explicitly modeled after the life of Miyamoto Musashi. However, once as Sakai was idly doodling, he drew rabbit ears tied in a topknot on his proposed hero and was pleased by the distinctive image. Usagi was first conceived as a supporting character in &quot;The Adventures of Nilson Groundthumper and Hermy&quot;, a brief series that predates &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;. Sakai expanded on the idea of a rabbit samurai and his world took on an anthropomorphized cartoon nature, creating a fantasy setting which suited his dramatic needs with a unique look he thought could attract readers.

Usagi first appeared in the anthology &quot;Albedo Anthropomorphics&quot; in 1984, and later in the Fantagraphics Books anthropomorphic anthology &quot;Critters&quot;, before appearing in his own series in 1987. The &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; series has been published by four different companies. The first publisher was Fantagraphics (volume one; 38 regular issues, plus one &quot;Summer Special&quot; and three &quot;Color Specials&quot;). The second was Mirage Comics (volume two; 16 issues). The third was Dark Horse Comics (volume three, 172 regular issues and two &quot;Color Specials&quot;), which also published the &quot;Senso&quot; miniseries (2015), &quot;The Art of Usagi Yojimbo: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2004), and &quot;Usagi Yojimbo: 35 Years of Covers (2018)&quot;, as well as republishing the Fantagraphics and Mirage series. The fourth is IDW Publishing, (volume four, 31 issues), which also republished select Fantagraphics story portions as &quot;Usagi Yojimbo Color Classics&quot;. Usagi returned to Dark Horse in September 2023, collaborating with Dogu Limited. Another publisher, Radio Comix, published two issues of &quot;The Art of Usagi Yojimbo&quot; (1997–1998) which contained a selection of unpublished drawings, convention sketches, and other miscellaneous &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; artwork (including an original short story in the first issue).

Because &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; is a creator-owned comic and Sakai has complete and sole ownership of the character, Miyamoto Usagi has been able to appear in occasional short stories published by companies other than the one currently publishing his series. Usagi has appeared in stories published by Cartoon Books, Oni Press, Sky Dog Press, Wizard Press, and most recently in the benefit book &quot;Drawing the Line&quot;, the proceeds of which went to Princess Margaret Hospital and The Hospital for Sick Children, both in Toronto, for cancer research.

Sakai has experimented with formats for &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, such as when he published the color story &quot;Green Persimmon&quot; first as twelve separate 2-page chapters serialized in Diamond Comic Distributor&#x27;s monthly catalog &quot;Previews&quot;. He has also serialized two short stories in a comic strip format in the tabloid-size promotional publication &quot;Dark Horse Extra&quot;. &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; stories have also been created as both single-page &quot;gag&quot; stories and as multi-issue epic adventures.

Usagi has also appeared several times in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (the comic, three of the animated series, and their respective toy lines), and the Turtles have appeared in &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; as well. In the 1987 series, &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; is incorrectly used as his actual name, but in the 2003 series, where he appeared far more frequently, he was referred to correctly as Miyamoto Usagi. He was even joined by Gen and other characters from his stories in his guest appearances in the 2003 series. Usagi&#x27;s first appearance in the 2012 series was the fifth-season episode, &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, which was written by Sakai. In his guest appearances, he is closest to Leonardo, both sharing the same ideals and code of ethics. The comics version also makes several pun references to Sergio Aragonés&#x27; &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;, in whose publication Sakai was also involved.

In addition, Sakai created a limited spin off series called &quot;Space Usagi,&quot; who first appeared in &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; 187. It featured characters similar to those in the original series, including a descendant of Miyamoto Usagi, but set in a futuristic setting that also emulated feudal Japan in political and stylistic ways. Four mini-series of three issues each and two short stories featuring the characters were produced. Sakai has announced tentative plans to produce a fourth &quot;Space Usagi&quot; miniseries, but nothing has been announced yet. A one-shot crossover between the contemporary &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; (Volume 4) series and &quot;Space Usagi&quot;, titled &quot;Space Usagi: Yokai Hunter&quot;, was released on October 11, 2023.

In the summer of 2014, Sakai, after a two-year hiatus, returned with a six-issue mini-series entitled &quot;Usagi Yojimbo: Senso&quot;. &quot;Senso&quot;, Japanese for &quot;war&quot;, refers to &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel about Martians invading Earth. &quot;Senso&quot; tells the story of Martians invading Japan roughly twenty years after the events of the main series of &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;, and also forms a plot bridge to the previously published &quot;Space Usagi&quot;.

In May 2015, Sakai returned to &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; with the release of the 145th issue.

On February 22, 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that IDW Publishing would present a new monthly &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; series, in color (provided by Tom Luth for the first time). The new series opens up with a short story arc about the Japanese puppetry art of bunraku. Additionally, new full-color collections of earlier issues are planned. IDW published volume 4 of the series up until issue 31, published in 2022. Sakai returned the series to Dark Horse under his own new imprint, Dogu Publishing. The series was relaunched at Dark Horse with &quot;Usagi Yojimbo: Ice and Snow&quot; #1, the first in a five issue mini-series.

In July 2017, the traditional crossovers between &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; and the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; franchise - at that time part also part of IDW&#x27;s publishing program - were resumed with a one-shot comic titled &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Usagi Yojimbo&quot;. In April 2023, publication was started on the five-issue miniseries &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles/Usagi Yojimbo: WhereWhen&quot;, which is an immediate prelude to &quot;Senso&quot; and once again co-stars the Ninja Turtles.

In 2024, Boom Studios and Dark Horse Comics published a one-shot crossover featuring Usagi meeting the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

==In other media==

===Television===

Usagi first appeared in episodes 32 and 34 in the third season of the 1987 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series. He next appeared in episodes 23–26 in the second season of the 2003 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; animated series for an interdimensional tournament against the Turtles (along with Gen). He and Gen showed up again in episodes 1 and 22–23 of season 3 for a Christmas party and a continuation of the second-season storyline (which prominently featured his world and characters), respectively. Usagi again appeared in episode 13 of season 4 (&quot;Samurai Tourist&quot;) for a confrontation with Leonardo, although the focus was mainly on Gen. Usagi and Gen also attended the wedding of April O&#x27;Neil and Casey Jones in episode 13 of season 7 (&quot;Back to the Sewer&quot;) titled &quot;Wedding Bells and Bytes&quot;. He becomes one of their greatest inter-dimensional allies and especially closest to Leonardo.

In September 2016, an appearance of Usagi was also announced for the 2012 CGI series of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. He appears in the fifth season (which is titled &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;) in the episodes &quot;Yojimbo&quot;, &quot;Osoroshi no Tabi&quot;, and &quot;Kagayake! Kintaro&quot;, where the Turtles are hurled into his dimension, and teamed up to save a child he protects from ancient evil.

On February 8, 2018, it was announced that a CGI adaptation of the comics is in the works from Gaumont Animation. On July 15, 2020, Gaumont announced that the series would be released worldwide exclusively on Netflix under the title &quot;Samurai Rabbit: The Usagi Chronicles,&quot; in partnership with Netflix Animation. Production companies Atomic Monster and Dark Horse Entertainment are also partnering with Gaumont, with Mumbai-based studio 88 Pictures handling the CGI animation. Doug and Candie Langdale serve as show-runners on the series. The series takes place in Neo Edo in the 26th century and centers on rabbit teenager Yuichi Usagi (voiced by Darren Barnet), who is the descendant of Miyamoto Usagi. The show premiered on April 28, 2022 and concluded on September 1.

===Video games===

A &quot;Samurai Warrior: The Battles of Usagi Yojimbo&quot; video game was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1988 by Firebird.

Usagi appears as a playable character in the &quot;Dimension Shellshock&quot; downloadable content for &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, released on August 31, 2023.

==Related works==
A project for an animated television series, &quot;Space Usagi&quot;, was cancelled following the failure of &quot;Bucky O&#x27;Hare and the Toad Wars&quot;. However, &quot;Space Usagi&quot; was one of the action figures produced under the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles line.

Two editions of an Usagi role-playing game have been made, a 1998 version, &quot;Usagi Yojimbo Roleplaying Game&quot;, from Gold Rush Games and a 2005 version from Sanguine Productions. A second edition of the 2005 version was successfully Kickstarted in 2019. A Hero Pack of Miyamoto Usagi, Gennosuke and Kitsune will be added to Arcadia Quest.

The comic is the basis of two video games: the 1988 game &quot;Samurai Warrior: The Battles of Usagi Yojimbo&quot; and the 2013 game &quot;Usagi Yojimbo: Way of the Ronin&quot;. Both are side-scrolling hack-and-slash action games.

Usagi returned to the &quot;Turtles&quot; franchise in the 2022 beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, being based on his incarnation from the 1987 cartoon from which the rest of the game is based on. He become available as downloadable content in 2023.

The Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles&#x27;s Little Tokyo presented an exhibit entitled &quot;Year of the Rabbit: Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; from July 9 through October 30, 2011.

Usagi was rated No. 92 on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.

===Film references===

Several of the characters in Usagi&#x27;s world are inspired by or make reference to samurai movies. Usagi&#x27;s former lord is named Mifune, which is a nod to Toshiro Mifune, an actor who starred in countless classic Samurai films. Gen, the rhino bounty hunter, was inspired by the characters made famous by Toshiro Mifune in the samurai films &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro&quot;. Zato-Ino, the Blind Swordspig, is a reference and tribute to the film character of Zatoichi. The story arc &quot;Lone Goat and Kid&quot; features an assassin who wanders with his son in a babycart, referring to the film/manga series &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;. Most significantly, the main character&#x27;s name, Miyamoto Usagi, is a play on &quot;Miyamoto Musashi&quot;, Japan&#x27;s most famous historical samurai and the author of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;, and &quot;Usagi&quot; the Japanese language word for &quot;rabbit&quot; (The story notes for one volume also cite as an influence Hiroshi Inagaki&#x27;s Samurai Trilogy, which features Miyamoto Musashi as a protagonist.) His friend Tomoe Ame, a feline samurai, is inspired by the female samurai Tomoe Gozen. The storyline &quot;The Dragon Bellow Conspiracy&quot; includes elements reminiscent of the classic Akira Kurosawa films &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; and &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, particularly the way that Usagi collects various allies to raid an evil lord&#x27;s fortress.

While &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; draws most heavily upon samurai and chanbara films, it has also been influenced by Japanese films from other genres. For example, the three-part story &quot;Sumi-E&quot; (included in Vol. 18. &quot;Travels with Jotaro&quot;) features monsters resembling Godzilla (identified as &quot;Zylla&quot;, who was first introduced in Vol. 2. &quot;Samurai&quot;), Gamera, Ghidorah, Mothra, and Daimajin.

<text>Denton is a town in Tameside, Greater Manchester, England, five miles (8 km) east of Manchester city centre. Historically part of Lancashire, it had a population of 36,591 at the 2011 Census.

== History ==

===Toponymy===
Denton probably derives its name from Dane-town, an etymology supported by other place names in the area such as Danehead-bank and Daneditch-bourne. The word &#x27;Dane&#x27; is itself derived from Anglo-Saxon &quot;denu&quot;, &quot;dene&quot;, &quot;daenland&quot;, meaning a valley. So literally Denton means valley town.

===Prehistory===
A Byzantine coin was discovered in Danesheadbank, dating from the sixth or seventh century, as part of the Denton coin hoard. The early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch passes through Denton; it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th centuries. A 300 m stretch is still visible on Denton golf course, about 4 m wide and 1.5 m deep.

===Middle Ages===
In the early 13th century it lay within the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate which also encompassed the townships of Withington, Didsbury, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Moss Side, Rusholme, Burnage and Haughton, ruled by the Hathersage, Longford, Mosley and Tatton families.

===Hat industry===
Felt hatting was recorded in Denton as early as 1702 and Denton gained supremacy in the hatting industry towards the end of the 19th century. The increasing importance of Denton and Haughton as centres of felt hat production is demonstrated by the increase of manufacturers in the area: in 1800 there were 4 hatting firms in Denton and Haughton, but by 1825 there were 25 manufacturers, making it the third largest hat making centre in the north west. By 1840, 24,000 felt hats were produced in Denton a week. The prosperity of the hatting industry is reflected in the growth of the town from 2,501 in 1801 to 6,759 in 1841.

During the 1840s, the felt hat industry went into depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages in the area falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of the felt hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also the increased use of machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton&#x27;s felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in the felt hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.

Although the felt hat industry in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and an integral part of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk free. One of the problems workers faced was mercury poisoning; mercury was used to separate the fur from the rabbit hide and workers were in regular contact with fur impregnated with mercury or exposed to mercury vapour. Inadequate ventilation in some parts of the hat making process led to other sorts of dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson &amp; Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The explosion was of vapour from methylated spirits used in the dying process.

Throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century, a wide range of hats was manufactured to suit all tastes and purses. The names used by the competing manufacturers to describe their products was bewildering and some of these were; felt hats, silk hats, fur hats, wear fur hats, soft hats, stiff hats, velour hats, wool hats, straw hats and, of course, the ubiquitous cloth cap. In the 1930s the &#x27;Attaboy&#x27; trilby hat was introduced by the Denton Hat Company. This brand quickly became famous and it was in production for many years. Ladies&#x27; hats were not forgotten either and at least one works specialised in making these and the hat master&#x27;s wife designed them at home. Hats were made for home consumption and for export. The well-known slogan &quot;&quot;If you want to get ahead, get a hat&quot; arose in Denton and, needless to say, anyone attending for a job interview not wearing a hat was quickly shown the door. Similarly, until the early 20th century, anyone entering a Denton shop without a hat would receive much cursing. The term, &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;&quot; also arose in Denton because the mercury used in the felting process led to mercury poisoning.

In 2003, the prominent Wilson&#x27;s Hat Factory on Wilton Street, together with the adjacent mill-workers&#x27; houses, other factories, Wilton Street Chapel and Mainstream Studios was demolished to make way for a new retail shopping park &#x27;Crown Point North&#x27;.

=== Coal mining ===

Denton is on the Lancashire coalfield and once had a number of collieries. These included the Ellis Colliery (which became Denton Colliery), Top Pit, Hard Mine Pit and, further south and near to the River Tame, Hulmes Pit. Much of the coal that they produced was consumed by local industry, there being an abundance of steam powered mills in the area.

Denton Colliery was the largest of these mines and eventually absorbed the other local pits, often using their shafts for ventilation or, in the case of Hulmes Pit, as a pumping station to drain water from the main workings. Denton Colliery was connected to the London &amp; North Western Railway&#x27;s line from Guide Bridge to Stockport by a standard gauge tramway. The tramway was worked by steam power, rather than horses, as evidenced by a photograph held in the Tameside Local History Library archives.

In 1926, miners at Denton Colliery joined the national strike against reduced wages and longer working hours. This dispute led to the General Strike (3–12 May 1926). When the General Strike was called off, coal miners stayed out for several more months.

As the strike started to crumble, miners at Denton Colliery remained steadfast, not returning to work until 5 November 1926, some 6 weeks and one day after their colleagues at the nearby Ashton Moss Colliery, the only other significant colliery left in Tameside at that time. They returned to face longer working hours and their pre-strike rates of pay.

Unfortunately, months without maintenance during the strike had taken their toll on many coal mines. Denton Colliery had flooded to the extent that it was no longer workable and the Denton Colliery Co. went into voluntary liquidation in 1929. The headstock was demolished in 1932 and the shaft was finally filled and capped in 1974.

Some traces of Denton Colliery can still be found. The colliery offices on Stockport Road still stand and are now the showroom of a company of monumental stonemasons. Behind the office building is a small section of wall from the colliery. On the opposite side of the road and slightly nearer to Crown Point is the building that once housed the local mines rescue station, now two private houses. Two miner&#x27;s cottages, much altered and now converted into one house, stand near the junction of Stockport Road and Cemetery Road. The foundations of Hulmes Pit were excavated in the early 1970s and can still be seen. Parts of the track bed of the tramway to Denton Colliery can still be traced, both on modern maps and on the ground, as can traces of a canal, known as the Beat Bank Branch, intended to link local collieries to the Stockport branch of the Ashton Canal at Reddish, which was partially built and then abandoned.

=== Oldham Batteries ===
After hatting, the most important industry in Denton was the manufacture of lead-acid batteries by Oldham Batteries (Oldham &amp; Son Ltd). In 1865, Joseph Oldham established a millwright general engineering shop and by 1887 this company was manufacturing machinery for the hat-making industry. Another important industry in the area was coal mining and shortly after 1887 the company began making machinery and equipment for this industry, which included miners&#x27; portable lamps. Up to this time, miners had always used the safety lamp devised in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) but this new battery-powered Davy lamp eventually replaced the traditional safety lamp.

In 1920, the manufacture of automotive batteries for commercial vehicles, cars and motorcycles commenced and over the years this business expanded into the manufacture of traction batteries, which also included submarine batteries.

Nonetheless, the company never converted exclusively to the manufacture of batteries and they still continued to make machinery for the hatting industry, general engineering equipment, portable lamps and lighting systems as well as helmet-lamps and other related equipment for the mining industry. It also produced attachments for the mechanical handling industry.

Oldham Batteries became a major Denton employer with over 1,000 employees, but by the beginning of 2002 the decision to close the factory had been made. The factory, which used to be off Lime Grove, Denton, is no longer there. It has been demolished, and a planning application for a further housing and a Wellness centre agreed, the latter of which was completed and opened in early 2020. The housing is still currently (as of 2022) being built. Both of these projects required considerable clean up of the ground, given the previous use and the associated lead and other chemical contamination.

==Governance==

===Civic history and councillors===
Denton was originally one of the townships of the ancient parish of Manchester in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire. In 1866 it became a civil parish in its own right. The parish was expanded in 1894 by the inclusion of the Haughton township, the former area of which now covers the eastern part of the town. The name of Haughton survives as local place names at Haughton Green and Haughton Dale, both in south Denton. Clues to the former township do still exist at Haughton Street, Haughton Hall Road, the Parish Church of St. Anne, Haughton, and etched onto an ancient boundary marker on Broomstair Bridge on the A57 Hyde Road – (CHESHIRE Township of Hyde | Township of Haughton LANCASHIRE). Also in 1894 the enlarged parish became Denton Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire.

In 1974 Denton&#x27;s Urban District status was abolished and its assets and area were transferred to form part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Tameside in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

Since 1974, Denton has consisted of three council wards on Tameside Council; Denton North East, Denton South and Denton West, each returning three councillors. The new wards took the same format as the original six Denton UDC wards (which were East, North, South-east, South, South-west and West). There have been minor ward boundary changes in 1982 and 2004. Denton West is the most Conservative-inclined of the three wards, and from 1975 to 1991 had Conservative Party representation. No Conservative councillor has been elected since 1987 in the town, although the party came within 13 votes of re-gaining the Denton West seat in 2008 on the back of government unpopularity over the abolition of the 10p tax rate and the proposals for a congestion charge in Greater Manchester with the proposed outer charging zone cutting the ward in two.

After the most recent local elections held in May 2022, the nine councillors for the town are:


Since 1998 there has been a degree of devolution, with District Assemblies established in the Tameside townships and consisting of the councillors and an advisory group. Assembly meetings are open to the public. Each Assembly has a town manager and devolved staff and budgets to deal with local services such as grounds maintenance, road repairs, parks, Britain in Bloom, community events, youth services, crime and disorder and town centre regeneration. The Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly controls an annual budget in excess of £1.5m. The old council chamber in Denton Town Hall was refurbished to provide a permanent home and meeting place for the Denton and Audenshaw District Assembly as the town&#x27;s millennium project in 2000.

Since its formation the District Assembly Chairs have been: Andrew Gwynne (1998–2001); Mike Craven (2001–2004); Allison Gwynne (2004–2005); Margaret Downs (2005–present).

===Twinning===
On 5 December 1992, Denton became a twin-town to Montigny le Bretonneux, near Paris, France. On one side of the town hall, there is a &#x27;French road sign&#x27; which was a gift from the Municipal Authority in Montigny and states how far it is to Montigny le Bretonneux from Denton. There is a similar &#x27;English road sign&#x27; outside Montigny&#x27;s Town Hall pointing to Denton. Denton celebrated 20 years of twinning in September 2012.

For ten years the French sign on Denton Town Hall pointed north, implying that Denton&#x27;s French twin-town is located in the sea somewhere to the west of Orkney. However, Tameside MBC installed a &#x27;mock&#x27; French road sign, pointing left (i.e. south) in February 2007.

Since September 2012, Denton has been twinned with Kierspe in north west Germany, near Cologne, which in itself has been twinned with Montigny for 25 years.

There is a similar road sign to Kierspe displayed on the wall of the town hall building that points in a southerly direction, indicating that you may find it close to Le Mans in France, rather than Germany where Kierspe is currently located.

The town twinning is run independently of the local authority and is run by volunteers who sit on the Denton Town Twinning Association. The group fundraise and rely on generous donations to continue cultivating educational, cultural, and commercial links between Denton and its twin towns.

===Parliamentary representation===
The area of the former Denton urban district initially formed part of the Gorton Parliamentary Division of South East Lancashire from 1885 to 1918; it then became part of the Lancashire, Mossley Parliamentary Division from boundary changes effective in that year&#x27;s election until 1950. From 1950 to 1955 the town was contained within the short-lived Droylsden constituency. From 1955 to 1983 Denton was re-grouped with Gorton to form the Manchester, Gorton constituency. Since the 1983 boundary changes, Denton has formed part of the Denton and Reddish parliamentary constituency. Andrew Gwynne is Denton&#x27;s current Member of Parliament. He was elected in 2005 to represent the Denton and Reddish seat, after long-serving MP Andrew Bennett retired.

Members of Parliament representing Denton since 1885:

==Landmarks==

There is one main war memorial, or cenotaph, in Denton, located in Victoria Park. This memorial commemorates people from Denton and Haughton who served in two world wars. The names on the war memorial were collected from their relatives who wrote to the council with details of their loved ones who served in either war. The war memorial was unveiled on 23 July 1921. Figures from the Denton section of the Tameside council website, state that 3,500 Denton men served in the Great War (1914–1918), of that number, 369 people were killed.

The oldest church in Denton is St. Lawrence&#x27;s. It is almost 500 years old, originally built in 1531. It is a listed Grade II* building. The church is also known locally as &quot;Th&#x27;owd Peg&quot; (the old peg) due to the fact, as a timber-framed building, it was constructed with wooden pegs rather than nails. It is more commonly known as the black and white church, because of its appearance. A local myth is also said to have a pirate buried within its grounds because of a grave stone marked with a skull and crossbones at its front door. In a more thorough investigation and article printed by Denton Local History Society (1995), it was found that the gravestone was actually a masonic gravestone belonging to a deceased Soldier named Samuel Bromley from the Royal Artillery.

The Victorian St Anne&#x27;s Church, Haughton, is a Grade I listed building, and is built in the Gothic Revival style.

==Transport==

The town is served by Denton railway station on the Stockport-Stalybridge Line. There is only a threadbare service, with only two passenger trains a week on Saturday mornings; these are known as Parliamentary trains. The line is used regularly by goods and charter trains.

The area&#x27;s bus services are provided by Stagecoach Manchester, with links to Hattersley, Manchester city centre, Gee Cross, Stockport, Haughton Green and Ashton-under-Lyne. Local routes include:
* 201: between Hattersley and Manchester city centre, via Hyde, Denton and Gorton
* 202: between Gee Cross and Manchester city centre, via Hyde, Haughton Green, Denton and Gorton
* 322: between Haughton Green and Stockport, via Denton, Brinnington and Portwood
* 324: between Stockport and Haughton Green, via Portwood, Brinnington and Denton
* 327: between Denton and Stockport, via Brinnington and Portwood
* 335: between Ashton-under-Lyne and Denton, via Dukinfield
* 345: between Ashton-under-Lyne and Denton, via Dukinfield and Audenshaw

The M67 &quot;Denton Relief Road&quot; motorway was constructed between 1978 and 1981, running east to west through Denton; originally, this was planned to be part of a motorway running from central Manchester to Sheffield. At Denton Island, the M67 (J1) connects with the M60 Manchester Ring Road (J24).

<doc id="183185" wikidata="Q837491" url="?curid=183185" title="Xebec">
<text>A xebec ( or ), also spelled zebec, was a Mediterranean sailing ship that was used mostly for trading. Xebecs had a long overhanging bowsprit and aft-set mizzen mast. The term can also refer to a small, fast vessel of the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries, used almost exclusively in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Description==

Xebecs were ships similar to galleys primarily used by Barbary pirates, which have both lateen sails and oars for propulsion. Early xebecs had two masts while later ships had three. Xebecs featured a distinctive hull with pronounced overhanging bow and stern, and rarely displaced more than 200 tons, making them slightly smaller and with slightly fewer guns than frigates of the period.

=== Use by Barbary corsairs ===

These ships were easy to produce and were cheap, and thus nearly every corsair captain (&quot;Raïs&quot;) had at least one xebec in his fleet. They could be of varying sizes. Some ships had only three guns while others had up to forty. Most xebecs had around 20–30 cannons, and the overwhelming majority had swivel guns equipped.

After the 18th century, galleys became increasingly outdated and xebecs became the preferred ships of Barbary pirates thanks to their heavy and effective use of wind power, reduced need for slaves to row, ability to carry more cannons than a galley, and overall cheapness, speed, and maneuverability.

Xebecs were generally faster than contemporary ship types until the introduction of steamships.

Corsairs built their xebecs with a narrow floor to achieve a higher speed than their victims, but with a considerable beam in order to enable them to carry an extensive sail-plan. The lateen rig of the xebec allowed the ship to sail close hauled to the wind, often giving it an advantage in pursuit or escape. The use of oars or sweeps allowed the xebec to approach vessels which were becalmed. When used as corsairs, the xebecs carried a crew of between 90 and 400 men.

The use of square rig among pirates was initially rare, although after the 1750s a mix between lateen and square rigs became much more widespread.

=== Use by European powers ===
Some victorious xebecs of the Spanish Navy, about 1770 (see Antonio Barceló campaigns... in the Spanish version of the page of Wikipedia):
* &quot;Andaluz&quot;, 30 guns (4 × 8-pounders)
* &quot;Africa&quot;, 18 guns (4-pounders)
* &quot;Atrevido&quot;, 20 guns
* &quot;Aventurero&quot;, 30 guns (3 × 8-pounders)
* &quot;Murciano&quot;, 16 guns, 4 pedreros (light swivel guns)
* &quot;San Antonio&quot;

Notable xebecs of the French Navy include four launched in 1750:
* &quot;Ruse&quot;, 160 tons, 18 guns
* &quot;Serpent&quot;, 160 tons burthen, 18 guns
* &quot;Requin&quot;, 260 tons burthen, 24 guns
* &quot;Indiscret&quot;, 260 tons burthen, 24 guns
In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, a large polacre-xebec carried a square rig on the foremast, lateen sails on the other masts, a bowsprit, and two headsails. The square sail distinguished this form of a xebec from that of a felucca which is equipped solely with lateen sails. The last of the xebecs in use by European navies were fully square-rigged and were termed xebec-frigates.

The British brig-sloop &quot;Speedy&quot;&#x27;s (14 guns, 54 men) defeat of the Spanish xebec-frigate &quot;El Gamo&quot; (32 guns, 319 men) on 6 May 1801 is generally regarded as one of the most remarkable single-ship actions in naval history. It was the foundation of the legendary reputation of the &quot;Speedy&quot;″s commander, Lord Cochrane, which has in turn provided the inspiration for sea fiction such as Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;Master and Commander&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Xebec is also written as &quot;xebeck&quot;, &quot;xebe(c)que&quot;, &quot;zebec(k)&quot;, &quot;zebecque&quot;, &quot;chebec&quot;, &quot;shebeck&quot; (); from (, , now &quot;chebec&quot;, , now &quot;jabeque&quot;, , now &quot;xaveco&quot;, , &quot;zambecco&quot;, &quot;stambecco&quot;, , , &#x27; , , &#x27; and ).
Words similar in form and meaning to &quot;xebec&quot; occur in Catalan, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Arabic and Turkish. The Online Etymology Dictionary regards the Arabic &quot;shabaka&quot; (meaning &quot;a small warship&quot;) as the source form; however, the Arabic root means &#x27;a net&#x27;, implying the word originally referred to a fishing boat.

<text>The Boeing E-6 Mercury (formerly Hermes) is an airborne command post and communications relay based on the Boeing 707-300. The original E-6A manufactured by Boeing&#x27;s defense division entered service with the United States Navy in July 1989, replacing the EC-130Q. This platform, now modified to the E-6B standard, conveys instructions from the National Command Authority to fleet ballistic missile submarines (see communication with submarines), a mission known as TACAMO (&quot;Take Charge And Move Out&quot;). 

The E-6B model deployed in October 1998 has the ability to remotely control Minuteman ICBMs using the Airborne Launch Control System. The E-6B replaced Air Force EC-135Cs in the &quot;Looking Glass&quot; role, providing command and control of U.S. nuclear forces should ground-based control become inoperable. With production lasting until 1991, the E-6 was the final new derivative of the Boeing 707 to be built.

==Design and development==
Like the E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, the E-6 is adapted from Boeing&#x27;s 707-320 airliner. Rolled out at Boeing&#x27;s Renton Factory in December 1986, the first E-6 made its maiden flight in February 1987, when it was flown to nearby Boeing Field in south Seattle for fitting of mission avionics. It was delivered to the Navy for testing in July 1988.

The E-6B is an upgrade of the E-6A. It includes a battlestaff area and updated mission equipment. The flight deck systems were later replaced with an off-the-shelf 737 Next Generation cockpit. This greatly increases the situational awareness of the pilot and saves significant cost over the previous custom avionics package. The first E-6B was accepted in December 1997. All 16 E-6A aircraft were modified to the E-6B standard, with the final delivery taking place in December 2006.

The E-6 cannot use the probe-and-drogue in-flight refueling method that most other US Navy aircraft use. It uses a flying boom receptacle on the upper-forward fuselage, making it, like the Navy&#x27;s Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, reliant upon specific U.S. Air Force aircraft (KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender, and KC-46 Pegasus) for in-flight refueling.

==Operational history==
Codenamed &quot;Looking Glass&quot;, the E-6 is United States Strategic Command&#x27;s (USSTRATCOM) Airborne Command Post (ABNCP). It is designed to take over in case the Global Operations Center (GOC), located at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, is destroyed or incapable of communicating with strategic forces. The term &quot;Looking Glass&quot; is used because the ABNCP &quot;mirrors&quot; the abilities of the US Strategic Command GOC to control nuclear forces.

The E-6A, which was initially named Hermes, entered service with squadron VQ-3 in August 1989. A second squadron, VQ-4, received its first E-6As in January 1991, allowing the EC-130Q to be phased out in June 1991. The E-6A was renamed Mercury in autumn 1991 by request of the Navy. Sixteen E-6A planes were delivered from 1988 to 1992.

The E-6 fleet is based at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, and operated by Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 3 (VQ-3), VQ-4, and VQ-7.

In 2021, one of the E-3D Sentry aircraft that had been in service with the Royal Air Force was purchased for conversion into a dedicated E-6 trainer. This was done as a means to extend the life of the operational fleet by reducing the need for E-6s to be used for training missions.

=== Replacement ===
In 2015, both the Air Force and Navy realized that they needed new aircraft to serve the missions of both the E-4 and the E-6. At one point, they considered building one plane to replace both aircraft, but by 2020, the Navy decided to go its own way and develop an aircraft specifically for the TACAMO mission, under the E-XX TACAMO program. The Air Force independently pursued an E-4 replacement under the Survivable Airborne Operations Center program.

The Navy selected a variant of the Lockheed EC-130J, specifically one derived from the lengthened C-130J-30. Initial orders were placed in late 2020 with development beginning in earnest in 2022. Delivery of the first aircraft is expected in FY26. The Navy expects the E-6 to fulfill the TACAMO role into the 2030s as the E-XX is transitioned into service. 

In October 2024, the replacement aircraft was officially named E-130J.

<doc id="183193" wikidata="Q272695" url="?curid=183193" title="Front-side bus">
<text>The front-side bus (FSB) is a computer communication interface (bus) that was often used in Intel-chip-based computers during the 1990s and 2000s. The EV6 bus served the same function for competing AMD CPUs. Both typically carry data between the central processing unit (CPU) and a memory controller hub, known as the northbridge.

Depending on the implementation, some computers may also have a back-side bus that connects the CPU to the cache. This bus and the cache connected to it are faster than accessing the system memory (or RAM) via the front-side bus. The speed of the front side bus is often used as an important measure of the performance of a computer.

The original front-side bus architecture was replaced by HyperTransport, Intel QuickPath Interconnect, and Direct Media Interface, followed by Intel Ultra Path Interconnect and AMD&#x27;s Infinity Fabric.

==History==
The term came into use by Intel Corporation about the time the Pentium Pro and Pentium II products were announced, in the 1990s.

&quot;Front side&quot; refers to the external interface from the processor to the rest of the computer system, as opposed to the back side, where the back-side bus connects the cache (and potentially other CPUs).

A front-side bus (FSB) is mostly used on PC-related motherboards (including personal computers and servers). They are seldom used in embedded systems or similar small computers. The FSB design was a performance improvement over the single system bus designs of the previous decades, but these front-side buses are sometimes referred to as the &quot;system bus&quot;.

Front-side buses usually connect the CPU and the rest of the hardware via a chipset, which Intel implemented as a northbridge and a southbridge. Other buses like the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI), Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), and memory buses all connect to the chipset in order for data to flow between the connected devices. These secondary system buses usually run at speeds derived from the front-side bus clock, but are not necessarily synchronized to it.

In response to AMD&#x27;s Torrenza initiative, Intel opened its FSB CPU socket to third party devices.
Prior to this announcement, made in Spring 2007 at Intel Developer Forum in Beijing, Intel had very closely guarded who had access to the FSB, only allowing Intel processors in the CPU socket. The first example was field-programmable gate array (FPGA) co-processors, a result of collaboration between Intel-Xilinx-Nallatech and Intel-Altera-XtremeData (which shipped in 2008).

==Related component speeds==

===CPU===

The frequency at which a processor (CPU) operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the front-side bus (FSB) speed in some cases. For example, a processor running at 3200 MHz might be using a 400 MHz FSB. This means there is an internal clock multiplier setting (also called bus/core ratio) of 8. That is, the CPU is set to run at 8 times the frequency of the front-side bus: 400 MHz × 8 = 3200 MHz. Different CPU speeds are achieved by varying either the FSB frequency or the CPU multiplier, this is referred to as overclocking or underclocking.

===Memory===

Setting an FSB speed is related directly to the speed grade of memory a system must use. The memory bus connects the northbridge and RAM, just as the front-side bus connects the CPU and northbridge. Often, these two buses must operate at the same frequency. Increasing the front-side bus to 450 MHz in most cases also means running the memory at 450 MHz.

In newer systems, it is possible to see memory ratios of &quot;4:5&quot; and the like. The memory will run 5/4 times as fast as the FSB in this situation, meaning a 400 MHz bus can run with the memory at 500 MHz. This is often referred to as an &#x27;asynchronous&#x27; system. Due to differences in CPU and system architecture, overall system performance can vary in unexpected ways with different FSB-to-memory ratios.

In image, audio, video, gaming, FPGA synthesis and scientific applications that perform a small amount of work on each element of a large data set, FSB speed becomes a major performance issue. A slow FSB will cause the CPU to spend significant amounts of time waiting for data to arrive from system memory. However, if the computations involving each element are more complex, the processor will spend longer performing these; therefore, the FSB will be able to keep pace because the rate at which the memory is accessed is reduced.

===Peripheral buses===

Similar to the memory bus, the PCI and AGP buses can also be run asynchronously from the front-side bus. In older systems, these buses are operated at a set fraction of the front-side bus frequency. This fraction was set by the BIOS. In newer systems, the PCI, AGP, and PCI Express peripheral buses often receive their own clock signals, which eliminates their dependence on the front-side bus for timing.

===Overclocking===

Overclocking is the practice of making computer components operate beyond their stock performance levels by manipulating the frequencies at which the component is set to run, and, when necessary, modifying the voltage sent to the component to allow it to operate at these higher frequencies with more stability.

Many motherboards allow the user to manually set the clock multiplier and FSB settings by changing jumpers or BIOS settings. Almost all CPU manufacturers now &quot;lock&quot; a preset multiplier setting into the chip. It is possible to unlock some locked CPUs; for instance, some AMD Athlon processors can be unlocked by connecting electrical contacts across points on the CPU&#x27;s surface. Some other processors from AMD and Intel are unlocked from the factory and labeled as an &quot;enthusiast-grade&quot; processors by end users and retailers because of this feature. For all processors, increasing the FSB speed can be done to boost processing speed by reducing latency between CPU and the northbridge.

This practice pushes components beyond their specifications and may cause erratic behavior, overheating or premature failure. Even if the computer appears to run normally, problems may appear under a heavy load. Most PCs purchased from retailers or manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard or Dell, do not allow the user to change the multiplier or FSB settings due to the probability of erratic behavior or failure. Motherboards purchased separately to build a custom machine are more likely to allow the user to edit the multiplier and FSB settings in the PC&#x27;s BIOS.

==Evolution==

The front-side bus had the advantage of high flexibility and low cost when it was first designed. Simple symmetric multiprocessors place a number of CPUs on a shared FSB, though performance could not scale linearly due to bandwidth .

The front-side bus was used in all Intel Atom, Celeron, Pentium, Core 2, and Xeon processor models through about 2008 and was eliminated in 2009. Originally, this bus was a central connecting point for all system devices and the CPU.

The potential of a faster CPU is wasted if it cannot fetch instructions and data as quickly as it can execute them. The CPU may spend significant time idle while waiting to read or write data in main memory, and high-performance processors therefore require high bandwidth and low latency access to memory. The front-side bus was criticized by AMD as being an old and slow technology that limits system performance.

More modern designs use point-to-point and serial connections like AMD&#x27;s HyperTransport and Intel&#x27;s DMI 2.0 or QuickPath Interconnect (QPI). These implementations remove the traditional northbridge in favor of a direct link from the CPU to the system memory, high-speed peripherals, and the Platform Controller Hub, southbridge or I/O controller.

In a traditional architecture, the front-side bus served as the immediate data link between the CPU and all other devices in the system, including main memory. In HyperTransport- and QPI-based systems, system memory is accessed independently by means of a memory controller integrated into the CPU, leaving the bandwidth on the HyperTransport or QPI link for other uses. This increases the complexity of the CPU design but offers greater throughput as well as superior scaling in multiprocessor systems.

==Transfer rates==

The bandwidth or maximum theoretical throughput of the front-side bus is determined by the product of the width of its data path, its clock frequency (cycles per second) and the number of data transfers it performs per clock cycle. For example, a 64-bit (8-byte) wide FSB operating at a frequency of 100 MHz that performs 4 transfers per cycle has a bandwidth of 3200 megabytes per second (MB/s):

:8 bytes/transfer × 100 MHz × 4 transfers/cycle = 3200 MB/s

The number of transfers per clock cycle depends on the technology used. For example, GTL+ performs 1 transfer/cycle, EV6 2 transfers/cycle, and AGTL+ 4 transfers/cycle. Intel calls the technique of four transfers per cycle Quad Pumping.

Many manufacturers publish the frequency of the front-side bus in MHz, but marketing materials often list the theoretical effective signaling rate (which is commonly called megatransfers per second or MT/s). For example, if a motherboard (or processor) has its bus set at 200 MHz and performs 4 transfers per clock cycle, the FSB is rated at 800 MT/s.

The specifications of several generations of popular processors are indicated below.

<text>Thermal history modelling is an exercise undertaken during basin modelling to evaluate the temperature history of stratigraphic layers in a sedimentary basin.

The thermal history of a basin is usually calibrated using thermal indicator data, including vitrinite reflectance and fission tracks in the minerals apatite and zircon.

The temperatures undergone by rocks in a sedimentary basin are crucial when attempting to evaluate the quantity, nature and volume of hydrocarbons (fossil fuels) produced by diagenesis of kerogens (a group of chemicals formed from the decay of organic matter).

Fourier&#x27;s law provides a simplified one-dimensional description of the variation in heat flow &quot;Q&quot; as a function of thermal conductivity &quot;k&quot; and thermal gradient &quot;dT&quot;/&quot;dz&quot;:

:formula_1

(The minus sign indicates that heat flows in the opposite direction to increasing depth, that is, towards the Earth&#x27;s surface.)

If the assumptions used to justify this simplified approximation (i.e. steady-state heat conduction, no convection or advection) are accepted, we define the simple 1-dimensional heat diffusion equation where temperature &quot;T&quot; at a depth &quot;z&quot; and time &quot;t&quot; is given by the equation:

:formula_2
where &quot;T&quot;t0 is the surface temperature history, &quot;Q&quot;&quot;t&quot; is the heat flow history and &quot;k&quot; is thermal conductivity. The integral thus represents the integrated thermal conductivity history of a 1-dimensional column of rock.

Thermal history modelling attempts to describe the temperature history &quot;T&quot;z,t and therefore requires a knowledge of the burial history of the stratigraphic layers which is obtained through the process of back-stripping.

<text> is a hill near Pōrangahau, south of Waipukurau, in southern Hawke&#x27;s Bay, New Zealand. The summit of the hill is above sea level. The hill is notable primarily for its unusually long name, which is of Māori origin; it is often shortened to Taumata for brevity. It has gained a measure of fame as it is the longest place name found in any English-speaking country, and possibly the longest place name in the world, according to &quot;World Atlas&quot;. The name of the hill (with 85 characters) has been listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest place name. Other versions of the name, including longer ones, are also sometimes used.

==Name==
The name &quot;&quot; translates roughly as &quot;the summit where Tamatea, the man with the big knees, the slider, climber of mountains, the land-swallower who travelled about, played his (flute) to his loved one&quot;.

===Other versions===
The name has multiple alternative forms, some of them being longer still. &#x27; has 92 letters. An even longer version, &#x27;, has 105 letters and means &quot;the hill of the flute playing by Tamatea – who was blown hither from afar, had a slit penis, grazed his knees climbing mountains, fell on the earth, and encircled the land – to his beloved one&quot;.

Maps from 1929 published by the Department of Lands and Survey use a 28-character name &#x27;. In 1941, the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand renamed the hill to a 57-character name &#x27;, which has been an official name since 1948, and first appeared in a 1955 map. The New Zealand Geographic Placenames Database, maintained by Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), shows the official name with macrons .

==Tamatea Urehaea==

 (Tamatea, the explorer of the land) was the father of , ancestor of the tribe (iwi). Mention of &#x27;s explorations of the land occur not only in legends, but also in the traditions of iwi from Northland, where he is said to have explored the Hokianga and Kaipara harbours.

In traditions from the Bay of Plenty Region, he left a son, , who is the ancestor of of Tauranga. Legends from the East Coast of the North Island tell of his explorations in , , , , and . He travelled via the River, over the saddle via to Lake Taupō. The Ōtamatea River is named after him. is also the name of a place in Napier.

Early South Island legends say that sailed down the east coast. His canoe was wrecked in the far south, and transformed into the mountain range. then returned to the North Island, and travelled via the Whanganui River.

==In popular culture==
The name is referenced in various works:
* The name is the subject of a 1960 song by the New Zealand balladeer Peter Cape.
* It appears in the 1976 (re-released in 1979) single &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; by British band Quantum Jump, which featured in the title sequence of the second series of &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;.
* It is featured in a Mountain Dew jingle and a SEEK Learning TV ad in Australia.
* The name is featured in the 2019 song &quot;Open Road&quot; by New Zealand artist Ra Costelloe.

Tennis star Martina Navratilova learned to say the word when she was ten years old.
