<text>The Church of Scotland (CoS; ; ) is a Presbyterian denomination of Christianity that holds the status of the national church in Scotland. It is one of the country&#x27;s largest, having 259,200 members in 2023. While membership in the church has declined significantly in recent decades (in 1982 it had nearly 920,000 members), the government Scottish Household Survey found that 20% of the Scottish population, or over one million people, identified the Church of Scotland as their religious identity in 2019. 

In the 2022 census, 20.4% of the Scottish population, or 1,108,796 adherents, identified the Church of Scotland as their religious identity. The Church of Scotland&#x27;s governing system is presbyterian in its approach, therefore, no one individual or group within the church has more or less influence over church matters. There is no one person who acts as the head of faith, as the church believes that role is the &quot;Lord God&#x27;s&quot;. As a proper noun, &quot;the Kirk&quot; is an informal name for the Church of Scotland used in the media and by the church itself.

The Church of Scotland was principally shaped by John Knox in the Reformation of 1560 when it split from the Catholic Church and established itself as a church in the Reformed tradition. The Presbyterian tradition in ecclesiology (form of the church government) believe that God invited the church&#x27;s adherents to worship Jesus, with church elders collectively answerable for correct practice and discipline.

The Church of Scotland celebrates two sacraments, Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper, as well as five other ordinances, such as Confirmation and Matrimony. The church adheres to the Bible and the Westminster Confession of Faith and is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The annual meeting of the church&#x27;s general assembly is chaired by the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

==History==


===Early traces===
According to traditional Scottish historiography, the first Christians in Scotland were converted by Saint Ninian around 400 AD. Early Christian missionaries included Saint Columba, who founded a mission at Iona two centuries later. In 1192, the Papal bull Cum universi separated the Scottish church from the Archbishopric of York, creating an independent national church with no higher authority except the Pope.

===Establishment and John Knox===

The Church of Scotland, in its current form, traces its origins to the Scottish Reformation of 1560. At that point, many in the then church in Scotland broke with Rome in a process of Protestant reform led, among others, by John Knox. It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of John Calvin, which Knox had been exposed to while living in Geneva, Switzerland. An assembly of some nobles, lairds, and burgesses, as well as several churchmen, claiming in defiance of the Queen to be a Scottish Parliament, abolished papal jurisdiction and approved the &quot;Scots Confession&quot;, but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox&#x27;s &quot;First Book of Discipline&quot;, which argued, among other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 Reformation Settlement was not ratified by the crown, as Mary I, a Catholic, refused to do so, and the question of church government also remained unresolved. In 1572, the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young James VI, but the Concordat of Leith also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church&#x27;s approval. John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as &#x27;superintendents&#x27; which is a translation of the Greek; but in response to the new Concordat, a Presbyterian party emerged headed by Andrew Melville, the author of the &quot;Second Book of Discipline&quot;. 

Melville and his supporters enjoyed some temporary successes—most notably in the Golden Act of 1592, which gave parliamentary approval to Presbyterian courts. James VI, however, believed that presbyterianism was incompatible with monarchy, declaring &quot;No bishop, no king&quot;. By skillful manipulation of both church and state, he steadily reintroduced parliamentary and then diocesan episcopacy; this approximately mirrored the structure of the Church of England, of which James had become Supreme Governor when he succeeded to the English throne in 1603. By the time he died in 1625, the Church of Scotland had a full panel of bishops and archbishops. General Assemblies met only at times and places approved by the Crown. 

=== Wars of the Three Kingdoms ===

Charles I inherited a settlement in Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking his father&#x27;s political judgment, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the &#x27;plainness&#x27; of the Scottish service, he, together with his Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the &quot;Scottish Prayer Book&quot; of 1637, a slightly modified version of the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Although a panel of Scottish bishops devised this, Charles&#x27;s insistence that it be drawn up secretly and adopted sight unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh in mid-1637, it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with Jenny Geddes, spread across Scotland. In early 1638, the National Covenant was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been tested and approved by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles&#x27; attempt to resist these developments led to the Bishops&#x27; Wars. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots Covenanters at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians—resulting in the Westminster Confession of Faith being agreed by both. This document remains the subordinate standard of the Church of Scotland but was replaced in England after the Restoration.

=== The Restoration ===

Episcopacy was reintroduced to Scotland after the Restoration, which caused considerable discontent, especially in the country&#x27;s southwest, where the Presbyterian tradition was strongest. The modern situation largely dates from 1690, when after the Glorious Revolution, the majority of Scottish bishops were non-jurors; that is, they believed they could not swear allegiance to William III of England and Mary II of England while James VII lived. To reduce their influence, the Scots Parliament guaranteed Presbyterian governance of the church by law, excluding what became the Scottish Episcopal Church. Most of the remaining Covenanters disagreed with the Restoration Settlement on various political and theological grounds, most notably because the Settlement did not acknowledge the National Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant, and so did not join the Church of Scotland, instead forming the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1690.

===Independence of the church===
Controversy still surrounded the relationship between the Church of Scotland&#x27;s independence and the civil law of Scotland. The interference of civil courts with church decisions, particularly over the appointment of ministers, following the Church Patronage (Scotland) Act 1711, which gave landowners, or patrons, the right to appoint ministers to vacant pulpits, would lead to several splits. This began with the secession of 1733 and culminated in the Disruption of 1843 when a large portion of the church broke away to form the Free Church of Scotland. The seceding groups tended to divide and reunite among themselves—leading to a proliferation of Presbyterian denominations in Scotland, as is demonstrated in the timeline above.

The UK Parliament passed the Church of Scotland Act 1921, finally recognising the complete independence of the church in matters spiritual, and as a result of this, and passage of the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 33), the church was able to unite with the United Free Church of Scotland in 1929. The United Free Church of Scotland was itself the product of the union of the former United Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the majority of the Free Church of Scotland in 1900. The 1929 assembly of church leaders to effect the Union of that year met at Industrial Hall on Annandale Street in north Edinburgh.

Some independent Scottish Presbyterian denominations still remain. These include the Free Church of Scotland—sometimes given the epithet The Wee Frees—(originally formed of those congregations which refused to unite with the United Presbyterian Church in 1900), the United Free Church of Scotland (formed of congregations which refused to unite with the Church of Scotland in 1929), the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland (which broke from the Free Church of Scotland in 1893), the Associated Presbyterian Churches (which emerged as a result of a split in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in the 1980s) and the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) (which emerged from a split in the Free Church of Scotland in 2000). The motto of the Church of Scotland is &quot;nec tamen consumebatur&quot; (Latin)—&quot;Yet it was not consumed&quot;, an allusion to Exodus 3:2 and the Burning Bush.

===Recent history===
In 2023, the Church of Scotland published a report which detailed its connections to the Atlantic slave trade. It noted that from 1707 to the 1830s, Church of Scotland ministers and elders inherited wealth from familial relatives which were made on West Indian slave plantations and numerous church buildings (including Glasgow Cathedral) contain memorials to and accepted donations from individuals who profited from slavery. The report also noted that enslaved Black people were used to build Church of Scotland churches in the West Indies, and the church distributed money made from slavery to Scottish parishes to fund philanthropic efforts that assisted Scotland&#x27;s poor. It ended by recommending to the General Assembly that &quot;a statement of acknowledgment and apology should be brought to a future General Assembly and a dedicated page about the Church’s connections to the slave trade should be created for its website.&quot;

=== Controversies ===
In 2019, the Church of Scotland paid £1 million in damages to three siblings who had been abused at the Lord and Lady Polwarth children&#x27;s home.

==Theology and practice==
The basis of faith for the Church of Scotland is the &quot;Word of God&quot;, which it views as being &quot;contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament&quot;. Its principal subordinate standard is &quot;The Westminster Confession of Faith&quot; (1647), although here liberty of opinion is granted on those matters &quot;which do not enter into the substance of the faith&quot; (Art. 2 and 5). (The 19th century Scottish distinction was between &#x27;evangelicals&#x27; and &#x27;moderates&#x27;.) There is no official document in which substantial matters and insubstantial ones are clearly demarcated.

The Church of Scotland has no compulsory prayer book, although it does have a hymn book (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its &quot;Book of Common Order&quot; contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of metrical psalms and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with Christian music of all types. The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship is the responsibility of the minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the Iona Community are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.

In common with other Reformed denominations, the church recognises two sacraments: Baptism and Holy Communion (the Lord&#x27;s Supper). The church baptises both believing adults and the children of Christian families. Communion in the Church of Scotland today is open to Christians of whatever denomination, without precondition. If baptised as an infant, one is expected to make the public profession of faith as part of a confirmation ceremony. Communion services are usually taken fairly seriously in the church; traditionally, a congregation held only three or four per year, although practice now greatly varies between congregations. In some congregations, communion is celebrated once a month.

Theologically, the Church of Scotland is Reformed (ultimately in the Calvinist tradition) and is a member of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.

===Ecumenical relations===
The Church of Scotland is a member of ACTS (Action of Churches Together in Scotland) and, through its Committee on Ecumenical Relations, works closely with other denominations in Scotland. The present inter-denominational co-operation marks a distinct change from attitudes in certain quarters of the church in the early twentieth century and before, when opposition to Irish Roman Catholic immigration was vocal (see Catholicism in Scotland). The Church of Scotland is a member of the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe, and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The Church of Scotland is a member of Churches Together in Britain and Ireland and, through its Presbytery of England, is a member of Churches Together in England. The Church of Scotland continues to foster relationships with other Presbyterian denominations in Scotland even where agreement is difficult. In May 2016 the Church of Scotland ratified the Columba Agreement (approved by the Church of England&#x27;s General Synod in February 2016), calling for the two churches to work more closely together on matters of common interest. In 2022, the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Bishops Conference of Scotland agreed a declaration of friendship between the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church.

===&quot;God&#x27;s Invitation&quot;===
While the Bible is the basis of faith of the Church of Scotland, and the Westminster Confession of Faith is the subordinate standard, a request was presented to a General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a statement explaining the historic Christian faith in jargon-free non-theological language. &quot;God&#x27;s Invitation&quot; was prepared to fulfil that request. The full statement reads:
God made the world and all its creatures with men and women made in His image.

By breaking His laws people have broken contact with God, and damaged His good world. This we see and sense in the world and in ourselves.

The Bible tells us the Good News that God still loves us and has shown His love uniquely in His Son, Jesus Christ. He lived among us and died on the cross to save us from our sin. But God raised Him from the dead!

In His love, this living Jesus invites us to turn from our sins and enter by faith into a restored relationship with God Who gives true life before and beyond death.

Then, with the power of the Holy Spirit remaking us like Jesus, we—with all Christians—worship God, enjoy His friendship and are available for Him to use in sharing and showing His love, justice, and peace locally and globally until Jesus returns!

In Jesus&#x27; name we gladly share with you God&#x27;s message for all people—You matter to God!

It was approved for use by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in May 1992.

== Social and political issues==

The national church has never shied from involvement in Scottish politics. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the Church and Society Council, and in 2019 merged with the World Mission Council to create the Faith Impact Forum. The Church of Scotland is a firm opponent of nuclear weaponry. Supporting devolution, it was one of the parties involved in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which resulted in the setting up of the Scottish Parliament in 1997. Indeed, from 1999 to 2004 the Parliament met in the church&#x27;s Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland supports the Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office in Edinburgh, an ecumenical partnership which is staffed and resourced by the Church.

=== Women&#x27;s ordination ===

Since 1968, all ministries and offices in the church have been open to women and men on an equal basis. In 2004, Alison Elliot was chosen to be Moderator of the General Assembly, the first woman in the post and the first non-minister to be chosen since George Buchanan, four centuries before. In May 2007 Sheilagh M. Kesting became the first female minister to be Moderator. There are currently 218 serving female ministers, with 677 male ministers.

=== Homosexuality ===
The Church of Scotland allows its clergy to enter into same-sex marriages and civil partnerships. In May 2022, the General Assembly voted in favour of permitting the church&#x27;s clergy to conduct same-sex marriages.

In May 2009, there was opposition to an attempt to install as minister an openly homosexual man who intended to live with his partner once appointed to his post. In a landmark decision on 23 May 2009 the General Assembly (GA) ratified by 326 to 267 the appointment of Scott Rennie, the church&#x27;s first out, non-celibate gay minister. Rennie had won the overwhelming support of his prospective church members at Queen&#x27;s Cross, Aberdeen, but his appointment was in some doubt until extensive debate and this vote by the commissioners to the assembly. The GA later agreed upon a moratorium on the appointment of further non-celibate gay people until after a special commission has reported on the matter. (See: LGBT clergy in Christianity.)

As a result of these developments, a new grouping of congregations within the church was begun &quot;to declare their clear commitment to historic Christian orthodoxy&quot;, known as the Fellowship of Confessing Churches. In May 2011, the GA of the Church of Scotland voted to appoint a theological commission with a view to fully investigating the matter, reporting to the General Assembly of 2013. Meanwhile, openly homosexual ministers ordained before 2009 would be allowed to keep their posts without fear of sanction. On 20 May 2013, the GA voted in favour of a proposal that allowed liberal parishes to opt out of the church&#x27;s policy on homosexuality. Since 2008, 25 out of 808 (3%) ministers had left over the issue. It was reported that seceding congregations had a combined annual income of £1 million.

In 2015, the Church of Scotland&#x27;s GA voted in favour of recommending that gay ministers be able to enter into same-sex marriages. and allowing pastors to enter in same-sex civil partnerships. On 21 May 2016, the GA voted in favour of the approval for gay and lesbian ministers to enter into same-sex marriages. In 2017, there was a report to be debated at the church&#x27;s General Assembly in May that proposed &quot;having a church committee research allowing nominated ministers and deacons to carry out the ceremonies, but...to retain the ability for &#x27;contentious refusal&#x27; from those opposed to same-sex marriage.&quot;

A Theological Forum report calling for the approval of same-sex marriage, and an apology to homosexuals for past mistreatment was approved by the General Assembly on 25 May 2017. In 2018, the church&#x27;s assembly voted in favour of drafting a new church law to allow same-sex marriages and to give ministers the option of performing same-sex marriages. The church was expected to vote on a final poll in 2021 but, after being considered at a GA in May 2021, a draft plan might still be being considered by commissioners prior to being shared with all presbyteries for their consideration under the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Barrier Act 1697 and being brought back to a future General Assembly. On 23 May 2022 the GA voted in favour of same-sex marriage with 274 for and 136 against. Clergy will be allowed to conduct the marriages but will not be forced to.

Many church congregations and clergy affirm the full inclusion of transgender and other LGBTI people within the church through Affirmation Scotland.

=== Israeli–Palestinian conflict ===
In April 2013, the church published a report entitled &quot;The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the &#x27;Promised&#x27; Land&quot; which included a discussion of Israeli and Jewish claims to the Land of Israel. The report said &quot;there has been a widespread assumption by many Christians as well as many Jewish people that the Bible supports an essentially Jewish state of Israel. This raises an increasing number of difficulties and current Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians have sharpened this questioning&quot;, and that &quot;promises about the Land of Israel were never intended to be taken literally&quot;. The church responded to criticism by saying that &quot;The Church has never and is not now denying Israel&#x27;s right to exist; on the contrary, it is questioning the policies that continue to keep peace a dream in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. This report is against the injustices levelled against the Palestinian people and how land is shared. It is also a reflection of the use or misuse of scripture to claim divine right to land by any group&quot; and says it must &quot;refute claims that scripture offers any peoples a privileged claim for possession of a particular territory&quot;.

The Scottish Council of Jewish Communities sharply criticised the report, describing it as follows: &quot;It reads like an Inquisition-era polemic against Jews and Judaism. It is biased, weak on sources, and contradictory. The picture it paints of both Judaism and Israel is barely even a caricature. The arrogance of telling the Jewish people how to interpret Jewish texts and Jewish theology is breathtaking.&quot; The report was also criticised by the Anti-Defamation League and the Israeli envoy to the United Kingdom.

In response to criticism, the church quickly replaced the original version with a modified one, stating that criticism of Israel&#x27;s policies toward the Palestinians &quot;should not be misunderstood as questioning the right of the State of Israel to exist&quot;.

=== Abortion ===
The Church of Scotland is anti-abortion, stating that it should be allowed &quot;only on grounds that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve serious risk to the life or grave injury to the health, whether physical or mental, of the pregnant woman.&quot;

=== Euthanasia ===
The Church of Scotland also opposes euthanasia: &quot;The General Assembly has consistently stated that: &#x27;the Christian recognises no right to dispose of his own life even although he may regard those who commit or may attempt to commit suicide with compassion and understanding rather than condemnation&#x27;. The church has frequently stressed its opposition to various attempts to introduce legislation to permit euthanasia, even under strictly controlled circumstances as incompatible with Christianity.&quot; The church is associated with the Care Not Killing organisation in &quot;Promoting more and better palliative care./ Ensuring that existing laws against euthanasia and assisted suicide are not weakened or repealed during the lifetime of the current Parliament./ Influencing the balance of public opinion further against any weakening of the law.&quot;

=== Capital punishment ===
Historically, the Church of Scotland supported the death penalty; the General Assembly once called for the &quot;vigorous execution&quot; of Thomas Aikenhead, who was found guilty of blasphemy in 1696. Nowadays, the church strongly disapproves of the death penalty: &quot;The Church of Scotland affirms that capital punishment is always and wholly unacceptable and does not provide an answer even to the most heinous of crimes. It commits itself to working with other churches and agencies to advance this understanding, oppose death sentences and executions and promote the cause of abolition of the death penalty worldwide.&quot;

=== Divorce ===
The Church of Scotland does not consider marriage to be a sacrament, and thus not binding forever, and has no moral objection to the remarriage of divorced persons. The minister who is asked to perform a ceremony for someone who has a prior spouse living may inquire for the purpose of ensuring that the problems which led to the divorce do not recur.

==Position in Scottish society==
At the time of the 2001 census, the number of respondents who gave their religion as Church of Scotland was 2,146,251 which amounted to 42.4% of the population of Scotland. In 2013, the Church of Scotland had around 995 active ministers, 1,118 , and its official membership at 398,389 comprised about 7.5% of the population of Scotland. Official membership is down some 66.5% from its peak in 1957 of 1.32 million. In the 2011 national census, 32% of Scots identified their religion as &quot;Church of Scotland&quot;, more than any other faith group, but falling behind the total of those without religion for the first time. However, by 2013 only 18% of Scots self-identified as Church of Scotland. Though according to the 2014 Scottish Annual Household Survey, 27.8%, or 1.5 million adherents, identified the Church of Scotland as the church of their religion. In 2019, according to the Scottish Household Survey, 20% of Scots self-reported themselves as adherents of the Church of Scotland. The Church of Scotland Guild, the church&#x27;s historical women&#x27;s movement and open to men and women since 1997, is still the largest voluntary organisation in Scotland.

According to the 2011 census, among respondents who identified with the church, 96% were white Scots, 3% were other white people, and 1% were from other ethnic groups; this broadly reflects Scotland&#x27;s demographic make-up.

Although it is the national church, it is not a state church; this and other regards makes it dissimilar to the Church of England (the established church in England). Under its constitution (recognised by the 1921 act of the British Parliament), the church enjoys complete independence from the state in spiritual matters. When in Scotland, the British monarch simply attends church, as opposed to their role in the English Church as Supreme Governor. The monarch&#x27;s accession oath includes a promise to &quot;maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Government&quot;. They are formally represented at the annual General Assembly by a Lord High Commissioner unless they choose to attend in person; the role is purely formal, and the monarch has no right to take part in deliberations.

The church is committed to its &#x27;distinctive call and duty to bring the ordinances of religion to the people in every parish of Scotland through a territorial ministry&#x27; (Article 3 of its &quot;Articles Declaratory&quot;). The church played a leading role in providing universal education in Scotland (the first such provision in the modern world), largely due to its teaching that all should be able to read the Bible. However, it ceased operating its schools, which were transferred to the state, in the latter half of the 19th century.

The Church of Scotland faces many current difficulties. Between 1966 and 2006, the number of members fell from over 1,230,000 to 504,000, reducing further to 446,000 in 2010 380,164 by 2014, 336,000 by 2017, and 325,695 by 2018, representing about 6% of the Scottish population. The Scottish Church Census of 2016 reported that just under 137,000 people worshipped on an average Sunday in a Church of Scotland, approximately 41% of the stated membership. However, according to the 2024 Assembly Trustees Report, only 61,580 were attending an average Sunday worship service in person during 2023.

In 2016 the church faced a £5.7 million deficit amid costly upkeep of many older ecclesiastical buildings. In response the church decided to &#x27;prune to grow&#x27;, reducing ministry provision plans from 1,234 to 1,000 funded posts (1,075 established FTE posts, of which 75 would be vacant at any one time) supported by a variety of voluntary and part-time ministries. At the same time the number of candidates accepted for full-time ministry has reduced from 24 (2005) to 8 (2009). Since 2014, the number of full-time candidates accepted into training each year has been in the range of 13 to 16. At the 2016 General Assembly the Moderator pointed to issues such as: 25% of charges without a minister; all but two ministers over the age of 30; falling clergy numbers over the coming six years (anticipated that for each newly recruited minister there will be four retirements).

By 2021 membership was continuing to decline year on year, leading to a new plan &quot;without which the church would not survive.&quot; The proposal reduced the number of ministry posts by 40%; to 660 of which 60 would be vacant at any one time, and was said to offer the church a chance to thrive. By December 2022 the Church had 270,300 members, a 4.7% decline from 2021, and representing an overall decline of 35% since 2012.

This lack of those in training towards ministry has threatened the viability of the church&#x27;s theological training colleges. During the 2019 General Assembly, the Ministries Council announced that they were looking to reduce the number of Academic Partners who train current ministry students from five, to either one or two. The five current academic partners are University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University of Aberdeen, University of St Andrews and, most recently, Highland Theological College.

==Governance and administration==

The Church of Scotland is Presbyterian in polity and Reformed in theology. The most recent articulation of its legal position, the &quot;Articles Declaratory&quot; (1921), spells out the key concepts.

===Courts and assemblies===
As a Presbyterian church, the church has no bishops but is rather governed by elders and ministers (collectively called presbyters) sitting in a series of courts. Each congregation is led by a Session. The Sessions in turn are answerable to regional presbyteries (of which the church currently has 14). The supreme body is the annual General Assembly, which meets each May in Edinburgh. Until the mid 1990&#x27;s, the Church of Scotland also had Synods, representing a layer of governance between Presbyteries and the General Assembly.

====National Youth Assembly====
The National Youth Assembly, often shortened to NYA, was an annual gathering of young people aged between 17 and 25 years old within the Church of Scotland. It ran from 1994 to 2019 and was run by the Mission and Discipleship Council of the Church, as part of Church of Scotland Youth (CoSY). The NYA discussed different topics every year and determined what they wish to say on these topics through the medium of debate (deliberately akin to that of the General Assembly).

===Moderator===

Each court is convened by the &#x27;moderator&#x27;—at the local level of the Session normally the parish minister who is &quot;ex officio&quot; member and Moderator of the Session. Congregations where there is no minister, or where the minister is incapacitated, may be moderated by a specially trained elder. Presbyteries and the General Assembly elect a moderator each year. The Moderator of the General Assembly serves for the year as the public representative of the church, but beyond that enjoys no special powers or privileges and is in no sense the leader or official spokesperson of the church. At all levels, moderators may be either elders or ministers. Only Moderators of Sessions are obliged to be trained for the role.

The official residence of the Moderator is Number 2 Rothesay Terrace in Edinburgh.

===National General Assembly Bodies===
At a national level, the work of the Church of Scotland is chiefly carried out by bodies appointed by the General Assembly, each supported by full-time staff mostly based at the Church of Scotland Offices in Edinburgh. Following a major reform (described as a &quot;Radical Action Plan&quot;) agreed at the 2019 General Assembly, the major central bodies are now:
*Faith Impact Forum (replaced the former Church and Society Council and World Mission Council)
*Faith Nurture Forum (replacing the former Ministries Council and Mission and Discipleship Council)
*Social Care Council &quot;(based at Charis House, Edinburgh)&quot;

The Church of Scotland&#x27;s Social Care Council (known as CrossReach) is the largest provider of social care in Scotland today, running projects for various disadvantaged and vulnerable groups: including care for the elderly; help with alcoholism, drug, and mental health problems; and assistance for the homeless.

A new body, the Assembly Trustees, was also created in 2019, to be the Charity Trustees of the Church and to head the Church&#x27;s governance structure. There are 12 General Assembly appointed trustees, plus the Convener of the Assembly Business Committee and the Chair of the General Trustees (the body responsible for property).

The national church has never shied from involvement in Scottish politics. In 1919, the General Assembly created a Church and Nation Committee, which in 2005 became the Church and Society Council, and in 2019 merged with the World Mission Council to create the Faith Impact Forum. The Church of Scotland was (and is) a firm opponent of nuclear weaponry. Supporting devolution, it was one of the parties involved in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which resulted in the setting up of the Scottish Parliament in 1997. Indeed, from 1999 to 2004 the Parliament met in the church&#x27;s Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, while its own building was being constructed. The Church of Scotland actively supports the work of the Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office in Edinburgh.

Other church agencies include:
*Assembly Arrangements Committee
*Committee on Chaplains to HM Forces
*Church of Scotland Guild
*Committee on Church Art and Architecture &quot;(part of the Mission and Discipleship Council)&quot;

===Church offices===
The Church of Scotland Offices are located at 121 George Street, Edinburgh.
These imposing buildings—popularly known in church circles as &quot;one-two-one&quot;—were designed in a Scandinavian-influenced style by the architect Sydney Mitchell and built in 1909–1911 for the United Free Church of Scotland. Following the union of the churches in 1929 a matching extension was built in the 1930s.

The offices of the Moderator, Principal Clerk, General Treasurer, Law Department and all the Church councils are located at 121 George Street, with the exception of the Social Care Council (CrossReach). The Principal Clerk to the General Assembly is Fiona Smith (the first woman to hold the post full-time), who succeeded George Whyte in 2022.

<text>Space rock is a music genre characterized by loose and lengthy song structures centered on instrumental textures that typically produce a hypnotic, otherworldly sound. It may feature distorted and reverberation-laden guitars, minimal drumming, languid vocals, synthesizers, and lyrical themes of outer space and science fiction.

The genre emerged in late 1960s psychedelia and progressive rock bands such as Pink Floyd, Hawkwind, and Gong who explored a &quot;cosmic&quot; sound. Similar sounds were pursued in the early 1970s&#x27; West German &quot;kosmische Musik&quot; (&quot;cosmic music&quot;) scene. Later, the style was taken up in the mid-1980s by Spacemen 3, whose &quot;drone-heavy&quot; sound was avowedly inspired by and intended to accommodate drug use. By the 1990s, space rock developed into shoegaze and post-rock with bands such as the Verve and Flying Saucer Attack. 

==History==
===Origins: 1950s-1960s===

Humanity&#x27;s entry into outer space provided ample subject matter for rock and roll and R&amp;B songs from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s. It also inspired new sounds and sound effects to be used in the music itself. A prominent early example of space rock is the 1959 concept album &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; by British producer and songwriter Joe Meek. The album was inspired by the space race and concerned humanity&#x27;s first close encounter with alien life forms. Meek then went on to have a UK and US No 1 success in 1961 with &quot;Telstar&quot;, named after the newly launched communications satellite and thus intended to commemorate the new space age. Its main instrument was a clavioline, an electronic forerunner of the synthesizers.

The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Flying&quot; (1967), originally titled &quot;Aerial Tour Instrumental&quot;, was a psychedelic instrumental about the sensation of flying, whether in a craft or in your own head space. Jimi Hendrix is also an early innovator of the genre, with such tracks as &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;, &quot;1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)&quot; and &quot;The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam&#x27;s Dice&quot;.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s early albums contain pioneering examples of space rock: &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; and &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; from their 1967 debut album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; are examples. Their second album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; contained further examples: &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; and &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; with explicit science fiction themes, and their third, &quot;More&quot; (1969) had &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot;.

===Peak: 1970s-1980s===
In the early 1970s, West Germany&#x27;s &quot;kosmische Musik&quot; (&quot;cosmic music&quot;) scene developed among artists who explored &quot;spacy&quot;, ambient instrumental soundscapes. The term is frequently used as a synonym of krautrock, but may also be used as a German analogue to the English term &quot;space rock&quot;. These artists often explored electronic music, synthesizers, and themes related to space or otherworldliness. Examples included artists like Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, and Klaus Schulze.

In early 1971, Pink Floyd began writing the song that would become known as &quot;Echoes&quot;, from the 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot;. The song was performed from April until September 1971, with an alternative set of lyrics, written about two planets meeting in space. 

A major album in the history of space rock was Hawkwind&#x27;s &quot;Space Ritual&quot; (1973), a two-disc live album advertised as &quot;88 minutes of brain-damage&quot; documenting Hawkwind&#x27;s 1972 tour that included a liquid light show and lasers, nude dancers (notably the earth-mother figure Stacia), wild costumes and psychedelic imagery. This hard-edged concert experience attracted a motley but dedicated collection of psychedelic drug users, science-fiction fans and motorcycle riders. The science fiction author Michael Moorcock collaborated with Hawkwind on many occasions and wrote the lyrics for many of the spoken-word sections on &quot;Space Ritual&quot;. 

In Europe, Hungarian band Omega produced albums such as &quot;Time Robber&quot; (1976), &quot;Skyrover&quot; (1978), and &quot;Gammapolis&quot; (1979). Other European bands include the progressive rock groups Eloy and Nektar. Nektar, who were known for having a rhythmic liquid/slide light show at their concerts, released their album &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Eye&quot; in 1971. Another European band of the period were the French Rockets, formed in 1974 and relocated to Italy in 1978.

===1990s revival===
The 1990s space rock revival extended from shoegaze, dream pop and related indie genres, as well as the first wave of post-rock. In the United Kingdom and the United States, it included bands such as Spacemen 3, Spectrum, Spiritualized, the Verve, My Bloody Valentine, Flying Saucer Attack, Magic Mushroom Band, and Ozric Tentacles.

In the mid-1990s, a number of bands built on the space rock styles of Hawkwind and Gong appeared in America. Some of these bands were signed to Cleopatra Records, which then proceeded to release numerous space rock compilations. Starting in 1997, Daevid Allen of Gong, along with members of Hawkwind, Clearlight, and Blue Öyster Cult, started to perform with Spirits Burning, a studio project created to celebrate space rock.

The Strange Daze festivals from 1997 to 2001 showcased the American space rock scene in three-day outdoor festivals. A Michigan-based space rock scene included Burnt Hair Records, Darla Records, and bands such as Windy &amp; Carl, Mahogany, Sweet Trip, Füxa and Auburn Lull. This was a modern movement of the traditional &quot;space rock&quot; sound and was pinned Detroit Space Rock.

<text>In thermodynamics, activity (symbol ) is a measure of the &quot;effective concentration&quot; of a species in a mixture, in the sense that the species&#x27; chemical potential depends on the activity of a real solution in the same way that it would depend on concentration for an ideal solution. The term &quot;activity&quot; in this sense was coined by the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis in 1907.

By convention, activity is treated as a dimensionless quantity, although its value depends on customary choices of standard state for the species. The activity of pure substances in condensed phases (solids and liquids) is taken as = 1. Activity depends on temperature, pressure and composition of the mixture, among other things. For gases, the activity is the effective partial pressure, and is usually referred to as fugacity.

The difference between activity and other measures of concentration arises because the interactions between different types of molecules in non-ideal gases or solutions are different from interactions between the same types of molecules. The activity of an ion is particularly influenced by its surroundings.

Equilibrium constants should be defined by activities but, in practice, are often defined by concentrations instead. The same is often true of equations for reaction rates. However, there are circumstances where the activity and the concentration are &quot;significantly different&quot; and, as such, it is not valid to approximate with concentrations where activities are required. Two examples serve to illustrate this point:
*In a solution of potassium hydrogen iodate KH(IO3)2 at 0.02 M the activity is 40% lower than the calculated hydrogen ion concentration, resulting in a much higher pH than expected. 
*When a 0.1 M hydrochloric acid solution containing methyl green indicator is added to a 5 M solution of magnesium chloride, the color of the indicator changes from green to yellow—indicating increasing acidity—when in fact the acid has been diluted. Although at low ionic strength (&lt; 0.1 M) the activity coefficient approaches unity, this coefficient can actually increase with ionic strength in a high ionic strength regime. For hydrochloric acid solutions, the minimum is around 0.4 M.

==Definition==
The relative activity of a species , denoted , is defined as:
:formula_1
where is the (molar) chemical potential of the species under the conditions of interest, is the (molar) chemical potential of that species under some defined set of standard conditions, is the gas constant, is the thermodynamic temperature and is the exponential constant.

Alternatively, this equation can be written as:
:formula_2

In general, the activity depends on any factor that alters the chemical potential. Such factors may include: concentration, temperature, pressure, interactions between chemical species, electric fields, etc. Depending on the circumstances, some of these factors, in particular concentration and interactions, may be more important than others.

The activity depends on the choice of standard state such that changing the standard state will also change the activity. This means that activity is a relative term that describes how &quot;active&quot; a compound is compared to when it is under the standard state conditions. In principle, the choice of standard state is arbitrary; however, it is often chosen out of mathematical or experimental convenience. Alternatively, it is also possible to define an &quot;absolute activity&quot; (i.e., the fugacity in statistical mechanics), , which is written as:

:formula_3

Note that this definition corresponds to setting as standard state the solution of formula_4, if the latter exists.

===Activity coefficient===

The activity coefficient , which is also a dimensionless quantity, relates the activity to a measured mole fraction (or in the gas phase), molality , mass fraction , molar concentration (molarity) or mass concentration : 
:formula_5

The division by the standard molality (usually 1 mol/kg) or the standard molar concentration (usually 1 mol/L) is necessary to ensure that both the activity and the activity coefficient are dimensionless, as is conventional.

The activity depends on the chosen standard state and composition scale; for instance, in the dilute limit it approaches the mole fraction, mass fraction, or numerical value of molarity, all of which are different. However, the activity coefficients are similar.

When the activity coefficient is close to 1, the substance shows almost ideal behaviour according to Henry&#x27;s law (but not necessarily in the sense of an ideal solution). In these cases, the activity can be substituted with the appropriate dimensionless measure of composition , or . It is also possible to define an activity coefficient in terms of Raoult&#x27;s law: the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends the symbol for this activity coefficient, although this should not be confused with fugacity.
:formula_6

==Standard states==
===Gases===
In most laboratory situations, the difference in behaviour between a real gas and an ideal gas is dependent only on the pressure and the temperature, not on the presence of any other gases. At a given temperature, the &quot;effective&quot; pressure of a gas is given by its fugacity : this may be higher or lower than its mechanical pressure. By historical convention, fugacities have the dimension of pressure, so the dimensionless activity is given by:
:formula_7
where is the dimensionless fugacity coefficient of the species, is its mole fraction in the gaseous mixture ( for a pure gas) and is the total pressure. The value is the standard pressure: it may be equal to 1 atm (101.325 kPa) or 1 bar (100 kPa) depending on the source of data, and should always be quoted.

===Mixtures in general===
The most convenient way of expressing the composition of a generic mixture is by using the mole fractions (written in the gas phase) of the different components (or chemical species: atoms or molecules) present in the system, where

: formula_8

: with , the number of moles of the component &quot;i&quot;, and , the total number of moles of all the different components present in the mixture. 

The standard state of each component in the mixture is taken to be the pure substance, &quot;i.e.&quot; the pure substance has an activity of one. When activity coefficients are used, they are usually defined in terms of Raoult&#x27;s law,
: formula_6
where is the Raoult&#x27;s law activity coefficient: an activity coefficient of one indicates ideal behaviour according to Raoult&#x27;s law.

===Dilute solutions (non-ionic)===
A solute in dilute solution usually follows Henry&#x27;s law rather than Raoult&#x27;s law, and it is more usual to express the composition of the solution in terms of the molar concentration (in mol/L) or the molality (in mol/kg) of the solute rather than in mole fractions. The standard state of a dilute solution is a hypothetical solution of concentration  = 1 mol/L (or molality  = 1 mol/kg) which shows ideal behaviour (also referred to as &quot;infinite-dilution&quot; behaviour). The standard state, and hence the activity, depends on which measure of composition is used. Molalities are often preferred as the volumes of non-ideal mixtures are not strictly additive and are also temperature-dependent: molalities do not depend on volume, whereas molar concentrations do.

The activity of the solute is given by:
:formula_10

===Ionic solutions===
When the solute undergoes ionic dissociation in solution (for example a salt), the system becomes decidedly non-ideal and we need to take the dissociation process into consideration. One can define activities for the cations and anions separately ( and ).

In a liquid solution the activity coefficient of a given ion (e.g. Ca2+) isn&#x27;t measurable because it is experimentally impossible to independently measure the electrochemical potential of an ion in solution. (One cannot add cations without putting in anions at the same time). Therefore, one introduces the notions of

;mean ionic activity
;mean ionic molality
;mean ionic activity coefficient
where represent the stoichiometric coefficients involved in the ionic dissociation process

Even though and cannot be determined separately, is a measurable quantity that can also be predicted for sufficiently dilute systems using Debye–Hückel theory. For electrolyte solutions at higher concentrations, Debye–Hückel theory needs to be extended and replaced, e.g., by a Pitzer electrolyte solution model (see external links below for examples). For the activity of a strong ionic solute (complete dissociation) we can write:

==Measurement==
The most direct way of measuring the activity of a volatile species is to measure its equilibrium partial vapor pressure. For water as solvent, the water activity &quot;aw&quot; is the equilibrated relative humidity. For non-volatile components, such as sucrose or sodium chloride, this approach will not work since they do not have measurable vapor pressures at most temperatures. However, in such cases it is possible to measure the vapor pressure of the &quot;solvent&quot; instead. Using the Gibbs–Duhem relation it is possible to translate the change in solvent vapor pressures with concentration into activities for the solute.

The simplest way of determining how the activity of a component depends on pressure is by measurement of densities of solution, knowing that real solutions have deviations from the additivity of (molar) volumes of pure components compared to the (molar) volume of the solution. This involves the use of partial molar volumes, which measure the change in chemical potential with respect to pressure.

Another way to determine the activity of a species is through the manipulation of colligative properties, specifically freezing point depression. Using freezing point depression techniques, it is possible to calculate the activity of a weak acid from the relation,
:formula_11
where is the total equilibrium molality of solute determined by any colligative property measurement (in this case ), is the nominal molality obtained from titration and is the activity of the species.

There are also electrochemical methods that allow the determination of activity and its coefficient.

The value of the mean ionic activity coefficient of ions in solution can also be estimated with the Debye–Hückel equation, the Davies equation or the Pitzer equations.

===Single ion activity measurability revisited===
The prevailing view that single ion activities are unmeasurable, or perhaps even physically meaningless, has its roots in the work of Edward A. Guggenheim in the late 1920s. However, chemists have not given up the idea of single ion activities. For example, pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity. By implication, if the prevailing view on the physical meaning and measurability of single ion activities is correct it relegates pH to the category of thermodynamically unmeasurable quantities. For this reason the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) states that the activity-based definition of pH is a notional definition only and further states that the establishment of primary pH standards requires the application of the concept of &#x27;primary method of measurement&#x27; tied to the Harned cell. Nevertheless, the concept of single ion activities continues to be discussed in the literature, and at least one author purports to define single ion activities in terms of purely thermodynamic quantities. The same author also proposes a method of measuring single ion activity coefficients based on purely thermodynamic processes. A different approach has a similar objective.

==Use==
Chemical activities should be used to define chemical potentials, where the chemical potential depends on the temperature , pressure and the activity according to the formula:
:formula_2
where is the gas constant and is the value of under standard conditions. Note that the choice of concentration scale affects both the activity and the standard state chemical potential, which is especially important when the reference state is the infinite dilution of a solute in a solvent. Chemical potential has units of joules per mole (J/mol), or energy per amount of matter. Chemical potential can be used to characterize the specific Gibbs free energy changes occurring in chemical reactions or other transformations.

Formulae involving activities can be simplified by considering that:
* For a chemical solution:
** the solvent has an activity of unity (only a valid approximation for rather dilute solutions)
** At a low concentration, the activity of a solute can be approximated to the ratio of its concentration over the standard concentration: formula_13
Therefore, it is approximately equal to its concentration.

* For a mix of gas at low pressure, the activity is equal to the ratio of the partial pressure of the gas over the standard pressure: formula_14 Therefore, it is equal to the partial pressure in atmospheres (or bars), compared to a standard pressure of 1 atmosphere (or 1 bar).
* For a solid body, a uniform, single species solid has an activity of unity at standard conditions. The same thing holds for a pure liquid.

The latter follows from any definition based on Raoult&#x27;s law, because if we let the solute concentration go to zero, the vapor pressure of the solvent will go to . Thus its activity will go to unity. This means that if during a reaction in dilute solution more solvent is generated (the reaction produces water for example) we can typically set its activity to unity.

Solid and liquid activities do not depend very strongly on pressure because their molar volumes are typically small. Graphite at 100 bars has an activity of only 1.01 if we choose as standard state. Only at very high pressures do we need to worry about such changes. Activity expressed in terms of pressure is called fugacity.

==Example values==
Example values of activity coefficients of sodium chloride in aqueous solution are given in the table. In an ideal solution, these values would all be unity. The deviations &quot;tend&quot; to become larger with increasing molality and temperature, but with some exceptions.

<text>Lord Melody (1926 – 26 September 1988) was a popular Trinidadian calypsonian, best known for singles such as &quot;Boo Boo Man&quot;, &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Shame &amp; Scandal&quot;, &quot;Jonah and the Bake&quot;, &quot;Juanita&quot;, and &quot;Rastaman Be Careful&quot;. Melody&#x27;s career spanned forty years, from the beginnings of popular calypso music to his embrace of the more dance oriented Soca style by the late 1970s.

==Career==
Melody was born Fitzroy Alexander at San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago, raised at an orphanage in Port of Spain, and met Alwyn Roberts (soon to become better known as Lord Kitchener) after moving to Arima while still in his teens. Roberts took him under his wing and they returned to Port of Spain, where Lord Kitchener became the leading calypso star, with Melody one of his main challengers. His popularity increased locally when Lord Kitchener emigrated to England in 1947. Melody&#x27;s career started in the 1940s with performances in calypso tents, and he continued to perform in this and other venues in the Caribbean until the 1960s. His early successes included &quot;Berlin on a Donkey&quot;, mocking Adolf Hitler, and &quot;Boo Boo Man&quot; first recorded in 1955 and released on several record labels. His rendition of &quot;Second Spring&quot; won him the Calypso Monarch title in 1954 and he signed with Cook Records in 1956.

He was one of the six vocalists chosen to perform for Princess Margaret when she visited Trinidad in 1956.

His first known album was &quot;Calypso Fiesta - Limbo In Trinidad&quot;, which was released in 1956 on Vitadisc records and contained eight songs, including his popular &quot;Mama Look A Boo Boo&quot;. Another album, &quot;Calypso Carnival 1958&quot;, was released on Balisier records in 1958. It was a split release - the first side contained six Lord Melody songs (some of which did not appear elsewhere), and the second side comprised instrumental tracks by Cyril Diaz (whose band usually backed Melody on his recordings).

Cook Records released several live tracks featuring him on their albums &quot;Jump Up Carnival&quot; and &quot;Calypso Kings And Pink Gin&quot; in 1957, which led to him recording a full album for the label the next year.

His first album on Cook Records, &quot;Lord Melody Sings Calypso&quot;, was released in 1958, with a second album, &quot;Again!&quot; released the following year.

The rivalry between Melody and Mighty Sparrow was a feature of the calypsos &quot;Ten to One is Murder&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Sparrow&quot;. Melody&#x27;s third album, &quot;Calypso Through The Looking Glass&quot;, was released in 1960 and featured the infamous &quot;Belmont Jackass&quot;, in which Melody berates Sparrow&#x27;s wife. Melody&#x27;s song &quot;Wau, Wau&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Shame and Scandal&quot;) was popular in 1962. The song was a version of a song originally recorded by Sir Lancelot in 1943 with new verses written by Melody. This subsequently became the most widely known version of the song and Melody&#x27;s version was covered by The Wailers with Peter Tosh on lead vocal.

Harry Belafonte recorded Lord Melody&#x27;s compositions &quot;Boo Boo Man&quot; (retitled &quot;Mama Look at Bubu&quot; and &quot;Mama Look at Boo Boo&quot;) and &quot;Sweetheart from Venezuela&quot; (aka &quot;Juanita&quot;), having a top 20 hit in the US with the former in 1957. &quot;Mama Look a Boo Boo&quot; was also recorded by Robert Mitchum and others. Several singles became favourites with Britain&#x27;s West Indian community in the late 1950s. In the first half of the 1960s, his popularity waned, but he again found success in 1965 when his &quot;Melody Mas&quot; won the Panorama at the Carnival. He released three albums in 1962, but despite recording a number of singles and compilation exclusives over the rest of the 1960s, did not record another album until 1974&#x27;s &quot;Salt And Pepper&quot;.

Melody moved to New York he toured with Belafonte in the 1960s. He was diagnosed with cancer in the early 1970s and the illness restricted his career, although he continued to release albums throughout the 1970s. In this decade he gradually moved away from calypso and instead embraced the emerging soca and reggae styles. These recordings are distinguished by the synths and drum machines of the era and a more reverb-based production sound, as well as the aging quality of Melody&#x27;s voice at the time. Around 1979 he became a Rastafarian, and released the &quot;I Man&quot; album, a reggae-tinged album on which he spoke on the subject, the singles &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Rastaman Be Careful&quot; becoming local hits in the same era. In 1982 he made another album, the soca-styled &quot;Lola&quot;.

Melody&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate, and he died from cancer in September 1988, in Port of Spain.

<text>STS-31 was the 35th mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the tenth flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. The primary purpose of this mission was the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into low Earth orbit. &quot;Discovery&quot; lifted off from Launch Complex 39B on April 24, 1990, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

Following the Challenger accident clarification was required on mission numbering. As STS-51-L was also designated STS-33, future flights with the previous STS-26 through STS-33 designators would require the R in their documentation to avoid conflicts in tracking data from one mission to another.

&quot;Discovery&quot;″s crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope on April 25, 1990, and then spent the rest of the mission tending to various scientific experiments in the Shuttle&#x27;s payload bay as well as operating a set of IMAX cameras to record the mission. &quot;Discovery&quot;″s launch marked the first time since January 1986 that two Space Shuttles had been on the launch pad at the same time – &quot;Discovery&quot; on 39B and &quot;Columbia&quot; on 39A.

== Crew ==
=== Crew seat assignments ===
=== Crew notes ===
This mission was originally to be flown in August 1986 as STS-61-J using &quot;Atlantis&quot;, but was postponed due to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. John W. Young was originally assigned to command this mission, which would have been his seventh spaceflight, but was reassigned to an administrative position and was replaced by Loren J. Shriver in 1988.

== Mission highlights ==

STS-31 was launched on April 24, 1990 at 12:33:51UTC (8:33:51amEDT, local time at the launch site). A launch attempt on April 10, 1990, was scrubbed at T&quot;−&quot;4 minutes for a faulty valve in auxiliary power unit (APU) number one. The APU was eventually replaced, and the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s batteries were recharged. On launch day, the countdown was briefly halted at T&quot;−&quot;31 seconds when &quot;Discovery&quot;″s computers failed to shut down a fuel valve line on ground support equipment. Engineers manually commanded the valve to close and the countdown continued.

The main purpose of this mission was to deploy Hubble. It was designed to operate above the Earth&#x27;s turbulent and obscuring atmosphere to observe celestial objects at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths. The Hubble mission was a joint NASA-ESA (European Space Agency) effort going back to the late 1970s. The rest of the mission was devoted to photography and onboard experiments. To launch HST into an orbit that guaranteed longevity, &quot;Discovery&quot; entered an orbit of around . At one point during the mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; briefly reached an apogee of , the highest altitude ever reached by a Shuttle orbiter. The record height also permitted the crew to photograph Earth&#x27;s large-scale geographic features not apparent from lower orbits. Motion pictures were recorded by two IMAX cameras, and the results appeared in the 1994 IMAX film &quot;Destiny in Space&quot;. Experiments on the mission included a biomedical technology study, advanced materials research, particle contamination and ionizing radiation measurements, and a student science project studying zero-gravity effects on electronic arcs. &quot;Discovery&quot;″s reentry from its higher-than-usual orbit required a deorbit burn of 4 minutes and 58 seconds, the longest in Shuttle history up to that time. &quot;Discovery&quot; orbited the Earth 80 times during the mission.

During the deployment of Hubble, one of the observatory&#x27;s solar arrays stopped as it unfurled. While ground controllers searched for a way to command HST to unreel the solar array, Mission Specialists McCandless and Sullivan began preparing for a contingency spacewalk in the event that the array could not be deployed through ground control. The array eventually came free and unfurled through ground control while McCandless and Sullivan were pre-breathing inside the partially depressurized airlock.

Secondary payloads included the IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) to document operations outside the crew cabin and a handheld IMAX camera for use inside the orbiter. Also included were the Ascent Particle Monitor (APM) to detect particulate matter in the payload bay; a Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiment to provide data on growing protein crystals in microgravity, Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME III) to measure gamma ray levels in the crew cabin; Investigations into Polymer Membrane Processing (IPMP) to determine porosity control in the microgravity environment, and an Air Force Maui Optical Site (AMOS) experiment.

The mission marked the flight of an human skull, which served as the primary element of &quot;Detailed Secondary Objective 469&quot;, also known as the In-flight Radiation Dose Distribution (IDRD) experiment. This joint NASA/DoD experiment was designed to examine the penetration of radiation into the human cranium during spaceflight. The female skull was seated in a plastic matrix, representative of tissue, and sliced into ten layers. Hundreds of thermo-luminescent dosimeters were mounted in the skull&#x27;s layers to record radiation levels at multiple depths. This experiment, which also flew on STS-28 and STS-36, was located in the shuttle&#x27;s mid-deck lockers on all three flights, recording radiation levels at different orbital inclinations.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base in California on April 29, 1990, at 13:49:57UTC (6:49:57amPDT, local time at the landing site). The landing had a rollout distance of , took 61 seconds, and marked the first use of carbon brakes on a shuttle. &quot;Discovery&quot; was returned to Kennedy Space Center after STS-31 on May 7, 1990.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="183329" wikidata="Q938082" url="?curid=183329" title="Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)">
<text>Aldwyn Roberts HBM DA (18 April 1922 – 11 February 2000), better known by the stage name Lord Kitchener (or &quot;Kitch&quot;), was a Trinidadian calypsonian. He has been described as &quot;the grand master of calypso&quot; and &quot;the greatest calypsonian of the post-war age&quot;.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in Arima, Trinidad and Tobago, the son of a blacksmith, Stephen, and housewife, Albertha. He was educated at the Arima Boys Government School until he was 14, when his father died, leaving him orphaned. His father had encouraged him to sing and taught him to play the guitar, and he became a full-time musician.

==Music career==
He moved to Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad in 1943 where he joined the Roving Brigade. He was spotted singing &quot;Mary I am Tired and Disgusted&quot; (aka &quot;Green Fig&quot;) with the group by Johnny Khan, who invited him to perform in his Victory Tent, where he met fellow calypsonian Growling Tiger, who decided Roberts should from that point be known as Lord Kitchener. He became known as an innovator, introducing musical and lyrical changes, including frequent criticism of the British government&#x27;s control of the island. During World War II Kitchener became popular with US troops based on the island, leading to performances in New York. After the end of World War II, the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival took place in early March 1946, during which Kitchener won his very first official Road March title with a catchy calypso leggo called &quot;Jump In The Line&quot;.

He toured Jamaica for six months in 1947–48 with Lord Beginner (Egbert Moore) and Lord Woodbine (Harold Phillips) before they took passage on the &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; to England in 1948. Upon his arrival at Tilbury Docks, Kitchener performed the specially-written song &quot;London Is the Place for Me&quot;, which he sang live on a report for Pathé News.

Within two years he was a regular performer on BBC radio, and was much in demand for live performances. He found further success in the UK in the 1950s, building a large following in the expatriate communities of the West Indian islands, and having hits with &quot;Kitch&quot;, &quot;Food from the West Indies&quot;, &quot;Tie Tongue Mopsy&quot;, and &quot;Alec Bedser Calypso&quot;, while remaining popular in Trinidad and Tobago.

His prominence continued throughout the 1950s, when calypso achieved international success. Kitchener became a very important figure to those first 5,000 West Indian migrants to the UK. His music spoke of home and a life that they all longed for but in many cases could not or would not return to. He immortalised the defining moment for many of the migrants in writing the &quot;Victory Calypso&quot; with its lyrics &quot;Cricket, Lovely Cricket&quot; to celebrate West Indies cricket team&#x27;s first victory over England in England, in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s in June 1950. This was one of the first widely known West Indian songs, and epitomised an event that historian and cricket enthusiast C. L. R. James defined as crucial to West Indian post-colonial societies.

Kitchener opened a nightclub in Manchester and also had a successful residency at The Sunset in London. Further US performances followed in the mid-1950s. In the 1950s, he also composed &quot;Bebop Calypso&quot;.

In 1962, he returned to Trinidad, where he and the Mighty Sparrow proceeded to dominate the calypso competitions of the 1960s and 1970s. Lord Kitchener won the road march competition 10 times between 1963 and 1976, more often than any other calypsonian. For 30 years, he ran his own calypso tent, Calypso Revue, within which he nurtured the talent of many calypsonians. Calypso Rose, David Rudder, Black Stalin and Denyse Plummer are among the many artists who got their start under Kitchener&#x27;s tutelage. Later he moved towards soca, a related style, and continued recording until his death. Kitchener&#x27;s compositions were enormously popular as the chosen selections for steel bands to perform at the annual National Panorama competition during Trinidad Carnival. He won his only Calypso King title in 1975 with &quot;Tribute to Spree Simon&quot;. He stopped competing in 1976.

Kitchener saw the potential of the new soca phenomenon of the late 1970s and adopted the genre on a string of albums over the years that followed. In 1977 he recorded his most commercially successful song, and one of the earliest major soca hits, &quot;Sugar Bum Bum&quot;, which became a big hit for the 1978 Trinidad Carnival season.

In 1993 a campaign was launched for Kitchener to receive the island&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Trinity Cross. The government declined but offered him a lesser honour, which he turned down.

Having been diagnosed with bone marrow cancer, Kitchener retired in 1999 after delivering a final album, &quot;Vintage Kitch&quot;. He died on 11 February 2000 of a blood infection and kidney failure at the Mount Hope Hospital in Port of Spain. He is buried in the Santa Rosa Cemetery in Arima.

It was always important to Kitchener throughout his career to gain new experiences that could be woven into his material. This led him to performances in Curaçao, Aruba and Jamaica in the early days, and finally to London, when he was already flying high in Trinidad. Kitchener once said: &quot;I have reached the height of my popularity in Trinidad. What am I doing here? I should make a move.&quot;

Kitchener is honoured with a statue in Port of Spain. A bust is also on display on Hollis Avenue, Arima, not far from the Arima Stadium.

==Family==
In 1952, he met his wife Elsie Lines. They married in 1953, and lived for a period in Manchester where Kitchener ran a nightclub. Together, they adopted a baby, to be named Tyrone Roberts, and the three of them moved back to Trinidad. They divorced in 1968. He later married and had four children (Christian, Kernel, Quweina and Kirnister Roberts) with Valerie Green, and also had a relationship with Betsy Pollard.

Kitchener&#x27;s son Kernal Roberts is also a performer, playing drums for a soca band Traffik in the 90&#x27;s and then in the early 2000s, Xtatik. He was also their musical director and is a composer of multiple Soca Monarch and Road March titles.

<text>A chassis (, ; plural &quot;chassis&quot; from French châssis ) is the load-bearing framework of a manufactured object, which structurally supports the object in its construction and function. An example of a chassis is a vehicle frame, the underpart of a motor vehicle, on which the body is mounted; if the running gear such as wheels and transmission, and sometimes even the driver&#x27;s seat, are included, then the assembly is described as a rolling chassis.

==Examples==
===Vehicles===
In the case of vehicles, the term &quot;rolling chassis&quot; means the frame plus the &quot;running gear&quot; like engine, transmission, drive shaft, differential, and suspension. The &quot;rolling chassis&quot; description originated from assembly production when an integrated chassis &quot;rolled on its own tires&quot; just before truck bodies were bolted to the frames near the end of the line. An underbody (sometimes referred to as &quot;coachwork&quot;), which is usually not necessary for the integrity of the structure, is built on the chassis to complete the vehicle.

For commercial vehicles, a rolling chassis consists of an assembly of all the essential parts of a truck without the body to be ready for operation on the road. A car chassis will be different from one for commercial vehicles because of the heavier loads and constant work use. Commercial vehicle manufacturers sell &quot;chassis only&quot;, &quot;cowl and chassis&quot;, as well as &quot;chassis cab&quot; versions that can be outfitted with specialized bodies. These include motor homes, fire engines, ambulances, box trucks, etc.

In particular applications, such as school buses, a government agency like National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. defines the design standards of chassis and body conversions.

An armoured fighting vehicle&#x27;s hull serves as the chassis and comprises the bottom part of the AFV that includes the tracks, engine, driver&#x27;s seat, and crew compartment. This describes the lower hull, although common usage might include the upper hull to mean the AFV without the turret. The hull serves as a basis for platforms on tanks, armoured personnel carriers, combat engineering vehicles, etc.

In the intermodal trucking industry, a chassis is a type of semi-trailer onto which a cargo container can be mounted for road transport.

===Electronics===

In an electronic device (such as a computer), the chassis consists of a frame or other internal supporting structure on which the circuit boards and other electronics are mounted.

In some designs, such as older ENIAC sets, the chassis is mounted inside a heavy, rigid cabinet, while in other designs such as modern computer cases, lightweight covers or panels are attached to the chassis.

The combination of chassis and outer covering is sometimes called an &quot;enclosure&quot;.

===Firearms===

In firearms, the chassis is a bedding frame on long guns such as rifles to replace the traditionally wooden stock, for the purpose of better accurizing the gun. The chassis is usually made from hard metallic material such as aluminium alloy (and less frequently stainless steel, titanium alloy or recently magnesium alloy) due to metals having superior stiffness and compressive strength compared with wood or synthetic polymer, which are commonly used in conventional rifle stocks.

The chassis essentially functions as a more extensive pillar bedding, providing a metal-on-metal bearing surface that has reduced shifting potential under the stress of recoil. A barreled action bedded into a metal chassis would theoretically operate more consistently during repeated firing, resulting in better precision. With the increasing availability of CNC machining, chassis have become more affordable and sophisticated as well as gained increasing popularity as these types of chassis can be expanded to accommodate customizable &quot;furniture&quot; (buttstock, pistol grip, etc.) and rail interface systems that provide mounting points for various accessories.

<text>Theophilus Philip (23 March 1926 – 24 December 1960), better known as Mighty Spoiler, was a Trinidadian calypsonian.

Spoiler&#x27;s career began in 1946 (see 1946 in music) at the House of Lords Tent, and he soon became one of the most popular calypso singers, known for hits such as &quot;Bedbug&quot;, &quot;Magistrate Try Himself&quot;, &quot;Picking Sense From Nonsense&quot;, &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;. He won the Calypso King title on three occasions, in 1948 (with &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;), 1953 (&quot;Bed Bug&quot;), and 1955 (&quot;Picking Sense From Nonsense&quot;).

He died in 1960 of an alcohol-related illness.

==Legacy==
Derek Walcott in his poem &quot;The Spoiler&#x27;s Return&quot; borrows the calypsonian&#x27;s persona, reworking his &quot;Bedbug&quot; calypso and making satirical use of Spoiler&#x27;s trademark incantation: &quot;Ah wanna fall!&quot;

Among Spoiler&#x27;s students was Grenadian-born calypsonian The Mighty Bomber (Clifton Ryan).

<text>Willie Lee Perryman (October 19, 1911 – July 25, 1985), usually known professionally as Piano Red and later in life as Dr. Feelgood, was an American blues musician, the first to hit the pop music charts. He was a self-taught pianist who played in the barrelhouse blues style (a loud percussive type of blues piano suitable for noisy bars or taverns). His performing and recording careers emerged during the period of transition from completely segregated &quot;race music&quot; to rhythm and blues, which was marketed to both white and black audiences. Some music historians credit Perryman&#x27;s 1950 recording &quot;Rocking With Red&quot; for the popularization of the term rock and roll in Atlanta. His simple, hard-pounding left hand and his percussive right hand, coupled with his cheerful shout, brought him considerable success over three decades.

==Early life==
Perryman was born on a farm near Hampton, Georgia, United States, where his parents, Ada and Henry Perryman, were sharecroppers. He was part of a large family, though sources differ on exactly how many brothers and sisters he had. Perryman was an albino African American, as was his older brother Rufus, who also had a blues piano career as &quot;Speckled Red&quot;.

When Perryman was six years old, his father gave up farming and moved the family to Atlanta, where he worked in a factory. Not much is known about Perryman&#x27;s education or early life, but he recalled that his mother bought a piano for her two albino sons. Both brothers had very poor vision, an effect of their albinism, so neither took formal music lessons, but they developed their barrelhouse style through playing by ear. Perryman sometimes recalled imitating Rufus&#x27;s style after watching him play, but it is doubtful that his brother was a major influence. Rufus, nineteen years older than Perryman, left Georgia in 1925 and did not return until a 1960 visit. Another influence that Perryman cited in interviews was Fats Waller, whose records his mother brought home. Other influences were likely the local blues pianists playing at &quot;house&quot; or &quot;rent&quot; parties, which were common community fund-raisers of that era.

==Career==
===1930s–1940s===
By the early 1930s, Perryman was playing at house parties, juke joints, and barrelhouses in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee. He developed his percussive playing style and harsh singing style to compensate for the lack of sound systems and to overcome the noise of people talking in venues. He worked these circuits with other Georgia bluesmen, including Barbecue Bob, Charlie Hicks, Curley Weaver, and Blind Willie McTell.

He obtained seasonal employment performing in Brevard, North Carolina, a mountain resort town, and commuted back and forth between there and Atlanta. The Brevard job brought him before white audiences; by 1934 he had also begun to play at white clubs in Atlanta. In Atlanta he would play at a white club until midnight and then head over to an African-American club, where he would play until 4 a.m. Perryman developed a repertoire of pop standards, which were more popular among the white audiences, while continuing his blues sets in African-American clubs.

Around 1936 he began to be billed as &quot;Piano Red&quot;. He made his first recordings with McTell in Augusta for Vocalion Records, but they were never released. He also began working as an upholsterer, a trade which he occasionally maintained through later years.

===1950s–1960s===
In 1950, after spending the previous 14 years upholstering and playing music on weekends, Perryman recorded &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Red&quot; and &quot;Red&#x27;s Boogie&quot; at the WGST radio studios in Atlanta for RCA Victor. Both songs became national hits, reaching numbers five and three, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Red&quot; has since been covered many times under many titles. This success, along with the further hits &quot;The Wrong Yo Yo&quot; (allegedly written by Speckled Red), &quot;Laying the Boogie&quot; and &quot;Just Right Bounce&quot;, allowed him to resume an active performing schedule. He also recorded sessions in New York City and Nashville during the early 1950s.

Red played for white teenagers&#x27; high school parties in people&#x27;s homes in Atlanta. Patrons would arrange for him to be picked up at his home and returned and would provide a &quot;bottle&quot; of booze for him and a modest fee.

During the mid-1950s, Perryman also worked as a disc jockey on radio stations WGST and WAOK in Atlanta, broadcasting &quot;The Piano Red Show&quot; (later &quot;The Dr. Feelgood Show&quot;) directly from a shack in his back yard. A young James Brown made an appearance on his show in the late 1950s. Perryman&#x27;s involvement had him appearing on a flatbed truck in many parades, which led to his song &quot;Peachtree Parade&quot;. From the mid-1950s until the late 1960s, he recorded for several record labels, including Columbia, for which he made several records; Checker, for which he recorded eight sides with Willie Dixon on bass; and Groove Records, a subsidiary of RCA Victor, producing the first hit for that label.

Signed to Okeh Records in 1961, Perryman began using the name Dr. Feelgood and the Interns, releasing several hits, including the much-covered &quot;Doctor Feelgood&quot;. The persona was one he had initially adopted on his radio shows. The new career was short-lived, though, and he was never able to regain his former stature. In 1963, The Merseybeats recorded a cover of the B-side of &quot;Doctor Feelgood,&quot; entitled &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; (written by Roy Lee Johnson) as the B-side of their UK top 5 hit &quot;I Think of You&quot;. It was also recorded by The Beatles, appearing on the album &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; in the United Kingdom and the album &quot;Beatles &#x27;65&quot; in the United States. In 1966, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful recorded Perryman&#x27;s song &quot;Bald Headed Lena&quot; on their second album, &quot;Daydream&quot;.

===Late career===
Perryman continued to be a popular performer in Underground Atlanta. He made several European tours late in his career, including appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival, the Berlin Jazz Festival, and the inauguration of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, and he also performed on BBC Radio. During this time, he was befriended by Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, and Paul McCartney, and Pete Ham of Badfinger wrote a song in his honor.

Muhlenbrink&#x27;s Saloon closed in 1979, and Perryman found himself without a regular job. That lasted until 1981, when he was hired to perform five nights a week at the Excelsior Mill in Atlanta. In 1984, he asked co-owner Michael Reeves to arrange a live recording, and Reeves arranged for a mobile recording in October of that year.

In 1985, Perryman recorded the song &quot;Yo Yo&quot;, a duet with Danny Shirley, who was later the lead singer of the band Confederate Railroad. The record reached the national chart in that year.

The tapes from the Excelsior Mill remained in Reeves&#x27;s possession for twenty-five years. In April 2010, he formed a partnership with the writer and producer David Fulmer to release a CD of the recording under the title &quot;The Lost Atlanta Tapes&quot;. The CD was released by Landslide Records on August 17, 2010.

==Personal life==
Perryman married in the early 1930s, and he and his wife, Flora, had two daughters.

===Death and funeral===
Perryman was diagnosed with cancer in 1985. He died in July that same year, at Dekalb General Hospital in Decatur, Georgia. Among those who attended his funeral were the governor of Georgia and the mayor of Atlanta.

==Legacy==
Piano Red&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; was covered by several UK beat groups, including The Beatles and Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, who recorded it as the B-side of their 1964 single &quot;Always and Ever&quot;.

<text>Dragonlance is a shared universe created by Laura and Tracy Hickman, and expanded by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis under the direction of TSR, Inc. into a series of fantasy novels. The Hickmans conceived &quot;Dragonlance&quot; while driving in their car on the way to TSR for a job interview. Tracy Hickman met his future writing partner Margaret Weis at TSR, and they gathered a group of associates to play the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. The adventures during that game inspired a series of gaming modules, a series of novels, licensed products such as board games, and lead miniature figures.

In 1984, TSR published the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; game module, &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;, and the first novel, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;. The novel began the &quot;Chronicles&quot; trilogy, a core element of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; world. While the authoring team of Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis wrote the setting&#x27;s central books, numerous other authors contributed novels, short stories and game supplements to the setting. Over 190 novels have used the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting; the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign setting has also been used for multiple editions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and for the SAGA System. Following Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s acquisition of TSR in 1997, Wizards licensed &quot;Dragonlance&quot; to Margaret Weis&#x27;s company Sovereign Press to produce game materials; this licensing agreement ran from 2001 to 2007. &quot;Dragonlance&quot; returned in 2022 with a new adventure module and the start of a new novel trilogy.

The fictional &quot;Dragonlance&quot; world of Krynn contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography. The history of Krynn consists of five ages. The novels and related game products are primarily set in the fourth age, The Age of Despair. Since the publication of &quot;&quot; in 1996, the fifth age, the Age of Mortals, has been used. The Heroes of the Lance, created by Weis and Hickman, are the popular protagonists of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; trilogy. Along with &quot;D&amp;D&quot; world of the &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot; is one of the most popular shared worlds in fiction.

== Publication history ==
=== Creation ===

Hickman developed his world creation technique by writing and self-publishing with his wife Laura the adventure modules &quot;Rahasia&quot; (1979) and &quot;Pharaoh&quot; (1980), and writing TSR&#x27;s &quot;Ravenloft&quot; module (1983). He was unemployed in 1982, and TSR offered him a job based on his submission of several modules. That year, while driving from Utah to Wisconsin to start a job with TSR, Hickman and his wife created the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; universe concept. During the trip, Hickman and his wife discussed two ideas they had had for several years: an entire world used to support a storyline, and a world dominated by dragons.

Their ideas were well received by TSR, whose marketing department felt they had enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, after a period of months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various &quot;Endless Quest&quot; books for TSR. The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for &quot;Project Overlord&quot;, the cover name for what would later be known as the Dragonlance saga.

TSR decided to create a franchise, including modules, board games, lead figures, and - for the first time - novels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren&#x27;t satisfied with the author, and decided they should be the ones to write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;, based on the module &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released the module &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot; and the novel &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot; in March and November 1984, respectively. TSR had doubts about the finished novel&#x27;s sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. The novel was written after the completion of the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; game modules. Weis and Hickman felt this was constraining and made the novel feel too episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written. &quot;Dragonlance&quot; received support products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.

=== Further development ===

In the mid to late 1980s, a rift developed between TSR and the authors. Weis and Hickman were feeling under-appreciated and, when TSR turned down their &quot;Darksword&quot; series of novels, they went to Bantam Books. Bantam made them an offer, which they accepted, and they stopped writing &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels for TSR. They returned to write &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; for TSR in 1995, thinking it would be their final &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel. At the time, &quot;Dragonlance&quot; gaming had been converted to the SAGA System, with limited success, and that, combined with TSR&#x27;s general financial troubles, put the setting&#x27;s future in doubt. Wizards of the Coast bought the troubled TSR in 1997, and Weis and Hickman then proposed the &quot;War of Souls&quot; trilogy, which was published in 2000-2002. All three novels made the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, and the setting was commercially revitalized. By 1998, the original &quot;Dragonlance&quot; trilogy had sold well over three million copies worldwide and spawned dozens of sequels. The central books of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series were written by the authoring team of Weis and Hickman, but many other writers have made contributions, including Richard A. Knaak, Douglas Niles, Roger E. Moore, Don Perrin, Jean Rabe, Paul B. Thompson, Tonya C. Cook, Michael Williams, Nancy Varian Berberick, and Chris Pierson.

In 2001, Wizards of the Coast licensed Sovereign Press to publish further &quot;Dragonlance&quot; game materials. This began with the newly revised &quot;Dragonlance Campaign Setting&quot; in 2003, which used the new &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd Edition rules. In April 2007, Wizards of the Coast had not renewed Sovereign&#x27;s license, and &quot;Dragonlance&quot; RPG game supplements and accessories were only released through the end of the year.

In October 2020, Weis and Hickman filed suit against Wizards of the Coast for breaching a licensing deal with Weis and Hickman for a new &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel trilogy. &quot;Boing Boing&quot; reported that &quot;according to the lawsuit, Weis and Hickman agreed with Wizards of the Coast to produce the new novels in 2017, capping off the series and giving fans a final sendoff, but the company pulled the plug in August 2020&quot;. In December, Weis and Hickman filed to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice their lawsuit, and &quot;the filing noted that Wizards of the Coast had not formally answered their lawsuit, nor had they filed for a summary judgement&quot;. Weis and Hickman&#x27;s publishing agent affirmed a few weeks following this that a new trilogy of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels was in the works; the first of the new trilogy was released in August 2022.

In December 2022, the first Dragonlance adventure module, titled &quot;&quot;, for 5th Edition was released. The module is set during the War of the Lance; Wizards of the Coast has stated that the module does not require prior knowledge of the setting or the novels to play the module. An integrated board game, titled &quot;Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn&quot;, was released in 2023, designed by Stephen Baker and Rob Daviau. &quot;Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn&quot; is a wargame that focuses on military battles during the War of the Lance. Both games can be played independently, but the adventure module includes rules for using the board game to resolve the military battles that occur in the narrative.

== Media ==
=== Campaign setting ===
TSR created &quot;Dragonlance&quot; as a campaign setting for the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) roleplaying game in 1982, publishing the first of a series of modules, &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;, in March 1984. They published the first world-spanning sourcebook, &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot;, in 1987. When &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; was updated to the 2nd edition in 1989, the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign setting was updated as well. However, in 1996, &quot;Dragonlance&quot; was converted to use the new SAGA System, which uses cards to determine the effects of actions, with the publication of the &quot;&quot; roleplaying game. 

When the 3rd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released in 2000, &quot;Dragonlance&quot; was not initially updated for the new edition. In 2002, Margaret Weis&#x27;s company Sovereign Press acquired the license to publish 3rd Edition &quot;Dragonlance&quot; material. The official update, &quot;Dragonlance Campaign Setting&quot;, was published in 2003 for the 3.5 Edition. Wizards of the Coast turned over all responsibility for maintaining the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting to Sovereign Press until 2007. The campaign setting was not supported during the 4th Edition era (2008-2013) of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

In March 2022, Wizards released the PDF &quot;Heroes of Krynn&quot; which is part of the &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; public playtest series for the 5th Edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. &quot;Polygon&quot; commented that this &quot;all but confirmed&quot; the return of the Dragonlance setting. The setting was revisited in December 2022 with a new adventure module for the 5th Edition. On December 6, Wizards released the adventure book &quot;Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen&quot;.

=== Novels ===

The main storyline of the original &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series has been written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, with multiple books written by other authors, covering years between and sometimes during the main events.
* The &quot;Chronicles&quot; trilogy relates the events since the meeting of the Companions until the end of the War of the Lance and the defeat of the Dragon armies of Ansalon.
* The &quot;Lost Chronicles&quot; trilogy is a companion to the original &quot;Chronicles&quot;. Each book of the trilogy fills in sections of the story previously left untold. It tells the story surrounding the recovery of the Hammer of Kharas, how the Companions retrieve the dragon orb from Ice Wall, how Kitiara Uth Matar and Lord Soth became allies, and how Raistlin Majere took the Black Robes in Neraka.
* The &quot;Legends&quot; trilogy covers the Blue Lady&#x27;s War, as well as the past adventures of Raistlin and Caramon Majere, culminating in Raistlin&#x27;s attempt to achieve godhood. The books feature time travel, and focus on events in Istar before the Cataclysm, as well as the ensuing Dwarfgate Wars.
* &quot;The Second Generation&quot; is a single compilation book which picks the most important tales from the &quot;Tales&quot; series and details the children of the Companions, all of whom become players in the later story. This book is considered to be part of the main storyline, as it must be read to understand the events that happened between the War of the Lance and the Chaos War. This novel develops characters that would later be seen in the &quot;War of Souls&quot; trilogy.
* &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; covers the Chaos War, also known as the Second Cataclysm. The gods and mortals join forces to defeat Chaos in his attempt to destroy Krynn. The war ends with the withdrawal of Chaos and the gods of Krynn in a divine agreement to keep the world safe.
* &quot;Dragons in the Archives: The Best of Weis and Hickman Anthology&quot; is another compilation of short stories which were previously published in other anthologies. These stories take place at different points of time in the world of Krynn. This book provides backstory to some of the characters and situations presented in the &quot;War of Souls&quot; trilogy. 
* &quot;The War of Souls&quot; trilogy begins as a strange storm courses through Krynn, heralding the War of Souls. The end of the war brings the return of the gods, Takhisis&#x27;s death, and the departure of Paladine as head of the good gods in order to maintain the balance between Good and Evil.
* &quot;The Dark Disciple&quot; trilogy follows the death of Takhisis and the departure of Paladine, when the lesser gods strive to maintain dominance.

=== Video games ===

Eight video games are set in the Dragonlance world. They belong to six different genres and were released within five years, from 1988 to 1992.

&quot;DL01 - Dragons of Despair&quot; and &quot;DL02 - Dragons of Flame&quot; (corresponding to the events in the first novel, &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;) were adapted into the video games &quot;Heroes of the Lance&quot; and &quot;Dragons of Flame&quot;, respectively. Instead of being role-playing video games, they are platform games using the Silver Box game engine. &quot;DL03 - Dragons of Hope&quot; and &quot;DL04 - Dragons of Desolation&quot; (corresponding to the events between the first and the second novel) were adapted into the video game &quot;Shadow Sorcerer&quot;. Released in 1991, this early real-time strategy game is a direct sequel to the first two games and a prequel to &quot;War of the Lance&quot; (1989). &quot;DL11 - Dragons of Glory&quot; is a self-contained tabletop strategy game (corresponding to the events in the background of the third novel, &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot;) that was adapted into the turn-based strategy game &quot;War of the Lance&quot;.

&quot;DragonStrike&quot; is a 1990 combat flight simulation game whose plot begins halfway through the previous video game. The 1992 NES remake is a scrolling shooter that features an ending different from the one in the novels, but following and fixing a &quot;bad ending&quot; from &quot;DL14 - Dragons of Triumph&quot;. Neither game is based directly on any tabletop module. The Gold Box trilogy (&quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;, &quot;Death Knights of Krynn&quot;, and &quot;The Dark Queen of Krynn&quot;) are the only role-playing video games based on Dragonlance. They tell an original story that begins shortly after the events in the 14 tabletop modules.

Apart from those, the MUSH game &quot;DragonLance&quot; is based on Krynn during the final stage of the War of the Lance.

=== Other ===
The series has inspired mention in music as well, including &quot;Wishmaster&quot;, a song by Nightwish based partially on the master and apprentice relationship between Raistlin Majere and Dalamar. The Swedish metal band Lake of Tears also recorded a song called &quot;Raistlin and the Rose&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Crimson Cosmos&quot;, while the German group Blind Guardian wrote &quot;The Soulforged&quot;, another song inspired by Raistlin&#x27;s story, which appeared on the band&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;. Also Danish/American band Pyramaze recorded in their 2008 album &quot;Immortal&quot; song &quot;Caramon&#x27;s Poem&quot;. A Russian concept album (2009-2010) and musical (premiered 2014) based on Raitslin&#x27;s story, &quot;The Last Trial&quot;, was created by Anton Kruglov and Yelena Khanpira. 

In 2008, &quot;&quot;, an animated film based on the first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; book of the same name, was released direct-to-video. The animation was produced by Toonz Animation, and featured the voices of Lucy Lawless, Kiefer Sutherland, Michael Rosenbaum, and Michelle Trachtenberg. In late 2011, Holysoft Studios Ltd. released the first part of a German audio adaption of the Chronicles Trilogy, with subsequent releases of the later trilogies being announced.

In comics, Krynn has been represented on the 1988 &quot;Dragonlance&quot; series by DC Comics and TSR. More recently, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing and Wizards of the Coast have also produced a number of comic book series: &quot;The Legend of Huma&quot; (2003), &quot;Chronicles&quot; (2005) and &quot;Legends&quot; (2008).

== World ==
The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; world is described in dozens of books and novels. The setting contains numerous characters, an extensive timeline, and a detailed geography.

=== Setting ===

&quot;Dragonlance&quot; is set on the world of Krynn. The majority of the novels take place in the various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world&#x27;s major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending on the time period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn&#x27;s most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, good Solinari, neutral Lunitari, and evil Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in &quot;Dragonlance&quot; spells. During Krynn&#x27;s various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. Any dragon egg can be used to make a draconian, although the ones most commonly used are good dragon eggs because the evil kings want more evil dragons to hatch.

Other gods of the setting include the gods of good Branchala, Habbakuk, Kiri-Jolith, Majere, and Mishakal; the gods of neutrality Chislev, Reorx, Shinare, Sirrion, and Zivilyn; and the gods of evil, Chemosh, Hiddukel, Morgion, Sargonnas, and Zeboim.

=== Fictional history ===
The history of the world of Krynn, and thus the settings for both the novels and gaming supplements, is roughly split into five separate ages. The first age is the time of creation, when the gods are born and Krynn is formed. The Age of Dreams, the second age, is marked by the rapid growth of the world&#x27;s first great civilizations and the appearance of myriad new races. This era is also marked by three great wars between dragons and their minions. Following the Third Dragon War, in the Age of Might, the Cataclysm obliterates the great empire of Istar and changes almost the entire surface of Krynn. A 300-year depression follows this event, in what is called the Age of Despair. This period also marks the War of the Lance. When Dragonlance was first introduced to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, events such as the Lost Wars happened during The Age of Despair. Later Age of Mortals novels and game supplements took Krynn into the Fifth Age (the Age of Mortals).

=== Dragonlances ===
Dragonlances are weapons first created in the Third Dragon War, designed with the purpose of killing evil dragons, and are the only weapons with which mortals who cannot use magic can kill dragons. Dragonlances have this power because of the way in which they are created, which requires the use of &quot;two god-blessed artifacts&quot;. 

Dragonlances are rare and not commonly traded. There are lesser dragonlances, which are made when only one of the artifacts is used to create them, and greater dragonlances, which are made when both artifacts are used to make them. Greater dragonlances are blessed with the power of Good, unlike lesser dragonlances.

There are two sizes of dragonlance. The smaller footman&#x27;s dragonlance is around eight feet long and functions as a polearm, while the larger mounted dragonlance is around sixteen feet long and most commonly used when mounted on a dragon.

=== Characters ===

The Heroes of the Lance are the protagonists of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; trilogy, the first series of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; books. They were created by Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player characters in gaming sessions of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; at Hickman&#x27;s apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to &quot;The Soulforge&quot;, &quot;[we] were just settling in to the game when I turned to my good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone in the room was both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [Weis] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night&quot;.

In a &quot;Traveling Road Show&quot; put on to publicize the novels, the Heroes of the Lance were played by various people. Authors Gary and Janet Pack played the half-elf Tanis Half-Elven and the kender Tasslehoff Burrfoot, respectively. Author Douglas Niles played the dwarf Flint Fireforge. TSR employee Harold Johnson played the Solamnic knight Sturm Brightblade. The rest of the Heroes are the barbarians Goldmoon and Riverwind, elf Laurana Kanan, and humans Caramon Majere (Raistlin&#x27;s brother) and Tika Waylan. Weis played Fizban the Fabulous.

In the beginning, Margaret Weis had problems depicting Tanis Half-Elven in the novels. Tracy Hickman finally told her that &quot;he&#x27;s James T. Kirk of the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot;. After that explanation, Margaret had no more difficulty writing about Tanis. Other noteworthy antagonists, and sometimes protagonists, are the Death Knight Lord Soth and Kitiara Uth Matar, the half-sister of Raistlin and Caramon, and leader of one of the Dragonarmies of Ansalon. According to Hickman, Lord Soth is the most unpredictable character to write about: &quot;Every time that character made an appearance in one of our books he would try to run off with the story&quot;.

===Locations===
The world of Dragonlance is set on the planet of Krynn, with most of the action taking place on the continent of Ansalon. Some of the key countries and areas on Ansalon are the Plains of Dust, Solamnia with its great metropolis, Palanthas, the Blood Sea Isles, the Empire of Ergoth, Istar, and Sancrist, the elven kingdom of Silvanesti, as well as the dwarven realm of Thorbardin. Important cities and towns and other locations include Solace (location of the Inn of the Last Home, and Sad Town), the High Clerist&#x27;s Tower, Palanthas, Kendermore, Port Balifor (location of the Pig and Whistle Tavern), and the various Towers of High Sorcery.

===Races===
Like in many &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign settings, the fictional world of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign is shaped by the division by race, with white humans as the central focus, but also including elves, goblins, and many others. With the species in many cases clearly assigned to &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, some critics have suggested that the setting had the potential to raise racist expectations. The authors take an active stance against racist ideology and ensure that a &quot;fascistic genocidal campaign to wipe-out species that are considered &#x27;impure&#x27;&quot; would have catastrophic consequences. In contrast, the authors emphasize the need for tolerance and cooperation between the races.

== Reception ==
&quot;Dragonlance&quot; is one of the most popular shared worlds, worlds in which writers other than those that created them place adventures. The first &quot;Dragonlance&quot; trilogy, &quot;Chronicles&quot;, launched the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; line of novels, with many of its characters spun off into other novels. Along with &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot; is TSR&#x27;s most popular series of novels. According to &quot;The 1990s&quot; by Marc Oxoby, what is most notable about the series is that &quot;what may at one time been considered disposable, escapist literature&quot; found &quot;unprecedented popularity&quot; in the 1990s. All of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels remained in print during the decade, turning Weis and Hickman into literary stars and boosting sales of their non-&quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels. Although the series was initially published in paperback, its success led to hardcover printings. The hardcover version of &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; had an &quot;impressive&quot; first printing of 200,000 books. Every &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novel by Weis and Hickman since 1995 has been released in hardcover, and some previous novels have been re-released in hardcover collector&#x27;s editions. &quot;Dragonlance&quot; made TSR one of the most successful publishers of science fiction and fantasy in the 1990s.

By 2008, there were more than 190 novels in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; franchise. Weis and Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels have made over twenty bestseller lists, with sales in excess of 22 million. The pair&#x27;s novels have been translated into German, Japanese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Spanish, French, Italian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Greek and Turkish and have sold well in the United States, Britain, and Australia.

Not all critics have praised &quot;Dragonlance&quot; and its creators. According to author Stephen Hunt, Wendy Bradley of &quot;Interzone&quot; magazine does not think highly of their work. Hunt feels that it is unusual for authors to receive such loathing among &quot;fantasy&#x27;s literary mafia&quot;, saying that &quot;behind every critic&#x27;s scorn laden insult, there that unsaid thought at the end: &#x27;But I could have written that! &quot;Visions of Wonder&quot;, edited by David G. Hartwell and Milton T. Wolf, and published by the Science Fiction Research Association, argues that &quot;Dragonlance&quot; is published under the &quot;omnivore theory&quot; of publishing. In this theory, the readership is made up of teenagers, and completely replaces itself every three to five years. This allows publishers to release subpar novels and still reach a small yet profitable audience.

<text>A bicycle brake reduces the speed of a bicycle or prevents the wheels from moving. The two main types are: rim brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes are less common on bicycles.

Most bicycle brake systems consist of three main components: a mechanism for the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of the bike and rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.

==History==
Karl Drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 . This was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals, such as the boneshaker, which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel. The brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars. The rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed-wheel drive.

The next development of bicycles, the penny-farthings, were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling. During its development from 1870 to 1878, there were various designs for brakes, most of them operating on the rear wheel. However, as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller, with more of the rider&#x27;s weight over the front wheel, braking on the rear wheel became less effective. The front brake, introduced by John Kean in 1873, had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power.

Some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills, but most also used a brake. Having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars, although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills. Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.

An alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by Browett and Harrison in 1887. This early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing&#x27;s small rear tyre.

The 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today, with two wheels of equal size, initially with solid rubber tyres. These were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism, but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears, allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals. The relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes. In the late 1890s came the introduction of rim brakes and the freewheel.

With the introduction of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck&#x27;s Cyclery in Oakland, California, was granted a patent for his &quot;Duck Roller Brake&quot; (U.S. Patent 594,234). The Duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.

In 1898, after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms, the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel. The coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub, and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling, thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear. In the United States, the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century, often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle.

==Brake types==

===Spoon brakes===
The spoon brake or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre. Spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle. The spoon brake consists of a pad (often leather) or metal shoe (possibly rubber faced), which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre. These were almost always rod-operated by a right-hand lever. In developing countries, a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters. It consists of a spring-loaded flap attached to the back of the fork crown. This is depressed against the front tyre by the rider&#x27;s foot.

Perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake, the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically.

Though made obsolete by the introduction of the Duck brake, coaster brake, and rod brake, spoon brakes continued to be used in the West supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s, and on children&#x27;s bicycles until the 1950s. In the developing world, they were manufactured until much more recently.

===Duck brake===
Invented in 1897, the Duck brake or Duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers (usually made of wood or rubber) against the front tyre. Mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre, the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre, thus braking the front wheel. A tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking. Braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar, which provided additional leverage when braking (two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary). Used in combination with a rear coaster brake, a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake. Known colloquially as the &quot;duck brake&quot;, the design was used by many notable riders of the day, and was widely exported to England, Australia, and other countries. In 1902, Louis H. Bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the Duck Roller Brake (Patent 708,114) for use on motorized bicycles (motorcycles).

===Rim brakes===
Rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel, thus slowing it and the bicycle. Brake pads can be made of leather, rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal &quot;shoes&quot;. Rim brakes are typically actuated by a lever mounted on the handlebar.

==== Advantages and disadvantages ====

Rim brakes are inexpensive, light, mechanically simple, easy to maintain, and powerful. However, they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet, and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped. Because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads, rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes (where braking surfaces are higher from the ground), particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces. The low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes, where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions. The light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles.

Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads wear down and have to be replaced. As they wear down, their position may need to be adjusted as the material wears away. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims can become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.

During braking, the friction surfaces (brake pads and rims) will experience thermal heating. In normal use this is not a problem, as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time, so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air. However, on a heavily laden bike on a long descent, heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up, which may damage components and cause brake failure.

A ceramic coating for the rims is available which may reduce wear and can also improve both wet and dry braking. It may also slightly reduce heat transfer to the inside of the rims because it is a thermal insulator.

====Brake pads====

Brake pads are available with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are held in place by a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more braking force with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force, but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.

Ceramic-coated rims should be used with special pads because of heat build-up at the pad-rim interface; standard pads can leave a &quot;glaze&quot; on the ceramic braking surface, reducing its inherent roughness and leading to a severe drop in wet-weather braking performance. Ceramic pads usually contain chromium compounds to resist heat.

For wet-weather use, brake pads containing iron (iii) oxide are sometimes used as these have higher friction on a wet aluminum rim than the usual rubber. These salmon-colored pads were first made by Scott-Mathauser and are now produced by Kool-Stop.

To minimise excessive rim wear, a brake pad should be hard enough that it does not embed road grit or chips of rim metal in the face of the pad, since these act as grinding/gouging agents and markedly reduce rim life.

====Types of rim brakes====
The following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes:

=====Rod-actuated brakes=====

The rod-actuated brake, or simply rod brake (roller lever brake in Raleigh terminology), uses a series of rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to transmit force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called &quot;stirrup brakes&quot; due to their shape. Rod brakes are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads on opposite sides of the rim.

The rear linkage mechanism is complicated by the need to allow rotation where the fork and handlebars attach to the frame. A common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear coaster brake. Although heavy and complex, the linkages are reliable and durable and can be repaired or adjusted with simple hand tools. The design is still in use, typically on African and Asian roadsters such as the Sohrab and Flying Pigeon.

===== Caliper brakes =====
The caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel, theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim. Arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim. While some designs incorporate dual pivot points — the arms pivot on a sub-frame — the entire assembly still mounts to a single point.

Caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider, and so deeper, reducing the brakes&#x27; mechanical advantage. Thus caliper brakes are rarely found on modern mountain bikes. But they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes, particularly the dual-pivot side-pull caliper brake.

=====Side-pull caliper brakes=====

Single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim. These arms have extensions on one side, one attached to the cable, the other to the cable housing. When the brake lever is squeezed, the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim.

These brakes are simple and effective for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made long enough to fit wide tyres. If not adjusted properly, low quality varieties tend to rotate to one side during actuation and tend to stay there, making it difficult to evenly space brake shoes away from the rim. These brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes.

Dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes are used on most modern racing bicycles. One arm pivots at the centre, like a side-pull; and the other pivots at the side, like a centre-pull. The cable housing attaches like that of a side-pull brake. These brakes offer a higher mechanical advantage, and result in better braking. Dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and cannot accurately track an out-of-true rim, or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing. It is common to see professional racers climbing mountains with the quick-release undone on the rear brake, to eliminate drag from this source.

Direct mount rim brakes employ two mounting points, increasing stiffness and braking power. It was developed by Shimano and released as an open standard. Individual mounting points for each arm ease the centering of side-pull brakes, and accommodate tire widths of 30 mm and more.

=====Centre-pull caliper brakes=====

Centre-pull caliper brakes have symmetrical arms and therefore centre more effectively. The cable housing attaches to a fixed cable stop attached to the frame, and the inner cable bolts to a sliding piece (called a &quot;braking delta&quot;, &quot;braking triangle&quot;, or &quot;yoke&quot;) or a small pulley, over which runs a &quot;straddle cable&quot; connecting the two brake arms. Tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms, preventing the brake from taking a &quot;set&quot; to one side or the other.

These brakes were reasonably priced, and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes. They are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter, reducing flex. It is important that the fixed bridge holding the pivots is very stiff.

=====U-brakes=====

U-brakes (also known by the trademarked term 990-style) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake. The difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt. Like roller cam brakes, this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim. Thus U-brakes are often interchangeable with, and have the same maintenance issues as, roller cam brakes.

U-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the mid-to-late 1980s, particularly under the chain stays, a rear brake mounting location that was then popular. This location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness, an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force. Unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud, which meant that U-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes.

U-brakes are the current standard on Freestyle BMX frames and forks. The U-brake&#x27;s main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal, and the exposed parts are smooth. This is especially valuable on freestyle BMX bikes where any protruding parts are susceptible to damage and may interfere with the rider&#x27;s body or clothing.

=====Cantilever brakes=====
The cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork. Thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot. Both first- and second-class lever designs exist; second-class is by far the more common. In the second-class lever design, the arm pivots below the rim. The brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together. In the first-class lever design, the arm pivots above the rim. The brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart.
Due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads, cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres, such as on mountain bikes. Because the arms move only in their designed arcs, the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes. Thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust. As the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears, they ride lower on the rim. Eventually, one may go underneath the rim, so that the brake does not function.

There are several brake types based on the cantilever brake design: cantilever brakes and direct-pull brakes – both second class lever designs – and roller cam brakes and U-brakes – both first class lever designs.

=====Traditional cantilever brakes=====
Traditional cantilever brakes pre-date the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull cantilever design with an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable stop on the frame or fork to terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the brake lever pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.

Originally, cantilever brakes had nearly horizontal arms and were designed for maximum clearance on touring or cyclo-cross bicycles. When the mountain bike became popular, cantilever brakes were adopted for these too, but the smaller MTB frames meant that riders often fouled the rear brake arms with their heels. &quot;Low profile&quot; cantilevers were designed to overcome this, where the arms are closer to 45 degrees from horizontal. Low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type.

Traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspension and protrude somewhat from the frame. Accordingly, they are usually found only on bicycles without suspension.

=====V-brakes=====

Linear-pull brakes or direct-pull brakes, commonly referred to by Shimano&#x27;s trademark V-brakes, are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses. However, the arms are longer, with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other. As the cable pulls against the housing, the arms are drawn together. Because the housing enters from vertically above one arm yet force must be transmitted laterally between arms, the flexible housing is extended by a rigid tube with a 90° bend known as the &quot;noodle&quot; (a noodle with a 135° bend is used where the front brake is operated by the right hand, as this gives a smoother curve in the cable housing). The noodle is seated in a stirrup attached to the arm. A flexible bellows often covers the exposed cable.

Since there is no intervening mechanism between the cable and the arms, the design is called &quot;direct-pull&quot;. And since the arms move the same distance that the cable moves with regard to its housing, the design is also called &quot;linear-pull&quot;. The term &quot;V-brake&quot; is trademarked by Shimano and represents the most popular implementation of this design. Some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear.

V-brakes function well with the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes because they do not require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork. Because of the higher mechanical advantage of V-brakes, they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes. Mechanical (i.e. cable-actuated) disc brakes use the same amount of cable travel as V-brakes, except for those that are described as being &quot;road&quot; specific. As a general rule, mechanical disc brakes for so-called &quot;flat bar&quot; bicycles (chiefly mountain and hybrid bicycles) are compatible with V-brake levers, whereas mechanical disc brakes intended for &quot;drop-bar&quot; bicycles are compatible with the cable pull of older brake designs (cantilever, caliper, and U-brake).

Poorly designed V-brakes can suffer from a sudden failure when the noodle end pulls through the metal stirrup, leaving the wheel with no braking power. Although the noodle can be regarded as a service item and changed regularly, the hole in the stirrup may enlarge through wear. The stirrup cannot normally be replaced, so good-quality V-brakes use a durable metal for the stirrup.

Mini V-brakes (or mini Vs) are V-brakes with shorter arms, typically between 8 and 9 centimeters. This reduces the required cable pull, making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes. Mini V-brakes retain advantages specific to V-brakes such as not requiring extra cable stops. On the downside, their shorter arms provide very small tyre and wheel clearance and generally make for a less forgiving setup: they can only accommodate smaller tyre sizes compared to cantilever brakes, may pose problems for mounting fenders, can be clogged more easily by mud, and they can make it harder to change wheels.

V-brakes always use thin and relatively long brake pads. The thin pads ease wheel removal, which is achieved by pushing the arms together and unhooking the noodle from the stirrup. The additional length gives good pad life by compensating for the thinner material depth.

=====Roller cam brakes=====

Roller cam brakes are centre-pull cantilever brakes actuated by the cable pulling a single two-sided sliding cam. (First- and second-class lever designs exist; first-class is most common and is described here.) Each arm has a cam follower. As the cam presses against the follower it forces the arms apart. As the top of each arm moves outward, the brake shoe below the pivot is forced inward against the rim. There is much in favor of the roller cam brake design. Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. They also require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre&#x27;s sidewall.

The roller cam design was first developed by Charlie Cunningham of WTB around 1982 and licensed to Suntour. Roller cam brakes were used on early mountain bikes in the 1980s and into the 1990s, mounted to the fork blades and seat stays in the standard locations, as well as below the chain stays for improved stiffness as they do not protrude to interfere with the crank. It is not unusual for a bicycle to have a single roller cam brake (or U-brake) combined with another type. They are still used on some BMX and recumbent bicycles.

There are two rare variants that use the roller cam principle. For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull toggle cam brake was developed. Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided sliding cam (the toggle) against one arm that is attached by a link to the other arm. As the cam presses against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull &quot;sabre cam brake&quot; was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.

=====Delta brakes=====

The delta brake is a road bicycle brake named due to its triangular shape. The cable enters at the centre, pulls a corner of a parallelogram linkage housed inside the brake across two opposite corners, pushing out at the other two corners on to the brake arms above the pivots, so that the arms below the pivots push pads in against the rim. A feature of the design is that the mechanical advantage varies as a tangent function across its range, where that of most other designs remains fixed.

Many consider the brake attractive, and it has a lower wind profile than some other common brakes. However, &quot;Bicycle Quarterly&quot; criticized the delta brake for being heavy, giving mediocre stopping power, and suffering disadvantageous variable mechanical advantage. In particular, with a small parallelogram, pad wear causes mechanical advantage to rise dramatically. However, with high leverage, the stroke of the lever is not enough to fully apply the brake, so the rider can have brakes that feel normal in light braking but which cannot be applied harder for hard braking.

The basic design dates from at least the 1930s. They were made most prominently by Campagnolo in 1985, but brakes based on the same mechanism were also manufactured by Modolo (Kronos), , and others. They are no longer made and are now uncommon.

=====Hydraulic rim brakes=====
Hydraulic rim brakes are one of the least common types of brakes. They are mounted either on the same pivot points used for cantilever and linear-pull brakes or they can be mounted on four-bolt brake mounts found on many trials frames. They were available on some high-end mountain bikes in the early 1990s, but declined in popularity with the rise of disc brakes. The moderate performance advantage (greater power and control) they offer over cable actuated rim brakes is offset by their greater weight and complexity. Some e-bikes continue to use them since they are powerful, relatively low-maintenance and weight is less of an issue when electric assistance is available.

===Disc brakes===
A disc brake consists of a metal disc, or &quot;rotor&quot;, attached to the wheel hub that rotates with the wheel. Calipers are attached to the frame or fork along with pads that squeeze the rotors for braking. Disc brakes may be actuated mechanically by cable, or hydraulically.

Disc brakes are most common for mountain bikes (including nearly all downhill bikes), and are also seen on some hybrid bicycles and touring bicycles. Towards the end of the 2010s, disc brakes have become increasingly common also on racing bicycles. A disc brake is sometimes employed as a drag brake for controlled speed reduction on steep descents.

Many hydraulic disc brakes have a self-adjusting mechanism so as the brake pad wears, the pistons keep the distance from the pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same brake lever throw. Some hydraulic brakes, especially older ones, and most mechanical discs have manual controls to adjust the pad-to-rotor gap. Several adjustments are often required during the life of the pads.

====Advantages====
Disc brakes tend to perform equally well in all conditions including water, mud, and snow due to several factors:

* The braking surface is farther from the ground and possible contaminants like mud which can coat or freeze on the rim and pads. With rim brakes, the first point that mud builds up on a mountain bike ridden in thick mud is usually the brakes. A mountain bicycle with disc brakes is less susceptible to mud buildup provided the rear frame and front fork yoke have sufficient clearance from the wheels.
* Disc brakes may be made of materials that dissipate heat better than the wheel rim, but undersized sport-sized discs will be too small to take advantage of this fact.
* There are holes in the rotor, providing a path for water and debris to get out from under the pads.
* Wheel rims tend to be made of lightweight metal. Brake discs and pads are harder and can accept higher maximum loads.
* It is possible to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disc brakes, where it would not be possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads.

Other reasons include:
* While all types of brakes will eventually wear out the braking surface, a brake disc is easier and cheaper to replace than a wheel rim or drum.
* The use of very wide tyres favors disc brakes, as rim brakes require ever-longer arms to clear the wider tyre. Longer arms tend to flex more, degrading braking. Disc brakes are unaffected by tyre width.
* Unlike some rarer rim brake designs, disc brakes are compatible with front and rear suspension.
*Different wheel sizes can be used with the same frame: i.e. the same frame built for 29″ tires can often also fit 27.5″+ (650+) tires, despite the two wheel sizes having different rim diameters. This is possible with disc brakes, so long as the rotor sizes are consistent and the frame has enough clearance; with rim brakes, this would be impossible, as the different rim sizes would not allow the same rim brakes to work with a different sized wheel. Wheel size optionality with disc brakes allows the rider more options, including using a smaller diameter rim-sized wheel (such as 27.5″+) with a higher volume wider tire with the same outer diameter size as a larger rim-sized wheel (such as 29″) – the outer diameter consistency is important as it preserves the geometry of the frame between the two different wheel sizes.

====Disadvantages====
====Hydraulic vs. &quot;mechanical&quot;====
There are two main types of disc brake: &quot;mechanical&quot; (cable-actuated) and hydraulic. Advantages and disadvantages are highly discussed by the users of each system. As advantages of cable-actuated disc brakes are argued lower cost, lower maintenance, and lighter system weight, hydraulic disc brakes are said to offer more braking power and better control. Cable-actuated disc brakes were traditionally the only type of disc brake that could be used with the brake levers found on drop handlebars, but this is no longer the case.

====Single vs. dual actuation====
Many disc brakes have their pads actuated from both sides of the caliper, while some have only one pad that moves. Dual actuation can move both pads relative to the caliper, or can move one pad relative to the caliper, then move the caliper and other pad relative to the rotor, called a &quot;floating caliper&quot; design. Single-actuation brakes use either a multi-part rotor that floats axially on the hub, or bend the rotor sideways as needed. Bending the rotor is theoretically inferior, but in practice gives good service, even under high-force braking with a hot disc, and may yield more progressiveness.

====Multiple pistons====
For disc brakes with a hydraulic system, high-performance calipers usually use two or three pistons per side; lower-cost and lower-performance calipers often have only one per side. Using more pistons allows a larger piston area and thus increased leverage with a given master cylinder. Also, pistons may be of several sizes so pad force can be controlled across the face of the pad, especially when the pad is long and narrow. A long narrow pad may be desired to increase pad area and thus reduce the frequency of pad changes. In contrast, a single large piston may be heavier.

====Caliper mounting standards====
There are many standards for mounting disc brake calipers. However, most manufactures today use either the &quot;IS&quot; or &quot;post-mount&quot; (PM) standards. These differ by disc size and axle type. In 2014 Shimano introduced a &quot;Flat Mount&quot; standard for high end road bikes and uses it exclusively for its top tier brake calipers.

====Advantages and disadvantages of various types of mounts====
A disadvantage of post mounts is that the bolt is threaded directly into the fork lowers. If the threads are stripped or if the bolt is stuck, then the threads will need to be repaired, or the seized bolt drilled out. Frame manufacturers have standardized the IS mount for the rear disc brake mount. In recent years post mount has gained ground and is becoming more common. This is mostly due to decreased manufacturing and part cost for the brake calipers when using post mount. A limitation of the mount is that the location of the rotor is more constrained: it is possible to encounter incompatible hub/fork combinations, where the rotor is out of range.

====Disc mounting standards====

There are many options for rotor mounting. IS is a six-bolt mount and is the industry standard. Center Lock is patented by Shimano and uses a splined interface along with a lockring to secure the disc. The advantages of Center Lock are that the splined interface is theoretically stiffer, and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one lockring to be removed. Some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from Shimano. A Shimano cassette lockring tool (or an external BB tool in case of through-axle hub) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a Torx key. Advantages of IS six-bolt are that there are more choices when it comes to hubs and rotors.

Adaptors enable the use of six-bolt discs on Center Lock hubs.

Examples of mounting standards are shown here:
* International Standard (IS), 6-Bolt 44 mm bolt circle diameter (BCD)
* Center Lock (Shimano proprietary)
* Hope Technology&#x27;s 3-bolt pattern (proprietary)
* Rohloff&#x27;s 4-bolt pattern (proprietary)

====Disc sizes====
Rotors come in many different sizes, such as and diameter. Other sizes are available as manufacturers make discs specific to their calipers; the dimensions often vary by a few millimeters. Larger rotors provide greater braking torque for a given pad pressure, by virtue of a longer moment arm for the caliper to act on. Smaller rotors provide less braking torque but also less weight and better protection from knocks. Larger rotors dissipate heat more quickly and have a larger amount of mass to absorb heat, reducing brake fade or failure. Downhill bikes usually have larger brakes to handle greater braking loads. Cross country bicycles usually use smaller rotors which handle smaller loads but offer considerable weight savings. It is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking (up to 90% of the total).

===Drum brakes===

Bicycle drum brakes operate like those of a car, although the bicycle variety use cable rather than hydraulic actuation. Two pads are pressed outward against the braking surface on the inside of the hub shell. Shell inside diameters on a bicycle drum brake are typically . Drum brakes have been used on front hubs and hubs with both internal and external freewheels. Both cable- and rod-operated drum brake systems have been widely produced.

A Roller Brake is a modular cable-operated drum brake manufactured by Shimano for use on specially splined front and rear hubs. Unlike a traditional drum brake, the Roller Brake can be easily removed from the hub. Some models contain a torque-limiting device called a power modulator designed to make it difficult to skid the wheel. In practice this can reduce its effectiveness on bicycles with adult-sized wheels.

Drum brakes are most common on utility bicycles in some countries, especially the Netherlands, and are also often found on cargo bikes and velomobiles. Older tandem bicycles often employ a rear drum brake as a drag brake.

Drum brakes provide consistent braking in wet or dirty conditions since the mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable as well as the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.

===Coaster brakes===

Invented in 1898 by Willard M. Farrow, the &quot;coaster brake&quot;, also known as a &quot;back pedal brake&quot; or &quot;foot brake&quot; (&quot;torpedo&quot; or &quot;contra&quot; in some countries, in Italy ), is a type of drum brake integrated into the back hub with an internal freewheel. Freewheeling functions as with other systems, but when back pedaled, the brake engages after a fraction of a revolution. The coaster brake can be found in both single-speed and internally geared hubs.

When such a hub is pedaled forwards, the sprocket drives a screw which forces a clutch to move along the axle, driving the hub shell or gear assembly. When pedaling is reversed, the screw drives the clutch in the opposite direction, forcing it either between two brake shoes and pressing them against the brake mantle (which is a steel liner within the hub shell), or into a split collar and expanding it against the mantle. The braking surface is often steel, and the braking element brass or phosphor-bronze, as in the Birmingham-made Perry Coaster Hub. Crude coaster brakes also exist, usually on children&#x27;s bicycles, where a serrated steel brake cone grips the inside of the hub shell directly, with no separate brake pads or mantle. These offer a less progressive action and are more likely to lock the rear wheel unintentionally.

Unlike most drum brakes (but like a Shimano Roller Brake) a coaster brake is designed to run with all its internal parts coated in grease for quiet operation and smooth engagement. Most grey molybdenum disulphide greases work well in a coaster brake, with its metal-to-metal friction surfaces.

Coaster-brake bicycles are generally equipped with a single cog and chain wheel and often use an wide chain. However, there have been several models of coaster brake hubs with derailleurs, such as the Sachs 2×3. These use special extra-short derailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the brake engages. Coaster brakes have also been incorporated into hub gear designs – for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.

Coaster brakes have the advantage of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the &#x27;Repack Downhill&#x27; race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.

===Drag brakes===
A drag brake is a type of brake defined by its use rather than by its mechanical design.

A drag brake is intended to provide a constant decelerating force to slow a bicycle on a long downhill rather than to stop it; a separate braking system is used to stop the bicycle. A drag brake is often employed on a heavy bicycle such as a tandem in mountainous areas where extended use of rim brakes could cause a rim to become hot enough to blow out.; The typical drag brake has long been a drum brake. The largest manufacturer of this type of brake is Arai, whose brakes are screwed onto hubs with conventional freewheel threading on the left side of the rear hub and operated via Bowden cables. As of 2011, the Arai drum brake has been out of production for several years, with remaining stocks nearing depletion and used units commanding premium prices on internet auction sites.

More recently, large-rotor disc brakes are being used as drag brakes. (Some tandem riders with Avid BB-7 mechanical disc brakes and 203 mm rotors report fewer heat problems under heavy braking than when using the previous standard of comparison, an Arai drum used as a drag brake.) DT-Swiss make an adapter to mate disc rotors with hubs threaded for the Arai drum brake, but this still leaves the problem of fitting the caliper.

===Band brake===
A band brake consists of a band, strap, or cable that wraps around a drum that rotates with a wheel and is pulled tight to generate braking friction. Band brakes appeared as early as 1884 on tricycles. Star Cycles introduced a band brake in 1902 on its bicycles with freewheels. Band brakes were still being manufactured for bicycles in 2010.

A rim band brake, as implemented on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, consists of a stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel on the side of the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.

==Actuation mechanisms==
The actuation mechanism is that part of the brake system that transmits force from the rider to that part of the system that does the actual braking. Brake system actuation mechanisms are either mechanical or hydraulic.

===Mechanical===
The primary modern mechanical actuation mechanism uses brake levers coupled to Bowden cables to move brake arms, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. Cable mechanisms are usually less expensive, but may require some maintenance related to exposed areas of the cable. Other mechanical actuation mechanisms exist: see Coaster brakes for back-pedal actuation mechanisms, and rod-actuated brakes for a mechanism incorporating metal rods. The first Spoon brakes were actuated by a cable that was pulled by twisting the end of a handlebar.

===Hydraulic===

Hydraulic brakes also use brake levers to push fluid through a hose to move pistons in a caliper, thus forcing pads against a braking surface. While hydraulic rim brakes exist, today the hydraulic actuation mechanism is identified mostly with disc brakes. Two types of brake fluid are used today: mineral oil and DOT fluid. Mineral oil is generally inert, while DOT is corrosive to frame paint but has a higher boiling point. Using the wrong fluid can cause seals to swell or become corroded. A hydraulic mechanism is closed and therefore less likely have problems related to contamination at exposed areas. Hydraulic brakes rarely fail, but failure tends to be complete. Hydraulic systems require specialized equipment to repair.

====Hydraulic brake fluid====
Hydraulic disc brakes make use of two common forms of fluid: Automotive grade DOT 4 or DOT 5.1 which are hygroscopic and has a boiling point of 230 °C; and mineral oil which is not hygroscopic and has varying boiling points depending on the type. O-rings and seals inside the brake are specifically designed to work with one or the other fluid. Using the incorrect fluid type will cause the seals to fail resulting in a &quot;squishy&quot; feeling in the lever, and the caliper pistons are unable to retract, so a scraping disc is common. The brake fluid reservoir is usually marked to indicate the type of brake fluid to be used.

===Hybrid===
Some older designs, like the AMP and Mountain Cycles brakes, use a cable from lever to caliper, then use a master cylinder integrated into the piston. Some Santana tandem bicycles used a cable from lever to a master cylinder mounted near the head tube, with a hydraulic line to the rear wheel caliper. Such &quot;hybrid&quot; designs allow the leverage of a hydraulic system while allowing use of cable brake levers, but may be heavier and can suffer from grit intrusion in the standard cable.

An older Sachs drum brake kit (&quot;Hydro Pull&quot;) allows to rebuild a regular Sachs bicycle drum brake to hydraulic lever and action. A piston is added outside the drum instead of the bowden clamp. This solution is often seen on modified Long John cargo bikes, allowing a low friction lever pull front wheel brake action. After Sachs ceased production of this kit a similar solution is sometimes done by welding on a Magura piston to the drum cylinder lever. Welding was necessary because the Magura action is reverse to that of the Sachs kit.

===Brake levers===

Brake levers are usually mounted on the handlebars within easy reach of the rider&#x27;s hands. They may be distinct from or integrated into the shifting mechanism. The brake lever transmits the force applied by the rider through either a mechanical or hydraulic mechanism.

Bicycles with drop handlebars may have more than one brake lever for each brake to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the &#x27;70s, were called &quot;extension levers,&quot; &quot;safety levers &quot; or, due to their reputation for being unable to actuate the full range of travel of the brake, &quot;suicide levers&quot;. Modern top-mounted brake levers are considered safer, and are called &quot;interrupt brake levers&quot; due to their mechanism of action which &quot;interrupts&quot; the cable run from the primary lever and actuates the brake by pushing the cable housing downward instead of pulling the cable. This type of lever is also known as a &quot;cross lever&quot; due to its popularity in cyclo-cross.

The mechanical advantage of the brake lever must be matched to the brake it is connected to in order for the rider to have sufficient leverage and travel to actuate the brake. Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much mechanical advantage and hence not enough travel to properly actuate the brake (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little mechanical advantage, requiring a very strong pull to apply the brakes hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).

Mechanical (cable) brake levers come in two varieties based on the length of brake cable pulled for a given amount of lever movement:
* &quot;Standard pull&quot; levers work with most brake designs, including caliper brakes, traditional cantilever brakes, and mechanically actuated disc brakes branded for &quot;Road&quot;.
* &quot;Long pull&quot; levers work with &quot;direct-pull&quot; cantilever brakes, such as Shimano &quot;V-Brakes&quot;, and mechanically actuated disc brakes branded for &quot;Mountain&quot;.
Adapters are available to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim brake. Some brake levers have adjustable leverage that can be made to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contacts the brake surface. Hydraulic brake levers move a piston in a fluid reservoir. The mechanical advantage of the lever depends on the brake system design.

==Braking technique==
The motion dynamics of a bicycle will cause a transfer of weight to the front wheel during braking, improving the traction on the front wheel. If the front brake is used too hard, momentum may cause the rider and bike to pitch forward – a type of crash sometimes called an &quot;endo&quot;. Light use of the rear brake causes a light skid as the bicycle approaches the limit where pitchover will occur, a signal to reduce force on the front brake. On a low-traction surface or when turning, the front wheel will skid, the bicycle cannot be balanced and will fall to the side instead.

On tandem bicycles and other long-wheel-base bicycles (including recumbents and other specialized bicycles), the lower relative centre of mass makes it virtually impossible for heavy front braking to flip the bicycle; the front wheel would skid first.

In some situations, it is advisable to slow down and to use the rear brake more and the front brake less:
* When unfamiliar with the braking characteristics of a bicycle. It is important to test the brakes and learn how much hand force is needed when first riding it.
* When leaning in a turn (or preferably, brake before turning).
* Slippery surfaces, such as wet pavement, mud, snow, ice, or loose stones/gravel. It is difficult to recover from a front-wheel skid on a slippery surface, especially when leaned over.
* Bumpy surfaces: If the front wheel comes off the ground during braking, its rotation will cease completely. Landing on a stopped front wheel with the brakes still applied is likely to cause the front wheel to skid and may flip the rider over the handlebar.
* Very loose surfaces (such as gravel and loose dirt): In some loose-surface situations, it may be beneficial to completely lock up the rear wheel in order to slow down or maintain control. On very steep slopes with loose surfaces where any braking will cause the wheel to skid, it can be better to maintain control of the bicycle by the rear brake more than one would normally. However neither wheel should stop rotating completely, as this will result in very little control.
* Steep descents: the slope angle makes the front flip more easily achieved, and moreover a front-wheel skid would be very difficult to recover (crash highly probable), whereas a rear skid does still drag the bike without losing too much control.
* Long descents: alternating the front and back brake can help prevent hand fatigue and overheating of the wheel rims which can cause a disastrous tyre blow-out, or boiling of the hydraulic fluid in case of hydraulic disc brakes.
* Flat front tyre: braking a tyre that has little air can cause the tyre to come off the rim, which is likely to cause a crash.

It is customary to place the front brake lever on the left in right-side-driving countries, and vice versa, because the hand on the side nearer the centre of the road is more commonly used for hand signals. Placing the front brake lever on the right also mimics the layout on motorcycles and is advantageous to avoid confusion when switching to and from a pedal cycle to motorcycle.

==Bicycles without brakes==
Track bicycles are built without brakes so as to avoid sudden changes in speed when racing on a velodrome. Since track bikes have a fixed gear, braking can be accomplished by reversing the force on the pedals to slow down, or by locking the pedals backwards and inducing a skid. Fixed gear road bikes may also lack brakes, and slowing or stopping is accomplished as with a track bike. Many fixed gear bikes however are fitted with a front brake for safety reasons, or because it is a legal requirement. Some BMX bicycles are built without brakes to forgo the expense and complication of a detangler. The usual method of stopping is for the rider to put one or both feet on the ground, or to wedge a foot between the seat and the rear tyre, effectively acting as a spoon brake. Cycle speedway is a type of close track racing in the UK, Poland, Australia, and France. The special built bike has a single freewheel and no brakes. Slowing is done during cornering by dragging the inside foot. These bikes are not intended for road use and are kept at the track.

In Belgium, Australia, Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Poland, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, it is illegal to ride a bicycle without brakes on a public road.

==Single-lever two-wheel brakes==
The SureStop braking system uses a single lever to actuate the front brake using the friction applied to the back brake shoes by the rotation of the rear wheel from the rear brake. It is claimed this reduces the risk of some braking-related accidents including going over the handlebars. 

This system emphasises the use of the rear brake, fails to optimise use of front braking, whilst being marketed as a solution to the fear of toppling over handle bars. The system encourages complacent use of brake levers by cyclists and reinforces the myth that the front brakes of bicycles are dangerous. Since this system means that the brakes on both wheels are directly tied together, the legality of such a system varies based on nation.

Cyclists young and old should seek training in the effective use of both brakes to stop in the minimum possible stopping distance in an emergency.

<text>Mount Hood, also known as Wy&#x27;east, is an active stratovolcano in the Cascade Range and is a member of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific Coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties, and forms part of the Mount Hood National Forest. Much of the mountain outside the ski areas is part of the Mount Hood Wilderness. With a summit elevation of 11,249 ft (3,429 m), it is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Oregon and is the fourth highest in the Cascade Range. Ski areas on the mountain include Timberline Lodge ski area which offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America, Mount Hood Meadows, Mount Hood Skibowl, Summit Ski Area, and Cooper Spur ski area. Mt. Hood attracts an estimated 10,000 climbers a year.

The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields. Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt. The odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7%, so the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) characterizes it as &quot;potentially active&quot;, but the mountain is informally considered dormant.

==Establishments==
Timberline Lodge is a National Historic Landmark located on the southern flank of Mount Hood just below Palmer Glacier, with an elevation of about .

The mountain has four ski areas: Timberline, Mount Hood Meadows, Ski Bowl, and Cooper Spur. They total over of skiable terrain; Timberline, with one lift having a base at nearly , offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.

There are a few remaining shelters on Mount Hood still in use today. Those include the Coopers Spur, Cairn Basin, and McNeil Point shelters as well as the Tilly Jane A-frame cabin. The summit was home to a fire lookout in the early 1900s; however, the lookout did not withstand the weather and no longer remains today.

Mount Hood is within the Mount Hood National Forest, which comprises of land, including four designated wilderness areas that total , and more than of hiking trails.

The most northwestern pass around the mountain is called Lolo Pass. Native Americans crossed the pass while traveling between the Willamette Valley and Celilo Falls.

==Naming==
===Indigenous names===
It has been difficult to establish place names for Mount Hood that are of indigenous etymology, or to reconstruct names that may have been used prior to European contact.

==== Wy&#x27;east ====
The name Wy&#x27;east has been associated with Mount Hood for more than a century, but no evidence suggests that it is a genuine name for the mountain in any indigenous language. The name was possibly inspired by an 1890 work of author Frederic Balch, although Balch does not use it himself. The name may have been popularized by his story being combined with a play around 1911 at Pacific College. It is also possible it was &#x27;invented&#x27; by scholars in the 20th century or even a minister hearing it second-hand around the same time the play was happening.

In one version of Balch&#x27;s story, the two sons of the Great Spirit Sahale fell in love with the beautiful maiden Loowit, who could not decide which to choose. The two braves, Wy&#x27;east and Pahto (unnamed in his novel, but appearing in a later adaptation), burned forests and villages in their battle over her. Sahale became enraged and smote the three lovers. Seeing what he had done, he erected three mountain peaks to mark where each fell. He made beautiful Mount St. Helens for Loowit, proud and erect Mount Hood for Wy&#x27;east, and the somber Mount Adams for the mourning Pahto.

There are other versions of the legend. In another telling, Wy&#x27;east (Hood) battles Pahto (Adams) for the fair La-wa-la-clough (St. Helens). Or again Wy&#x27;east, the chief of the Multnomah tribe, competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe. Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes. Their battle is said to have destroyed the Bridge of the Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.

==== Other names ====
The mountain sits partly inside the reservation of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, which comprises multiple languages including Sahaptin, Upper Chinook/Kiksht (Wasco) and Numu (Paiute). However, it has been difficult to determine names originating from these or other indigenous languages specifically referring to Mount Hood. Eugene Hunn suggests that the mountain may have lacked a specific name:Learning a landscape is not simply a matter of naming all the rivers and mountains... The Native American perspective emphasizes by contrast places as focal points of activity, places where significant human-landscape interactions occur. Thus, while a few prominent peaks may be given Indian names, such as taxùma [təqʷuʔməʔ] for Mt. Rainier (in the Puget Salish language) or lawilayt-łà [lawílatɬa], literally &quot;the smoker,&quot; for Mt. St. Helens (in Sahaptin), other prominent peaks, e.g. Mts. Adams and Hood, are known simply as pàtu, a general term for snow-capped summit.

===Current name===

The mountain was given its present name on October 29, 1792, by Lt. William Broughton, a member of Captain George Vancouver&#x27;s exploration expedition. Lt. Broughton observed its peak while at Belle Vue Point of what is now called Sauvie Island during his travels up the Columbia River, writing, &quot;A very high, snowy mountain now appeared rising beautifully conspicuous in the midst of an extensive tract of low or moderately elevated land [location of today&#x27;s Vancouver, Washington] lying S 67 E., and seemed to announce a termination to the river.&quot; Lt. Broughton named the mountain after Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, a British admiral.

Lewis and Clark spotted the mountain on October 18, 1805. A few days later at what would become The Dalles, Clark wrote, &quot;The pinnacle of the round topped mountain, which we saw a short distance below the banks of the river, is South 43-degrees West of us and about . It is at this time topped with snow. We called this the Falls Mountain, or Timm Mountain.&quot; Timm was the native name for Celilo Falls. Clark later noted that it was also Vancouver&#x27;s Mount Hood.

Two French explorers from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company may have traveled into the Dog River area east of Mount Hood in 1818. They reported climbing to a glacier on &quot;Montagne de Neige&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Snow&quot;), probably Eliot Glacier.

===Namesakes===
There have been two United States Navy ammunition ships named for Mount Hood. USS &quot;Mount Hood&quot; (AE-11) was commissioned in July 1944 and was destroyed in November 1944 while at anchor in Manus Naval Base, Admiralty Islands. Her explosive cargo ignited, resulting in 45 confirmed dead, 327 missing and 371 injured. A second ammunition ship, AE-29, was commissioned in May 1971 and decommissioned in August 1999.

==Volcanic activity==

The glacially eroded summit area consists of several andesitic or dacitic lava domes; Pleistocene collapses produced avalanches and lahars (rapidly moving mudflows) that traveled across the Columbia River to the north. The eroded volcano has had at least four major eruptive periods during the past 15,000 years.

The last three eruptions at Mount Hood occurred within the past 1,800 years from vents high on the southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily to the south and west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The volcano has had a VEI of 2 at least three times before. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of the explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event was thought to have occurred in August 1907, but has been discredited as &quot;an observation of non-eruptive fumarolic activity.&quot;
The glaciers on the mountain&#x27;s upper slopes may be a source of potentially dangerous lahars when the mountain next erupts. There are vents near the summit that are known for emitting gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Prior to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the only known fatality related to volcanic activity in the Cascades occurred in 1934, when a climber suffocated in oxygen-poor air while exploring ice caves melted by fumaroles in Coalman Glacier on Mount Hood.

Since 1950, there have been several earthquake swarms each year at Mount Hood, most notably in July 1980 and June 2002.
Seismic activity is monitored by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, which issues weekly updates (and daily updates if significant eruptive activity is occurring at a Cascades volcano).

The most recent evidence of volcanic activity at Mount Hood consists of fumaroles near Crater Rock and hot springs on the flanks of the volcano.

===Monitoring controversy===

A conflict exists between protecting public safety and protecting the environment. In 2014, a USGS employee, Dr. Seth Moran, proposed installing new instruments on Mount Hood to warn of volcanic activity. The instruments were installed at four different locations on the mountain, including:
*three seismometers to measure earthquakes
*three Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments to measure ground movement
*one instrument to measure gas emissions
The proposed locations were in a protected wilderness area, tightly controlled by the United States Forest Service. The project was opposed by Wilderness Watch, a conservation group.

Three monitoring stations were eventually installed on Mount Hood in 2020.

==Elevation==
Mount Hood was first seen by European explorers in 1792 and is believed to have maintained a consistent summit elevation, varying by no more than a few feet due to mild seismic activity. Elevation changes since the 1950s are predominantly due to improved survey methods and model refinements of the shape of the Earth (see vertical reference datum). Despite the physical consistency, the estimated elevation of Mount Hood has varied substantially over the years, as seen in the following table:

Early explorers on the Columbia River estimated the elevation to be . Two people in Thomas J. Dryer&#x27;s 1854 expedition calculated the elevation to be and the tree line to be at . Two months later, a Mr. Belden claimed to have climbed the mountain during a hunting trip and determined it to be upon which &quot;pores oozed blood, eyes bled, and blood rushed from their ears.&quot; Sometime by 1866, Reverend G. H. Atkinson determined it to be . A Portland engineer used surveying methods from a Portland baseline and calculated a height of between . Many maps distributed in the late 19th century cited , though Mitchell&#x27;s School Atlas gave as the correct value. For some time, many references assumed Mount Hood to be the highest point in North America.

Modern height surveys also vary, but not by the huge margins seen in the past. A 1993 survey by a scientific party that arrived at the peak&#x27;s summit with of electronic equipment reported a height of , claimed to be accurate to within . Many modern sources likewise list as the height. However, numerous others place the peak&#x27;s height one foot lower, at . Finally, a height of has also been reported.

==Glaciers==
Mount Hood is host to 12 named glaciers or snow fields, the most visited of which is Palmer Glacier, partially within the Timberline Lodge ski area and on the most popular climbing route. The glaciers are almost exclusively above the level, which also is about the average tree line elevation on Mount Hood. More than 80 percent of the glacial surface area is above .

The glaciers and permanent snow fields have an area of and contain a volume of about . Eliot Glacier is the largest glacier by volume at , and has the thickest depth measured by ice radar at . The largest glacier by surface area is the Coe-Ladd Glacier system at .

Glaciers and snowfields cover about 80 percent of the mountain above the level. The glaciers declined by an average of 34 percent from 1907 to 2004. Glaciers on Mount Hood retreated through the first half of the 20th century, advanced or at least slowed their retreat in the 1960s and 1970s, and have since returned to a pattern of retreat. The neo-glacial maximum extents formed in the early 18th century.

During the last major glacial event between 29,000 and 10,000 years ago, glaciers reached down to the level, a distance of from the summit. The retreat released considerable outwash, some of which filled and flattened the upper Hood River Valley near Parkdale and formed Dee Flat.

Older glaciation produced moraines near Brightwood and distinctive cuts on the southeast side; they may date to 140,000 years ago.
==Hiking==
Mt. Hood National Forest is home to approximately of trails. Cooper Spur Trail leads to in elevation, the highest reachable point one can gain on the mountain without requiring mountaineering gear.

The Timberline Trail, which circumnavigates the entire mountain and rises as high as , was built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Typically, the hike is snow-free from late July until the autumn snows begin. The trail includes over of elevation gain and loss and can vary in distance year to year depending on river crossings. There are many access points, the shortest being a small walk from the Timberline Lodge. A portion of the Pacific Crest Trail is coincident with the Timberline Trail on the west side of Mount Hood.

The predecessor of the Pacific Crest Trail was the Oregon Skyline Trail, established in 1920, which connected Mount Hood to Crater Lake.

==Climbing==
Mount Hood is Oregon&#x27;s highest point and a prominent landmark visible up to away. About 10,000 people attempt to climb Mount Hood each year. It has convenient access, though it presents some technical climbing challenges. There are no trails to the summit, with even the &quot;easier&quot; southside climbing route constituting a technical climb with crevasses, falling rocks, and often inclement weather. Ropes, ice axes, crampons and other technical mountaineering gear are necessary. Peak climbing season is generally from April to mid-June.

There are six main routes to approach the mountain, with about 30 total variations for summiting. The climbs range in difficulty from class 2 to class 5.9+ (for &quot;Acrophobia&quot;). The most popular route, dubbed the south route, begins at Timberline Lodge and proceeds up Palmer Glacier to Crater Rock, the large prominence at the head of the glacier. The route goes east around Crater Rock and crosses the Coalman Glacier on the Hogsback, a ridge spanning from Crater Rock to the approach to the summit. The Hogsback terminates at a bergschrund where the Coalman Glacier separates from the summit rock headwall. The route continues to the Pearly Gates, a gap in the summit rock formation, then right onto the summit plateau and the summit proper.

Technical ice axes, fall protection, and experience are now recommended in order to attempt the left chute variation or Pearly Gates ice chute. The Forest Service recommends several other route options due to these changes in conditions (e.g. &quot;Old Chute,&quot; West Crater Rim, etc.).

===Climbing accidents===
As of May 2002, more than 130 people had died in climbing-related accidents since records have been kept on Mount Hood, the first in 1896. Incidents in May 1986, December 2006, and December 2009 attracted intense national and international media interest. Though avalanches are a common hazard on other glaciated mountains, most Mount Hood climbing deaths are the result of falls and hypothermia. Around 50 people require rescue per year. 3.4 percent of search and rescue missions in 2006 were for mountain climbers.

==Climate==
The summit of Mount Hood has a typical dry-summer alpine climate (Köppen: &quot;ETs&quot;), with temperatures below eight months of the year and no month with an average temperature above . Even in the hottest months, nightly average temperatures often dip below , and frost occurs almost every day, even in summer or the hottest time of year. Otherwise, all months have a dew point below .

<doc id="183350" wikidata="Q457332" url="?curid=183350" title="Ambidexterity">
<text>Ambidexterity is the ability to use both the right and left hand equally well. When referring to objects, the term indicates that the object is equally suitable for right-handed and left-handed people. When referring to humans, it indicates that a person has no marked preference for the use of the right or left hand.

Only about one percent of people are naturally ambidextrous, which equates to about 80,000,000 people in the world today. In modern times, it is common to find some people considered ambidextrous who were originally left-handed and who learned to be ambidextrous, either by choice or as a result of training in schools or in jobs where right-handedness is often emphasized or required. Since many everyday devices such as can openers and scissors are asymmetrical and designed for right-handed people, many left-handers learn to use them right-handedly due to the rarity or lack of left-handed models. Thus, left-handed people are more likely to develop motor skills in their non-dominant hand than right-handed people.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;ambidextrous&quot; is derived from the Latin roots &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;both&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;right&quot; or &quot;favorable&quot;. Thus, &quot;ambidextrous&quot; is literally &quot;both right&quot; or &quot;both favorable&quot;. The term &quot;ambidexter&quot; in English was originally used in a legal sense of jurors who accepted bribes from both parties for their verdict.

==Writing==
Some people can write with both hands. Famous examples include Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Nikola Tesla, James A. Garfield, and Leonardo da Vinci.

In India&#x27;s Singrauli district there is a unique ambidextrous school named Veena Vadini School in Budhela village, where students are taught to write simultaneously with both hands.

==Sports==
===Baseball===
Ambidexterity is advantageous in the sport of baseball, most commonly seen in hitters. A &quot;Switch hitter&quot; is highly prized because a batter is more likely to hit the ball successfully if they bat with the opposite hand to the pitcher&#x27;s throwing hand. An ambidextrous hitter can gain this advantage, against both right and left-handed pitchers. Pete Rose, the record holder for most hits in Major League Baseball, was a switch hitter.

Switch pitchers are comparatively rare in contrast to switch hitters. Tony Mullane won 284 games in the 19th century. Elton Chamberlain and Larry Corcoran were also notable ambidextrous pitchers. In the 20th century, Greg A. Harris was the only major league pitcher to pitch with both his left and his right arm. A natural right-hander, by 1986 he could throw well enough with his left hand that he felt capable of pitching with either hand in a game. Harris was not allowed to throw left-handed in a regular-season game until September 1995 in the penultimate game of his career. Against the Cincinnati Reds in the ninth inning, Harris (then a member of the Montreal Expos) retired Reggie Sanders pitching right-handed, then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters, Hal Morris and Ed Taubensee, who both batted left-handed. Harris walked Morris but got Taubensee to ground out. He then went back to his right hand to retire Bret Boone to end the inning.

In the 21st century there is only one major league pitcher, Pat Venditte of the Seattle Mariners, who regularly pitches with both arms. Venditte became the 21st century&#x27;s first switch pitcher in the major leagues with his debut on June 5, 2015, against the Boston Red Sox, pitching two innings, allowing only one hit and recording five outs right-handed and one out left-handed. During his career, an eponymous &quot;Venditte Rule&quot; was created restricting the ability of a pitcher to change arms in the middle of an at-bat.

Billy Wagner was a natural right-handed pitcher in his youth, but after breaking his throwing arm twice, he taught himself how to use his left arm by throwing nothing but fastballs against a barn wall. He became a dominant left-handed relief pitcher, most known for his 100+ mph fastball. In his 1999 season, Wagner captured the National League Relief Man of the Year Award as a Houston Astro.

St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Brett Cecil is naturally right-handed, but starting from a very early age, threw with his left. As such, he writes and performs most tasks with the right side of his body, but throws with his left.

===Basketball===
In basketball a player may choose to make a pass or shot with the weaker hand. NBA stars LeBron James, Larry Bird, Kyrie Irving, Carlos Boozer, David Lee, John Wall, Derrick Rose, Chandler Parsons, Andrew Bogut, John Henson, Michael Beasley, and Jerryd Bayless are ambidextrous players, as was Kobe Bryant. Bogut and Henson are both stronger in the post with their left-handed hook shot than they are with their natural right hands. Brothers Marc and Pau Gasol can make hook shots with either hand while the right hand is dominant for each. Bob Cousy, a Boston Celtics legend was forced to play with his left hand in high school when he injured his right hand, thus making him effectively ambidextrous. Mike Conley shoots left-handed, but has preferred to shoot floaters right handed, as he does everything else right-handed off the court. Ben Simmons and Luke Kennard are also natural right-handers shooting left-handed. Tristan Thompson is a natural left-hander, and was a left-handed shooter, but has shot right-handed since the 2013–2014 season. He does perform left-handed hook shots more often. Los Angeles Lakers center DeAndre Jordan who is left-handed, shoots with his left hand but has been known to dunk with his right hand, spin clockwise in his 360 dunks, and shoot right handed hook shots more accurately and from further out. Charlotte Hornets power forward Miles Bridges is a left-handed shooter; however, he dunks the ball and blocks shots more frequently with his right hand. Former Los Angeles Lakers center Roy Hibbert shoots his hook shots equally well with either hand. Former Oklahoma City Thunder left-handed point guard Derek Fisher used to dunk with his right hand in his early years. Candace Parker, forward for the Chicago Sky, also has equal dominance with either hand. Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant shot with either hand, although his right hand was dominant: due to an injury to the right hand, he was forced to shoot with his left. Paul George, Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter are all noted to be right-handed, but rotates clockwise for dunks, but Carter is able to also spin counterclockwise, as he did during high school. McGrady also spins anti-clockwise for his baseline dunks. Larry Bird, LeBron James, Paul Millsap, Russell Westbrook, Danny Ainge and Gary Payton shoot right-handed, but do almost everything left-handed off the courts, but Bird once had a game in which he only shot left-handed running hook shots, cross passes and layups. Ronnie Price, however has a tendency to dunk with his left hand, but he is a right-handed shooter. Josh McRoberts is known to be a left handed shooter but does everything with his right hand such as his famous dunks. Ivica Zubac is a right handed shooter, but can shoot hook shots with both hands, and is more accurate with his left handed hooks. Greg Monroe is also a left-handed shooter but does right handed jump hooks and everything else right handed off the court.

Trevor Booker is left handed for shooting a basketball but writes with his right hand. Ben Simmons shoots jumpers and free throws left-handed, but does everything else right-handed, including dunking, throwing long passes and writing. He also shoots more right-handed non-jumpers (layups, floaters and hook shots).

===Board sports===
In skateboarding, being able to skate successfully with not only one&#x27;s dominant foot forward but also the less dominant one is called &quot;skating switch&quot;, and is a prized ability. To illustrate the stances further; there is &quot;Regular&quot; which is left shoulder and foot towards the front of the board and the opposite (right shoulder foot towards the front) is referred to as goofy. These terms are also used in surfing and snowboarding. When skateboarding, whether one pushes with their front or back foot determines whether they are considered regular v. regular-mongo or goofy v. goofy-mongo. The ability to ride both regular and goofy is considered to be &quot;switch stance&quot;. Notable switch skateboarders include Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Guy Mariano, Paul Rodriguez Jr., Mike Mo Capaldi, and Bob Burnquist. Similarly, surfers who ride equally well in either stance are said to be surfing &quot;switch”. Snowboarding, at an advanced level, requires the ability to ride equally well in either stance.

===Combat sports===
In combat sports fighters may choose to face their opponent with either the left shoulder forward in a right-handed stance (&quot;orthodox&quot;) or the right shoulder forward in a left-handed stance (&quot;south-paw&quot;), thus a degree of cross dominance is useful. In boxing, Manny Pacquiao has a southpaw stance in the ring, and is ambidextrous outside the ring. Also, in mixed martial arts, many naturally left-handed strikers like Lyoto Machida and Anderson Silva will switch stances in order to counter opponent&#x27;s strikes or takedown attempts to stay standing. Some fighters choose to fight in a southpaw stance despite their dominant hand being their right, one such fighter being Vasyl Lomachenko. This gives access to a strong and precise jab from the leading hand, which is arguably the most important strike in boxing for setting up combos and interrupting your opponent during their attacks. Bruce Lee also practiced this same method of fighting with his dominant hand forward. Left handed fighters such as Oscar De La Hoya, Miguel Cotto, Andre Ward, and Gerry Cooney fought in orthodox. This made their left hooks their most powerful weapons, along with enhancing the strength of their jab.

===Cricket===
In cricket, it is also beneficial to be able to use both arms. Ambidextrous fielders can make one-handed catches or throws with either hand. Sachin Tendulkar uses his left hand for writing, but bats and bowls with his right hand, it is the same with Ajinkya Rahane, Kane Williamson, and Shane Watson. There are many players who are naturally right-handed but bat left and vice versa. Sourav Ganguly, Thisara Perera uses his right hand for writing and bowls with the right hand, too, but bats with his left hand. Players due to injuries may also switch arms for fielding. Zaheer Khan bowls left-arm fast-medium but bats right handed. Phillip Hughes batted, bowled, and fielded left-handed before a shoulder injury. Australian batsman George Bailey also due to sustaining an injury, taught himself to throw with his weaker left arm. He is now often seen throughout matches switching between arms as he throws the ball. See also reverse sweep and switch hitting. David Warner has batted right-handed in high school, and has practiced right-handed as well, when he is normally a left-handed switch-hitter. Alastair Cook, Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ben Stokes, Eoin Morgan, Ben Dunk, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Travis Head, Chris Gayle, Gautam Gambhir, Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Devdutt Padikkal, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Smriti Mandhana and Kagiso Rabada are natural right-handers, but bat left-handed.

Michael Clarke is naturally a left handed person who bowls left handed but bats right handed.

Akshay Karnewar is an ambidextrous bowler. Originally, he only bowled with his right hand, but since he does everything else with his left hand, he was taught to bowl left-handed as well but needs to signal to the umpire when he switches hands when bowling to allow for the field to change. He is a left-handed batsman. As an off-spinner and left-arm orthodox spin, the ball will always spin towards the batsman (OB vs. RHB; SLO vs. LHB), or away from opposite-handed batsmen, which is the predominant role of switch-handed spinners.

Sri Lankan Kusal Perera started his cricket as a right hand batsman, until he changed to left hand to mimic his favourite cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya bats and bowls left handed but writes with his right hand. Another Sri Lankan Kamindu Mendis is also a handy ambidextrous bowler. He can bowl orthodox left-arm spin and he can bowl right-arm offspin as well. Yasir Jan, however is a fast bowler both right and left handed and tops over 140 km/h with both hands, with his right arm being faster.

Jofra Archer warms up with slow orthodox left-arm spin, and Jos Buttler practiced left-handed as a club cricketer.

===Cue sports===
In cue sports, players can reach farther across the table if they are able to play with either hand, since the cue must either be placed on the left or the right side of the body. English snooker player Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan is a rarity amongst top snooker professionals, in that he is able to play to world-class standard with either hand. While he lacks power in his left arm, his ability to alternate hands allows him to take shots that would otherwise require awkward cueing or the use of a rest. When he first displayed this ability in the 1996 World Championship against the Canadian player Alain Robidoux, Robidoux accused him of disrespect. O&#x27;Sullivan responded that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right. O&#x27;Sullivan was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux&#x27;s formal complaint, where he had to prove that he could play to a high level with his left hand.

===Figure skating===
In figure skating, most skaters who are right-handed spin and jump to the left, and vice versa for left-handed individuals, but it also down to habit for ballerinas. Olympic Champion figure skater John Curry notably performed his jumps in one direction (anti-clockwise) while spinning predominantly in the other. Very few skaters have such an ability to perform jumps and spins in both directions, and it is now considered a &quot;difficult variation&quot; in spins under the ISU Judging System to rotate in the non-dominant direction. Michelle Kwan used an opposite-rotating camel spin in some of her programs as a signature move. No point bonus exists for opposite direction jumps or bi-directional combination jumps, despite their being much harder to perfect. Nobody can perform a jump sequence (because it requires change of edge, whereas a combo is maintained on the same edge) from clockwise to anti-clockwise, or vice versa.

===Football codes===
====American football====
In American football, it is especially advantageous to be able to use either arm to perform various tasks. Ambidextrous receivers can make one-handed catches with either hand; linemen can hold their shoulders square and produce an equal amount of power with both arms; and punters can handle a bad snap and roll out and punt with either leg, limiting the chance of a block. Naturally right-handed quarterbacks may have to perform left-handed passes to avoid sacks. Chris Jones is cross-dominant. Although he is a left-footed punter, he throws with his right. Chris Hanson was dual-footed, able to punt with either foot.

===Golf===
Some players find cross-dominance advantageous in golf, especially if a left-handed player utilizes right-handed clubs. Having more precise coordination with the left hand is believed to allow better-controlled, and stronger drives. Mac O&#x27;Grady was a touring pro who played right-handed, yet could play &quot;scratch&quot; (no handicap) golf left-handed. He lobbied the USGA for years to be certified as an amateur &quot;lefty&quot; and a pro &quot;righty&quot; to no avail. Although not ambidextrous, Phil Mickelson and Mike Weir are both right-handers who golf left-handed; Ben Hogan was the opposite, being a natural left-hander who played golf right-handed, as is Cristie Kerr. This is known as cross-dominance or mixed-handedness.

===Hockey===
Ice hockey players may shoot from the left or right side of the body. For the most part, right-handed players shoot left and, likewise, most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed. The dominant hand is typically placed on the top of the stick to allow for better stickhandling and control of the puck. Gordie Howe was one of few players capable of doing both, although this was at a time when the blade of the stick was not curved.

Another ice hockey goaltender Bill Durnan, had the ability to catch the puck with either hand. He won the Vezina Trophy, then for the National Hockey League&#x27;s goalie with the fewest goals allowed six times out of only seven seasons. He had developed this ability playing for church-league teams in Toronto and Montreal to make up for his poor lateral movement. He wore custom gloves that permitted him to hold his stick with either hand. Most goaltenders nowadays choose to catch with their non-dominant hand.

Field hockey players are forced to play right-handed. The rules of the game denote that the ball can only be struck with the flat side of the stick. Only one player Laeeq Ahmed on Pakistan National Hockey team, played with unorthodox left hand below and right hand up side of stick grip with full command. He played from 1991 to 1992 for the national team. Perhaps to avoid confusing referees, there are no left-handed sticks. In floorball, like ice hockey, right-handed players shoot left and, likewise, most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed. Floorball goalkeepers do not use a stick, so they have two glove hands, and act much like a soccer goalkeeper, but with an ice hockey helmet. When they venture out of the goal box, they act just like an outfield soccer player.

===Lacrosse===
In field lacrosse, which is more popular in the United States, it is extremely advantageous to be able to use both hands, as players can play on both sides of the field and are harder to defend against. Usually in field lacrosse, all players except goalies, but especially offensive players, are expected to be able to catch and throw with their weak hand. However, in box lacrosse, which is more popular in Canada, players often only use their dominant hand, like in hockey.

===Martial arts===
The traditional martial arts tend to feature a larger number of practitioners who have intentionally developed ambidexterity to a high degree, compared to athletes in combat sports. This is because unlike sports, which have structured rules and common player preferences, traditional martial arts are intended for situations such as self-defense, in which a wider array of physical challenges may occur.

Some arts and schools practice all or most techniques and movements with both sides, while others emphasize that some techniques should only be trained on the right or the left (though both sides tend to eventually receive nearly equal attention). This may be for a number of reasons. Some of these arts rely on the tendency of right-handed people to move differently with the left side than with the right, and attempt to take advantage of this. Similarly, certain weapons are more often carried on one side. For instance, most weapons in ancient China were wielded primarily with the right hand and on the right side; this habit has carried on to the practice of those weapons in modern times. As an example, in xingyiquan, most schools that teach spear-fighting only practice on the right side, although much of the rest of the art is ambidextrous in practice.

===Professional wrestling===
Shawn Michaels is ambidextrous. He typically kicks with his right leg in Sweet Chin Music, but uses either arm for his signature elbow drop, depending on the position.

===Racing===
In professional sports car racing, drivers who participate in various events in both the United States and Europe will sometimes encounter machines with the steering wheel mounted on different sides of the car. While steering ability is largely unaffected, the hand used for shifting changes is, due to the shift pattern relative to the driver changing, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a gear change that requires moving the lever toward the driver in a left-hand-drive vehicle becomes a movement away from the driver in a right-hand-drive vehicle. A driver skilled in shifting with the opposite hand is at an advantage.

===Racket sports===
In tennis, a player may be able to reach balls on the backhand side more easily if they&#x27;re able to use the weaker hand. An example of a player who is ambidextrous is Luke Jensen. Due to a physical advantage on the space of time needed when matching the ball with the racket simultaneously with tagging the opponent&#x27;s movement, being laterality-crossed on eyedness with handedness may be a decisive factor for outstanding performance, since the hand which strikes the ball can do it while the overriding eye, matching with this hand, can be tagging the opponent&#x27;s movement-decisions. Such have the case of Rafael Nadal who uses his right hand for writing, but plays tennis with left. There are many players who are naturally right handed, but play lefty and vice versa. Evgenia Kulikovskaya is also an ambidextrous player, Kulikovskaya played with two forehands and no backhand, switching her racket hand depending on where the ball was coming. Jan-Michael Gambill is the opposite case of Kulikovskaya, since he played with a two-handed forehand and backhand, although he served with his right hand. Other famous examples of a two-handed forehand are Fabrice Santoro and Monica Seles. Seles&#x27; playing style was unusual in that she hit with two hands on both sides and, at the same time, always kept her (dominant) left hand at the base of her racket. This meant that she hit her forehand cross-handed. Maria Sharapova is also known to be ambidextrous. Cheong-eui Kim is a truly ambidextrous player with no backhand, and can serve left-handed as well as right-handed.

Some table tennis players have used their ability to hit with their non-dominant hand to return balls out of reach of their dominant hand&#x27;s backhand, most notably Timo Boll, a former world #1 player.

Although it is quite uncommon, in badminton, ambidextrous players are able to switch the racquet between their hands, often to get to the awkward backhand corner quickly. As badminton can be a very fast sport at professional levels of play, players might not have time to switch the racquet, as this disrupts their reaction time.

===Rugby===
In rugby league and rugby union being ambidextrous is an advantage when it comes to passing the ball between teammates as well as being able to use both feet by the halves is an advantage in gaining field position by kicking the ball ahead. Jonny Wilkinson is a prime example of a union player who is good at kicking with both feet, he is left handed and normally place kicks using his left, but he dropped the goal that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 with his right. Dan Carter is actually right handed, but kicks predominantly with his left, sometimes with his right.

===Volleyball===
A volleyball player has to be ambidextrous to control the ball to either direction and performing basic digs. On the other hand, the setter has to be proficient in performing dump sets with either hand to throw off blockers. Wing spikers that can spike with either hand can alter trajectories to throw off receivers&#x27; timing.

==In art==
Although most artists have a favored hand, some artists use both of their hands for arts such as drawing and sculpting. It is believed that Leonardo da Vinci utilized both of his hands after an injury to his right hand during his early childhood.

A contemporary artist, Gur Keren, can draw with both his hands and even feet. Thea Alba was a well-known German who could write with all ten fingers.

==In music==
In drum and bugle corps (and drum and bell corps), snare drummers, quads (tenors), and bass drummers need to be somewhat ambidextrous. Since they have to abide by what the composer/arranger has written, they have to learn to play evenly in terms of dynamics and speed with their right and left hands. The drummer of The Beatles, Ringo Starr, is left-handed, but plays a right-handed drum kit. American instrumental guitarist Michael Angelo Batio is known for being able to play both right-handed and left-handed guitar proficiently. The ambidexterity of Jimi Hendrix has been explored in a psychology, but he was known for playing a standard right-handed guitar flipped to make it left-handed. The guitarist Duane Allman was the reverse of Hendrix, being left-handed and playing right-handed guitars. Shara Lin is naturally left-handed, but plays the violin and guitar right handed. Lin can also play the piano with her left hand while playing the zither with her right.

Despite some instruments having left-handed versions, instruments like violin, viola or the cello, are exclusively right-handed.

==Tools==
With respect to tools, ambidextrous may be used to mean that the tool may be used equally well with either hand; an &quot;ambidextrous knife&quot; refers to the opening mechanism and locking mechanism on a folding knife. It can also mean that the tool can be interchanged between left and right in some other way, such as an &quot;ambidextrous headset,&quot; which can be worn on either the left or right ear. Many tools and implements are made specifically for use in the right hand, and will not work properly if used in the other hand. There exist shops dedicated to selling implements and tools made specifically for left-handed use. For example, left-handed, and ambidextrous, scissors are available.

Many knives are sold sharpened asymmetrically for right-hand use, and resharpened in the same way. It is possible to buy knives sharpened for left-handed use, and to sharpen any knife in that way.

==Medicine and surgery==

A degree of ambidexterity is required in surgery because surgeons must be able to tie with their left and right hands in either single or double knots. This is usually due to factors like the positioning of the surgeon, whether they have an assistant and the angle required to throw and secure the knot.

Ambidexterity is also useful after surgery on a dominant hand or arm, as it allows the patient to use their non-dominant hand with equal facility as the limb which is recovering from surgery.

==Ambisinistrality==

A related variation to one that is ambidextrous is a person who displays &quot;ambisinistrality&quot; or is &quot;ambisinistrous&quot;. This term is a near inverse to ambidexterity as Latin root of the word &quot;ambi-&quot; means both and the Latin root of the word -&quot;&quot; means &quot;left&quot;, being derived from the word sinister. The term &quot;ambisinistral&quot; can be directly interpreted as &quot;both left&quot; or &quot;both sinister&quot;.

The term is used in non-scientific manners to describe individuals who have two non-dominant hands, as both hands are either clumsy or insufficient in motor skill and are therefore used equally as much. In a 1992 New York Times Q&amp;A article on ambidexterity, the term was used to describe people &quot;...with both hands as skilled as a right-hander&#x27;s left hand.&quot;

<text>The penny-farthing, also known as a high wheel, high wheeler or ordinary, is an early type of bicycle. It was popular in the 1870s and 1880s, with its large front wheel providing high speeds, owing to it travelling a large distance for every rotation of the wheel. These bicycles had solid rubber tires and as a consequence the only shock absorption was in the saddle.

The penny-farthing became obsolete in the late 1880s with the development of modern bicycles, which provided similar speed, via a chain-driven gear train, and comfort, from the use of pneumatic tires. These later bikes were marketed as &quot;safety bicycles&quot; because of the greater ease of mounting and dismounting, the reduced danger of falling, and the reduced height to fall, in comparison to penny-farthings.

The name came from the British penny and farthing coins, the penny being much larger than the farthing, so that the side view of the bicycle resembles a larger penny (the front wheel) leading a smaller farthing (the rear wheel). Although the name &quot;penny-farthing&quot; is now the most common, it was probably not used until the machines had been almost superseded. The first recorded print reference is from 1891 in &quot;Bicycling News&quot;. For most of their reign they were simply known as &quot;bicycles&quot; and were the first machines to be so called, although they were not the first two-wheeled, pedalled vehicles. In the late 1890s, the name &quot;ordinary&quot; began to be used, to distinguish them from the emerging safety bicycles, and that term, along with &quot;hi-wheel&quot; and variants, are preferred by many modern enthusiasts.

Following the popularity of the boneshaker, Eugène Meyer, a Frenchman, invented the high-wheeler bicycle design in 1869 and fashioned the wire-spoke tension wheel. Around 1870, English inventor James Starley described as the father of the bicycle industry, and others, began producing bicycles based on the French boneshaker but with front wheels of increasing size, because larger front wheels, up to in diameter, enabled higher speeds on bicycles limited to direct-drive. In 1878, Albert Pope began manufacturing the Columbia bicycle outside Boston, starting their two-decade heyday in the United States.

Although the trend was short-lived, the penny-farthing became a symbol of the late Victorian era. Its popularity also coincided with the birth of cycling as a sport.

== History ==
=== Origins and development ===

Eugène Meyer of Paris is now regarded as the father of the high bicycle by the International Cycling History Conference in place of James Starley. Meyer patented a wire-spoke tension wheel with individually adjustable spokes in 1869. They were called &quot;spider&quot; wheels in Britain when introduced there. Meyer produced a classic high bicycle design during the 1880s.

James Starley in Coventry added the tangent spokes and the mounting step to his famous bicycle named &quot;Ariel&quot;. He is regarded as the father of the British cycling industry. Ball bearings, solid rubber tires and hollow-section steel frames became standard, reducing weight and making the ride much smoother.

Penny-farthing bicycles are dangerous because of the risk of headers (taking a fall over the handlebars head-first). Makers developed &quot;moustache&quot; handlebars, allowing the rider&#x27;s knees to clear them, &quot;Whatton&quot; handlebars that wrapped around behind the legs, and ultimately (though too late, after development of the safety bicycle), the American &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Star&quot; bicycles, whose large and small wheels were reversed. This prevented headers but left the danger of being thrown backwards when riding uphill. Other attempts included moving the seat rearward and driving the wheel by levers or treadles, as in the &quot;Xtraordinary&quot; and &quot;Facile&quot;, or gears, by chain as in the &quot;Kangaroo&quot; or at the hub, as in the &quot;Crypto&quot;; another option was to move the seat well back, as in the &quot;Rational&quot;.

Even so, bicycling remained the province of the urban well-to-do, and mainly men, until the 1890s, and was a salient example of conspicuous consumption.
=== Attributes ===
The penny-farthing used a larger wheel than the velocipede, thus giving higher speeds on all but the steepest hills. In addition, the large wheel gave a smoother ride, important before the invention of pneumatic tires.

An attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits above the front axle. When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard. Riders coasting down hills often took their feet off the pedals and put them over the tops of the handlebars, so they would be pitched off feet-first instead of head-first.

Penny-farthing bicycles often used similar materials and construction as earlier velocipedes: cast iron frames, solid rubber tires, and plain bearings for pedals, steering, and wheels. They were often quite durable and required little service. For example, when cyclist Thomas Stevens rode around the world in the 1880s, he reported only one significant mechanical problem in over , caused when the local military confiscated his bicycle and damaged the front wheel.

=== End of an era ===

The well-known dangers of the penny-farthing were, for the time of its prominence, outweighed by its strengths. While it was a difficult, dangerous machine, it was simpler, lighter, and faster than the safer velocipedes of the time. Two new developments changed this situation, and led to the rise of the safety bicycle. The first was the chain drive, originally used on tricycles, allowing a gear ratio to be chosen independent of the wheel size. The second was the pneumatic bicycle tire, allowing smaller wheels to provide a smooth ride.

The nephew of one of the men responsible for popularity of the penny-farthing was largely responsible for its demise. James Starley had built the Ariel (spirit of the air) high-wheeler in 1870; but this was a time of innovation, and when chain drives were upgraded so that each link had a small roller, higher and higher speeds became possible without the need for a large front wheel.

In 1885, Starley&#x27;s nephew John Kemp Starley took these new developments to launch the modern bicycle, the Rover safety bicycle, so-called because the rider, seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.

In 1888, when John Dunlop re-invented the pneumatic tire for his son&#x27;s tricycle, the high wheel was made obsolete. The comfortable ride once found only on tall wheels could now be enjoyed on smaller chain-driven bicycles. By 1893, high-wheelers were no longer being produced. Use lingered into the 1920s in track cycling until racing safety bicycles were adequately designed.

=== Modern usage ===
Today, enthusiasts ride restored penny-farthings, and a few manufacturers build new ones with modern materials. Manufacturers include Richards of England (Hull, UK), Rideable Bicycle Replicas (US), Trott &amp; Sons (UK) and UDC (Taiwan). One of these manufacturers, UDC Penny Farthings, the largest penny-farthing retailer in the United Kingdom, recorded record sales of penny-farthings in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown.

The Penny Farthing Club is a cycling club that was founded in 2013 by Neil Laughton. The club offers rider training, bike tours of London and other UK cities, and hosts club events such as penny-farthing polo.

== Characteristics ==

The penny-farthing is a direct-drive bicycle, meaning the cranks and pedals are fixed directly to the hub. Instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged so the radius from the hub to the outer wheel is comfortable for the rider to reach the pedals fixed to the hub. But the rider needs to be able to both mount the saddle and reach the pedals. If the wheel is too large, this will not be achievable. For instance a 5&#x27;9&quot; cyclist due to their leg length could at best ride a 50&quot;-54&quot; high wheel depending on the height of the saddle.

=== Construction ===

The frame is a single tube following the circumference of the front wheel, then diverting to a trailing wheel. A mounting peg is above the rear wheel. The front wheel is in a rigid fork with little if any trail. A spoon brake is usually fitted on the fork crown, operated by a lever from one of the handlebars. The bars are usually mustache shaped, dropping from the level of the headset. The saddle mounts on the frame less than behind the headset.

One particular model, made by Pope Manufacturing Company in 1886, weighs , has a 60-spoke front wheel and a 20-spoke rear wheel. It is fitted with solid rubber tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars are made from hollow, steel tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable ball bearings. The leather saddle is suspended by springs.

Another model, made by Humber and Co., Ltd., of Beeston, Nottingham, weighs only , and has wheels. It has no step and no brakes, in order to minimize weight.

A third model, also made by Pope Manufacturing Company, weighs and has forged steel forks. A brake lever on the right of a straight handlebar operates a spoon brake against the front wheel.

All three have cranks that can be adjusted for length.

=== Operation ===

Mounting and dismounting a penny-farthing takes practice, but can be learned in about an hour or two. Mounting is generally achieved on flat, level ground. It&#x27;s possible to mount a penny-farthing on a slight incline, but more challenging as you need to maintain momentum. Once the penny-farthing stops rolling, the rider will fall over if they have not mounted by that point. Dismounting on an incline is also to be avoided and one&#x27;s ability to successfully reach the top needs to be considered before even attempting it.

Once mounting and dismounting have been mastered, speed moderation is the next key skill to learn. If you never cycle faster than you can react to potential hazards, then you can avoid disaster. For instance, don&#x27;t freewheel (feet off the pedals) down a steep hill which leads to a busy juncture/roundabout or has a blind bend where you can&#x27;t see if there is a stopped vehicle or other obstruction. Slow-pedaling is a key skill to master. If you can slow-pedal up to a red light, you can stage your approach so when you arrive it is hopefully green, so you don&#x27;t have to dismount. When cycling downhill, you must start braking at the top of the hill. Start applying resistance on the pedals at the top and through the descent. Also, never brake sharply if using a mechanical brake or you risk going over the handlebars.

The last key skill needed to ride a penny-farthing safely is learning to change direction. Never turn the handlebars too sharply or you risk a headover. Turns should be wide and gentle. Also, in respect to changing direction, skill and care must be exercised when approaching junctures and roundabouts. This is where speed moderation becomes important: you need to stage your approach so you can time arriving at the juncture or roundabout when a gap in traffic permits you to safely join the flow of traffic. This is also true for turning in front of opposing lane traffic: you need to be able to stage your approach to reach the turn when a gap enables you to do so. When approaching any juncture/roundabout, if you cannot enter safely, you must stop and dismount.

When learning, do not cycle a penny-farthing on busy roads: you will not have the skills to stay safe. Only venture onto the roads when you can mount/dismount reflexively and have mastered speed moderation or you risk serious injury or death.

In most other respects, once mounted, riding a penny-farthing is much like riding any other bicycle in respect to anticipating hazards, signaling, and defensive cycling. Penny-farthings are legal to ride on UK roads, but one must check the laws in the country they want to ride their penny-farthing 

=== Performance ===
Frederick Lindley Dodds, of Stockton-on-Tees, England, is credited with having set the first hour record, covering an estimated distance of 15 miles and 1,480 yards (25.493 kms) on a high-wheeler during a race on the Fenner&#x27;s Track, Cambridge University on March 25, 1876.

The furthest (paced) hour record ever achieved on a penny-farthing bicycle was by William A. Rowe, an American, in 1886.

The record for riding from Land&#x27;s End to John o&#x27; Groats on a penny-farthing was set in 1886 by George Pilkington Mills with a time of five days, one hour, and 45 minutes. This record was broken in 2019 by Richard Thoday with a time of four days, 11 hours and 52 minutes.

Until the 21st century, the last paced hour record to be set on a penny-farthing was probably BW Attlee&#x27;s 1891 English amateur record of . This was beaten by Scots cyclist Mark Beaumont at Herne Hill Velodrome on 16 June 2018 when he covered .

In 1884, Thomas Stevens rode a Columbia penny-farthing from San Francisco to Boston—the first cyclist to cross the United States. In 1885–86, he continued from London through Europe, the Middle East, China, and Japan, to become the first to ride around the world.

Tremendous feats of balance were reported, including negotiating a narrow bridge parapet and riding down the U.S. Capitol steps with the American Star Bicycle which has the small wheel in front.

== In popular culture ==

The bike, with the one wheel dominating, led to riders being referred to in America as &quot;wheelmen&quot;, a name that lived on for nearly a century in the League of American Wheelmen until renamed the League of American Bicyclists in 1994. Clubs of racing cyclists wore uniforms of peaked caps, tight jackets and knee-length breeches, with leather shoes, the caps and jackets displaying the club&#x27;s colors. In 1967 collectors and restorers of penny-farthings (and other early bicycles) founded the Wheelmen, a non-profit organization &quot;dedicated to keeping alive the heritage of American cycling&quot;.

The high-wheeler lives on in the gear inch units used by cyclists in English-speaking countries to describe gear ratios. These are calculated by multiplying the wheel diameter in inches by the number of teeth on the front chain-wheel and dividing by the teeth on the rear sprocket. The result is the equivalent diameter of a penny-farthing wheel. A 60-inch gear, the largest practicable size for a high-wheeler, is nowadays a middle gear of a utility bicycle, while top gears on many exceed 100 inches. There was at least one Columbia made in the mid-1880s, but 60 was the largest in regular production.

A penny-farthing is the logo of The Village in the cult 1960s television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, and is also featured in the show&#x27;s closing titles. Co-creator and star Patrick McGoohan stated that the bike represented slowing down the wheels of progress.

The penny-farthing is a symbol of the cities of Sparta, Wisconsin; Davis, California; and Redmond, Washington.

== Events ==

* Each February in Evandale, Tasmania, penny-farthing enthusiasts from around the world converge on the small village for a series of penny-farthing races, including the national championship.
* In October there is a bicycle ride from the statue of an 1890s bicyclist on a penny-farthing in Port Byron, Illinois named &quot;Will B. Rolling&quot; to a similar statue in Sparta, Wisconsin named &quot;Ben Bikin&#x27;&quot;.
* In 2004, British leukemia patient and charity fundraiser Lloyd Scott (43) rode a penny-farthing across the Australian outback to raise money for a charitable cause.
* In November 2008, Briton Joff Summerfield completed a round-the-world trip on a penny-farthing. Summerfield spent two-and-a-half years cycling through 23 countries, visiting locations including the Taj Mahal, Angkor Wat and Mount Everest.
* Knutsford in England has hosted the Knutsford Great Race every 10 years since 1980. The 1980 race had 15 team entries, and there were 16 in 1990 and 2000. The 2010 race was limited to 50 teams and was in aid of the ShelterBox charity.
* In 2012, the first Clustered Spires High Wheel Race took place in Frederick, Maryland, USA. This is the country&#x27;s only race of its kind - a one-hour criterium race around a course through the historic downtown district.

<text>Does This Look Infected? is the second studio album by Canadian rock band Sum 41. It was released on November 26, 2002.

== Music, lyrics and composition ==
The album is a lot more aggressive, darker and heavier than Sum 41&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot; (2001). It also has fewer elements of pop music than &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;. Described as heavy metal, horror punk, punk rock, pop punk, and melodic hardcore, the album uses elements of heavy metal, hardcore punk, thrash metal, d-beat and, on the song &quot;Thanks for Nothing&quot;, hip hop. Although the album has been described as pop punk by some sources, &quot;Counterculture.co.uk&quot; considered it an album that shows Sum 41 abandoning the pop punk genre for a more standard punk rock style. Amy Sciarretto of &quot;ARTISTdirect&quot; wrote that &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; soldifies Sum 41 as &quot;true punk stalwarts&quot;. The music on &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; has been compared to bands such as The Offspring, P.O.D., Metallica, Rancid, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Bad Religion, NOFX, Green Day and 

The album&#x27;s lyrical topics are darker than the lyrical topics on &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;. Sum 41&#x27;s vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley said, &quot;A lot of stuff happened in the past year that opened our eyes to new things,&quot; Whibley said. &quot;The whole last year has been really crazy around the world. There&#x27;s been so much stuff going on and it&#x27;s been so televised. I think we&#x27;ve all become more aware. When we were writing the last record everything was happy go lucky. Now this time we&#x27;ve seen a little bit more and our eyes have been opened up a little bit.&quot; The album&#x27;s lyrical topics include hatred, war, internal demons, disliking the world, suicide, drugs, insomnia and HIV. The song &quot;Mr. Amsterdam&quot; is about an embittered man. Whibley said, &quot;&#x27;Mr. Amsterdam&#x27; is sort of about a guy who hates everything, very bitter person who kind of hates the world.&quot; He explains, &quot;He&#x27;s against the world.&quot; The song is also about the complacency of pop culture in 2002, the year that &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; was released, and technology that was new during the year that the album was released. Whibley explained the meaning of &quot;Mr. Amsterdam&quot;, saying, &quot;We depend so much on new technology to make sure that we don&#x27;t have to do anything. Everything&#x27;s being laid out so we can sit at home and do nothing and never leave our homes. You can order all your groceries from the computer. You can do anything you want. You can just sit there and become fatter. And I think that&#x27;s bad.&quot;

Lead guitarist Dave &quot;Brownsound&quot; Baksh explained the meaning of the song &quot;All Messed Up&quot;, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a song called &#x27;All Messed Up,&#x27; which is about doing drugs . . . just what we feel when we&#x27;re on drugs.&quot; When Whibley spoke about &quot;All Messed Up&quot;, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s about those kinds of nights. It&#x27;s just about being really messed up and in that whole cracked-out kind of state.&quot; &quot;The Hell Song&quot; is about a friend of Sum 41 who contracted HIV. Whibley spoke about &quot;The Hell Song&quot; saying, &quot;It’s one of my favorite songs on the record. It&#x27;s about this girl I used to date who I&#x27;ve known forever. Just last Christmas she found that she was HIV positive, and it was so brutal. She doesn&#x27;t sleep around. She&#x27;s only had two or three boyfriends and one of them used to cheat on her all the time, and then he got it and gave it to her. It&#x27;s the heaviest thing that&#x27;s happened in our group of friends.&quot; &quot;No Brains&quot; is about a former band member of Sum 41. Whibley explained the song&#x27;s meaning, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s just a basic &#x27;fuck you, I&#x27;m done&#x27; kind of song. This guy was our old singer and I was best friends with him. We had this big falling out.&quot; Whibley explained what the song &quot;Over My Head (Better Off Dead)&quot; is about. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s not about being fucked up or drunk. It&#x27;s more about the aftermath when you&#x27;re hearing everything you&#x27;ve just done the night before, and you&#x27;re like, &quot;Ah, fuck, I&#x27;m better off dead.&quot; I don&#x27;t regret any of the things I do and I don&#x27;t mind doing them, I just hate hearing about it. Being told every morning, &quot;Dude, what did you do last night?&quot; drives me nuts.&quot;

&quot;Still Waiting&quot; was written after the September 11 attacks. Whibley explained the meaning of the song, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not directly about 9/11 or the war on terrorism. It&#x27;s about the war on everything. It&#x27;s about the world as we know it. It&#x27;s no secret that the world doesn&#x27;t get along and there&#x27;s all this hatred. It&#x27;s everything to do with how this world functions.&quot; Whibley stated on the band&#x27;s DVD, &quot;Sake Bombs And Happy Endings&quot;, that the album&#x27;s song &quot;A.N.I.C.&quot; is a &quot;special love song&quot; dedicated to Anna Nicole Smith. According to him, &quot;A.N.I.C.&quot; stands for &#x27;Anna Nicole is a Cunt&#x27;.&quot; Lead guitarist Dave &quot;Brownsound&quot; Baksh said that Anna Nicole Smith is &quot;a fuckin&#x27; loser&quot; and also said, &quot;Look what she&#x27;s doing to herself.&quot; Sum 41 stopped including the song in their live performances after Smith died of an overdose in 2007. However, they put &quot;A.N.I.C.&quot; back into their setlist during the 2012 summer European leg of the Screaming Bloody Murder Tour. When Sum 41 performed the song live after Smith&#x27;s death, the band would not show any disrespect towards her, with Whibley saying that the song &quot;A.N.I.C.&quot; stands for &quot;Deryck Whibley is a Fucking Stupid Cunt&quot;. However, since 2018, Whibley has resumed using Anna Nicole&#x27;s name in the title.

== Cover and title ==
The cover for &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; shows drummer Steve Jocz dressed as a zombie. It was chosen months before the title. The album&#x27;s release was almost delayed because the band members did not have a name for it on time until Whibley thought of the name &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot;. The whole band laughed at the idea and chose it. The same idea was also used on the band&#x27;s EP &quot;Does This Look Infected Too?&quot;, except Jocz was replaced with Whibley, also dressed as a zombie.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; has received mostly positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, the album has 75 out of 100. E! Online said that it &quot;has a clutch of songs that mix chord-y abandon with raging rock riffs--and a heck of a lot of good times&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; also gave it a positive review, saying, &quot;So Sum 41 have grown up... a little... It&#x27;s all relative, and, crucially, it still rocks.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; debuted at #8 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 17,000 copies in Canada in its first week. The album gained commercial success, with singles &quot;The Hell Song&quot; and &quot;Still Waiting&quot; mainly gaining success on the modern rock charts. The album has since sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide, but the album did not have as much success as the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;All Killer No Filler&quot;.

===Legacy===
The album was included at number 28 on &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s &quot;The 51 Most Essential Pop Punk Albums of All Time&quot; list. The band toured to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2012, and its 15th anniversary in 2018, playing the album in its entirety. Whibley himself stated he was not satisfied with how the album was mixed, stating &quot;I’ve always, always hated the way this album sounds. I hated it in the studio and it still bothers me. The demo I made myself at home sounded better than the final mix.&quot; In February 2025, former drummer Steve Jocz ranked &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; as his favorite Sum 41 album he has worked on.

== Track listing ==


=== Bonus DVD ===
The unedited version includes a bonus DVD which is entitled &quot;Cross The T&#x27;s and Gouge Your I&#x27;s&quot;. The DVD has footage of Sum 41&#x27;s alter ego band, Pain for Pleasure, titled &quot;Reign In Pain&quot;, as well as various humorous segments like &quot;Going Going Gonorrhea&quot;, &quot;Campus Invasion&quot; and &quot;Pizza Heist and Other Crap&quot;. Also included in the DVD are the Pain for Pleasure tracks &quot;Reign In Pain&quot; and &quot;WWVII Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;, the Autopilot Off songs &quot;Long Way to Fall&quot; and &quot;Nothing Frequency&quot;, the No Warning songs &quot;Short Fuse&quot; and &quot;Ill Blood&quot;, and some web-links.

<doc id="183358" wikidata="Q2061259" url="?curid=183358" title="SLC Punk!">
<text>SLCPunk! is a 1998 American comedy-drama film written and directed by James Merendino. The film centers around Steven &quot;Stevo&quot; Levy, a college graduate and punk living in Salt Lake City during the mid-1980s.

&quot;SLCPunk!&quot; was chosen as the opening-night feature at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.
Merendino created the film based on his experience growing up in Salt Lake City. Although the film is not autobiographical, Merendino has said that many characters were based on people he knew.

==Plot==
The film outlines the daily life of a punk named Stevo in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the fall of 1985. Stevo&#x27;s best friend, &quot;Heroin&quot; Bob, is also a punk. The nickname &quot;Heroin&quot; is ironic, as Bob is afraid of needles and actually believes that any drug (with the notable exception of alcohol and cigarettes) is inherently dangerous.

Stevo and Bob go from party to party while living in a dilapidated apartment. They spend much of their time fighting with members of other subcultures, particularly rednecks. Stevo has a casual relationship with a girl named Sandy, while Bob is in love with Trish, the owner of a head shop.

The two of them are shaped by their experiences with their parents. Stevo&#x27;s parents, now divorced, are former hippies who are proud of their youthful endeavors; however, Stevo is revolted by what he perceives as their &quot;selling out&quot; by becoming affluent professionals, which they try to justify. Stevo&#x27;s grades are excellent, and when his father sends an application to Harvard Law School and Stevo is accepted, he nevertheless rejects it because of his beliefs. By contrast, Bob&#x27;s father is a mentally ill alcoholic who mistakes his son and his friend for Central Intelligence Agency operatives and chases them away with a shotgun when they visit him on his birthday.

Stevo begins to see the drawbacks of living the punk life. Sean, a fellow punk, was a drug dealer who once attempted to stab his mother while under the influence of an entire 100-dose sheet of acid; in the present, Stevo finds him panhandling on the street with some obvious mental issues.

While Stevo understands that his relationship with Sandy is casual, he is still enraged when he discovers her having sex with another man and savagely beats him, later loathing himself because his action contradicts his own belief in anarchism. His social circle also begins to drift away, as his dealer, Mark, and his friend, Mike, both leave Salt Lake City (Mark to return to Miami, Mike to attend the University of Notre Dame). Soon after, Stevo attends a party and falls in love with a rich girl named Brandy, who points out that his clothing and hair are fashion as opposed to true rebellion. Rather than being offended, Stevo takes the criticism thoughtfully, and they passionately kiss.

At the same party, Bob complains of a headache (induced by Spandau Ballet&#x27;s &quot;She Loved Like Diamond&quot; playing on a stereo), and is given Percodan, which he consumes with alcohol after being told the pills are simply &quot;vitamins&quot; that will help his headache. The accidental drug overdose kills him in his sleep. When Stevo discovers Bob&#x27;s body, he breaks down completely. At the funeral, he appears with a shaved head and changed clothing, having decided he is done with being a punk. He plans to go to Harvard, and earlier narration suggests that he eventually marries Brandy. He notes in his closing narration that his youthful self would probably kick his future self&#x27;s ass, wryly describing himself as having been ultimately just another poser.

==Production notes==
The film was shot in an aggressive, highly kinetic style, with sweeping crane shots, fast dolly moves, and jump cuts.

Most of the film was shot on location in Salt Lake City, with a scene taking place in Evanston, Wyoming. Numerous scenes took place in locally well-known areas:
* The high school, which Heroin Bob calls &quot;Southeast High&quot;, is West High School near downtown Salt Lake City.
* The scene where Heroin Bob chastises Stevo for using acid takes place at Presidents Circle at the University of Utah.
* Stevo introduces the &quot;poseurs&quot; and gives his &quot;Who Started Punk Rock?&quot; speech at the now-defunct Cottonwood Mall in Holladay, Utah. Sean&#x27;s &quot;women&#x27;s clothing&quot; job interview takes place inside a Cottonwood Mall storefront.
* Stevo and Sandy drop acid at Memory Grove Park, a World War I memorial park.
* Many exterior street scenes occur just north of the Frank E. Moss Federal Courthouse in the downtown area. The scene where Stevo and Sandy run into Sean begging was shot on Market Street. You can see The Felt and Boston Buildings in the background. Sean is standing in front of the old Odd Fellows Building which currently houses The Dennis Group Engineering consulting at 26 W Market Street. Trish&#x27;s head shop was on the 200 block of E 300 S. The Broadway Plaza at 250 E 300 S is visible when Mark walks in. 
* The ECP concert was shot at the old Deseret News Paper Mill at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon, posing as The SLC Indian Center.
* The scenes depicting Heroin Bob&#x27;s funeral were shot inside and outside The Cathedral of the Madeleine. The cathedral is located just east of downtown Salt Lake City.
* The apartment where Stevo and Heroin Bob live was the Big D Construction building, across from Pioneer Park.
* The store where they bought the &quot;Wyoming Beer&quot; is &#x27;Porter&#x27;s Fireworks and Liquor&#x27; on the outskirts of Evanston.

Eight Bucks Experiment, the band portraying fictional English band ECP, were featured on a European release of the soundtrack. The three songs they recorded live for the punk concert scene were sent back to the band after filming. They self-released the songs on the &quot;One Of These Days&quot; EP through their Blue Moon Recordings label website.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film premiered in the United States at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 1999. It received a wide release on April 16, 1999, grossing $36,218 on its opening weekend and amassing a total domestic gross of $299,569 by the time it left theaters.

===Critical reception===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 62% on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Merging anarchic spirit with straightforward melodrama, &quot;SLC Punk&quot; is a hit-and-miss odyssey of youthful rebellion elevated by Matthew Lillard&#x27;s dramatically potent star turn.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-out-of-four stars, praising Lillard&#x27;s performance and writing that the film offers &quot;a little something there for all of us&quot;. Janet Maslin, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the film &quot;likable for its outlandishness, less so when it shows a self-important streak&quot;. Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;energetic but poorly structured&quot;, writing that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite grasp how its slick, flashy package undermines any actual punk cred&quot;. Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;S.L.C. Punk!&quot; takes a potentially fascinating subject and reduces it to a mawkish compendium of film-festival clichés&quot;. David Luty of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; wrote a mostly negative review of the film, stating that it &quot;cannot quite reach the richer depths it grasps for, because it doesn&#x27;t have the material to support the large dramatic distance Stevo has to travel&quot;.

==Sequel==

In April 2013, director James Merendino announced that a sequel to &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; titled &quot;Punk&#x27;s Dead&quot; would begin filming later in the year and would be released in 2014 with most of the original cast reprising their roles. The film was successfully funded by an Indiegogo campaign launched on October 27, 2013, and completed on January 15, 2014. Merendino said of the sequel, “I made &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; when I was a kid, and accordingly, the story is naive, and, as just a coming of age story, not finished. The characters are facing big questions, 18 years later, as outsiders, punk rockers… What relevance do they have in a world where all statements have already been made? In the years since I made &quot;SLC Punk!&quot;, it has found a rather large and supportive following who have been very kind to me. So in making a sequel, I feel I owe it to those people to really do it right.&quot;

In May 2014, the film was announced to be shooting in June, with its cast officially announced to include Devon Sawa, Michael Goorjian, Adam Pascal and James Duval returning as Sean, Heroin Bob, Eddie and John the Mod, respectively, with Ben Schnetzer appearing as Heroin Bob&#x27;s son, Ross, Machine Gun Kelly as Crash, and Hannah Marks and Sarah Clarke portraying the female leads. Also in May, Matthew Lillard and Jason Segel, who starred in the original film, announced through social media that they would not be reprising their roles.

==Comic book adaptation==
In 1998, &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; was adapted into a comic book, illustrated by Dean Haspiel.

<doc id="183359" wikidata="Q1362895" url="?curid=183359" title="Cycle rickshaw">
<text>The cycle rickshaw is a small-scale local means of transport. It is a type of tricycle designed to carry passengers on a for-hire basis. It is also known by a variety of other names such as bike taxi, velotaxi, pedicab, bikecab, cyclo, beca, becak, trisikad, sikad, tricycle taxi, trishaw, or hatchback bike.

While the rickshaw is pulled by a person on foot, the cycle rickshaw is human-powered by pedaling. By contrast, the auto rickshaw is motorized.

==Overview==

The first cycle rickshaws were built in the 1880s and were first used widely in 1929 in Singapore. Six years later, they outnumbered pulled rickshaws there. By 1950, cycle rickshaws were found in every south and east Asian country. By the late 1980s, there were an estimated 4 million cycle rickshaws worldwide.

The vehicle is generally pedal-driven by a driver, though some are equipped with an electric motor to assist the driver.

The vehicle is usually a tricycle, though some quadracycle models exist, and some bicycles with trailers are configured as cycle rickshaws. Some cycle rickshaws have gas or electric motors.

===Passenger configuration===
The configuration of driver and passenger seats varies. Generally the driver sits in front of the passengers to pedal the rickshaw. There are some designs, though, where the cyclist driver sits behind the passengers. In many Asian countries, like Bangladesh, India, and China, the passenger seat is located behind the driver, while in Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Vietnam the cyclist driver sits behind the passenger. In the Philippines, the passenger seats are usually located beside the driver in a side car. Similar to this, passengers sit alongside the driver in both &quot;trishaw,&quot; in Singapore, and the &quot;sai kaa,&quot; in Burma.

==Nomenclature==

The cycle rickshaw is known by a variety of other names, including:
* velotaxi (used in Germany)
* pussuss (used in parts of France)
* velotram (used in parts of France)
* bikecab
* cyclo (used in Vietnam and Cambodia)
* pedicab (used in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada)
* bike taxi (used in Buffalo, New York)
* bicitaxi (used in Mexico)
* taxi ecologico (used in Mexico)
* trishaw
* beca (used in Malaysia)
* becak (used in Indonesia)
* helicak (used in Indonesia) it is another version of becak but with engines, not manual pedals
* traysikad, trisikad, sikad, or padyak (used in the Philippines)

==Country overview==
Not only are cycle rickshaws used in Asian countries, but they are also used in some cities in Europe and North America. They are used primarily for their novelty value, as an entertaining form of transportation for tourists and locals, but they also have environmental benefits and may be quicker than other forms of transport if traffic congestion is high. Cycle rickshaws used outside Asia often are mechanically more complex, having multiple gears, more powerful brakes, and in some cases electrical motors to provide additional power.

===Africa===

====Madagascar====
In Madagascar rickshaws, including cycle rickshaws or &quot;cyclo-pousse&quot;, are a common form of transportation in a number of cities. Rickshaws are known as &quot;pousse-pousse&quot;, meaning &quot;push-push&quot;, reportedly for the pulled rickshaws that required a second person to push the vehicles up hills. Cycles are more common in the hillier areas, like Toamasina.

===Americas===

====Canada====
In Canada there are pedicabs in operation in Victoria, British Columbia, and Vancouver, British Columbia. They are regulated in Toronto, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia.

====Mexico====

In Mexico, they are called or (literally &quot;ecological taxi&quot;).

====United States====
In many major cities, pedicabs can be found rolling about city centers, nightlife districts, park lands, sports stadiums, and tourist-heavy areas. Myriad uses have been discovered in the states, including car-park-to-event transport at large events nationwide. Thousands of pedicabs today operate on streets in locales including Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Austin, Texas; Manhattan, New York; Chicago, Illinois; San Diego and San Francisco, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida; Washington, D.C.; Denver, Colorado; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans, Louisiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; Salt Lake City, Utah; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and dozens of other hot spots. Manhattan sports the largest collection of pedicabs operating within city limits, and the City of New York itself has mandated that approximately 850 pedicabs always sport operating permits issued by the city.

Pedicabs in the United States seem to have gotten their start at the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair in Seattle.

===Asia===

====Bangladesh====

Cycle rickshaws (রিকশা &quot;riksha&quot;) are the most popular modes of transport in Bangladesh and are available for hire throughout the country including the capital city Dhaka, known as the &quot;Rickshaw Capital of the World&quot;. They are either pedal or motor-powered. They were introduced here about 1938 and by the end of the 20th century there were 300,000+ cycle rickshaws in Dhaka.

Approximately 400,000 cycle rickshaws run each day. Cycle rickshaws in Bangladesh are also more convenient than the other public modes of transports in the country namely auto rickshaws, cabs and buses. They are mostly &quot;convertible&quot;, decorated, rickshaws with folding hoods and are the only kind of vehicles that can be driven in many neighbourhoods of the city with narrow streets and lanes. However, increasing traffic congestion and the resulting collisions have led to the banning of rickshaws on many major streets in the city. Urban employment in Bangladesh also largely depend on cycle rickshaws. Because of inflation and unemployment in the rural areas, people from villages crowd in the cities to become rickshaw drivers locally called the &quot;riksha-wala&quot; (রিকশাওয়ালা).

====Cambodia====
Cycle rickshaws are known as &quot;cyclo&quot; (pronounced see-clo) in Cambodia, derived from the French .

====China====
Since the 1950s, when the pulled rickshaw was phased out, mid-city and large city passengers may travel using three-wheeled pedicabs, or cycle rickshaws. The Chinese term for the conveyance is &quot;sanlunche&quot; (三轮车). The vehicles may be pedal- or motor-powered. In Shanghai, most of the vehicles are powered by electricity.

Tourists are warned to beware of over-charging vendors, especially who wear an &quot;old fashioned costume&quot; or are located near tourist locations.

Whilst many local tourism authorities still issue licences for rickshaw drivers to carry passengers, authorities in China are tightening rules in order to alleviate cheating of tourists and to reduce traffic congestion (e.g. a typical Chinese cycle-rickshaw will travel at less than 10 and is wide enough to fill an entire motor or bicycle lane and therefore are blamed as a major cause of traffic congestion), and have been banned in many cities already.

====India====

The first attempt of improving the existing cycle rickshaws and then converting them to electric ones was done by the Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute in the late 1990s.

=====Service availability=====
Cycle rickshaws were used in Kolkata starting about 1930 and are now common in rural and urban areas of India.

=====Ecocabs and similar service=====

Navdeep Asija started a dial-a-cycle rickshaw concept known as Ecocabs, Environmental friendly Ecocabs operate in the Punjab towns of Fazilka, Amritsar. Central Delhi and Kolkata. Passengers may call to request transport service, similar to dial-up taxi cab operations. 

In November 2010, Patiala GreenCABS, similar to Ecocabs, were introduced in the city by the local non governmental organisation (NGO) the Patiala Foundation.

=====Financing=====
In West Bengal the Rotaract Club of Serampore finances cycle rickshaw purchases so that unemployed people can begin their own rickshaw business. The loans are repaid from the workers&#x27; earnings. When paid in full, the rickshaw workers own their rickshaw and other unemployed individuals are entered into the program.

=====Soleckshaw=====
The Soleckshaw is a battery-electric assisted cycle rickshaw. The battery is designed to be charged or exchanged at centralised solar-powered charging stations. Developed by the Council of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research, it was launched in Delhi in October 2008. However, in September 2010 it was reported that no Soleckshaws had been sold on a commercial basis, and the approximately 30 demonstration units, initially deployed in Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Delhi, Dhanbad, Durgapur, Jaipur, and Kolkata, were &quot;not in operation due to various local administrative and management problems&quot;, and the charging stations &quot;are not being used at this point of time as the vehicles are not in operation at those locations&quot;.

The 2010 Union budget of India had a concessional excise duty of 4% on solar cycle rickshaws.

====Indonesia====
Cycle rickshaws in Indonesia are called &quot;becak&quot; (pronounced ). They began being used in Jakarta about 1936. &quot;Becak&quot; were considered an icon of the capital city of Jakarta prior to its ban in the 1970s. Citing concerns of public order, the city government forbade them on the city&#x27;s main streets. Scenes of the anti-&quot;becak&quot; campaign appear in the 1971 Canadian film &quot;Wet Earth and Warm People&quot;, a documentary by Michael Rubbo. Despite the attempts at eradication, however, many &quot;becak&quot; still operate near slums throughout the city. Attempts at reinforcing the ban resulted in large-scale seizures of the vehicle in the late 1990s and in 2007. In 2018, Governor Anies Baswedan attempted to allow &quot;becak&quot; again because of a political contract with becak drivers during his campaign.

There are two types of &quot;becak&quot; in Indonesia: the first type is the driver sitting behind the passenger (similar to Dutch-style cargo bikes), the other one which mainly found in Sumatra is the driver sitting beside the passenger. &quot;Becak&quot; is still being used in various part of Indonesia, especially in smaller cities and town.

====Malaysia====

In Malaysia, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by cycle rickshaws ( in Malay, from Hokkien &quot;bé-chhia&quot; 馬車 &quot;horse cart&quot;). Cycle rickshaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid urbanisation has increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling cycle rickshaw numbers. Today, cycle rickshaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction, with small numbers operating in Malacca, Penang, Kelantan, and Terengganu.

====Myanmar====

In Myanmar, cycle rickshaws or trishaws (, directly pronounced as in the English word &#x27;side car&#x27;) came first into wide use in 1938, when the 1300 Revolution, which originated from the Chauk oil-field strike, inspired the people in Mandalay to have a consciousness of nationalism and to boycott British goods and services. The auto body technician Saya Nyo built the first trishaw in Mandalay by attaching a side-car to the side of an old bicycle. So two passengers are on the right of the driver.

Only two forms of transportation were then available in the city; the cab and the electric train. The latter could run only on tracks. Trishaws could reach every nook and cranny, so the spirit of nationalism plus the advantage of trishaws reaching everywhere made them so popular among Mandalayans that even the train company had to stop its business.

====Nepal====
In the Terai region of Nepal, cycle rickshaws are still the most popular means of public transport for short-distance commuting. Most big cities in the Terai have hundreds of cycle rickshaws that carry local commuters and travellers, and are also used for carrying goods. Since the Terai region is bordered with India, cycle rickshaws are also popular means for shoppers, businessmen and travellers to travel in and out of the country freely. The free border between India and Nepal enable the rickshaw owners from both countries to operate across the border without any restriction.

However, in Hilly regions of Nepal, cycle rickshaws are primarily used to attract tourists who can relax and travel around the popular streets and markets at reasonable fares. Cycle rickshaws are particularly popular among tourists to roam around the popular streets and markets of Thamel, Kathmandu.

====Pakistan====
The Cycle and Pulled rickshaw were banned in Pakistan in November 1991.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, it is called a pedicab, traysikad, trisikad—or simply sikad or padyak, from the Philippine word meaning to tramp or stamp one&#x27;s feet. It is made by mounting a sidecar to a regular bicycle. They are used mainly to ferry passengers short distances along smaller, more residential streets, often to or from jeepneys or other public utility vehicles. They are also used for transporting cargo too heavy to carry by hand and over a distance too short or roads too congested for motor transport, such as a live pig. During rainy seasons, they are useful as a way to avoid walking through flood waters. Along with the jeepney, the motorcycle-powered tricycle, and the engine-powered kuliglig, the open-air pedicab provides shade when needed.

====South Korea====

The Korean term for Cycle Rickshaw is &quot;illyeokgeo&quot; (인력거), which can be pedal- or motor-powered, though most in South Korea are electric. While not commonly used as a primary mode of transportation, cycle rickshaws can still be found in certain areas like Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul, where they operate mainly for tourism purposes.

====Thailand====

In Thailand, any three-wheeler is called (), whether motorised or not, including pedicabs, motorcycles with attached vending carts or sidecars, etc. The driver is also called &quot;&quot;.

====Vietnam====

Cycle rickshaws are known as &#x27; (pronounced sick-low, from the French &#x27;) in Vietnam. Cyclo was an invention of a French named P. Coupeaid, which was introduced in Cambodia and Saigon in 1939. From 2008 to 03/2012, due to the traffic obstruction, cyclos were totally forbidden in Ho Chi Minh City and other provinces, except cyclo tours organised by tourist agencies. Another similar vehicle, a pedicab called &quot;xe lôi&quot; of the Mekong Delta, are now rarely found in some provinces such as Sóc Trăng, Vĩnh Long, and Châu Đốc. They are on their way to disappear.

&quot;Cyclo&quot;, a 1995 film about a cyclo driver, won the Golden Lion at the 52nd Venice International Film Festival.

Beyond their practical utility, cyclos held cultural significance in Saigon. They appeared in literature, art, and cinema, becoming emblematic of the city&#x27;s identity. From romantic rendezvous to everyday commutes, cyclos featured prominently in the daily lives of Saigonese residents.

Despite the challenges, efforts are underway to preserve the legacy of cyclo in Saigon. Some organizations are restoring vintage models, while others are promoting eco-friendly alternatives to traditional cyclos. These initiatives aim to celebrate the cultural heritage of these iconic vehicles and ensure their continued presence in the city.

===Europe===
Cycle rickshaws, also called pedicabs, are used in most large continental European cities.

====Denmark====

Copenhagen and Odense have pedicab service.

====Finland====
Cycle rickshaws are available for rent at Kaivopuisto in Helsinki. The rental company brought the vehicles from the city of Lappeenranta in 2009.

====France====
Most French cities have one or more pedicabs, locally known as PussPuss or VeloTaxi. Most common in Paris, Nantes, Lyon, Montpellier and Valence, these cities operate one or more units. France have pedicab vendors.

====Germany====

Lake Constance, Berlin, Frankfurt, Dresden, and Hamburg offer cycle rickshaw, also called pedicab, service.

=====Velotaxi=====
In the 1990s, German-made cycle rickshaws called velotaxis were created. They are about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of regular taxis. Velotaxis are three-wheeled vehicles with a &quot;space-age lightweight plastic cab that is open on both sides&quot;, a space for a driver, and behind the driver, space for two passengers. They have been made in Berlin, Germany, by Ludger Matuszewski, the founder of &quot;Velotaxi GmbH&quot; company. Velotaxis are often used for group functions like weddings. Under German traffic laws, transporting people on bicycles was forbidden.

=====Electric assist pedicabs=====
Berlin&#x27;s Senate, police, and taxi associations finally agreed that the &quot;cult-flitzer&quot; could be integrated into the city&#x27;s traffic flow. Germany&#x27;s highest court later ruled that transporting people on bikes was legal. It is a modern and newly designed pedicab (CityCruiser) with a 500-watt electric assist motor. Although these electric-assist pedicabs were engineered in Germany they are manufactured in the Czech Republic and some clones are now also produced in China. The Chinese clone can be purchased for about 3,000 US dollars; the German original is around 6,000 US dollars (the newest version, 9000+ €). The batteries last about 4 hours with a full charge. As with a few recumbent and semi-recumbent designs, some drivers may suffer with knee and joint pain due to the weight of the vehicle (145 kg).

====Hungary====
Pedicab service is available in Budapest.

====Ireland====
Pedicabs operate in Cork and Dublin, Ireland.

====Italy====
Pedicab service is available in Florence, Milan, Rome, Bari.

====The Netherlands====
Pedicab service is available in Amsterdam, The Hague and in the Caribbean, at Willemstad.

Thomas Lundy of Amsterdam adapted his battery-electric assisted cycle rickshaw to become what he terms &quot;semi-solar powered&quot;, resulting in a video report on Reuters.

====Norway====

Pedicab service is available in Oslo, Fredrikstad, Bergen, Porsgrunn, and Tønsberg.

====Poland====

During World War II, when Poland was under Nazi German occupation, the German authorities confiscated most privately owned cars and many of the streetcars and buses. Because of that, public transport was partially replaced by cycle rickshaws, at first improvised and with time mass-produced by bicycle factories. Cycle rickshaws became popular in Warsaw and by the start of the Warsaw Uprising were a common sight on the city&#x27;s streets.

Pedicabs still can be found in most large cities in Poland from Łódź to Warsaw.

====Spain====
Alicante, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Málaga, San Sebastian, and Seville have pedicab service.

====United Kingdom====
Cycle rickshaws operate in central London, including Soho, Piccadilly, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. Pedal Me is a pedicab company using electric cargo bikes to transport passengers and cargo across Central and Inner London. In 2024, Transport for London was given powers to regulate pedicabs, including fare control, vehicle standards and driver licensing.

Rickshaws and pedicabs are found in the centre of Edinburgh where vendors are hired like taxis and provide tours. Pedicabs and their variants are also available in Oxford.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
Two companies operate pedicabs in Sydney. Pedapod operate &#x27;pod&#x27; styled cabs from Queen Victoria Buildings to Circular Quay. Tikki Tikki Australia operate more advanced &#x27;classic&#x27; styled cabs from the Central Railway Station to Circular Quay and up to Kings Cross and down to Star City Casino.Tikki Tikki also has pedicabs and rickshaws in London and Vancouver

Pedicabs are also found in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Darwin, Perth, Gold Coast, Cairns, Townsville, Newcastle, and Byron Bay.

====New Zealand====
New Zealand has had pedicabs since the early 1990s. Auckland currently has 19 bikes mainly run by Bikeman and a few owner-operators.

Queenstown also has a fleet of Danish-made rickshaws run by a local entrepreneur.

==Economic, social and political aspects==

===Economics===

In many Asian cities where they are widely used, cycle rickshaw driving provides essential employment for recent immigrants from rural areas, generally impoverished men. One study in Bangladesh showed that cycle rickshaw driving was connected with some increases in income for poor agricultural labourers who moved to urban areas, but that the extreme physical demands of the job meant that these benefits decreased for long-term drivers. In Jakarta, most cycle rickshaw drivers in the 1980s were former landless agricultural labourers from rural areas of Java.

In 2003, Dhaka cycle rickshaw drivers earned an estimated average of Tk 143 (US$2.38) per day, of which they paid about Tk 50 (US$0.80) to rent the cycle rickshaw for a day. Older, long-term drivers earned substantially less. A 1988–89 survey found that Jakarta drivers earned a daily average of Rp. 2722 (US$1.57). These wages, while widely considered very low for such physically demanding work, do in some situations compare favourably to jobs available to unskilled workers.

In many cities, most drivers do not own their own cycle rickshaws; instead, they rent them from their owners, some of whom own many cycle rickshaws. Driver-ownership rates vary widely. In Delhi, a 1980 study found only one per cent of drivers owned their vehicles, but ownership rates in several other Indian cities were much higher, including fifteen per cent in Hyderabad and twenty-two per cent in Faridabad. A 1977 study in Chiang Mai, Thailand found that 44% of cycle rickshaw drivers were owners. In Bangladesh, driver-ownership is usually highest in rural areas and lowest in the larger cities. Most cycle rickshaws in that country are owned by individuals who have only one or two of them, but some owners in the largest cities own several hundred.

===Social aspects===
In 2012 Ole Kassow, a resident of Copenhagen, wanted to help the elderly get back on their bicycles, but he had to find a solution to their limited mobility. The answer was a cycle rickshaw, and he started offering free cycle rickshaw rides to residents of a nearby nursing home. He then got in touch with a civil society consultant at the City of Copenhagen, Dorthe Pedersen, who was intrigued by the idea, and together they bought five cycle rickshaws and launched an organisation called Cycling Without Age, which has now spread to all corners of Denmark, and since 2015 to another 50 countries around the world.

===Legislation===
Some countries and cities have banned or restricted cycle rickshaws. They are often prohibited in congested areas of major cities. For example, they were banned in Bangkok in the mid-1960s as not fitting the modern image of the city being promoted by the government. In Dhaka and Jakarta, they are no longer permitted on major roads, but are still used to provide transportation within individual urban neighbourhoods. They are banned entirely in Pakistan. While they have been criticised for causing congestion, cycle rickshaws are also often hailed as environmentally-friendly, inexpensive modes of transportation.

In Taiwan, the Road Traffic Security Rules require pedicabs to be registered by their owners with the police before they can be legally driven on public roads, or risk an administrative fine of 300 new Taiwan dollars (TWD). Their drivers must carry the police registration documents or risk a fine of 180 TWD, but no driver licence is required. The administrative fines are based on Articles 69 and 71 of the Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of Road traffic Regulations. As Taiwanese road traffic is now heavily motorised, most pedicabs have been replaced by taxicabs, but they can still be found at limited places, such as Cijin District of Kaohsiung City.

Electric-assist pedicabs were banned in New York City in January 2008, the city council decided to allow pedicabs propelled only by muscle power. The city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, has decided not to issue permits to electric-assist pedicabs.

==Arts==

As a key part of the urban landscape in many cities, cycle rickshaws have been the subject of films and other artwork, as well as being extensively decorated themselves. The cycle rickshaw in Dhaka is especially well known as a major medium for Bengali folk art, as plasticine cutouts and handpainted figures adorn many cycle rickshaws.

Films featuring cycle rickshaws and their drivers include Kickboxer and Sammo Hung&#x27;s 1989 martial arts film &quot;Pedicab Driver&quot;, which dealt with a group of pedicab drivers and their problems with romance and organised crime. &quot;Cyclo&quot;, a 1995 film by Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung, is centered on a cycle rickshaw driver. Tollywood films with cycle rickshaw themes include &quot;Orey Rickshaw&quot; (&quot;Orey&quot; literally means &quot;Hey&quot;, in a derogatory tone), which tells a story sympathising with the downtrodden, and &quot;Rickshavodu&quot; (&quot;Rickshaw Guy&quot;).

<text>Buddha is a demo album by the American rock band Blink-182. Recorded and released in January 1994 under the name Blink, it was the band&#x27;s first recording to be sold and distributed. The band had recorded two previous demos in drummer Scott Raynor&#x27;s bedroom—&quot;Flyswatter&quot; and &quot;Demo No.2&quot;—using a four track recorder. Most of the tracks from &quot;Buddha&quot; were re-recorded for the band&#x27;s subsequent releases; seven were re-recorded for their debut album &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; and one was re-recorded for their second album &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;.

The demo was originally released on the label Filter Records. In the early days of the band, Hoppus worked at the record store The Wherehouse, and became friends with his supervisor, Pat Secor. Hoping to start his own record label, Secor pulled money from his savings and helped finance and produce &quot;Buddha&quot;. The demo was recorded live at local Santee studio Doubletime, comprising nearly all of the songs the trio had written up to that point. Hoppus and friends Cam Jones and Kerry Key photographed the cassette inserts, and the original packaging was compiled by the band and Hoppus&#x27; family. Upon completion, the demo was locally distributed to several San Diego record stores, and was available for purchase at early concerts. &quot;Buddha&quot; helped the trio cement an audience and was a deciding factor in their signing to local label Cargo in 1993.

The recording became the subject of a legal dispute between the band and Secor several years later. The group accused Secor of selling the tape without paying royalties, and attempted to put a stop to his distribution with help of lawyer Joe Escalante of the Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. Kung Fu remixed and remastered the demo, giving it a wider commercial reissue in October 1998. This edition deletes two original tracks for other recordings from the original session. Kung Fu has since reportedly sold 300,000 copies of &quot;Buddha&quot;. It is currently their only commercially available demo. In announcing the band&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Nine&quot;, Hoppus stated that he counted their studio albums beginning with &quot;Buddha&quot;.

==Background==
Blink-182 was formed in Poway, California, a suburb outside of San Diego, in August 1992. After Mark Hoppus graduated from high school in Ridgecrest, he relocated to San Diego to work at a record store and attend college. Tom DeLonge was kicked out of Poway High for attending a basketball game drunk and was forced to attend another local school for one semester. At Rancho Bernardo High School, he befriended Kerry Key, also interested in punk music. Key&#x27;s girlfriend, Anne Hoppus, introduced her brother Mark to DeLonge on August 2, 1992. The two bonded instantly and played for hours in DeLonge&#x27;s garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songs—one of which became &quot;Carousel&quot;. DeLonge recruited friend Scott Raynor for drums, whom he met at a Rancho Bernado Battle of the Bands competition. Raynor was by far the youngest member of the trio at 14, and his event account differs significantly: he claims he and DeLonge formed the group after meeting at the Battle of the Bands and worked through a variety of bassists before meeting Hoppus.

The trio began to practice together in Raynor&#x27;s bedroom, spending hours together writing music, attending punk shows and movies, and playing practical jokes. Hoppus and DeLonge would alternate singing vocal parts. The trio first operated under a variety of names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band &quot;Blink&quot;. Hoppus&#x27; girlfriend was angered by her boyfriend&#x27;s constant attention for the band and demanded him to make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a four track recorder from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a demo tape, with Jones on bass. Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band. &quot;Flyswatter&quot;—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor&#x27;s bedroom in May 1993. Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an avid surfing, skating and snowboarding scene. In contrast to East Coast punk music, the West Coast wave of groups, Blink included, typically introduced more melodic aspects to their music. &quot;New York is gloomy, dark and cold. It makes different music. The Californian middle-class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about,&quot; said DeLonge. San Diego at this time was &quot;hardly a hotbed of [musical] activity&quot;, but the band&#x27;s popularity grew as did California punk rock concurrently in the mainstream.

The band&#x27;s first performance was at a local high school during lunch, and soon the trio graduated to San Diego&#x27;s Spirit Club and influential local shop Alley Kat Records. DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as calling up local high schools convincing them that Blink was a &quot;motivational band with a strong anti-drug message&quot; in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch. The band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and they found their way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at SOMA, a local all-ages venue which they longed to headline. The band&#x27;s equipment was piled into a blue station wagon for touring purposes and they first began to play shows outside San Diego.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Buddha&quot; was financed by Pat Secor, Hoppus&#x27; boss at Wherehouse Music in San Diego. Secor wanted to start his own record label and offered to help pay for costs. &quot;He was like, hey, I&#x27;ll front you the money, and we&#x27;ll split the profits until you pay me back,&quot; recalled Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor&#x27;s seniority of post. &quot;At that point they&#x27;d played around enough to get their chops up so I took all the money I had in savings and we went into the studio for two days,&quot; said Secor.

The recording sessions at Doubletime Studios in Santee, California took place in January 1994, and were scheduled around work and school commitments. Hoppus was sick at the time of recording. Despite this, the band carried on and the demo was complete within two days. &quot;&quot;Buddha&quot; was cut live then we added the vocals. Two days and they were done – including the mix. It&#x27;s quite standard for a young punk band to do that,&quot; said engineer Jeff Forrest. Despite this, the liner notes for the cassette claim it was recorded in twelve hours, while the later remaster of &quot;Buddha&quot; contend it was recorded &quot;over three rainy nights.&quot; The trio were &quot;super stoked&quot; about a sound effects tape they found at the studio, and took time out to add in applause and laughter tracks because they deemed it humorous.

Hoppus and DeLonge took the songwriting for their first legitimate release very seriously. The two strove for perfection writing songs that they felt would be relatable. Blink also recorded joke tracks, as they felt that, in addition to the serious songs, &quot;it was almost as important to make people laugh.&quot; DeLonge recalled that the band spent more time at the end of production on &quot;Buddha&quot; trying to perfect the joke songs rather than their serious tracks. The band&#x27;s main influence on &quot;Buddha&quot;, according to DeLonge, was the Descendents. &quot;I was trying to emulate that band. Really punchy guitars, fast, simple and formulaic nursery rhyme love songs,&quot; he said in 2012.

==Packaging and release==

The photographs in the original cassette release of &quot;Buddha&quot; were photographs taken by friend of the band Cam Jones. Kerry Key, drummer for the Iconoclasts and friend of the band, also is credited with artwork in the original cassette. To produce the artwork, Hoppus and Jones spent an afternoon together taking &quot;artsy&quot; photographs in and around Raynor&#x27;s backyard. The cover art is a picture of a Budai statue (commonly mistaken in the west for statues of the Buddha, hence the demo title). The statue was a present from Hoppus&#x27; stepfather that the bassist grabbed on the way to Raynor&#x27;s for the photos. After developing the photos, they took them to a copy shop to run off color copies. Afterwards, they cut, pasted and rearranged them until they found something suitable. The lyric sheets were handwritten and photocopied. Hoppus and his family in Ridgecrest would spend hours folding and combining pieces of artwork to compile the &quot;Buddha&quot; cassette. When this was complete, Hoppus would load the cassettes into his car and deliver them to local record stores around town.

The demo tape, which was originally untitled, came to be known by the name &quot;Buddha&quot;, and was released by Filter Records in 1994. Cassette copies of &quot;Buddha&quot; were also sold at early Blink concerts, alongside homemade T-shirts.

==Re-release==
The rights to &quot;Buddha&quot; and its associated recordings were the subject of a dispute between the band and Secor in later years. According to Secor, he and the band had a gentleman&#x27;s agreement: he would pay for the costs of recording and manufacturing the tape, and in exchange would receive half of all the profits from it. According to Raynor, the oral agreement was that Secor would invest $1,000 and when that money was recouped, the band would have complete ownership of the work product. Secor helped the band sign to Cargo Music in 1994 using his connections at the label; he felt that by helping the briskly growing band sign a deal he could build his own label, Filter Records, in the wake of Blink&#x27;s success. According to Secor, he attempted to contact the band to discuss the rights to the tape, but would only receive comments such as &quot;Oh, let me call my manager and I&#x27;ll call you right back.&quot; Secor asserted he should have the rights to the master tapes, having financed the entire production. He alleged that Cargo Music began calling him and making threats, and he could not afford to fight back and was unlikely to win since he had no written contract with the band. In 1996, Blink-182 signed a joint-venture deal with major label MCA Records, who Secor also said began calling him. &quot;Try going up against that,&quot; he remarked in 2001.

The band began to grow suspicious that Secor was keeping all the money from selling copies of the &quot;Buddha&quot; cassette, and contacted their lawyer, Joe Escalante of the Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. They informed Escalante that they believed &quot;someone&#x27;s bootlegging it,&quot; and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Kung Fu Records to re-release &quot;Buddha&quot; on compact disc. The band had told Secor not to sell any more copies of the cassette, but suspected that he was still doing so. Escalante anonymously ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. Blink-182 asserted that they were not receiving royalties for these sales. &quot;I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of &quot;Buddha&quot;,&quot; said Secor in 2001. &quot;It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, and I gave them half of what their profit would be. I wanted to have a few to give to people and to have on hand.&quot; Secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the cassettes, since the band &quot;had been paid royalties for that already.&quot;

Kung Fu re-released &quot;Buddha&quot; on CD and cassette in November 1998, and has since re-released the recording on vinyl and retains digital distribution. The remaster cleans and sharpens the sound of tracks, and contains a slightly different track listing. &quot;They&#x27;d already sold 60,000 copies of &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, said Escalante, &quot;and I thought, &#x27;Man, if I can sell just 10% of that that would be great for the label,&#x27; and of course it sold a lot more because they went on to be superstars.&quot; In 2001 the label had reportedly sold 300,000 copies of &quot;Buddha&quot;. &quot;At this point it&#x27;s not even the money,&quot; Secor said at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s the fact that there is no mention of my work anywhere; no credit has been given to me.&quot;

===Reception===
Reviewing the 1998 re-release of &quot;Buddha&quot; for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it three stars out of five, calling it a &quot;promising debut&quot; and &quot;a solid skatepunk record that illustrates the group&#x27;s flair for speedy, catchy hooks and irreverent humor.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; viewed it, alongside proper debut album &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; (1995) as &quot;slapped together lilting melodies and racing beats in an attempt to connect emo and skate punk, a sort of pop hardcore.&quot; &quot;This fast and furious beauty may have been recorded in two days, but it soon had the labels knocking at DeLonge and co&#x27;s door,&quot; said &quot;Total Guitar&quot; in 2012.

<doc id="183362" wikidata="Q835722" url="?curid=183362" title="Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)">
<text>Cheshire Cat is the debut studio album by American rock band Blink-182 (then known as simply &quot;Blink&quot;), released on February 17, 1995, by Cargo Music. The trio, composed of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor, formed in 1992 and recorded three demos that impressed the San Diego–based Cargo label. In addition, their reputation as an irreverent local live act at venues such as SOMA alerted the label, who was seeking to expand into different genres.

Due to budget constraints, the album was recorded quickly with producer Otis Barthoulameu at Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles. Producer Steve Kravac engineered the recording and advised the trio to record additional overdubs. As such, the band spent an additional week re-recording several tracks at Santee, California&#x27;s Doubletime Studios. The album was originally released with the band&#x27;s name as Blink, until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action, after which the band appended &quot;-182&quot; to the end of their name.

Released during the breakthrough year for punk rock in California, the album brought the band great success in and outside of the San Diego skate punk scene. &quot;M+M&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Wasting Time&quot; were released as singles to promote the album, and received popularity locally through radio play. The band toured in support of the album vigorously, most notably on the &quot;GoodTimes&quot; Tour in 1995, which brought them outside of California for the first time. &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; is cited by bands and fans as an iconic release, and has sold over 250,000 copies as of 2001.

==Background==

San Diego–based trio Blink-182, formed in 1992, first promoted itself by recording low-fi demos to distribute to local record stores and at concerts. The three eventually were playing concerts at local venues such as SOMA, which alerted local independent record label Cargo Music. Cargo was at the heart of San Diego&#x27;s music scene, which was not particularly thriving but still produced several skate punk acts. Pat Secor, who funded the trio&#x27;s demo &quot;Buddha&quot; and was the former boss of Hoppus, pulled for Blink&#x27;s move to Cargo through a roommate who knew Cargo executives. Otis Barthoulameu, guitarist of local Cargo Music-signed act Fluf, saw potential in the young band and pushed them from the beginning. Eric Goodis, president of Cargo, wanted to diversify the label by incorporating different styles of music. His son, Brahm Goodis, thought Blink and their style of Southern California punk fit the bill and encouraged his father to listen to a tape. Together, Barthoulameu and Brahm Goodis convinced Eric Goodis to attend a live performance of the band.

Goodis invited the three musicians into his office and made the band an offer: he wanted to &quot;start small&quot; by releasing a 7-inch with the band. Blink were more interested in pursuing a full-length release; they had already saved money for a budget and made arrangements with a friend from a local band to record and release one on their own. Upon knowledge of this information, Goodis withdrew his original offer and signed the band on a trial basis. Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. DeLonge has said that Goodis did not favor the band, and invented the Grilled Cheese imprint of Cargo in order to keep them away from the main label. The &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; sessions were to be the last performance with the band for Raynor, whose family had moved to Reno, Nevada. Raynor stayed with his sister for the summer of 1994 in order to rehearse for the recording of their debut album. The band rehearsed in DeLonge&#x27;s garage, where they wrote &quot;M+M&#x27;s&quot;.

==Recording and production==

The deal was completed and Blink immediately set off to record their debut at the famous Westbeach Recorders in Los Angeles. DeLonge and Hoppus were excited, as the &quot;hallowed ground&quot; had hosted their influences Bad Religion, NOFX, Face to Face, and Ten Foot Pole. Raynor recalled the sessions: &quot;Westbeach was where all the Epitaph bands had been recording at this time. I spent the whole time thinking, &#x27;Greg Graffin probably sat in this chair&#x27;, &#x27;Brett Gurewitz probably stood in this doorway,&#x27; etc.&quot; Fueled by &quot;some great, terrible Chinese food,&quot; the band were forced to record and mix the sixteen tracks in three days, once again recording under serious time constraints. Despite the fact that the band were now in possession of a contract with the biggest indie label in San Diego, Cargo were still not in a position to offer more than a few days&#x27; worth of finances to record the trio&#x27;s first efforts for their new home.

Unfamiliar with the area, the trio got lost on their first day of recording, arriving at the studio three hours late. Blink got to work immediately, setting up Raynor&#x27;s drums and beginning to lay down tracks. &quot;We were working ten- to twelve-hours straight, hardly even breaking for food or anything,&quot; recalled Hoppus in 2001. The band made reservations at local hotel not far from the studio for a room with two double beds. Despite the request, the band were stuck with one king-size bed, with the three musicians sleeping three-across in one bed. DeLonge recorded through Bad Religion guitarist Gurewitz&#x27;s amp, and also accidentally broke his microphones. Producer Steve Kravac was the engineer for the album, and the trio made an immediate impression on him with their humor and eagerness. Kravac set the trio up and recorded most of &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; live, and there were few retakes, which would lead to the record&#x27;s raw appeal.

Kravac pleaded with a frustrated DeLonge and Hoppus (who was &quot;try[ing] to make the best of it&quot;) to book more time for overdubs. According to Jeff Forrest, the band eventually decamped to more familiar surroundings of Doubletime Studios in Santee, California, where they recorded &quot;Buddha&quot;. The trio booked the studio for one week to allow time for additional recording. Still, recording progressed quickly at Doubletime according to Forrest, and the record was mixed as they went along. Forrest suggested a line (&quot;In my town you can&#x27;t drive naked&quot;) for &quot;Wasting Time&quot; while Hoppus was recording his vocals for the track. Despite the lost time and the pressure of limited resources, the recording went well. When completed, the quality of the recording was &quot;near perfect&quot; to the young band. As it was, Raynor moved to Reno and was replaced briefly with school friend Mike Krull. Hoppus and DeLonge wanted Raynor back, and Raynor moved back to San Diego to live with Hoppus and his family.

==Packaging, title and composition==

===Artwork===
The album&#x27;s title and cover artwork originated from a calendar DeLonge had purchased. His day job in the first years of the band was hauling bags of concrete. While at work at an industrial park warehouse, a foreign salesman going door-to-door approached him with the calendar, which showcased photographs of cats. DeLonge found the calendars offbeat and showed Hoppus, who likened a photo of a Siamese cat with intensely colored eyes to the famous character from the Lewis Carroll novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. The band&#x27;s request to use the photo was denied by the calendar company, however, the band employed Cargo&#x27;s art department to computer enhance the photo until the band was safe from copyright infringement. DeLonge joked in 2020 that it was the &quot;worst album cover ever&quot;.

===Music===
DeLonge, at the time of its release, called the album&#x27;s musical style &quot;not punk rock [...] We&#x27;re nothing like the Sex Pistols, but our music kind of flowed from this genre of fast music with melody.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the album&#x27;s lyrical themes in a 1995 profile: &quot;Most of blink-182&#x27;s songs poke fun at their own youthful escapades, focusing on raging hormones, candy, masturbation, intestinal gas and other topics of interest to adolescents.&quot; The refusal to grow up, which arises in many later Blink-182 songs (most notably &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;) is a common lyrical theme on the record. The album&#x27;s sound is inspired by punk groups the band idolized, such as the Vandals, the Descendents and NOFX. &quot;Every song of ours is a version of another punk song that I&#x27;ve heard and tried to make better,&quot; DeLonge remarked at the time. &quot;In the end, ours wind up a little different, but I know where the influence came from, and I think it&#x27;s important to acknowledge that.&quot; A number of the tracks on &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; are recycled from the band&#x27;s previous demos.

&quot;Carousel&quot; is the record&#x27;s first track, which also opened the Filter cassette demo &quot;Buddha&quot;. The song had its genesis in the very first jam session between Hoppus and DeLonge in 1992. It contains skate punk influences and has been described as &quot;a satisfyingly fast-assed punk song in the vein of NOFX with some very adept dynamic breakdowns.&quot; The record&#x27;s first single, &quot;M+M&#x27;s&quot;, follows, which is based around power chords and Hoppus&#x27; lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. Track three, &quot;Fentoozler&quot; is another recycled song from &quot;Buddha&quot;. &quot;Touchdown Boy&quot; is written about being &quot;the hero who always gets the girl.&quot; It is based around a school friend the trio knew and originally included his name, until the band thought better and toned it down. &quot;Strings&quot; follows, and &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; afterward, which is about &quot;holding off from being aggressive when other people are telling you what to do.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes&quot; carries on the relationship theme, and &quot;Does My Breath Smell?&quot; has been described as &quot;[DeLonge] singing some self-searching lyrics over a subdued riff&quot; that later &quot;[slams] into mosh-melting territory ... with one of the most economical lead guitar counterpoints to the layered vocals so far.&quot; The following track, &quot;Cacophony&quot; is slower-paced and revolves around a relationship in which confusion reigns due to the imbalance of enthusiasm between both involved. Shooman writes that &quot;the lyrics are unguarded and show a sensitive side of Blink that&#x27;s quite often been somewhat obfuscated over the years by the popular perception of the band as goons goofing off.&quot; &quot;TV&quot; asserts that television is a vital part of life, and the recycled &quot;Toast and Bananas&quot; follows. &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, which became the record&#x27;s second and final single, is sung by Hoppus, longing for the object of his affection. &quot;Romeo and Rebecca&quot;, likewise, argues that the object of his affection, and the fairer sex as a whole are a waste of time. Three more tracks close out &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, all of which are joke tracks, &quot;Ben Wah Balls,&quot; &quot;Just About Done,&quot; and, &quot;Depends.&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; was released through Cargo Music on February 17, 1995, on cassette. Initially, Goodis bet DeLonge the album would only sell 3,000 copies; by 2001, over 250,000 copies of the debut were sold. A CD release of the album occurred in 1995, and a vinyl version was released in small quantities in 1996. Along with the re-release of &quot;Buddha&quot; in November 1998, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; was re-released and received national distribution for the first time. &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; has been called an iconic release by bands and fans. As an independent release, very few reviews were published upon initial release. Retrospective reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that &quot;the group is rather scattershot here, hitting the target as often as they miss it,&quot; noting that the release is better suited to more involved fans. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would rate the record at two and a half stars in 2001, describing it as &quot;slapped together lilting melodies and racing beats in an attempt to connect emo and skate punk, a sort of pop hardcore.&quot; Website AbsolutePunk called &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; a &quot;good early indicator of what Blink-182 would turn out to be. Their sound wasn’t quite as polished, but they were certainly miles ahead of a lot of their peers at the time.&quot; At Fuse, it was list as one of the &quot;strongest&quot; pop-punk debut albums by Marie Sheyman, who added &quot;they made the punk rock they loved even catchier&quot;.

&quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; was a strong seller for an independent band, despite the fact that popularity grew in the form of unauthorized CD copies across the country. The band were acquiring legions of new fans and radio play, and the buzz created by the album inspired manager Rick DeVoe to call Hoppus, wanting to manage the band. DeLonge threw together a crude &quot;press kit&quot; for DeVoe, which included photocopies of fanzines, reviews, and some cartoons drawn by DeLonge. The band members were ecstatic when DeVoe signed on with the band, as he promoted larger bands such as Pennywise, NOFX, and The Offspring. The attention also brought forth calls from Rick Bonde, of the Tahoe Agency, a booking agency based out of Lake Tahoe that worked with big punk and ska names such as Sublime. The husband-and-wife team of Rick and Jean Bonde, who owned and operated the company, began arranging shows for the band and minitours that gave Blink their first promotion outside of San Diego.

Mike Halloran, disc jockey at XETRA-FM (branded on-air as 91X), made &quot;M+M&#x27;s&quot; a regular part of his radio show playlist, which Hoppus cites as the first person to play the band. When DeLonge first heard their song on the radio while driving in his car, he rolled down his window, &quot;yelling at everyone to turn their damn radios on.&quot; The single was a local success and Cargo offered the band a small budget ($10,000) to film a music video. Darren Doane, who had previously worked with MxPx and Pennywise, directed the clip. &quot;We weren&#x27;t planning on doing anything with that video except hoping it got on a surf video or something,&quot; said Hoppus. A Cargo Music employee presented the video to MTV, but network executives &quot;threw the tape out&quot; upon seeing guns in the film. Meanwhile, the record also drew the attention of an Irish techno band, also named Blink. Unwilling to engage in a legal battle, the band agreed to change their name. Cargo gave the band a week, but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward. Eventually, Cargo called the band, demanding to &quot;change the name or [we&#x27;ll] change it for you,&quot; after which the band decided on a random number, 182.

The band also received their first profile in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in December 1995, which praised the album but questioned their authenticity and &quot;punk&quot; label. &quot;I mean, is it the retro rock of England&#x27;s Exploited, the anarchy of the Ramones or the political focus of Bad Religion? Punk has gone off in so many different directions that you can&#x27;t really classify it anymore,&quot; DeLonge said. &quot;People said Elvis Costello was punk when he first came out.&quot;

==Touring and &quot;GoodTimes&quot;==
The band expanded their fan-base outside of San Diego by embarking on their first national tour shortly after the release of &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;. Alongside 7 Seconds and Unwritten Law, the band travelled in a small convoy of cars, being too young and broke to afford a van. Unwritten Law loaned the band their van, named &quot;The Cock&quot;, for their first out-of-town gig in Reno, Nevada, and it broke before they were able to make it back. The band eventually purchased a Chevy Beauville tour van they christened &quot;The Millennium Falcon&quot;. Through new manager Rick DeVoe&#x27;s connections, the band broke through the surf/snowboarding scene by appearing on the surf video &quot;GoodTimes&quot;. The video was financed by Taylor Steele, friend of DeVoe, who wanted to put together a tour in support of the tape.

The &quot;GoodTimes&quot; Tour of October 1995, featuring the aforementioned bands and Sprung Monkey, introduced the trio to the south and east and was the band&#x27;s first national tour. The trip was not without its incidents: DeLonge was arrested for underage drinking on Halloween 1995 in Jacksonville, Florida, and on another occasion, a small riot broke out between bouncers using excessive force and fans. The trio desperately wanted to continue on the second leg of the tour in Australia but lacked the funds; the members of Pennywise helped out and bought the band&#x27;s plane tickets. Raynor recalled the tour fondly in 2010: &quot;Honestly, the shows went well. We always got a good reaction, and the next time we came around we had more fans and better floors to sleep on — some with carpet!&quot; Hoppus&#x27; sister, Anne, made T-shirts and described the tour: &quot;Any money made goes back into the gas fund. You only have five dollars and it has to feed you all day. You eat nothing but crappy fast food, or on a good night, Denny&#x27;s.&quot;

Early 1996 saw the three trekking to Alaska to perform and compete in a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; snowboarding contest. It was the site of an infamous prank fight between the members of the band and Pennywise that ended with local police being called and hotel security banning them. The band&#x27;s first headlining tour took place afterward, and the following February dates — later dubbed the &quot;Shitty Weather&quot; tour — found the band performing through a harsh rain and snow. A seventeen-hour drive to Quebec City found DeLonge driving the entire way, unable to see through a snowstorm (&quot;the biggest to hit the Northeast in forty years&quot;). By March 1996, major labels began courting the band and the trio signed a joint-venture deal with MCA Records to distribute their sophomore effort, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, to be recorded that winter.

In all, the group toured the US three times and went to Alaska, Australia and Hawaii twice. &quot;It&#x27;s tiring,&quot; DeLonge told &quot;Thrasher&quot; in November 1996. &quot;Then again, I just remember I used to work at this stupid job. I think about that, and I realize I&#x27;m not that bad off.&quot;

<doc id="183363" wikidata="Q3205402" url="?curid=183363" title="The Sword in the Stone (novel)">
<text>The Sword in the Stone is a 1938 novel by British writer T. H. White. First published by Collins in the United Kingdom as a stand-alone work, it later became the first part of a tetralogy, &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;. A fantasy of the boyhood of King Arthur, it is a &quot;sui generis&quot; work which combines elements of legend, history, fantasy, and comedy. Walt Disney Productions adapted the story to an animated film, and the BBC adapted it to radio. 

&quot;Time&quot; included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time. In 2014, &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; was awarded a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1939.

==Background==
The premise is that Arthur&#x27;s youth, not dealt with in Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1485), was a time when he was tutored by Merlyn to prepare him for the use of power and royal life. Merlyn magically turns him into various animals at times, and he also has more human adventures. The setting is loosely based on Medieval England, and in places it incorporates White&#x27;s considerable knowledge of medieval culture (e.g., hunting, falconry and jousting). However, it makes no attempt at consistent historical accuracy, and incorporates some obvious anachronisms.

== Plot of the &quot;Once and Future King&quot; version ==
The Wart is an orphan boy being raised by Sir Ector in the Castle Sauvage surrounded by the Forest of the same name. Alongside Ector&#x27;s son Kay, Wart is training as a knight, although he can only rise to be Kay&#x27;s squire because he is of common birth. Chasing a tiercel goshawk that Kay had let get away during their falconry practice, Wart gets lost in the Forest Sauvage. He is shot at by an unseen bowman, and he encounters King Pellinore who is busy hunting the Questing Beast. Eventually, he meets the wizard Merlyn who is living backward in time, and frequently speaks of things that he has seen in the future. 

Wart and Merlyn return to Ector&#x27;s castle, and the wizard becomes the boys&#x27; tutor. He pays special attention to Wart. Merlyn turns him into a fish, and together they explore the castle&#x27;s moat. In one of their excursions, the boys and Merlyn encounter Little John, who leads them to Robin Hood (referred to as Robin Wood) and Marian. Their extended stay with Robin culminates in an encounter with a griffin. Kay manages to slay the beast, taking its head as a trophy. During the fray, the griffin breaks the Wart&#x27;s collar bone.

While Wart is stuck in bed, Merlyn sends a spell through his bedroom keyhole to turn him into an ant. Wart crawls into the ant farms in his room and learns that ants think in binary terms of &quot;Done&quot; or &quot;Not Done&quot;. After his clavicle heals, Merlyn later changes Wart into a badger, and then a wild goose that flies so high as to not be able to perceive national boundaries, a pacifist message. Wart is confused about why he is tasked with keeping watch while the other geese eat. He assumes that he is meant to look out for rival geese, but the very notion that geese would eat their own kind is offensive to them. 

When Kay is ready to be knighted, Sir Ector and his retinue travel to London, where he owns some property. As Kay approaches the tournament field, he realizes that he has left his sword back at the inn. Wart is sent back to retrieve it, but finds the inn locked. He finds a sword stuck in an anvil atop a stone in a churchyard. When Wart touches the sword, his senses heighten. He is unable to pull it out, but as he tries again, the voices of all the animals and friends he has made give him encouragement and remind him of the lessons they taught him. On the third try, the sword comes loose, and Wart rushes to Kay with it.

When Kay learns that Wart pulled it from the anvil, he knows it is the sword that will determine Uther Pendragon&#x27;s successor. He tells Sir Ector that &quot;he&quot; pulled it from the stone. However, when Ector asks him to replicate the feat, Kay admits that Wart was responsible. Wart is terrified when Sir Ector and Kay bow to him as their King.

After he is crowned, Wart is given gifts from all over the world and from his friends, both animal and human. Sir Ector sends him a dunce cap, which transforms into Merlyn. The wizard explains that Wart is Uther&#x27;s son, and that his real name is Arthur.

==Revisions==
The English Collins first edition was partially rewritten for Putnam in America.

The version appearing in 1958 in the tetralogy was substantially revised, partly to incorporate events and themes that White had originally intended to cover in a fifth volume (which was finally published after his death, as &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot;). To this end, the revised version includes several new episodes, including the ant and goose episodes, but leaves out some of the episodes that had appeared in the original (e.g. Merlyn&#x27;s battle with Madam Mim which appeared in the Disney film). Some critics considered the revised version to be inferior to the original. Publishers have tended to carry on using the original versions when they were published independently of the tetralogy.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

Walt Disney made an animated film adaptation of &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;, first released on 25 December 1963 by Buena Vista Distribution. Similar to many Disney films, it is based on the general plot of the original story, but much of the substance and depth of the story is considerably changed.

===Radio dramatization===
The BBC broadcast a six-part radio dramatisation in 1939, with incidental music by Benjamin Britten. A single surviving 25-minute episode, &quot;Wart and the Hawks&quot;, is available to stream online. It was revived in 1952, following re-discovery of Britten&#x27;s score after it had been thought lost. A further BBC radio adaptation in 1982 starred Michael Hordern as Merlyn. Hordern had already starred as another famous wizard, Gandalf, in the BBC&#x27;s 1981 radio adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien.

<text>The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!) is a live album by American rock band Blink-182. It was released on November 7, 2000, by MCA Records. Blink-182 had risen to fame at the turn of the millennium on the strength of its third album, &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, which went multiplatinum. Capturing the band&#x27;s stage show—known for its irreverent humor—with a live release was designed to satisfy fans between new studio albums. The album was recorded over two nights at performances in their native California, on the group&#x27;s inaugural arena tour.

The album contains energetic, high-speed renditions of the band&#x27;s catalogue up to that point in their career. The set list includes singles such as &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, and &quot;Dammit&quot;. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus trade juvenile jokes in-between songs, while drummer Travis Barker performs with virtuosity. The album&#x27;s sleeve was designed by artist Glen Hanson, who received an award for his work on it. Jerry Finn, the band&#x27;s frequent collaborator, produced and mixed the album.

Marketed as a limited edition release, &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot; was initially available for only two months at retail. During that time, the album sold over 500,000 copies in the US, earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. &quot;Man Overboard&quot;—a bonus studio single recorded to promote its release—reached number two on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The album proved influential for future pop punk acts, including Man Overboard and All Time Low. In recent years, the album has seen sporadic availability on digital platforms.

==Background==
Blink-182 broke into the mainstream with its 1999 album &quot;Enema of the State&quot;—a fast, glossy pop-punk record with multiple hit singles. The LP proved enormously successful, shifting over five million units domestically, and three times that number worldwide. It became a time of transition for the group, who performed worldwide in larger venues than before, including amphitheaters, arenas, and stadiums. At the beginning of the album&#x27;s promotional cycle, the trio were driving from show to show in a van with a trailer attached for merchandise and equipment; by its end, they were traveling by double-decker bus and flying on private jets. Bassist Mark Hoppus recalled that &quot;we had gone from playing small clubs and sleeping on people&#x27;s floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels.&quot; Guitarist Tom DeLonge, in a band biography, recalled that touring arenas &quot;was amazing, because it was the first time we&#x27;d ever done anything that big. I felt like a success story.&quot; Drummer Travis Barker, in his memoir &quot;Can I Say&quot;, recalled his newfound stardom: &quot;[The] album took us all over the world, for months at a time. We were playing awards shows with [pop stars] Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera when we were used to hanging with bands like the Vandals, Unwritten Law, and 7 Seconds.&quot;

Capturing the band&#x27;s stage show with a live album was designed to satisfy fans between new studio albums. The content of &quot;The Mark, Tom and Travis Show&quot; was recorded at two concerts in California. These shows—a part of the band&#x27;s first arena outing, the Loserkids Tour—took place on November 4, 1999, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California, and November 5, 1999, at Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City, California. The album was titled after the band&#x27;s 2000 worldwide tour, while the subtitle alludes to both &quot;Enema of the State&quot; and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. The recordings were captured by Le Mobile, a California-based mobile recording unit. Le Mobile has also recorded live albums for artists such as the Offspring, Van Morrison, Kenny G, and Robin Thicke.

Hoppus described the experience as daunting, especially the Los Angeles show: &quot;Playing shows in LA is already nerve-wracking enough because you have friends and family and agents and lawyers and label people and radio stations,&quot; he told &quot;Rock Sound&quot; in 2020. The album was produced and mixed by Jerry Finn, a veteran punk rock producer that the band previously collaborated with on &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. Additional editing of the recordings took place at Signature Sound in the band&#x27;s hometown, San Diego; Finn mixed the album at Cello Studios in Hollywood, where it was also finalized at Bernie Grundman Mastering. The album&#x27;s artwork was illustrated by artist Glen Hanson, best known for later designing the Mattel fashion doll franchise &quot;Monster High&quot;. The drawing depicts the band performing for a colorful audience of characters, including a wizard, nude men, an alien, and &quot;Enema of the State&quot; cover model Janine Lindemulder. Hanson was awarded a certificate of excellence from the American Institute of Graphic Arts for his work on the sleeve. The design of the CD sleeve was headed by Tim Stedman, then vice president of the art department for MCA Records.

==Composition==
===Music===
&quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot; features live renditions of songs from the band&#x27;s first three albums: &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, and &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. It leans heavily on the contents of the latter, as the band were touring in support of it at the time. Most of the songs are performed at a significantly faster tempo than the album versions. &quot;We played the songs at lightning speed, and the dick jokes were at an all-time high. It was a perfect representation of what we sounded like and who we were at that time,&quot; Barker has recalled. The band&#x27;s songs commonly focus on autobiographical lyrical subjects such as relationships, and adolescent themes like high school and teen angst. Greg Kot at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; perceived an &quot;undercurrent of seriousness and an attention to songcraft that might not be instantly apparent beneath the prankster veneer.&quot;

Guitarist Tom DeLonge&#x27;s guitar riffs are down-stroked and power-chord heavy, with large amounts of palm muting, while Hoppus acts as a combination between a rhythm guitarist and bassist. Writer Greg Heller of &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, on the topic of Barker&#x27;s role, observed that &quot;In the great tradition of Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;Live at Budokan&quot;, the [album] showcases the drummer&#x27;s quiet fury—which is to say that when not drumming furiously, he&#x27;s quiet [...] But when playing he&#x27;s the loudmouth, squeezing fills into rolls with unthinkable technicality and brutal abandon.&quot; Heller felt that Barker&#x27;s percussive work on the album offers &quot;something slightly more eclectic&quot; than the typical &quot;repetitive blitzkrieg&quot; of double-time punk drumming. At this point in his career, Barker listed veteran percussionists Steve Gadd, Dennis Chambers, and Stewart Copeland as influences. DeLonge and Hoppus, meanwhile, jokingly prioritize carelessness, remarking on the album that they &quot;professionally suck.&quot;

At the conclusion of the live set, the album crossfades into &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, a new studio track. The song was originally demoed during the sessions that produced &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, but was left off the final album. It lyrically references former drummer Scott Raynor, likening his expulsion from the group to an exclamation made when a passenger falls from a ship. The band wanted to include a new studio cover song as a bonus track, potentially from an artist like the Police, Phil Collins, or Paul Simon, but it was difficult to find time between their busy schedule.

===Humor===
The album contains a handful of juvenile joke songs, including &quot;Family Reunion&quot;, a musical retelling of comedian George Carlin&#x27;s seven dirty words routine, and &quot;Blow Job&quot;, a celebration of oral sex. Throughout the performance, DeLonge and Hoppus alternate vocally portraying Satan through a voice changer, and parody their own lyrics. Nearly every song concludes with long, improvised repartee between the two musicians, often starting with DeLonge shouting &quot;Hey Mark!&quot; and punctuated by belching. &quot;I always hated bands that just sit there and play,&quot; DeLonge said to disc jockey Michael Halloran. &quot;I think us interacting with the audience is different, and original, and it&#x27;s fun to do.&quot; The LP concludes with nearly eleven minutes of this collected banter, in which DeLonge references the duo&#x27;s off-color tendency: &quot;Hey, how come every time we say a joke, it has to be about fucking, sex, masturbation, incest, or anything gross like that? [...] There&#x27;s nothing else to talk about!&quot; These tracks, collectively known as &quot;Words of Wisdom&quot;, are culled from DAT recordings of thirty shows across the Mark, Tom and Travis Show Tour, and were compiled by a member of band&#x27;s entourage. Hoppus called it &quot;the worst, most obscene, foul-language. On that tour me and Tom were really trying to see who could outdo the other and say the most ridiculous thing on stage.&quot; DeLonge expressed surprise at audience members&#x27; potential offense to their humor, noting that the scene the group came up in included acts like Guttermouth, whose frontman Mark Adkins was known to stick a drum stick up his rear on-stage—so their dialogue certainly felt tame in comparison.

Barker, who voted against including the 26-track collection of crosstalk, takes no part in the silliness, and communicates solely in rimshots. &quot;Probably 60 percent of the time, what they&#x27;re saying between songs is genuinely funny,&quot; he told Heller. &quot;But the other times... that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m kicking or doing something behind the drum set to say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s play the next song.&#x27; They tried before [to get me involved]: &#x27;Get a mic. Tell a joke.&#x27; But that&#x27;s just not my style. I&#x27;d just rather play a song.&quot; This type of between-song dialogue has been compared to Paul Stanley&#x27;s stage banter on the Kiss live album &quot;Alive!&quot;, as well as the Slayer bootleg album &quot;Do You Dig Older Women?&quot;. Allmusic reviewer MacKenzie Wilson dismissed this humor as &quot;immature, [but] harmless.&quot; In contrast to their crude humor, the duo were fairly straight-laced behind-the-scenes, compared to many s. A 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; profile by writer Gavin Edwards details the band: &quot;They say they don&#x27;t use drugs. Their tour rider mandates a supply of beer, which they routinely donate to the road crew. [...] Hoppus&#x27; and DeLonge&#x27;s antics mask a mature streak that, given their fondness for fart jokes and references to one another&#x27;s penises, in itself seems shocking.&quot; Nevertheless, the band&#x27;s tendency to celebrate audience members flashing their breasts drew criticism. Hoppus responded to these critiques in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; story; &quot;I just get super bummed-out when 13-year-old girls show their boobs. [...] Now, we&#x27;re the first show for a lot of kids, so I just want them to have fun and get out safe.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot; was first alluded to in an August 2000 article on MTV News, which reported the band were back in the studio to record a studio track accompanying the album, &quot;Man Overboard&quot;. The song debuted online, streaming exclusively on MTV.com, KROQ.com and the band&#x27;s official website on September 2, 2000. The song was later serviced to radio on September 18, where it quickly rose up &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song peaked at number two on November 18, 2000, its eighth week on the chart, representing another hit single for the band. The live version of &quot;Dumpweed&quot; was also issued as a promotional single to support the album.

&quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot; was released on compact disc and cassette worldwide on November 7, 2000, with a suggested list price of $12.98 in the US. It was marketed as a limited edition release, and was only available for two months in stores. The album premiered with sales of between 110,000 and 128,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, debuting at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the issue dated November 25, 2000. It charted highest in Canada, where it peaked at number four, and in Australia, where it debuted on the ARIA Charts at number six. It was quickly certified gold in several regions; in Canada, the album was certified platinum by Music Canada for sales of over 100,000 copies; overseas, in the United Kingdom, it similarly attained 100,000 sales, resulting in a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry.

It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 17, 2001, denoting shipments of over 500,000 copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Mark, Tom and Travis Show&quot; received mixed reviews from critics at the time of its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 56, based on eight reviews, indicating a &quot;mixed or average&quot; response. Wilson of Allmusic dubbed the album &quot;a real rock show [and] high-speed energy at finest [...] in the midst of teen pop mediocrity and post-grunge rollickers, it&#x27;s good to see a band such as blink-182 enjoying its time on top of the world.&quot; Alex Pappademas of &quot;Spin&quot; was appreciative of Hoppus and DeLonge&#x27;s &quot;smirky, self-deprecating one-liners [that] can&#x27;t conceal the music&#x27;s winning wistfulness.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that &quot;DeLonge is one terrific little guitar player, the comic chitchat interludes are a sweet bonus for fans, and Blink-182 steal enough moronic hooks to make &quot;The Enema Strikes Back!&quot; a hoot.&quot;

Mike Pace of PopMatters wrote that &quot;the recording sounds bright and full, and while the suits at MCA surely had something to do with that production-wise, one can&#x27;t fault Tom Delonge for coming into his own as a guitar player, and probably getting more mileage out of the C, G, A, F and G, C, D chord progressions than any band thus far.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; observed that the album &quot;obeys the First Three Laws of Rock: have a good time; maintain the generation gap; keep it simple.&quot; The more negative reviews came from &quot;NME&quot;, with writer Siobhan Grogan deriding the album as &quot;the tragic sound of three men so desperately trying to avoid growing up.&quot; Tom Sinclair, reviewing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, found the collection to be &quot;wholly unwarranted,&quot; criticizing the &quot;laughably obvious&quot; marketing strategy of &quot;quickly flood[ing] the market with blink-182 product before their fans outgrow &#x27;em.&quot; Retrospective reviews have since become more positive. Consequence of Sound contributor Alex Young retrospectively reviewed the album in 2008, praising the band&#x27;s energy and considering it a part of that &quot;timeless teenage tradition of offending parents and pushing the boundaries.&quot;

==Legacy and availability==
&quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)&quot; proved influential to a generation of pop punk musicians. The New Jersey band Man Overboard named themselves after the album&#x27;s lead single, while the members of Baltimore-based pop punk outfit All Time Low first bonded over listening to the album. Still, re-releases and availability of &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show&quot; have proven scarce. The original CD was only in stores for two months; it was pulled in January 2001. In the US, Universal Music Group first issued the album on vinyl in 2011 through mall chain Hot Topic, while Canadian independent label SRC reissued it on high-fidelity audiophile vinyl and cassette in 2015 and 2016. It has been infrequently available for digital download or on streaming services; in 2017, upon its latest removal, it prompted Man Overboard guitarist Zac Eisenstein to publicly bemoan its absence. It became re-available on Spotify and Apple Music in 2019, but only in certain regions.

<doc id="183365" wikidata="Q284935" url="?curid=183365" title="Universal Plug and Play">
<text>Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a set of networking protocols on the Internet Protocol (IP) that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices, to seamlessly discover each other&#x27;s presence on the network and establish functional network services. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise-class devices.

UPnP assumes the network runs IP, and then uses HTTP on top of IP to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and event notification. Device search requests and advertisements are supported by running HTTP on top of UDP (port 1900) using multicast (known as HTTPMU). Responses to search requests are also sent over UDP, but are instead sent using unicast (known as HTTPU).

Conceptually, UPnP extends plug and play—a technology for dynamically attaching devices directly to a computer—to zero-configuration networking for residential and SOHO wireless networks. UPnP devices are plug-and-play in that, when connected to a network, they automatically establish working configurations with other devices, removing the need for users to manually configure and add devices through IP addresses.

UPnP is generally regarded as unsuitable for deployment in business settings for reasons of economy, complexity, and consistency: the multicast foundation makes it chatty, consuming too many network resources on networks with a large population of devices; the simplified access controls do not map well to complex environments.

==Overview==
The UPnP architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics, mobile devices, personal computers, and networked home appliances. It is a distributed, open architecture protocol based on established standards such as the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), HTTP, XML, and SOAP. UPnP &quot;control points&quot; (CPs) are devices which use UPnP protocols to control UPnP &quot;controlled devices&quot; (CDs).

The UPnP architecture supports zero-configuration networking. A UPnP-compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, announce its name, advertise or convey its capabilities upon request, and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network. Devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving state information.

UPnP was published as a 73-part international standard ISO/IEC 29341 in December 2008.

Other UPnP features include:
; Media and device independence: UPnP technology can run on many media that support IP, including Ethernet, FireWire, IR (IrDA), home wiring (G.hn) and RF (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi). No special device driver support is necessary; common network protocols are used instead.
; User interface (UI) control: &quot;Optionally&quot;, the UPnP architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser (see Presentation below).
; Operating system and programming language independence: Any operating system and any programming language can be used to build UPnP products. UPnP stacks are available for most platforms and operating systems in both closed- and open-source forms.
; Programmatic control: UPnP architecture also enables conventional application programmatic control.
; Extensibility: Each UPnP product can have device-specific services layered on top of the basic architecture. In addition to combining services defined by UPnP Forum in various ways, vendors can define their own device and service types, and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions, state variables, data structure elements, and variable values.

==Protocol==
UPnP uses common Internet technologies. It assumes the network must run Internet Protocol (IP) and then uses HTTP, SOAP and XML on top of IP, in order to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and eventing. Device search requests and advertisements are supported by running HTTP on top of UDP using multicast (known as HTTPMU). Responses to search requests are also sent over UDP, but are instead sent using unicast (known as HTTPU). UPnP uses UDP due to its lower overhead in not requiring confirmation of received data and retransmission of corrupt packets. HTTPU and HTTPMU were initially submitted as an Internet Draft, but it expired in 2001; these specifications have since been integrated into the actual UPnP specifications.

UPnP uses UDP port 1900, and all used TCP ports are derived from the SSDP alive and response messages.

===Addressing===
The foundation for UPnP networking is IP addressing. Each device must implement a DHCP client and search for a DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network. If no DHCP server is available, the device must assign itself an address. The process by which a UPnP device assigns itself an address is known within the UPnP Device Architecture as AutoIP. In UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.0, AutoIP is defined within the specification itself; in UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.1, AutoIP references IETF . If during the DHCP transaction, the device obtains a domain name, for example, through a DNS server or via DNS forwarding, the device should use that name in subsequent network operations; otherwise, the device should use its IP address.

===Discovery===
Once a device has established an IP address, the next step in UPnP networking is discovery. The UPnP discovery protocol is known as the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP). When a device is added to the network, SSDP allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network. This is achieved by sending SSDP alive messages. When a control point is added to the network, SSDP allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the SSDP alive messages of devices. The fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services, for example, its type, identifier, and a pointer (network location) to more detailed information.

===Description===
After a control point has discovered a device, the control point still knows very little about the device. For the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities, or to interact with the device, the control point must retrieve the device&#x27;s description from the location (URL) provided by the device in the discovery message. The UPnP Device Description is expressed in XML and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number, serial number, manufacturer name, (presentation) URLs to vendor-specific web sites, etc. The description also includes a list of any embedded services. For each service, the Device Description document lists the URLs for control, eventing and service description. Each service description includes a list of the commands, or &quot;actions&quot;, to which the service responds, and parameters, or &quot;arguments&quot;, for each action; the description for a service also includes a list of variables; these variables model the state of the service at run time and are described in terms of their data type, range, and event characteristics.

===Control===
Having retrieved a description of the device, the control point can send actions to a device&#x27;s service. To do this, a control point sends a suitable control message to the control URL for the service (provided in the device description). Control messages are also expressed in XML using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Much like function calls, the service returns any action-specific values in response to the control message. The effects of the action, if any, are modeled by changes in the variables that describe the run-time state of the service.

===Event notification===
Another capability of UPnP networking is event notification, or &quot;eventing&quot;. The event notification protocol defined in the UPnP Device Architecture is known as General Event Notification Architecture (GENA). A UPnP description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time. The service publishes updates when these variables change, and a control point may subscribe to receive this information. The service publishes updates by sending event messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables. These messages are also expressed in XML. A special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names and values for all &quot;evented&quot; variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to keep all control points equally informed about the effects of any action. Therefore, all subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all &quot;evented&quot; variables that have changed, and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed (either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed).

===Presentation===
The final step in UPnP networking is presentation. If a device has a URL for presentation, then the control point can retrieve a page from this URL, load the page into a web browser, and depending on the capabilities of the page, allow a user to control the device and/or view device status. The degree to which each of these can be accomplished depends on the specific capabilities of the presentation page and device.

==AV standards==

&quot;UPnP AV architecture&quot; is an audio and video extension of the UPnP, supporting a variety of devices such as TVs, VCRs, CD/DVD players/jukeboxes, settop boxes, stereos systems, MP3 players, still image cameras, camcorders, electronic picture frames (EPFs), and personal computers. The UPnP AV architecture allows devices to support different types of formats for the entertainment content, including MPEG2, MPEG4, JPEG, MP3, Windows Media Audio (WMA), bitmaps (BMP), and NTSC, PAL or ATSC formats. Multiple types of transfer protocols are supported, including IEEE 1394, HTTP, RTP and TCP/IP.

On 12 July 2006, the UPnP Forum announced the release of version 2 of the UPnP Audio and Video specifications, with new &quot;MediaServer&quot; (MS) version 2.0 and &quot;MediaRenderer&quot; (MR) version 2.0 classes. These enhancements are created by adding capabilities to the MediaServer and MediaRenderer device classes, allowing a higher level of interoperability between products made by different manufacturers. Some of the early devices complying with these standards were marketed by Philips under the Streamium brand name.

Since 2006, versions 3 and 4 of the UPnP audio and video device control protocols have been published. In March 2013, an updated uPnP AV architecture specification was published, incorporating the updated device control protocols. UPnP Device Architecture 2.0 was released in April 2020.

The UPnP AV standards have been referenced in specifications published by other organizations including Digital Living Network Alliance Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines, International Electrotechnical Commission IEC 62481-1, and Cable Television Laboratories OpenCable Home Networking Protocol.

==AV components==
Generally a UPnP audio/video (AV) architecture consists of:

* Control Point: a device that discovers Media Servers and Media Renderers, then connects them
* Media Server: the server that stores content on the network to be accessed by Media Renderers
* Media Renderer: a device that renders (&#x27;plays&#x27;) content received from a Media Server.

===Media server===
A is the UPnP-server (&quot;master&quot; device) that provides media library information and streams media-data (like audio/video/picture/files) to UPnP clients on the network. It is a computer system or a similar digital appliance that stores digital media, such as photographs, movies, or music and shares these with other devices.

UPnP AV media servers provide a service to UPnP AV client devices, so-called &quot;control points&quot;, for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback.

UPnP media servers are available for most operating systems and many hardware platforms. UPnP AV media servers can either be categorized as software-based or hardware-based. Software-based UPnP AV media servers can be run on a PC. Hardware-based UPnP AV media servers may run on any NAS devices or any specific hardware for delivering media, such as a DVR. As of May 2008, there were more software-based UPnP AV media servers than there were hardware-based servers.

===Other components===
* UPnP MediaServer ControlPoint - which is the UPnP-client (a &#x27;slave&#x27; device) that can auto-detect UPnP-servers on the network to browse and stream media/data-files from them.
* UPnP MediaRenderer DCP - which is a &#x27;slave&#x27; device that can render (play) content.
* UPnP RenderingControl DCP - control MediaRenderer settings; volume, brightness, RGB, sharpness, and more.
* UPnP Remote User Interface (RUI) client/server - which sends/receives control-commands between the UPnP-client and UPnP-server over network, (like record, schedule, play, pause, stop, etc.).
** Web4CE (CEA 2014) for UPnP Remote UI - CEA-2014 standard designed by Consumer Electronics Association&#x27;s R7 Home Network Committee. Web-based Protocol and Framework for Remote User Interface on UPnP Networks and the Internet (Web4CE). This standard allows a UPnP-capable home network device to provide its interface (display and control options) as a web page to display on any other device connected to the home network. That means that one can control a home networking device through any web-browser-based communications method for CE devices on a UPnP home network using ethernet and a special version of HTML called CE-HTML.
* QoS (quality of service) - is an important (but not mandatory) service function for use with UPnP AV (Audio and Video). QoS (quality of service) refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program. Since UPnP AV is mostly to deliver streaming media that is often near real-time or real-time audio/video data which it is critical to be delivered within a specific time or the stream is interrupted. QoS guarantees are especially important if the network capacity is limited, for example public networks, like the internet.
** QoS for UPnP consist of Sink Device (client-side/front-end) and Source Device (server-side/back-end) service functions. With classes such as; Traffic Class that indicates the kind of traffic in the traffic stream, (for example, audio or video). Traffic Identifier (TID) which identifies data packets as belonging to a unique traffic stream. Traffic Specification (TSPEC) which contains a set of parameters that define the characteristics of the traffic stream, (for example operating requirement and scheduling). Traffic Stream (TS) which is a unidirectional flow of data that originates at a source device and terminates at one or more sink device(s).
* Remote Access - defines methods for connecting UPnP device sets that are not in the same multicast domain.

==NAT traversal==
One solution for NAT traversal, called the Internet Gateway Device Control Protocol (UPnP IGD Protocol), is implemented via UPnP. Many routers and firewalls expose themselves as Internet Gateway Devices, allowing any local UPnP control point to perform a variety of actions, including retrieving the external IP address of the device, enumerating existing port mappings, and adding or removing port mappings. By adding a port mapping, a UPnP controller behind the IGD can enable traversal of the IGD from an external address to an internal client.

There are numerous compatibility issues due the different interpretations of the very large actually backward compatible IGDv1 and IGDv2 specifications. One of them is the UPnP IGD client integrated with current Microsoft Windows and Xbox systems with certified IGDv2 routers. The compatibility issue still exist since the introduced of the IGDv1 client in Windows XP in 2001, and a IGDv2 router without a workaround that makes router port mapping impossible.

If UPnP is only used to control router port mappings and pinholes, there are alternative, newer much simpler and lightweight protocols such as the PCP and the NAT-PMP, both of which have been standardized as RFCs by the IETF. These alternatives are not yet known to have compatibility issues between different clients and servers, but adoption is still low. For consumer routers, only AVM and the open-source router software projects OpenWrt, OPNsense, and pfSense are currently known to support PCP as an alternative to UPnP. AVM&#x27;s Fritz!Box UPnP IGDv2 and PCP implementation has been very buggy since its introduction. In many cases it does not work.

==Problems==

===Authentication===
The UPnP protocol, by default, does not implement any authentication, so UPnP device implementations must implement the additional &quot;Device Protection&quot; service, or implement the &quot;Device Security Service&quot;. There also exists a non-standard solution called UPnP-UP (Universal Plug and Play - User Profile) which proposes an extension to allow user authentication and authorization mechanisms for UPnP devices and applications. Many UPnP device implementations lack authentication mechanisms, and by default assume local systems and their users are completely trustworthy.

When the authentication mechanisms are not implemented, routers and firewalls running the UPnP IGD protocol are vulnerable to attack. For example, Adobe Flash programs running outside the sandbox of the browser (e.g. this requires specific version of Adobe Flash with acknowledged security issues) are capable of generating a specific type of HTTP request which allows a router implementing the UPnP IGD protocol to be controlled by a malicious web site when someone with a UPnP-enabled router simply visits that web site. This only applies to the &quot;firewall-hole-punching&quot;-feature of UPnP; it does not apply when the router/firewall does not support UPnP IGD or has been disabled on the router. Also, not all routers can have such things as DNS server settings altered by UPnP because much of the specification (including LAN Host Configuration) is optional for UPnP enabled routers. As a result, some UPnP devices ship with UPnP turned off by default as a security measure.

===Access from the Internet===
In 2011, researcher Daniel Garcia developed a tool designed to exploit a flaw in some UPnP IGD device stacks that allow UPnP requests from the Internet. The tool was made public at DEFCON 19 and allows portmapping requests to external IP addresses from the device and internal IP addresses behind the NAT. The problem is widely propagated around the world, with scans showing millions of vulnerable devices at a time.

In January 2013, the security company Rapid7 in Boston reported on a six-month research programme. A team scanned for signals from UPnP-enabled devices announcing their availability for internet connection. Some 6900 network-aware products from 1500 companies at 81 million IP-addresses responded to their requests. 80% of the devices are home routers; others include printers, webcams and surveillance cameras. Using the UPnP-protocol, many of those devices can be accessed and/or manipulated.

In February 2013, the UPnP forum responded in a press release by recommending more recent versions of the used UPnP stacks, and by improving the certification program to include checks to avoid further such issues.

=== IGMP snooping and reliability ===
UPnP is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks; therefore, multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as UPnP issues rather than underlying network issues.

If IGMP snooping is enabled on a switch, or more commonly a wireless router/switch, it will interfere with UPnP/DLNA device discovery (SSDP) if incorrectly or incompletely configured (e.g. without an active querier or IGMP proxy), making UPnP appear unreliable.

Typical scenarios observed include a server or client (e.g. smart TV) appearing after power on, and then disappearing after a few minutes (often 30 by default configuration) due to IGMP group membership expiring.

===Callback vulnerability===
On 8 June 2020, yet another protocol design flaw was announced. Dubbed &quot;CallStranger&quot; by its discoverer, it allows an attacker to subvert the event subscription mechanism and execute a variety of attacks: amplification of requests for use in DDoS; enumeration; and data exfiltration.

OCF had published a fix to the protocol specification in April 2020, but since many devices running UPnP are not easily upgradable, CallStranger is likely to remain a threat for a long time to come. CallStranger has fueled calls for end-users to abandon UPnP because of repeated failures in security of its design and implementation.

== History ==

The UPnP protocols were promoted by the UPnP Forum (formed in October 1999), a computer industry initiative to enable simple and robust connectivity to standalone devices and personal computers from many different vendors. The Forum consisted of more than 800 vendors involved in everything from consumer electronics to network computing. Since 2016, all UPnP efforts have been managed by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF).

In the fall of 2008, the UPnP Forum ratified the successor to UPnP 1.0 Device Architecture, UPnP 1.1. The Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) standard was a candidate successor to UPnP, but UPnP 1.1 was selected by the UPnP Forum. Version 2 of IGD is standardized.

The UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD) standard has a WANIPConnection service, which provides similar functionality to IETF-standard Port Control Protocol. The NAT-PMP specification contains a list of the problems with IGDP that prompted the creation of NAT-PMP and its successor PCP.

A number of further standards have been defined for the UPnP Device Architecture:
* The Wi-Fi Alliance defines a set of &quot;WFA device&quot; () services related to the wireless access point. 
** The WFAWLANConfig service is a required part and defines ways to query the capabilities of a wireless access point and set up wireless connections. This service is used in the AP-ER and UPnP-C types of Wi-Fi Protected Setup.

<doc id="183366" wikidata="Q846755" url="?curid=183366" title="Dude Ranch (album)">
<text>Dude Ranch is the second studio album by American rock band Blink-182, released on June 17, 1997, by Cargo Music and MCA Records, making it their major record label debut. MCA signed the band in 1996 following moderate sales of their 1995 debut &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; and their growing popularity in Australia. &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was the band&#x27;s final recording released on Cargo and the last to feature the original lineup as drummer Scott Raynor was dismissed from the band in 1998.

The band recorded the album from December 1996 to January 1997 at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California with producer Mark Trombino. With lyrical material written on their nonstop tours over the previous years, as well as completed songs, the band recorded with Trombino in sessions that lasted for five weeks. During production, the members of Blink-182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule: bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, co-vocalists for the band, were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with injuries to both feet.

The album was released in the summer of 1997 and was a success, reaching number 67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top Heatseekers chart. The second single, &quot;Dammit&quot;, became a rock radio hit single and helped the band gain mainstream credibility as they toured worldwide on the Vans Warped Tour. The band toured exhaustively behind the album, creating tensions which led to the firing of Raynor in mid-1998. Three more singles were released, with &quot;Josie&quot; gathering MTV play and charting highly in Australia. &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; eventually grew in sales and was certified platinum in the US by the end of the decade.

== Background ==
The San Diego–based trio Blink-182 released their debut album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, in 1995. Released on local record label Cargo Music, the album sold well for an independent release; it had moved over 70,000 units by late 1996. Throughout 1995 and 1996, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, most notably in Australia, where audiences embraced the band&#x27;s irreverent sense of humor and stage shows. The trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; at their respective local record stores, and began searching for larger record labels with better distribution. Likewise, problems had become apparent between the trio and employees at Cargo, who largely considered the band a joke. In contrast, the group had accumulated a genuine buzz among major labels, and a bidding war for the band began in March 1996. Several labels courted the group, sending A&amp;R reps to shows and inviting the band to their offices for lunch meetings. With several labels interested, Blink-182 seriously considered Interscope, Epitaph, and MCA. The band contemplated their options: the three had no qualms signing to a major label, and were wary of purists attempting to define &quot;punk&quot;. They felt a great affinity for Epitaph, as many of their favorite acts (Pennywise, Bad Religion, NOFX) were signed to the label. Overall, Blink felt they were nothing but honest regarding their ambitions: &quot;I try and tell kids, &#x27;The Clash, Sex Pistols and the Ramones did it, so how come we can&#x27;t?&quot; guitarist Tom DeLonge reasoned. &quot;If people are bummed, we don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s normally critics. Older critics.&quot;
MCA at the time was riding out a dead spell, and was derisively referred to in the music industry as MCA—Musicians&#x27; Cemetery of America. Despite this, their executives&#x27; persistence and sincerity won the band over, as well as their promise of complete artistic freedom. The trio signed a joint venture deal with MCA to distribute their sophomore album with Cargo. Drummer Scott Raynor was happy for the band&#x27;s signing, but was uneasy with signing to a major label—he much preferred Epitaph, and when the band passed over the label, he began to feel only half-invested in the band. Raynor was not, however, difficult about the band&#x27;s mainstream growth: &quot;I didn&#x27;t measure success in terms of oppositional credibility. I loved being on the radio and MTV. We were certified products of pop culture, born and bred in suburbia.&quot; Thanks to their established fan base and merchandising, MCA did not intervene much in the band&#x27;s activities. Although the label had granted the band artistic freedom in their contract, MCA did step in and warn the band when they planned to feature a spoof of the &quot;Macarena&quot; on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, humorously titled &quot;Hey Wipe Your Anus&quot;.

To celebrate their signing, the group held a party at the Hotel del Coronado near San Diego. At the event, Raynor became inebriated and jumped off a balcony. He broke both his heels and was forced to record &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; while in a wheelchair. Soon, the band booked time at DML Studios in Escondido, California, where they worked out arrangements for the songs on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. Most of the lyrics for the album had been written over 1995 and 1996, while touring. &quot;I remember writing most of those songs in my living room, sitting on a curb, whatever,&quot; recalled DeLonge in 2001. &quot;Back then, each song was pretty much written with a specific girl or event in mind.&quot; Demos for the album were recorded with Warren Fitzgerald of the Vandals; early versions of &quot;Enthused&quot; and &quot;Lemmings&quot; were released on the &quot;Wasting Time&quot; single and the &quot;Lemmings / Going Nowhere&quot; split EP, respectively.

== Recording and production ==

The band were afforded more time to record than previous endeavors, and were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, which influenced the album. For production duties, the band worked with Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. The band were initially slated to record with another producer, but picked Trombino because of his familiarity with the studio itself, his major-label know-how, and the work he had done on Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Static Prevails&quot; (1996). The band first met Trombino through their friendship with San Diego punk band Fluf. The group spent time trying to amuse Trombino, to no avail. Hoppus&#x27; sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet during the sessions. Trombino, in a retrospective piece about the album, mentioned that he was &quot;excited, but also nervous and intimidated. I felt weird that there were these guys who had sold way more records than I had ever sold and I&#x27;m sitting in the producer&#x27;s chair telling them what to do.&quot; &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was recorded at Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996. Big Fish was a converted guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before. However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, and what was a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group. Bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time. Despite this, Trombino was impressed by their work ethic: &quot;They were the most business-centric band I&#x27;d ever seen at that point. They had their shit together.&quot;

Despite the creative boom while writing lyrics for the album, all three members of Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert. Hoppus realized the magnitude of the situation and cancelled the final week of recording in December 1996. He quit smoking in order to take care of his voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for &quot;Dammit&quot;, which was accidentally written just outside his vocal range. Meanwhile, Raynor had to record his drum tracks while still in his wheelchair, the result of injuries sustained at the signing party. He would wheelchair up to the drum set and scoot onto the drum throne and play,&quot; remembered Trombino in a later interview. &quot;I got the sense that [the band] were bummed.&quot; Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; and &quot;reading the articles from the shelves and shelves of &quot;Playboy&quot;s that the studio had thoughtfully provided.&quot; The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in &quot;Josie&quot;, and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas&#x27; Pick Up Stix.

It would be January 1997 by the time the band was able to wrap up sessions for &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to &quot;Josie&quot;, and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using a sound-effects machine he owned. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor&#x27;s drum tracks for several songs. Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and seemed excited by the material they heard. &quot;When we were in there mixing, the A&amp;R person would come by,&quot; remembered Cameron. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record.&quot; DeLonge remembered it differently: &quot;[Label executives] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever.&quot; A funny story happened upon the executives&#x27; first listen to the album, according to Hoppus:

After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2001, Hoppus recalled, &quot;I remember when we finished &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; I was so proud. That was the first time we could take the time and whatever to make a good record.&quot; In addition to the record, Trombino produced &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Home for Christmas&quot;, a Christmas song recorded during the &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; sessions.

== Music and packaging ==

According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; is an album of &quot;juvenile, adrenaline-fueled punk-pop.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Doug Reece described it as &quot;a collection of machine-gun-quick, energetic punk songs—sometimes with a puerile slant—about such topics as girlfriends, broken hearts, and fights with one&#x27;s parents.&quot; At &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, it was characterized as a &quot;killer skate-punk record&quot;. Greg Simpsons at Punknews.org too labeled it skate punk, stating that the album &quot;set [the] blueprint for their style of poppy, goofy skate punk that they would later bring to the masses.&quot; DeLonge considered the album a step up in terms of songwriting, with &quot;Dammit&quot; proving the breakthrough to him. The album&#x27;s guitar tone has been interpreted as scratchy and displaying a &quot;blown-out quality that&#x27;s in constant combat with the vastly more refined vocal hooks.&quot; DeLonge at the time was playing a &quot;sticker-heavy&quot; Stratocaster with a Seymour Duncan Invader pickup.

&quot;Pathetic&quot; has been considered a tale of &quot;abject self-pity in the face of collapsed relationship.&quot; &quot;Pathetic&quot; is also reportedly about DeLonge&#x27;s mother being disappointed about how DeLonge was doing in high school and college. The distinctive riff of &quot;Dammit&quot; was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song&#x27;s theme is maturity, exemplified by the refrain, &quot;Well, I guess this is growing up.&quot; &quot;Dick Lips&quot; was named after an insult the trio bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge&#x27;s experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. &quot;Waggy&quot; was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. &quot;Untitled&quot; has been considered a tribute to the emerging ska punk scene, and &quot;Emo&quot; by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge&#x27;s favorite band at that time, Jimmy Eat World.

&quot;Apple Shampoo&quot; was inspired by Elyse Rogers of Dance Hall Crashers, whom Hoppus dated; the title is culled from a particular brand of shampoo she often used. &quot;Josie&quot; makes further reference to Dance Hall Crashers and the band Unwritten Law (&quot;My girlfriend likes UL and DHC&quot;). &quot;A New Hope&quot; takes the standard rock subject matter of a hopeless crush and rewrites it with details of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. The original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy were popular during Hoppus&#x27; childhood into the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a theatrical re-release in the late 1990s reinvigorated interest in the series. &quot;Degenerate&quot; is a re-recording of a track that first appeared on the band&#x27;s demo cassette &quot;Demo No.2&quot;. &quot;Lemmings&quot; is another re-recorded track, which had previously only been available on a 7-inch. The band felt the song was strong enough that it should not be limited to those owning record players.

The cover design, a collage by artist Lou Beach, features a bull with the band&#x27;s name branded on its rear end, while the packaging is decorated by images of the band as cowboys on a &quot;dude ranch&quot;. The gatefold packaging features a painting stating &quot;Greetings from the Blink-182 Dude Ranch,&quot; which was intended to be a pastiche of both &quot;cheesy postcards&quot; and a parody of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.&quot;. Art direction for the album was headed by MCA in-house graphic artist Tim Stedman, with Stedman and designer Ashley Pigford crafting the visual package. The CD art, a revolver chamber, was designed by artist Victor Gastelum, while the band photography was done by Steven Shea. DeLonge recalled in 2012 that the only &quot;bad&quot; aspect of &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; in retrospect were the jokes found within the inside artwork: &quot;I remember sitting at the Sombrero taco shop going, &#x27;Fuck, we’ve got to finish off our album cover, let&#x27;s just write some jokes to these cowboy pictures.&#x27; Why did we do that? We should have had better jokes for those pictures.&quot;

== Release ==

&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was released on June 17, 1997, jointly through Cargo Music and MCA Records. It was initially set to be released in a dual deal between Cargo and MCA subsidiary Way Cool Music. The record, at first, largely passed without notice from audiences outside their established fan base. With fan support and the trio touring nonstop, the album&#x27;s sales began to improve. The momentum from touring helped &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; sell 3,000–4,000 units a week, and the record sold 40,000 copies by August 1997. &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was promoted by the label through board-sport magazines and tie-ins between surf shops and record stores. At retail, MCA and Cargo organized midnight sales promotions on the West Coast. The popularity of the trio in Australia has been cited as the sign that alerted major record companies of &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; commercial potential; at the time, the album had spent five months on the charts and the band became famous for their stage show while on the 1997 Warped Tour. Thanks to increased recognition, the band dropped Cargo and fully signed with MCA in 1998 to handle increased distribution. Punk rock purists asserted the band were betraying their indie roots by even considering major label proposals and began to address the band as &quot;sell-outs&quot;.

Sales improved dramatically when the record&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Dammit&quot;, began making rounds at rock radio. MCA&#x27;s marketing strategy involved waiting until after the band&#x27;s Warped Tour performances wrapped in order to have a retail story to back up radio promotion efforts. The label first serviced &quot;Dammit&quot; in August 1997 and several SoCal stations were quick to pick up the single, finding it to be a good match alongside Green Day and The Offspring radio hits. The song was released in September, and was added to the playlist of Los Angeles–based radio station KROQ, after which the song began to be played across the country. Mainstream rock received &quot;Dammit&quot; in November, and MTV picked up the &quot;Dammit&quot; video, bumping it into &quot;stress rotation&quot; in December. This led to feature stories in magazines such as &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Radio-wise, &quot;Dammit&quot; achieved great commercial success, peaking at number 11 on the US rock charts in 1998. The year-end &quot;Billboard&quot; Airplay Monitor Report (BDS) stats indicated that &quot;Dammit&quot; earned top spins at many key radio stations. In addition, its success knocked &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; onto the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for the first time, where it peaked at number 67 in February 1998. On January 24, 1998, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; sold more than 268,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; spent a total of 48 weeks in the top 200 in the United States.

&quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 9, 1998, yielded three more singles, which did not attract the same commercial success as &quot;Dammit&quot;. &quot;Apple Shampoo&quot; was the second single release from &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, released in October 1997. &quot;Although it didn&#x27;t have the impact of &quot;Dammit&quot;, it hardly mattered as the former was still receiving heavy play on radio and TV stations across the nation&quot;, wrote journalist Joe Shooman. &quot;Dick Lips&quot; was released in February 1998 but failed to register on charts. &quot;Josie&quot; became the record&#x27;s fourth and final single in November 1998. Its music video also received MTV airplay and the single charted at number 31 in Australia. For the single release of both &quot;Dammit&quot; and &quot;Josie&quot;, the songs were remixed and remastered by Tom Lord-Alge. The unreleased &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; cut &quot;I Won&#x27;t Be Home for Christmas&quot; was released as an international single in 2001, only successful in Canada, but charting for six non-consecutive weeks at number one. &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA on November 8, 1999. As of June 30, 2001, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; sold 1,100,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was released when the band was only achieving moderate success, and very few critical reviews of the record were published in 1997. A &quot;CMJ&quot; write-up commented, &quot;&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; has the hooks and sonic wallop to rocket Blink-182 into stadiums throughout the nation.&quot; British rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published a negative early review: the reviewer laments the disc&#x27;s &quot;little depth, passion, soul and even vaguely memorable hooks.&quot; Later reviews were subsequently more positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; regarded &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; as the moment &quot;the trio focused and refined their pop-punk sound,&quot; summarizing the record&#x27;s themes: &quot;bassist Mark Hoppus plays the straight man, singing sturdily and deadpan, while the squeakier-voiced guitarist Tom DeLonge bleats urgently about romance gone wrong.&quot; The website AbsolutePunk placed the album on their &quot;Absolute Classics&quot; list in February 2009, calling it a &quot;classic mix&quot; that was successful due to timing. In 2011, a writer for &quot;Total Guitar&quot; referred to the record as &quot;a genuine modern punk classic,&quot; while Scott Heisel of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called it a &quot;quantum leap in sonic quality and songwriting.&quot; Guitar.com writer Huw Baines writes that the band on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; &quot;[settle] into a songwriting mode that was more focused, lean and representative of what they were trying to achieve.&quot; In 2000, Gavin Edwards at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the record a &quot;vast improvement&quot; on its predecessor; in 2017, Maria Sherman for the same magazine praised &quot;the album&#x27;s disarming combo of humor and raw pop smarts&quot; and opined that &quot;the record&#x27;s juvenile overtones often conceal real poignancy.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was awarded Best Punk Album at the 1998 California Music Awards.

==Touring==
Beginning in the summer of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an extended period of touring. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with influences Pennywise, NOFX, and Social Distortion. &quot;The Warped Tour is really more of a traveling-band barbecue,&quot; commented DeLonge. &quot;You hang out with the other bands all day, you play your set, and then hang out again.&quot; In late 1997 and early 1998, the band would be on the road for nine months straight, only coming home to San Diego for days at a time before striking out on the next tour. &quot;When we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancée,&quot; recalled DeLonge. &quot;We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;ll see you in nine months.&#x27; It was really hard.&quot; In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of &quot;Dammit&quot;.

Desperate for a break, the overworked band began to argue and tensions formed. Raynor, who was at the center of this drama, had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years, and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma. The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore 98, described as &quot;a winter version of the Warped Tour.&quot; Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore&#x27;s conclusion. Shortly after the conclusion of SnoCore was a short minitour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band&#x27;s favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, California, where the band had dreamed of performing at for years.

Raynor suffered a &quot;tragic loss&quot; during the West Coast minitour and flew home, forcing the band to find a fill-in drummer: Travis Barker of the ska punk support band The Aquabats. Barker learned the drum tracks for the band&#x27;s set in only 45 minutes prior to his first show. Raynor returned for the band&#x27;s Hollywood Palladium performance, and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues, Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band&#x27;s performances. Following a largely successful Australian tour in the spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options. According to Raynor, he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab. Despite this, he felt no malice toward his former bandmates and conceded they were &quot;right&quot; to fire him.

The band would minimize the impact of the situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure. The &quot;Josie&quot; CD single, released in the US in November 1998, was the first Blink-182 release to feature Barker in any capacity (he is pictured on the back cover alongside Hoppus and DeLonge). Barker would join Blink-182 full-time in the summer of 1998 and toured with the band for the remainder of the year, playing sold-out shows across America on the PooPoo PeePee Tour.

==Legacy==
&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; was the band&#x27;s first leap into the mainstream and proved to be a pivotal moment for the trio. While subsequent albums sold more copies, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; has proved influential in other ways. Lindsay Zoladz provides context for its place in the band&#x27;s canon in a 2019 piece for The Ringer: &quot;For a lot of pop-punk fans who felt the whiplash of Blink&#x27;s sudden late-&#x27;90s transformation from Warped Tour upstarts to genuine &quot;TRL&quot; heartthrobs, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; came to develop a mythic, almost Edenic glow. It was their final punk record, the one they made before they went pop.&quot; Trevor Kelley from &quot;Alternative Press&quot; credited it with &quot;reigniting&quot; the pop punk movement while calling it a &quot;huge source of inspiration for a new generation of bands,&quot; such as Midtown and New Found Glory. The members of FIDLAR credited the album&#x27;s impact, while original Panic! at the Disco guitarist Ryan Ross has cited the album as his first influence: &quot;I wanted to learn how to play like Tom DeLonge [on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;].&quot; The musician Day Wave has said the album made the band his grade-school heroes; likewise, the Wonder Years frontman Dan Campbell wore out his copy of the album: &quot;I played &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; to death,&quot; he laughed in a 2022 interview. Some writers, like Chris Payne at &quot;Billboard&quot;, have suggested hints of the album&#x27;s impact in groups like Cloud Nothings. In a 20th anniversary piece celebrating the album, Maria Sherman, writing for MTV News, commented that on &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; the trio &quot;found a subversive way to embrace lameness as something to be commended—a language all outsiders could understand.&quot; &quot;Vice&quot; columnist Emma Garland writes: &quot;&quot;Dude Ranch&quot; remains a formative and timeless classic [...] the perfect segue from [&quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; to their 1999 effort &quot;Enema of the State&quot;], capturing Blink-182 right on the precipice of self-discovery.&quot;

At least three full-length album covers of &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; have been released. In 2019, American musician Colleen Green issued a cassette-only cover of &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; in her signature lo-fi style. Green&#x27;s cover was widely celebrated: &quot;There&#x27;s a sepia quality to Green&#x27;s covers, as if they&#x27;ve been filtered through translucent gobs of memory,&quot; wrote 
Randall Colburn for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Never Over Til It&#x27;s Done&quot;, a charity album supporting Black transgender communities, was released in 2020 and contained covers by bands like Joyce Manor, Adult Mom, and Rozwell Kid. Another &quot;concept cover album&quot; by American musician Cameron Hurley (under the name new.wav) saw release in 2023, this time in the high-energy and sonic style of the band&#x27;s later work with Barker and producer Jerry Finn. The album&#x27;s title is also the namesake for one Blink-182 cover band.

<text>Scrambling is a mountaineering term for ascending steep terrain using one&#x27;s hands to assist in holds and balance. It can be described as being between hiking and rock climbing. &quot;A scramble&quot; is a related term, denoting terrain that could be ascended in this way.

Sure-footedness and a head for heights are essential. Canyoning and stream climbing both involve scrambling.

==Overview==
Scrambling is ascending or traversing a grade without technical apparatus. Unroped ascent in exposed situations is potentially one of the most dangerous of mountaineering activities. As soon as an ascent involves a rope, going up or down, it is no longer a scramble.

== Alpine scrambling ==
Alpine scrambling is scrambling in high mountains and may not follow a defined or waymarked path. The Seattle Mountaineers climbing organization defines alpine scrambling as follows:

Alpine Scrambles are off-trail trips, often on snow or rock, with a &#x27;non-technical&#x27; summit as a destination. A non-technical summit is one that is reached without the need for certain types of climbing equipment (body harness, rope, protection hardware, etc), and not involving travel on extremely steep slopes or on glaciers. However, this can mean negotiating lower angle rock, traveling through crossing streams, fighting one&#x27;s way through dense brush, and walking on snow-covered slopes.
==Hazards and safety==

Many easy scrambles become serious climbs in bad weather. Black ice or verglas is a particular problem in cold weather, and mist or fog can disorient scramblers very quickly.

Hypothermia is a danger to all hikers, particularly the inexperienced. Any combination of cool temperatures, wind, moisture, and an absence of sunlight can create the condition.

Proper gear, clothing, supplies, and first aid materials are essential, as is in most cases a map.

==Classification systems==
By climbing grade, the U.S. generally defines scrambling as Class 2 or 3 in the Yosemite Decimal System of climbing difficulties. In the British climbing system, it is &quot;Easy&quot; with some of the harder scrambles incorporating moves of &quot;Moderate&quot; or even &quot;Difficult&quot; standard.

In Britain, scrambles are usually rated using Ashton&#x27;s system of either Grade 1, 2, 3 or 3S (S for serious), with the grade being based around technical difficulty and exposure. The North Ridge of Tryfan in Snowdonia, or Striding Edge on Helvellyn in the Lake District, are classic Grade 1 scrambles. At the other end of the scale, Broad Stand on Scafell is usually considered Grade 3 or 3S. Some of the older Scottish guidebooks used a system of grades 1 to 5, leading to considerable confusion and variation over grades 1, 2 and 3 in Scotland, however most well-known scrambles now have a standardised rating.

==By country==

===Canada===

A guide to 175 scrambling routes in the Canadian Rockies can be found in &quot;Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies&quot; by Alan Kane. &quot;Backpacker&quot; magazine has twice featured the book as an expedition guide. The &quot;Canadian Alpine Journal&quot; referred to it as a &quot;scree gospel&quot;.

===Italy===

Via ferrata is &quot;a mountain route equipped with fixed ladders, cables, and bridges in order to be accessible to climbers and walkers&quot; common in the Dolomites of Italy. This form of scrambling has climbing aids built in on the route that help make it safe. The essence of a modern via ferrata is a steel cable which runs along the route and is periodically (every ) fixed to the rock. Using a via ferrata kit, climbers can secure themselves to the cable, limiting any fall. The cable can also be used as an aid to climbing, and additional climbing aids, such as iron rungs (stemples), pegs, carved steps and even ladders and bridges are often provided. Thus, via ferratas allow otherwise dangerous routes to be undertaken without the risks associated with unprotected scrambling and climbing or the need for climbing equipment such as ropes. Such routes allow the relatively inexperienced a means of enjoying dramatic positions and accessing difficult peaks, normally the preserve of the serious mountaineer; although, as there is a need for some equipment, a good head for heights and basic technique, the via ferrata can be seen as a distinct step up from ordinary mountain walking.

===United Kingdom===
Scrambling has become an increasingly popular form of mountaineering in Britain; the English Lake District, the Scottish Highlands, and the north of Snowdonia in Wales being the chief regions of interest. Popular Scrambling guidebooks exist for these areas, outlining a wide spectrum of routes in terms of both difficulty and style. UK scrambles come in many forms: the ascents, descents and traverses of ridges, gully and ghyll scrambles, rakes (lines of weakness that penetrate large, and often sheer, rock faces), and the ascents of buttresses and faces. UK scrambles vary enormously in length; from as little height gain as 30 metres, as with many crag rock climbs, up to the 700+ metres of vertical height gain encountered on Tower Ridge, a famous 3S grade scramble that ascends Ben Nevis via its north face (Tower Ridge is also graded as a &#x27;difficult&#x27; rock climb - arguably Britain&#x27;s longest.). Scrambles in Snowdonia typically feature between 60 (e.g. Milestone Gully, Tryfan.) and 500 metres (e.g. Bryant&#x27;s Gully, Glyder Fawr) of height gain.

Ridge routes that involve some scrambling are especially popular in Britain, including Crib Goch on Snowdon, Bristly Ridge on Glyder Fach, Striding Edge on Helvellyn, and Sharp Edge on Blencathra, both in the English Lake District, as well as numerous routes in Scotland, such as the Aonach Eagach ridge in Glencoe. Many of these routes include a &quot;bad step&quot;, where the scrambling suddenly becomes much more serious. The bad step on Crib Goch for example, involves only or so of climbing, but the position is exposed. The rock face here is well polished by countless boots, but there are many holds which offer firm support. By contrast, the traverse of the Cuillin Ridge on Skye demands use of a rope at one point at least. The ridge routes of Liathach and Beinn Eighe in Wester Ross are easier to traverse but are extremely exposed. Descent from such ridges is very limited, so once committed, the scrambler must continue to the end. An Teallach to the north offers scrambling, as does Stac Pollaidh further north in Sutherland, which includes a bad step.

One resource for scramblers in Britain are the guides by W A Poucher (1891–1988), though these are now dated and more recent guide books exist.

A community project consisting of a comprehensive list of scrambles in the United Kingdom is available at UKscrambles.com.

===Poland and Slovakia===

Scrambling has grown ever so popular in recent years with more experienced mountain hikers in Tatras, the highest mountain range within the 1500 km-long chain of Carpathians, located on the border between Poland and Slovakia. A hiker who has scaled all possible marked tourist trails will in time typically start looking for more ambitious goals, namely those peaks that by law are only accessible via hiring a licensed mountain guide (for a fee). More adventurous individuals, however, or those on a tight budget (often college/university students) endeavour to climb those harder accessible summits without assistance, especially since very accurate descriptions of (typically &quot;normal&quot;, i.e. the easiest) routes are readily available on the Internet. Apart from dedicated websites, guidebooks for rock climbers by or (Poland) and (Slovakia) are particularly popular. There is an informal peak bagging challenge called / Velka Korona Tatier (or Great Crown of Tatras), involving climbing Tatras&#x27; all fourteen 8-thousanders (in feet), only 3 of which are accessible by marked hiking trails. Typically, they are graded at most I or II in Tatra climbing difficulty scale (equivalent to British Grade 3/3s).

<text>A home cinema, also called a home theater or theater room, is a home entertainment audio-visual system that seeks to reproduce a movie theater experience and mood using consumer electronics-grade video and audio equipment and is set up in a room or backyard of a private home. Some studies show that films are rated better and generate more intense emotions when watched in a movie theater, but convenience is a major appeal for home cinemas. In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a LaserDisc Player or VCR; and a heavy, bulky large-screen cathode-ray tube TV set, although sometimes CRT projectors were used instead. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment, TV screens and video projectors have changed the equipment used in home cinema set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive Blu-ray players in the 2020s can also &quot;stream&quot; movies and TV shows over the Internet using subscription services such as Netflix). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2020s-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a video rental store as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favorite content).

In the 2020s, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a video projector or a large flat-screen high-resolution HDTV system, a movie or other video content on a DVD or high-resolution Blu-ray disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel power amplifier and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for stereo sound) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more surround sound speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency subwoofer speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.

==Introduction==
Introduced in 1912, the Edison Home Projecting Kinetoscope was one of the first home theater devices. Although it used a 22 mm film format, the image size was nearer to 6 mm, the smallest ever to be commercially released. The film was perforated not only on the edges, but also in two interior rows, dividing each frame into three separate images. The film was run through once for the first set of outside images; the gate was shifted over and the film run backwards for the interior row of images; then the gate was shifted once more to project the other outside row. The value was that an entire motion picture could be projected from one reel of film. However, its high cost - $175 on introduction - its distribution through Edison phonograph dealers who resented having to sell it, the difficulty of working the machine properly, and the graininess of the early safety film stock (made even more visible when projecting the 6mm image) made it a commercial failure. Production stopped after the disastrous fire at Edison&#x27;s West Orange, New Jersey factory complex in December 1914. 
Home theater systems were made in the 1920s with 16 mm projectors. Technological improvements led to 8 mm and sound 16 mm in the 1930s. In the 1950s, playing home movies became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as Kodak 8 mm film projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later LaserDisc in the 1980s created a new paradigm for home video, as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a LaserDisc or VHS player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large rear-projection television set, with the audio output through a stereo system. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1980s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the DVD-Video format (higher resolution than VHS), Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio (surround sound) speaker systems, and high-definition television (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy cathode-ray tube HDTVs and flat-screen TVs. In the 2010s, affordable large HDTV flatscreen TVs, high resolution video projectors (e.g., DLP), 3D television technology and the high resolution Blu-ray (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.

===Recent developments===
In the 2010s, the term &quot;home cinema&quot; encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a DVD player, a standard-definition (SD) large-screen television with at least a 27-inch (69 cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive home theater in a box surround sound amplifier and speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, home theater PC (HTPC) computer or digital media receiver streaming devices with a 10-foot user interface, a high-definition video projector and projection screen with over diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofers. 3D-TV-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and Blu-ray 3D players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.

Home cinema designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space that is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality video projector CRT (no new models sold in U.S.), LCD, digital light processing (DLP), plasma display, organic light-emitting diode (OLED), Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD), Laser TV, rear-projection TV, video projector, Standard-definition television (SDTV), HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69 cm) measured diagonally, an AV receiver or pre-amplifier (surround processor) and amplifier combination capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and DTS audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI VCR, LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, cable or satellite receiver, video game console, etc. Finally, a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.

The most expensive home cinema set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 US, and which are in the homes of executives, celebrities and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital projectors and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms that include cinema-style chairs and audiophile-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial cinema performance.

==Design==

In the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the &quot;cinema experience&quot;. To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home cinema includes the following components:
#Movie or other viewing content: As the name implies, one of the key reasons for setting up a home cinema is to watch movies on a large screen, which does a more effective job at reproducing filmed images of vast landscapes or epic battle sequences. As of 2016, home cinema enthusiasts using &quot;smart&quot; Blu-ray players may also watch DVDs of TV shows, and recorded or live sports events or music concerts. As well, with a smart player, a user may be able to stream movies, TV shows and other content over the Internet. Many 2016-era DVD players and Blu-ray players also have inputs that allow users to view digital photos and other content on the big screen.
#Video and audio input devices: One or more video/audio sources. High-resolution movie media formats such as Blu-ray discs are normally preferred, though DVD or video game console systems are also used. Some home theaters include a HTPC (Home Theater PC) with a media center software application to act as the main library for video and music content using a 10-foot user interface and remote control. In 2016, some of the more expensive Blu-ray players can stream movies and TV shows over the Internet.
#Audio and video processing devices: Input signals are processed by either a standalone AV receiver or a preamplifier and Sound Processor for complex surround sound formats such as Dolby Pro-Logic/and or Pro-logic II, X, and Z, Dolby Digital, DTS, Dolby Digital EX, DTS-ES, Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby Atmos and . The user selects the input (e.g., DVD, Blu-ray player, streaming video, etc.) at this point before it is forwarded to the output stage. Some AV receivers enable the viewer to use a remote control to select which input device or source to use.
#Audio output: Systems consist of preamplifiers, power amplifiers (both of which may be integrated into a single AV receiver) and two or more loudspeakers mounted in speaker enclosures. The audio system requires at least a stereo power amplifier and two speakers, for stereo sound; most systems have multi-channel surround sound power amplifier and six or more speakers (a 5.1 surround sound system has left and right front speakers, a centre speaker, left and right rear speakers and a low-frequency subwoofer speaker enclosure). Some users have 7.1 Surround Sound. It is possible to have up to 11 speakers with additional subwoofers.
#Video output: A large-screen display, typically an HDTV. Some users may have a 3D TV. As of 2015, flatscreen HDTVs are the norm. Options include Liquid crystal display television (LCD), plasma TV, and OLED. Home cinema users may also use a video projector and a movie screen. If a projector is used, a portable, temporary screen may be used,a screen may be permanently mounted or the image may be projected directly on a wall.
#Seating and atmosphere: Comfortable seating is often provided to improve the cinema feel. Some luxury home cinemas have movie theater-style padded chairs for guests. Higher-end home theaters commonly also have sound insulation to prevent noise from escaping the room and specialized wall treatment to balance the sound within the room. Wall color can be optimized.

==Component systems vs. theater-in-a-box==
Home cinemas can either be set up by purchasing individual components one by one (e.g., buying a multichannel amp from one manufacturer, a Blu-ray player from another manufacturer, speakers from another company, etc.) or a by purchasing a HTIB (Home Theater in a Box) package which includes all components from a single manufacturer, with the exception of a TV or projector. HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote. The benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room, or the consumer&#x27;s needs.

However, to buy individual components, a consumer must have knowledge of sound system and video system design and electronics and they must do research on the specifications of each component. For instance, some speakers perform better in smaller rooms while others perform better in larger rooms and seating location must be considered. One of the challenges with buying all the components separately is that the purchaser must understand speaker impedance, power handling, and HDMI compatibility and cabling. Given these challenges, HTIB systems are a simpler and more cost-effective solution for many families and consumers; they are also better suited to smaller living spaces in semi-detached homes or apartments/condos where noise could be an issue. Buying an HTIB package is often less expensive than buying separate components.

==Dedicated rooms==

Some home cinema enthusiasts build a dedicated room in their home for the theater. These more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements, including &quot;room-in-a-room&quot; construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen, often using a high-definition projector. These installations are often designated as &quot;screening rooms&quot; to differentiate them from simpler, less-expensive installations. In some movie enthusiast&#x27;s home cinemas, this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema, with a projector enclosed in its own projection booth, specialized furniture, curtains in front of the projection screen, movie posters, or a popcorn or vending machine with snack food and candy. More commonly, real dedicated home theaters pursue this to a lesser degree.

As of 2016, the days of the $100,000 and over home cinema system are being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies, which has spurred a rapid drop in prices, making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before. This in turn has brought the true digital home theater experience to the doorsteps of the do-it-yourselfers, often for much less than the price of a low-budget economy car. As of 2016, consumer-grade A/V equipment can meet some of the standards of a small modern commercial cinema (e.g., THX sound).

===Seating===
Home cinema seating consists of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies in a home cinema. Some home cinema seats have a cup holder built into the chairs&#x27; armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has cinema-style chairs like those seen in a cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, tactile transducers for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home cinema seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.

==Backyard cinema==
In homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home cinema in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and a couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and pool parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with inflatable movie screens and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile drive-in theaters that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other car radios.

==History==

===1920s–1940s===
In the 1920s the first home cinemas were made using silent 16mm film projectors such as Kodascope and Filmo. Later, in the 1930s, 8mm and sound 16mm were introduced. These were rare luxuries.

===1950s–1970s===
In the 1950s, home movies became more popular in the United States and elsewhere as Kodak 8 mm film (Pathé 9.5 mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable movie projector onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show home movies of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or private stag films. Dedicated home cinemas were called &quot;screening rooms&quot; at the time and were outfitted with 16 mm or even 35 mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.

Portable home cinemas improved over time with colour film, Kodak Super 8 mm film cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of home video in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8 mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.

===1980s===
The development of multi-channel audio systems and LaserDisc in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room that incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified Sony Trinitron televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would look and sound like.

Over the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first home-like experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.

===1990s===
In the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc player or VHS VCR fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of DVD-Video, Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.

===2000s===

In the 2000s, developments such as high-definition video, Blu-ray disc (as well as the now-obsolete HD DVD format, which lost the format war to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a more-affordable price. Newer lossless audio from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD High-Resolution Audio and DTS-HD Master Audio and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.2, and 22.2) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.

===2010s===

By the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix, Hulu and YouTube were offering a range of high-definition content, including some 4K content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first 4K Blu-ray discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless surround sound encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High-definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.

As a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80&quot;) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups. Technologies such as local dimming and the like improved the black levels of LCD screens making them more suitable for use in a dark room. Consumer-grade OLED TVs measuring 55&quot; and above began to emerge in the second half of the decade. These had even better black levels.

===2020s===
As of 2020, video projectors remained the only viable option when screen sizes much over are needed.

==Entertainment equipment standards==
Noise Criteria (NC) are noise-level guidelines applicable to cinema and home cinema. For this application, it is a measure of a room&#x27;s ambient noise level at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be THX certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the dynamic range of the system. Some NC levels are:

*NC 40: Significant but not a dooming level of ambient noise; the highest &quot;acceptable&quot; ambient noise level. 40 decibels is the lower sound pressure level of normal talking; 60 being the highest.
*NC 30: A good NC level; necessary for THX certification in cinemas.
*NC 20: An excellent NC level; difficult to attain in large rooms and sought after for dedicated home cinema systems. For example, for a home cinema to be THX certified, it has to have a rating of NC 22.
*NC 10: Virtually impossible noise criteria to attain; 10 decibels is associated with the sound level of calm breathing.

Projectors used for home cinemas have a set of recommended criteria:

*Brightness, usually at least 1800 lumens.
*Resolution (the number of pixels making up the image), usually at least 1920×1080, one of the HDTV standards.
*Contrast (how well white, black and greyscales are displayed), usually a minimum of 5000:1.
*HDMI connection sockets (although some people use older component video, connections with three-cord sockets for the different individual colours)
*Good quality manufacturers, although this is a subjective element that depends upon user tastes and budget. For one user with a modest budget, &quot;good quality&quot; may mean a mainstream consumer electronics brand; for a well-to-do user, a Christie projector may be their interpretation of &quot;good quality&quot; (Christie units are widely used in professional, commercial theatres)

<text>Hamilton Hume (19 June 1797 – 19 April 1873) was an early explorer of the present-day Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria. In 1824, along with William Hovell, Hume participated in an expedition that first took an overland route from Sydney to Port Phillip (near the site of present-day Melbourne). Along with Sturt in 1828, he was part of an expedition of the first Europeans to find the Darling River.

==Background==
Hume was born on 19 June 1797 in Seven Hills, near Parramatta, a settlement close to (and now part of Greater) Sydney. He was the eldest son of Andrew Hamilton Hume and his wife Elizabeth, &quot;née&quot; Kennedy. Andrew Hume got the appointment of Commissary-General for New South Wales, and came out to the colony in 1797. Hamilton Hume received most of his education from his mother.

==Exploratory career==
===Early exploration===
When Hume was only 17 years of age, he began exploring the country beyond Sydney with his younger brother John and an Aboriginal boy as far to the south-west as Berrima, and soon developed into a good bushman. In 1817, Hume went on a journey with James Meehan, the deputy surveyor-general, and Charles Throsby during which Lake Bathurst and the Goulburn Plains were sighted. Subsequently, in 1818, he went with John Oxley and Meehan to Jervis Bay.

In 1822, he journeyed with Alexander Berry down the south coast of New South Wales. He travelled as far south as the Clyde River, and inland nearly as far as Braidwood. Berry came to settle in the Shoalhaven, and in June 1822 he left Hume and a party of convicts to cut a 209-yard canal between the Shoalhaven River and the Crookhaven River to allow passage of boats into the Shoalhaven. This canal was Australia&#x27;s first navigable canal, and the work was completed in 12 days. The canal today forms the main water flow of the Shoalhaven River.

===Hume and Hovell expedition===

In 1824, Hume was seen by Governor Brisbane with reference to an expedition to Spencer Gulf. Brisbane was also in touch about this time with William Hovell on the same subject, but it is not quite clear which of the men was the first to be approached. In any event, the hoped-for government funding of the expedition was not forthcoming, so that eventually the two men decided to make the journey at their own expense, except for some packsaddles, arms, clothes and blankets, which were provided from government stores.

Hume, in a letter dated 24 January 1825, (immediately after the return of the explorers), practically claimed to have been the leader of the party. He refers to &quot;the expedition your Excellency was pleased to entrust to my care&quot;. But Brisbane did not accept this view of it, as in a letter to the secretary, Wilmot Horton, dated 24 March 1825 he mentions the &quot;discovery of new and valuable country . . . by two young men Messrs Hovell and Hume . . . they were directed by me to try and reach Spencer&#x27;s Gulf&quot;. It may also be pointed out that in the letter to Brisbane of 28 July 1824, Hovell signed first. These facts are of interest in view of the controversy which broke out many years later.

Each of the explorers brought three assigned servants with him and between them they had five bullocks, three horses and two carts. Much of the journey was through difficult mountain country, and the party had to cross the major Murrumbidgee River, Murray River, Mitta Mitta River, Ovens River, and Goulburn River. Hovell had named the Murray River after Hume during the trip but Charles Sturt altered it to its current name in 1830.

Four days after crossing the Goulburn impassable country was reached. The party spent three days attempting to cross the Great Dividing Range at Mt Disappointment but were thwarted. Hume shifted direction to the West then reached lower land at the future township of Broadford on the 12 December where they camped.
Hume headed towards low ranges to the South and found a pass in that direction next day. He led the party across the Dividing Range at Hume’s Pass, Wandong and on the 16th December, 1824 reached Port Phillip Bay at Bird Rock, Point Lillias adjacent to the future Geelong.
Hovell claimed that he measured their longitude on the same day but in reality he read it off the sketch map that he and Hume had drafted themselves during the trip.
Hovell admitted in 1867 that he did not take any longitude measurements and blamed Hume for it.
Prior to this admission, Dr William Bland, who wrote the first book on the journey in 1831, invented the myth that Hovell made an error of one degree in longitude in order to protect him.

The party turned back towards New South Wales on the 18 December. Hume chose to travel more to the west to avoid the mountainous country and save considerable time. On 16 January 1825, just as their flour ran out, they reached the carts they had left behind them, and then two days later the safety of Hume&#x27;s station at Gunning.

Hume and Hovell each received grants of of land, an inadequate reward for discoveries of great importance made by an expedition which, practically speaking, paid its own expenses. This expedition was the first to discover an overland route from southern New South Wales to Port Phillip, on whose shores Melbourne now stands.

=== Blue Mountains and Lithgow Valley ===
In 1827, accompanied by Lieutenant George M. C. Bowen, then an assistant surveyor, Hume explored the western part of the Blue Mountains—around the landform that he named the Darling Causeway, after Governor Ralph Darling—and found three passes through the western escarpment that would have avoided the steep Mt York route. During this period, he named the Lithgow Valley, after William Lithgow, who, at the time, was the Auditor-General of New South Wales.

===Exploration of the Darling River===

In November 1828, Hume journeyed with Charles Sturt into western New South Wales, where they found the Darling River, the Murray River&#x27;s longest tributary. Hume was able to communicate with some Aboriginals they met early in their journey who consented to act as guides, and later, when the Aboriginals left them, Sturt speaks with appreciation of Hume&#x27;s ability in tracking their animals which had strayed. Being a drought year, it was a constant struggle to find water, and only good bushmanship saved the party. Sturt would have liked Hume to go with him on his second expedition, which started at the end of 1829, but he had a harvest to get in and was unable to make arrangements. Hume had finished his work as an explorer, and spent his remaining days as a successful pastoralist.

==Later life==

Hume married Elizabeth Dight on 8 November 1825 at St Philip&#x27;s Church in Sydney. She survived him but had no children.

Hume served as a magistrate in Yass until his death at his residence, Cooma Cottage in Yass on 19 April 1873. A double seater buggy once owned by Hume and used by him in Yass is in the National Museum of Australia collection in Canberra.

==Honours==

Hume is commemorated by the Hume Highway, the principal road between Sydney and Melbourne. Hume and Hovell were also commemorated by having their portraits printed on the Australian one-pound banknote between 1953 and 1966. Hume Dam and the impounded reservoir, Lake Hume, were named in his honour in 1996. The Canberra suburb of Hume was named after him, as was the federal electoral Division of Hume. The City of Hume, an outer metropolitan council in Melbourne formed in 1994, is named in his honour.

In 1976 a postage stamp bearing the portraits of Hume and Hovell was issued by Australia Post. The Hume and Hovell Track, a trail between Yass and Albury, also bears their joint names.

<doc id="183373" wikidata="Q1140520" url="?curid=183373" title="Critical chain project management">
<text>Critical chain project management (CCPM) is a method of planning and managing projects that emphasizes the resources (people, equipment, physical space) required to execute project tasks. It was developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. It differs from more traditional methods that derive from critical path and PERT algorithms, which emphasize task order and rigid scheduling. A critical chain project network strives to keep resources levelled, and requires that they be flexible in start times.

== Origins ==
Critical chain project management is based on methods and algorithms derived from Theory of Constraints. The idea of CCPM was introduced in 1997 in Eliyahu M. Goldratt&#x27;s book, &quot;Critical Chain&quot;. The application of CCPM has been credited with achieving projects 10% to 50% faster and/or cheaper than the traditional methods (i.e., CPM, PERT, Gantt, etc.) developed from 1910 to 1950s.

According to studies of traditional project management methods by Standish Group and others as of 1998, only 44% of projects typically finish on time. Projects typically complete at 222% of the duration originally planned, 189% of the original budgeted cost, 70% of projects fall short of their planned scope (technical content delivered), and 30% are cancelled before completion. CCPM tries to improve performance relative to these traditional statistics.

== Details ==
With traditional project management methods, 30% of lost time and resources are typically consumed by wasteful techniques such as bad multitasking (in particular task switching), student syndrome, Parkinson&#x27;s law, in-box delays, and lack of prioritization.

In a project plan, the critical chain is the sequence of both precedence- and resource-dependent tasks that prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time, given finite resources. If resources are always available in unlimited quantities, then a project&#x27;s critical chain is identical to its critical path method.

Critical chain is an alternative to critical path analysis. Main features that distinguish critical chain from critical path are: 
# &quot;Use of (often implicit) resource dependencies&quot;. Implicit means that they are not included in the project network, but must be identified by looking at the resource requirements.
# &quot;Lack of search for an optimum solution&quot;—a &quot;good enough&quot; solution is enough because:
## As far as is known, there is no analytical method for finding an absolute optimum (i.e., having the overall shortest critical chain).
## The inherent uncertainty in estimates is much greater than the difference between the optimum and near-optimum (&quot;good enough&quot; solutions).
# &quot;Identification and insertion of buffers&quot;:
#* Project buffer
#* Feeding buffers
#* Resource buffers (companies are usually reluctant to give more resources)
# Monitoring project progress and health by monitoring the consumption rate of the buffers rather than individual task performance to schedule.

CCPM planning aggregates the large amounts of safety time added to tasks within a project into the buffers—to protect the due-date performance and avoid wasting this safety time through bad multitasking, student syndrome, Parkinson&#x27;s Law, and poorly synchronized integration.

Critical chain project management uses buffer management instead of earned value management to assess the performance of a project. Some project managers feel that the earned value management technique is misleading, because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint (i.e., on the critical chain) from progress on non-constraints (&quot;i.e., on other paths). Event chain methodology can determine the size of the project, feeding, and resource buffers.&quot;

=== Planning ===
A project plan or work breakdown structure (WBS) is created in much the same fashion as with critical path. The plan is worked backward from a completion date with each task starting as late as possible.

A duration is assigned to each task. Some software implementations add a second duration: one a &quot;best guess,&quot; or 50% probability duration, and a second &quot;safe&quot; duration, which should have higher probability of completion (perhaps 90% or 95%, depending on the amount of risk that the organization can accept). Other software implementations go through the duration estimate of every task and remove a fixed percentage to be aggregated into the buffers.

Resources are assigned to each task, and the plan is resource leveled, using the aggressive durations. The longest sequence of resource-leveled tasks that lead from beginning to end of the project is then identified as the critical chain. The justification for using the 50% estimates is that half of the tasks will finish early and half will finish late, so that the variance over the course of the project should be zero.

Recognizing that tasks are more likely to take more time than less time due to Parkinson&#x27;s law, Student syndrome, or other reasons, CCPM uses &quot;buffers&quot; to monitor project schedule and financial performance. The &quot;extra&quot; duration of each task on the critical chain—the difference between the &quot;safe&quot; durations and the 50% durations—is gathered in a buffer at the end of the project. In the same way, buffers are gathered at the end of each sequence of tasks that feed into the critical chain. The date at the end of the project buffer is given to external stakeholders as the delivery date. Finally, a baseline is established, which enables financial monitoring of the project.

An alternate duration-estimation methodology uses probability-based quantification of duration using Monte Carlo simulation. In 1999, a researcher applied simulation to assess the impact of risks associated with each component of project work breakdown structure on project duration, cost and performance. Using Monte Carlo simulation, the project manager can apply different probabilities for various risk factors that affect a project component. The probability of occurrence can vary from 0% to 100% chance of occurrence. The impact of risk is entered into the simulation model along with the probability of occurrence. The number of iterations of Monte Carlo simulation depend on the tolerance level of error and provide a density graph illustrating the overall probability of risk impact on project outcome.

=== Execution ===

When the plan is complete and the project is ready to start, the project network is fixed and the buffers&#x27; sizes are &quot;locked&quot; (i.e., their planned duration may not be altered during the project), because they are used to monitor project schedule and financial performance.

With no slack in the duration of individual tasks, resources are encouraged to focus on the task at hand to complete it and hand it off to the next person or group. The objective here is to eliminate bad multitasking. This is done by providing priority information to all resources. The literature draws an analogy with a relay race. Each element on the project is encouraged to move as quickly as they can: when they are running their &quot;leg&quot; of the project, they should be focused on completing the assigned task as quickly as possible, with minimization of distractions and multitasking. In some case studies, actual batons are reportedly hung by the desks of people when they are working on critical chain tasks so that others know not to interrupt. The goal, here, is to overcome the tendency to delay work or to do extra work when there seems to be time. The CCPM literature contrasts this with &quot;traditional&quot; project management that monitors task start and completion dates. CCPM encourages people to move as quickly as possible, regardless of dates.

Because task duration has been planned at the 50% probability duration, there is pressure on resources to complete critical chain tasks as quickly as possible, overcoming student&#x27;s syndrome and Parkinson&#x27;s Law.

=== Monitoring ===

According to proponents, monitoring is, in some ways, the greatest advantage of the Critical Chain method. Because individual tasks vary in duration from the 50% estimate, there is no point in trying to force every task to complete &quot;on time;&quot; estimates can never be perfect. Instead, we monitor the buffers created during the planning stage. A fever chart or similar graph can be created and posted to show the consumption of buffer as a function of project completion. If the rate of buffer consumption is low, the project is on target. If the rate of consumption is such that there is likely to be little or no buffer at the end of the project, then corrective actions or recovery plans must be developed to recover the loss. When the buffer consumption rate exceeds some critical value (roughly: the rate where all of the buffer may be expected to be consumed &quot;before&quot; the end of the project, resulting in late completion), then those alternative plans need to be implemented.

Critical sequence was originally identified in the 1960s.

<doc id="183376" wikidata="Q333056" url="?curid=183376" title="George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen">
<text>George Islay MacNeill Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen (born 12 April 1946) is a British politician who served as the 10th Secretary General of NATO from 1999 to 2003. A member of the Labour Party, he previously served as Secretary of State for Defence from 1997 to 1999 and Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland from 1993 to 1997. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hamilton South (formerly Hamilton) from 1978 to 1999 and was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer in 2000.

==Early life==
Born in Port Ellen, Isle of Islay, Scotland, the son of George Philip Robertson (1916–2002), a policeman, and Marion Isabella Robertson &quot;née&quot; MacNeill (1913–1996). His mother taught French and German. His maternal grandfather Malcolm McNeill was the police sergeant at Bowmore during World War One, and wrote about the kindness of local people in shipwreck tragedies of &quot;SS Tuscania&quot; and &quot;HMS Otranto&quot;. Robertson was educated at Dunoon Grammar School and studied economics at Queen&#x27;s College, Dundee. When he was 15 years of age, he was involved with protests against US nuclear submarines docking in Scotland.

During Robertson&#x27;s time at Queen&#x27;s College it broke away from the University of St Andrews to become the University of Dundee, of which Robertson was one of the first graduates (MA, 1968), and one of a minority of graduates that year who opted to take a Dundee, rather than a St Andrews, degree. During his time at University he played a full part in student life. He wrote a column for the student newspaper &quot;Annasach&quot;, launched in 1967, and took an active role in student protests. Robertson used his newspaper column to back the new University and encouraged his fellow students to take a University of Dundee degree (students who had started before 1967 could opt to take a degree from either the University of Dundee or the University of St Andrews). Robertson is now the Chancellor of the University of Dundee.

In 1968, Robertson was one of a number of Dundee students to invade the pitch during a rugby match at St Andrews involving a team from the Orange Free State to protest against apartheid. The same year he organised a 24-hour work-in by students in the university library in opposition to proposed cuts by the government in student grants.

==Personal life==
Robertson married Sandra Wallace on 1 June 1970. They have two sons and a daughter. Robertson supports Hamilton Academical football club.

==Traffic collision==

Robertson survived a serious car crash on 19 January 1976 when a Navy Land Rover, which was carrying of gelignite and a box of detonators, hit his car head-on in the Drumochter Pass, one mile south of Dalwhinnie leaving him with two injured knees and a broken jaw. In May 1976 the driver of the Land Rover was found guilty of careless driving. Robertson was wearing a seat belt at the time and attributed his survival to this.

==Political career==
Robertson entered the House of Commons as a Labour MP in 1978, having won the Hamilton by-election in May of that year, caused by the death of the incumbent Labour MP Alex Wilson that March. Margo MacDonald of the SNP came second. Robertson retained the constituency with an increased majority and obtained 51% of the overall vote. He was re-elected to Parliament at five subsequent general elections, was Chairman of the Labour Party in Scotland, and was appointed to the Privy Council.
After Labour won the 1997 general election, Robertson was appointed Secretary of State for Defence. He initiated the Strategic Defence Review, which was completed in 1998, presenting a coherent political and strategic narrative themed as &#x27;a force for good&#x27;. The review created the Joint Rapid Reaction Force and inaugurated the ambitious project to build two new large aircraft carriers for force projection, the Queen Elizabeth-class, and its new warplanes, symbolising the new government&#x27;s commitment to defence. However the new Labour government had come to power promising to follow the previous Conservative government&#x27;s spending plans for its first two years, and this required a defence budget cut of £2 billion. Though the defence budget was subsequently expanded, it was not sufficient for the increased ambitions of the review. Tom Bower, in his book on that government, argued that &quot;Robertson had created an unaffordable dream in 1998.&quot;

In 1999, Robertson was appointed Secretary General of NATO after the German defence minister Rudolf Scharping declined to the position, and doubts were raised about the suitability of the British politician and former Royal Marine Paddy Ashdown (at that time the outgoing leader of the Liberal Democrats) due to his never having held a position in government.
Robertson was the Secretary General of NATO at the time of the United States invasion of Afghanistan. In October 2001, NATO invoked Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty for the first time in its history.

In December 2002, before the US-led invasion of Iraq, Robertson declared that NATO had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to support the United States if it attacked Iraq.

In September 2022, during the 7th month of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, interviewed by Channel 4 about his nine meetings with Vladimir Putin, Robertson said, &quot;At the first meeting (in Moscow, Oct 2001) Vladimir Putin clearly said, &#x27;I WANT RUSSIA TO BE PART OF WESTERN EUROPE...at the 2nd meeting (in Brussels) he said..&#x27;WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE RUSSIA TO JOIN NATO?&#x27;...I started to sort of reach out and engage them in so many activities that they basically couldn&#x27;t fight with us.. but after I left NATO (in Dec 2003), the American administration, the Bush administration (during their own illegal war on Iraq opposed by Putin), lost any interest basically in doing business with Russia, they saw it as a threat..they didn&#x27;t really want to make it part of the overall partnership. I think we missed an opportunity at that time because I think it&#x27;s what he (Putin) wanted, and we could have grabbed hold of him!&quot; 
===Quote on devolution===
In 1995, Robertson, while he was Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland said, &quot;Devolution will kill Nationalism stone dead&quot;. This quote was designed to assuage hopes that devolution would provide a greater platform for the Scottish National Party (SNP). Robertson&#x27;s quote is frequently recalled, usually in a mocking fashion, since the SNP won Scottish Parliament elections in 2007, 2011, 2016 and 2021.

===Dunblane libel action===
Robertson&#x27;s three children are former pupils of the school in Dunblane where gunman Thomas Hamilton murdered 16 children and their teacher in 1996. After the massacre, Robertson, a long-time resident of the town, acted as a spokesman for the victims&#x27; families. He was also a key figure in the subsequent campaign that led to the ban on handguns in Great Britain.

In 2003, the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; newspaper ran an article entitled &quot;Should the Dunblane dossier be kept secret?&quot;, a reference to documents relating to the Cullen Inquiry into the massacre which are to remain classified for 100 years. In a discussion board on the newspaper&#x27;s website, anonymous contributors claimed that Robertson had signed a recommendation for a gun licence for Thomas Hamilton in his capacity as Hamilton&#x27;s MP. However, Robertson had never been the gunman&#x27;s MP, and the claims were unfounded. Robertson sued the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and the paper settled by paying him a five-figure sum plus costs. A subsequent action by Robertson, related to the terms of the newspaper&#x27;s apology, was unsuccessful. The first case became an important test case as to whether publishers can be held responsible for comments posted on their websites.

===Independence referendum interventions===
Robertson opposed Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, he wrote: &quot;The residual United Kingdom would still be a major player in the world, but upon losing a third of its land mass, 5 million of its population and a huge amount of credibility, its global standing would inevitably diminish.&quot;

He said in a speech to the Brookings Institution on 8 April 2014: &quot;The loudest cheers for the break-up of Britain would be from our adversaries and from our enemies. For the second military power in the west to shatter this year would be cataclysmic in geo-political terms.&quot; Robertson also likened the efforts of Unionists to keep Scotland tied to the UK with those of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s fight against slavery when he stated, &quot;they might look more relevantly at the Civil War where hundreds of thousands of Americans perished in a war to keep the new Union together. To Lincoln and his compatriots the Union was so precious, so important, and its integrity so valuable that rivers of blood would be spilt to keep it together.&quot;

==After NATO==
Robertson has received numerous honours (including a total of 12 Honorary doctorates from various universities).

In addition, he is a Senior Counsellor at The Cohen Group, a consulting firm in Washington D.C. that provides advice and assistance in marketing and regulatory affairs.

In August 2021, he criticised the withdrawal of NATO troops from Afghanistan, saying that &quot;We never really took Afghanistan and the conflict there with the seriousness that it demanded.&quot;

On 16 July 2024, the newly elected Labour government of Keir Starmer announced the commencement of a defence review, to be led by Robertson.

<text>The Urethra Chronicles is a 1999 documentary film about the American pop punk band Blink-182. The film, directed by former manager Rick DeVoe, is a behind-the-scenes look at the band&#x27;s history featuring their usual toilet humor. The documentary includes exclusive live performance footage and music videos.

The film was released on November 30, 1999 on VHS and May 2, 2000 for DVD. A sequel, &quot;The Urethra Chronicles II: Harder Faster Faster Harder&quot;, was released in 2002.

==Background==
The film explores the lives of Blink-182 members Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, and Travis Barker. The film features footage shot over many years: for example, stunts shot by Hoppus and DeLonge during the recording of sophomore effort &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; in 1996 open up the film. The film was completed in fall of 1999, shortly before Blink-182 set off on tour with Silverchair. The original title of the documentary was &quot;The Diary of the Butt&quot;. Hoppus, in a 1999 interview with the MTV Radio Network, described the production as &quot;...a look back, and also a look ahead.&quot;

==Contents==
The DVD includes all of the official music videos of the singles from the &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and &quot;Enema of the State&quot; albums.

#&quot;Dammit&quot; (Directed by Darren Doane)

<doc id="183387" wikidata="Q4271" url="?curid=183387" title="Mark Hoppus">
<text>Mark Allan Hoppus (born March 15, 1972) is an American musician and record producer. He is the co-lead vocalist, co-founder, and bassist for the rock band Blink-182 and the only member to appear on every album.

Hoppus became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of 15. After he moved to San Diego in 1992 to attend California State University San Marcos, his sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and they formed the band Blink-182 with drummer Scott Raynor. The band produced several rock recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, which featured the Hoppus-penned hit &quot;Dammit&quot;.

After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker, Blink-182 recorded &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999), which launched them to multi-platinum success. Two more records followed—the heavier &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; (2001) and the more experimental untitled fifth album (2003)—before the band split in 2005 following internal tension. Hoppus continued playing with Barker in +44 in the late 2000s. Blink-182 subsequently reunited in 2009 and continue to record and tour worldwide.

Aside from his musical career, Hoppus has had multiple successes behind the recording console, producing records for groups such as Idiot Pilot, New Found Glory, The Matches, Motion City Soundtrack, and PAWS. He has previously co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, and created a new clothing line in 2012 named Hi My Name is Mark. Hoppus hosted a weekly podcast in 2005 through 2006, which returned in 2015, and he hosted his own television talk show, &quot;Hoppus on Music&quot;, from 2010 to 2012 on Fuse. He also was part of the pop rock duo Simple Creatures from 2019 until 2020.

==Early life==
Mark Allan Hoppus was born on March 15, 1972, in Ridgecrest, California. He was raised near Washington, D.C., before his family settled in Ridgecrest, a place he later described as &quot;geniuses, scientists, physicists, and then just complete strung-out meth-heads&quot;. His maternal great-grandparents, Aaron and Lempi Orrenmaa, were Finnish immigrants from Laihia. His father Tex, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town&#x27;s Navy testing center.

Hoppus describes himself as &quot;pretty mellow&quot; until his parents divorced when he was eight, which had a &quot;drastic, unsettling effect&quot; on him. He said, &quot;When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. I remember sitting outside my parents&#x27; room when I was seven years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door. It upset me a lot.&quot; Following these events, he spent two years shuffling between his parents&#x27; homes with sister Anne, until he and his father moved to Monterey. His father was often away earning a postgraduate degree in college. He later would describe his childhood as lonely, remarking, &quot;[I] was living by myself in the fifth grade.&quot; His father introduced him to the music of The Beatles, Elton John and Billy Joel.

Hoppus describes himself as &quot;pretty straight&quot; until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock. In his early high school years, he lived in Fairfax, Virginia, attending nearby Annandale High School during his second year; he received his first bass guitar during this time and attended his first concert, They Might Be Giants, at the 9:30 Club shortly before his 16th birthday. He recalled, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know where I should stand or what I should do, so my friends and I bought some menthol cigarettes and smoked for the first time and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots.&quot; He received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale. He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead teaching himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. He has remarked that &quot;Silly Girl&quot; by the Descendents was the &quot;song that made [him] fall in love with punk rock music [...] that song changed [his] life forever&quot;. He borrowed a cassette tape of The Cure&#x27;s album &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; from his friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school, and was taken with the song &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;. 
Hoppus began to dress like Cure frontman Robert Smith, donning eyeliner and &quot;occasionally bright red lipstick&quot; to his high school classes; he later quipped, &quot;This all went over exceedingly well with the faculty and staff in the small desert town where I grew up.&quot; Beginning in his first year, he gained solace through music of both The Cure and The Smiths. He played by himself and sang in the band Pier 69, primarily covering songs by The Cure, and recorded a live demo with a group named The Attic Children in 1988, featuring covers of The Cure songs. Hoppus returned to Ridgecrest in 1989, completing high school at Burroughs High School. In his teen years, a friend stole his mother&#x27;s car in the middle of the night to pick him up; the two would sneak out to the desert and burn trees and any objects they could find.

After graduating from Burroughs High School in 1990, he began playing in a band called of All Things he formed with two friends, covering songs by Descendents, Social Distortion, and Bad Religion, as well as writing original punk numbers. The group primarily performed at friend&#x27;s parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue. Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college and get a job at a local music store in San Diego. He continued playing gigs with of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, his manager became suspicious of his weekend activities, as Hoppus had told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest, and refused to give him any time off on weekends. His &quot;short-lived attempt&quot; at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher. He recalls he &quot;hated&quot; college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for educational reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after &quot;things began to take off with Blink-182&quot; and lived with his mother for many of the early years of the band. Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with Blink-182; however, he describes his father as &quot;more realistic, [...] he said, &#x27;Have something to fall back on.&#x27;&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m really fortunate that my mom always completely supported me, even to the point that I dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on,&quot; said Hoppus.

==Music career==
===Blink-182===
====Early career====

After moving to San Diego in the summer of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he expressed his desire to be in a band. Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer. In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge&#x27;s garage. To impress DeLonge, Hoppus climbed to the top of a streetlight outside of DeLonge&#x27;s home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being on crutches for the next few weeks. DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: &quot;When I first met Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun.&quot; DeLonge recruited old friend Scott Raynor from his days at Poway to become the drummer for the new band, named blink.

Hoppus and his girlfriend at this time lived in a basement apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus went out and bought his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home and his girlfriend proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. &quot;I just kept telling her that this was what mattered to me, this was my life,&quot; Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation. Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. &quot;Flyswatter&quot;—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor&#x27;s bedroom and landed the band their first shows. Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music. Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother&#x27;s, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.

Blink&#x27;s first album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; (1995), was a strong seller for the independent band and would come to be regarded as iconic within the skate punk scene. In 1995, the band signed on for their first national tour, which extended as far as the East Coast. The band purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law, Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds. The band slowly built a young, devoted following with indie recordings and an endless series of performances and various clubs and festivals. MCA Records signed the band in 1996 and would co-distribute their next release, the sophomore effort &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. Hoppus penned the record&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Dammit&quot;, which became a nationwide rock radio hit single as the band toured on the Vans Warped Tour.

====Multi-platinum success and +44====
Hoppus grew increasingly lonely on these tours, having no significant other while other band members did. The exhaustive schedule created tensions within the band, who would fire Raynor in the summer of 1998 in mysterious circumstances never fully explained. With new drummer Travis Barker behind the kit, the trio hit the studio with producer Jerry Finn and recorded &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, which launched the band&#x27;s career, catapulting them into the &quot;stratosphere of pop music&quot; and solidifying them as the biggest pop punk act of the era. Three singles were released from the record—&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, and &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot;—that crossed over into Top 40 radio format and experienced major commercial success. Hoppus got married in 2000 (see Personal life) just before the band prepared to record their highly anticipated follow-up, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; (2001). Hoppus felt complacent creatively but DeLonge felt otherwise, creating post-hardcore side project Box Car Racer to experiment with ideas he deemed unsuitable for blink.

Hoppus felt betrayed (Barker was also in Box Car Racer) and a rift developed between Hoppus and DeLonge that would carry on into the band&#x27;s future. When the band regrouped to record their next record in 2003, all of the members had become fathers (or, in the case of Barker, becoming one) and the trio took a darker, more &quot;mature&quot; direction with their untitled fifth studio album, infusing experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound partially inspired by Box Car Racer. Unresolved feelings from that project would arise in late 2004 when the band began to argue regarding their future and recording process. The February 2005 breakup of blink-182 affected Hoppus greatly: &quot;I had no idea what to do. After blink broke up I had such a loss of identity and purpose. I just had a giant sense of void.&quot; Hoppus then began to work on even darker, electronic demos with Barker in his kitchen. He also turned to producing, hitting the studio with Motion City Soundtrack to record &quot;Commit This to Memory&quot; (2005). In October 2005, Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio together (named Opra Music), where they would bring together a full band to expand upon those electronic demos, creating +44&#x27;s &quot;When Your Heart Stops Beating&quot; (2006).
The record, by all accounts, sold poorly and received mixed reviews in the music press. Hoppus and Barker continued touring on the Honda Civic Tour and commenced work on a second +44 album. The August 2008 death of friend and producer Jerry Finn deeply affected Hoppus, who referred to Finn as a lifelong friend and mentor. The following month, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (aka DJ AM), were involved in a plane crash that killed four people, leaving Barker and Goldstein the only survivors. Hoppus immediately boarded a plane to the burn unit, and DeLonge reconnected with the duo under the tragic circumstances. When the band regrouped in the studio for a day, past acrimony vanished with near immediacy. Regarding these experiences, Hoppus wrote, &quot;The events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. Life is too short.&quot; In February 2009, the band&#x27;s official website was updated with a statement: &quot;To put it simply, We&#x27;re back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy.&quot;

====Reunion and recent events====

The band reconnected musically and emotionally on the reunion tour, but were still &quot;on eggshells&quot; throughout the recording of their comeback album. The recording&#x27;s delay was due to the way the band chose to work – in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios – in addition to each member&#x27;s busy schedules. The band struggled to record juggling individual priorities; in the case of Hoppus, his new television show &quot;Hoppus on Music&quot; required him flying to New York once a week. Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters. The band&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;Neighborhoods&quot; (2011), debuted high but undersold label expectations, and Blink-182 parted with Interscope Records in 2012, going independent for their next release, the EP &quot;Dogs Eating Dogs&quot;.

The band toured Australia in February 2013 without Barker, who did not attend due to his fear of flying (Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion filled in for him). The band toured the United States in September 2013, where they planned to begin writing songs for their seventh studio album. &quot;We&#x27;re hoping to head into the studio next year [and to have the] album out in late spring/early summer,&quot; Hoppus told &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. In the interim, Hoppus began recording songs with frequent engineer and producer Chris Holmes that the duo plan to release by the end of the year. &quot;We probably have seven or eight songs in various stages of completion,&quot; Hoppus remarked in August 2013. &quot;I still haven&#x27;t chosen a name [for the project] yet; we still have to figure that out. It&#x27;s like guitar mixed with electronics…. at this point.&quot; Hoppus will share lead vocals with Holmes on the tracks. On April 25, 2014, Hoppus announced, via Twitter, the name of the band as Nothing and Nobody. Their first album is expected to be released in the &quot;not-too-distant future&quot;.

In 2015, blink-182 played three shows in California. With the departure of Tom DeLonge from the band, Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio, filled in. It was the first time Hoppus performed under the name &quot;blink-182&quot; without DeLonge by his side. The shows were on March 18, March 20, and March 22. Hoppus later hired Skiba full-time, and blink-182 recorded two albums with him, 2016&#x27;s &quot;California&quot; and 2019&#x27;s &quot;Nine&quot; before DeLonge returned to the band in 2022.

Hoppus has also performed DJ sets at Emo Nite in Los Angeles on several occasions from 2015 to 2017.

In non-musical endeavors, Hoppus launched his own clothing line, Hi My Name is Mark (stylized as &quot;HiMyNameIsMark&quot;), in July 2013.

===Simple Creatures===
On January 24, 2019, Hoppus announced he was forming a new group with Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low called Simple Creatures. A debut song called &quot;Drug&quot; was released in January, followed by their first EP, &quot;Strange Love&quot;, on March 29, 2019. Their second EP, &quot;Everything Opposite&quot;, was released on October 11, 2019. Since 2020 the project has been on hiatus.

==Musical style==
===Songwriting===
Hoppus primarily writes most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. He is self-taught, &quot;and consequently I don&#x27;t have the best technique&quot;, he remarked in 2004. &quot;I think you would learn how to paint by painting, rather than reading books about painters or painting and I think it&#x27;s the same with music. You learn by doing and getting influences from other artists.&quot;

===Equipment===
====Bass guitars====
For Blink-182&#x27;s earliest concerts and demo recordings, Hoppus used a standard Fender Precision Bass. On the albums &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; and &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and their respective tours, he switched to using a Music Man StingRay as his primary bass. While recording &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, Hoppus used his StingRay as well as a Fender Precision and Jazz Bass. In a 2021 livestream on Twitch, he revealed he stopped using the StingRay as he thought they sounded too &quot;clanky&quot;.

After primarily recording with the two Fender basses, Hoppus worked with Fender to design a signature model, which consisted of a Jazz Bass body with a Precision Bass neck and pickup. This model debuted in 2000. In 2006, Fender manufactured an updated variant of Hoppus&#x27; signature Jazz Bass with the pickup, a Seymour Duncan Quarter Pound (SPB-3), reversed from its standard position, giving it a fuller sound.

In 2015, Hoppus switched to Fender Jaguar Basses with the same configuration as his 2006 model. However, he still occasionally uses his original signature Jazz Basses; he notably used them extensively alongside his Jaguar Basses on the band&#x27;s 2023 reunion tour, and the &quot;One More Time...&quot; album and tour.

In 2022, Hoppus teamed up with Fender to release a signature Jaguar Bass sold exclusively through his website Hi My Name Is Mark. To date, it has been released in his signature hot pink color as well as Daphne Blue, with each color being released in limited runs based on customer demand. In 2024, Fender officially released a limited edition signature Jaguar Bass in sunburst and Sea Foam Green colors.

Hoppus has been a longtime user of Ernie Ball strings and his instruments are strung with Super Slinky Bass strings (.45-.100).

====Amps====
For live sound, Hoppus originally plugged his basses into three Ampeg SVT Classic bass heads running into two Ampeg 8x10 SVT bass cabs. Prior to the use of the all-tube SVT Classic heads, Hoppus used two Ampeg SVT-4 Pro heads which only feature a tube preamp. After the &quot;Neighborhoods&quot; album release, Hoppus used New Vintage amplifiers and cabinets, specifically the Undertow 300 amplifier and NW 8x10 bass cabinets. In 2016, he began using Kemper Profiler amps in concert.

==Non-musical endeavors==
Hoppus and Tom DeLonge co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, Hoppus has since sold his share in both companies; as well as loserkids.com.

Mark Hoppus has made several acting appearances in films and television, often as part of blink-182. He first appeared as a member of a garage band in the hugely successful teen comedy &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999) with bandmates Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, (Though the film&#x27;s credits list Barker as Scott Raynor.) He appeared again with DeLonge, singing a cover of Jan and Dean&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; in the CBS television movie &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll: An American Love Story&quot; (1999). Hoppus and DeLonge hosted the MTV show &quot;You Idiot!&quot; in 1999. The band appeared in the &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot; episode &quot;Au Revoir, Pizza Place&quot; in 1999, as well as an animated cameo in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Barting Over&quot; in 2003. The band made a guest appearance on &quot;MADtv&quot; in 2002, in a segment titled &quot;Leave It to Blink-182&quot;, spoofing 1950s-era sitcoms. Hoppus was a guest actor on an episode of the show &quot;Haunted&quot; in 2002. In 2011, he appeared in the documentary film &quot;The Other F Word&quot;. Hoppus was featured as a panelist on the comedy show &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2012.

He also wrote columns for &quot;Risen Magazine&#x27;s&quot; March/April and May/June 2005 issues entitled &quot;Beyond Us&quot;. Mark Hoppus has been confirmed to be a part of a documentary about modern punk music entitled &quot;One Nine Nine Four&quot;. The film was due to be released in 2009 but has been delayed.

In 2010, he joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

Mark Hoppus worked to help relief efforts in Japan after the devastating earthquake and tsunami Tōhoku. He announced that his group Blink-182, will be auctioning off items to benefit the American Red Cross on EBay. &quot;So sad for what&#x27;s happening in Japan. Gonna dig in the bins &amp; find some old blink-182 items to auction for the Red Cross&quot; said Mark. The items auctioned off included the original lyrics sheet to the group&#x27;s hits &quot;The Rock Show&quot; and &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot;, Bad Religion autographed cymbal, hand-painted 1.5 FT tall Bunny, blink-182 tour backstage pass, stickers, postcard/magnets, trading cards, the band&#x27;s dressing room sign from the 2000 VMAs, and Hoppus orange sweater from the &quot;Dammit&quot; music video. Among the 33 items auctioned off for charity he totaled 4,318 dollars.

===HiMyNameIsMark (2005, 2012–present)===

&quot;HiMyNameIsMark&quot; is a podcast that was set up in the wake of the Blink-182 hiatus by Hoppus, and can be found at HiMyNameIsMark.com. Every few weeks he released a show of songs by underground bands, interviews with band members and/or friends, and reminisces about happenings in his life. He is often joined on the show by his friends Chris Holmes (+44&#x27;s engineer) and James Ingram (+44&#x27;s assistant engineer). Hoppus has also created various side projects including &quot;Hopp on Popp&quot; where he reviews one of his favorite up and coming artists, some of which have been Matt &amp; Kim, fun., and Japandroids. In late 2014, the podcast returned from a hiatus.

In 2012, &quot;HiMyNameIsMark&quot; rebranded itself as a clothing company, selling apparel and accessories branded with an octopus logo.

===&quot;Hoppus on Music&quot; (2010–2012)===
On June 22, 2010, Fuse announced that Hoppus would be hosting his own weekly, one-hour television series entitled &quot;A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus&quot;. In relation to the press release, Hoppus stated &quot;I am stoked to join the Fuse family and have a show where I can talk about a topic that I&#x27;m passionate about, music. More importantly, I&#x27;m excited to force millions of people to watch me on a weekly basis on national television.&quot; According to Fuse senior vice president of programming and development Sal LoCurto, &quot;&quot;A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus&quot; was developed to complement the wide variety of music programming on Fuse – including live concerts, festival coverage and in-depth interview series with the biggest names in music. On August 5, Hoppus revealed the co-host of the show would be comedian Amy Schumer.&quot;

The show focuses on music news, fun panel discussions and special reports from the show&#x27;s correspondents. The show also features musical performances by both mainstream and emerging bands. The show officially premiered on September 16, 2010, on Fuse. The show&#x27;s second season premiered in March 2011 and the show was re-titled &quot;Hoppus on Music&quot;.

===&quot;After School Radio&quot; (since 2020)===

On August 18, 2020, the first episode of Hoppus&#x27;s newest podcast entitled &quot;After School Radio&quot; would premiere on Apple Music. The podcast is hosted weekly by Hoppus, where he focuses on the artists, music, and culture that have defined the alternative genre.

Most notably, the August 3, 2021, episode titled &quot;The Mark and Tom Show&quot; reunited Hoppus with then former bandmate Tom Delonge.

==Personal life==
Hoppus met former MTV talent executive Skye Everly in August 1999, at a rehearsal for the music video of &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, and they later married on December 2, 2000. According to a 2004 interview, she initially refused to date him. Hoppus elaborated, &quot;Tom [DeLonge] always used to embarrass me. Any girl he&#x27;d talk to, he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Hey, you wanna go on a date with Mark?&#x27; He asked Skye, my wife, who looked at me and said, &#x27;No.&#x27; That&#x27;s how it all started.&quot; Their son, Jack, was born in 2002.

Hoppus stands tall. In 2004, he revealed that he votes for the Libertarian Party. He said, &quot;To me, it means to respect other people and let them do their own thing. The government is there to help people but not control them.&quot; A 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; profile noted that he &quot;pray[s] every night&quot;, and he said of his religious views in 2005, &quot;It&#x27;s amazing to me that anyone can say that one thing is right. [...] To draw lines over something that none of us on earth could possibly comprehend seems like a waste of time.&quot;

In 2011, Hoppus and his family relocated to the Mayfair area of London, England, as Blink-182 were in the process of completing their sixth album, &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;. They remained in London until 2014, when they moved back to the US and have since settled in Beverly Hills, California. During his time in London, he enjoyed jogging in the city&#x27;s parks and became a supporter of Premier League football club Chelsea F.C.. Hoppus is also a devout supporter of the NFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams.

Hoppus was a vegan for many years, though he returned to eating meat at his doctor&#x27;s recommendation following his cancer diagnosis in 2021.

===Health issues===
On June 23, 2021, Hoppus revealed that he was undergoing treatment for cancer after accidentally sharing a picture of himself undergoing chemotherapy treatment to his public Instagram Story. On July 11, he said that he was experiencing stage 4 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. On September 29 of the same year, Hoppus announced that he was declared cancer-free, but would continue to be screened every 6 months in case the cancer returns.

<text>Scott William Raynor Jr. (born May 23, 1978) is an American former musician and police officer. He is best known as the original drummer of the rock band Blink-182. Born in Poway, California, Raynor first approached the drums in his preteens; he joined Blink-182 at only 14 years old, and played with the band for six years. With Raynor, the group recorded their first demo, &quot;Buddha&quot; (1994), their debut album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; (1995), as well as the gold-certified &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; (1997). Raynor was dismissed from the group in 1998, and was replaced by Travis Barker.

Since then, Raynor has performed with a wide variety of groups, including post-punk band the Wraith, and contributed to the charity StandUp for Kids. As of 2023, he works for the city of San Diego as a police officer.
==Life and career==
Raynor began playing drums at a young age, forming a group with friend Ryan Kennedy at age 11 to perform at a school competition – &quot;a kind of &#x27;show and tell&#x27; thing,&quot; Raynor later recalled. The duo were initially inspired by Metallica, but found their material far too technical; they instead played &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; by Danzig and &quot;London Dungeon&quot; by the Misfits. Raynor&#x27;s first legitimate performance consisted of a cover of &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot; by Gwar.

===Beginnings of music career===
Raynor attended Rancho Bernardo High School (RBHS). RBHS often arranged Battle of the Bands competitions, and Raynor participated: his band, The Necropheliacs, played a cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Creeping Death&quot;. While at the competition, new transfer student Tom DeLonge, who had been expelled from Poway High School for attending a basketball game while drunk, performed an original song titled &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Shave Your Back Tonight?&quot; to a packed auditorium. Raynor was introduced to DeLonge at a party by Paul Scott, founding member of The Necropheliacs, shortly before he moved out of state. The two found they had plenty in common, and DeLonge was searching for a more permanent band to create music with. The two began writing songs at Raynor&#x27;s parents&#x27; home – &quot;a strange mix of metal and Descendents-style punk&quot; – and tried out a variety of bass players, according to Raynor. 

DeLonge later met Mark Hoppus in August 1992 through friend Kerry Key and his girlfriend, Anne Hoppus. &quot;I thought they were hilarious when I met them. I mean, I didn&#x27;t have a driver&#x27;s license yet, so I gained a lot of agency through hanging with them and their group of friends,&quot; said Raynor. The trio began to practice in Raynor&#x27;s room (amid complaints from neighbors), which was soundproofed with empty egg cartons.

The trio spent time together constantly, attending punk shows and movies and playing practical jokes. The trio first operated under a variety of names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band &quot;Blink&quot;. Hoppus&#x27; girlfriend later led him to depart from the group for a time, but he returned when Raynor and DeLonge began recording a demo tape on a four track recorder with friend and collaborator Cam Jones. The band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and they found their way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at SOMA, a local all-ages venue which they longed to headline. &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to describe, in words, the nauseous mix of fear and excitement that would hit me when I first started seeing lines of people wanting to hear us play,&quot; said Raynor.

The three eventually were playing concerts at local venues such as SOMA, which alerted local independent record label Cargo Music. Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor. The &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; sessions were to be the last performance with the band for Raynor, whose family had moved to Reno, Nevada. Raynor stayed with his sister for the summer of 1993 in order to rehearse for the recording of their debut album. Raynor moved to Reno following the recording and was briefly replaced by school friend Mike Krull. The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor would move back to San Diego to live with Hoppus and his family. His parents allowed him to drop out of full-time school to move back and play with the band, but he would continue to finish his diploma by bringing homework on tour. &quot;I think Mark and his sister Anne and I stayed up watching old TV shows until morning that whole summer,&quot; he recalled.

&quot;The summer I lived with Mark and his family was probably the greatest summer of my life so far,&quot; said Raynor in 2001. &quot;I left home at 17, came to San Diego, we bought a van, finished our first video… I had all kinds of dreams in my head and they were all coming true.&quot;

===Mainstream success and dismissal from Blink-182===

By March 1996, the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels, resulting in a bidding war between Interscope, MCA, and Epitaph. MCA&#x27;s persistence and sincerity won the band over, as well as their promise of complete artistic freedom. The band began recording their sophomore effort &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; that winter. The record hit stores the following summer and the band headed out on the Warped Tour, which Raynor described as &quot;one of the most unequivocally positive experiences of my time with the band.&quot; When lead single &quot;Dammit&quot; began rotation at Los Angeles-based KROQ, other stations took notice and the single was added to rock radio playlists across the country. Desperate for a break due to extended touring, the overworked band began to argue and tensions formed, centering largely around Raynor.

Raynor had planned from the earliest days of the band to one day attend college, as he said in a partially tongue-in-cheek remark in a 1994 interview: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be 30 and still in a punk-rock band. That seems kind of scary to me.&quot; Shortly after the band released &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, Raynor began to think outside of the situation, viewing the major label experience as nothing like he had hoped. He had only been half invested in the band since signing to MCA, as he felt it offered less creative freedom, especially in comparison to Epitaph, which had been pursuing the band and was Raynor&#x27;s first choice. &quot;I mean, I was intellectually invested, I recognized it as a smart move financially. But it&#x27;s like that song says, &#x27;I Left My Heart in San Francisco&#x27;; I left my heart in the office at Epitaph. After that compromise I found it difficult to make further ones, and I felt like I was asked to make a lot. Eventually, there was not enough of my heart in the band to justify my sticking around. I backed away, I was dead weight.&quot;

The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore, described as &quot;a winter version of the Warped Tour.&quot; Sharing the stage with Primus, the band was enjoying more success than ever before, but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially. Relations reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore&#x27;s conclusion. Shortly after the conclusion of SnoCore was a short mini-tour along the western coast, most notably Southern California, the band&#x27;s favorite place to play. The tour ended with the band headlining a sold-out show at the Palladium in Hollywood, where the band had dreamed of performing for years.

Raynor suffered a &quot;tragic loss&quot; during the West Coast mini-tour and flew home, forcing the band to find a fill-in drummer: Travis Barker of the ska punk support band The Aquabats. Barker learned the drum tracks for the band&#x27;s set in only 45 minutes prior to his first show, but still was not able to replicate the speed of Scott. Raynor returned for the band&#x27;s Hollywood Palladium performance, and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues, Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band&#x27;s performances. Following a largely successful Australian tour in the spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an in-patient rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options. According to Raynor, he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab. Despite this, he felt no malice toward his former bandmates and conceded they were &quot;right&quot; to fire him. The band minimized the impact of the situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure. The band later worked Raynor&#x27;s departure into a song, &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, which makes reference to his alcohol abuse.

===Later work===
Raynor has kept a low profile since exiting Blink-182; he has taken part in few interviews, aside from a 2004 AbsolutePunk piece and portions for Joe Shooman&#x27;s unauthorized 2010 biography of the band, &quot;Blink-182: The Bands, The Breakdown &amp; The Return&quot;.
In his immediate years after leaving the group, Raynor kept himself busy with various musical projects, including a band called The Axidentals. Raynor played guitar for the group, which recorded an extended play and a full-length that was left unreleased when Vagrant Records showed interest in signing the band. By the time the deal went through, Raynor was having disputes with the group and quit; the band later released their debut album as &quot;Death on Wednesday&quot; through Vagrant in 2000. Raynor later went on to perform with the group Grimby from 2000 to 2001, which recorded an extended play at Doubletime Studios. Recorded live over the course of a day, Raynor has described it as dark comedy, &quot;a Black Sabbath, Ramones, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic milkshake.&quot; Raynor fulfilled a long-held ambition to work with Nirvana producer Jack Endino on an extended play recorded with The Spazms in 2004. &quot;The language of the whole record really speaks for me. It&#x27;s deskilled, nihilistic, and posits, by default not intention, a Franco-feminism&quot;, he said.

In the 2000s, he began contributing to a charity called StandUp for Kids, an outreach organization that helped street and homeless youth. He also taught music to teens in trouble with the law under the &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; program. In 2003, a rumor circulated on the Internet that Raynor had been shot dead; he addressed the hoax via a letter he e-mailed to the sites in question, that instead directed the attention to the StandUp for Kids organization. He continued to play music; in 2017, Raynor joined the Los Angeles post-punk band The Wraith, with whom he released the extended play &quot;Shadow Flag&quot;. He left the band some time after, but re-joined in 2019. Raynor appears in the music video for the song &quot;Wing of Night&quot;, although he didn&#x27;t take part in the writing process. In January 2020, Raynor left The Wraith again; the band continued with a new drummer.

As of 2023, Raynor had joined the San Diego Police Department and lives in San Diego.

<text>Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed by humans, non-human animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulate from repeated experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be &quot;lost&quot; from that which cannot be retrieved.

Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions between people and their environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/accidents, or in collaborative learning health systems). Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals. Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event cannot be avoided or escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness. There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development.

Play has been approached by several theorists as a form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children&#x27;s development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games. For Vygotsky, however, play is the first form of learning language and communication, and the stage where a child begins to understand rules and symbols. This has led to a view that learning in organisms is always related to semiosis, and is often associated with representational systems/activity.

== Types ==
There are various functional categorizations of memory which have developed. Some memory researchers distinguish memory based on the relationship between the stimuli involved (associative vs non-associative) or based to whether the content can be communicated through language (declarative/explicit vs procedural/implicit). Some of these categories can, in turn, be parsed into sub-types. For instance, declarative memory comprises both episodic and semantic memory.
=== Non-associative learning ===
&quot;Non-associative learning&quot; refers to &quot;a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus.&quot; This definition exempts the changes caused by sensory adaptation, fatigue, or injury.

Non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization.

==== Habituation ====

&quot;Habituation&quot; is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response (e.g., response probability, response duration) to a stimulus diminishes when the stimulus is repeated. Thus, habituation must be distinguished from extinction, which is an associative process. In operant extinction, for example, a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward. An example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl (or similar predator) is put into the cage, the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator. Soon the birds react less, showing habituation. If another stuffed owl is introduced (or the same one removed and re-introduced), the birds react to it again as though it were a predator, demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to (namely, one particular unmoving owl in one place). The habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli, respectively. Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal, as well as the sensitive plant &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; and the large protozoan &quot;Stentor coeruleus&quot;. This concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization.

==== Sensitization ====

&quot;Sensitization&quot; is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus. This is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus. An everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously. After a while, this stimulation creates a warm sensation that can eventually turn painful. This pain results from a progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves. This sends a warning that the stimulation is harmful. Sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism.

=== Active learning ===
&quot;Active learning&quot; occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience. Since understanding information is the key aspect of learning, it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not. By doing so, they can monitor their own mastery of subjects. Active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings. This and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time. Studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning, claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result. In addition, learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn. Active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning. Conversely, passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning (or traditional education).

=== Associative learning ===
&quot;Associative learning&quot; is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events. In classical conditioning, a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex-eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own. In operant conditioning, a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus.

==== Operant conditioning ====

&quot;Operant conditioning&quot; is a way in which behavior can be shaped or modified according to the desires of the trainer or head individual. Operant conditioning uses the thought that living things seek pleasure and avoid pain, and that an animal or human can learn through receiving either reward or punishment at a specific time called trace conditioning. Trace conditioning is the small and ideal period of time between the subject performing the desired behavior, and receiving the positive reinforcement as a result of their performance. The reward needs to be given immediately after the completion of the wanted behavior.

Operant conditioning is different from classical conditioning in that it shapes behavior not solely on bodily reflexes that occur naturally to a specific stimulus, but rather focuses on the shaping of wanted behavior that requires conscious thought, and ultimately requires learning.

Punishment and reinforcement are the two principal ways in which operant conditioning occurs. Punishment is used to reduce unwanted behavior, and ultimately (from the learner&#x27;s perspective) leads to avoidance of the punishment, not necessarily avoidance of the unwanted behavior. Punishment is not an appropriate way to increase wanted behavior for animals or humans. Punishment can be divided into two subcategories, positive punishment and negative punishment. Positive punishment is when an aversive aspect of life or thing is added to the subject, for this reason it is called positive punishment. For example, the parent spanking their child would be considered a positive punishment, because a spanking was added to the child. Negative punishment is considered the removal of something loved or desirable from the subject. For example, when a parent puts his child in time out, in reality, the child is losing the opportunity to be with friends, or to enjoy the freedom to do as he pleases. In this example, negative punishment is the removal of the child&#x27;s desired rights to play with his friends etc.

Reinforcement on the other hand is used to increase a wanted behavior either through negative reinforcement or positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is defined by removing an undesirable aspect of life, or thing. For example, a dog might learn to sit as the trainer scratches his ears, which ultimately is removing his itches (undesirable aspect). Positive reinforcement is defined by adding a desirable aspect of life or thing. For example, a dog might learn to sit if he receives a treat. In this example the treat was added to the dog&#x27;s life.

==== Classical conditioning ====

The typical paradigm for &quot;classical conditioning&quot; involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now referred to as the &quot;conditioned stimulus&quot;). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a &quot;conditioned response&quot;. The classic example is Ivan Pavlov and his dogs. Pavlov fed his dogs meat powder, which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder. Meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder. The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. It was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants.

Another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is John B. Watson. Watson&#x27;s work was very influential and paved the way for B.F. Skinner&#x27;s radical behaviorism. Watson&#x27;s behaviorism (and philosophy of science) stood in direct contrast to Freud and other accounts based largely on introspection. Watson&#x27;s view was that the introspective method was too subjective and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors. In 1913, Watson published the article &quot;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views&quot;, in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science. Watson&#x27;s most famous, and controversial, experiment was &quot;Little Albert&quot;, where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles.

==== Observational learning ====

&quot;Observational learning&quot; is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings.

==== Imprinting ====

&quot;Imprinting&quot; is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior. In filial imprinting, young animals, particularly birds, form an association with another individual or in some cases, an object, that they respond to as they would to a parent. In 1935, the Austrian Zoologist Konrad Lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds.

=== Play ===

&quot;Play&quot; generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself, but that improves performance in similar future situations. This is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans, but is mostly limited to mammals and birds. Cats are known to play with a ball of string when young, which gives them experience with catching prey. Besides inanimate objects, animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals, such as orcas playing with seals they have caught. Play involves a significant cost to animals, such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection. It also consumes energy, so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved. Play is generally seen in younger animals, suggesting a link with learning. However, it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning, for example improving physical fitness.

Play, as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child&#x27;s learning and development. Through play, children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration. Children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger, through play activities. As a form of learning, play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children.

There are five types of play:
# Sensorimotor play aka functional play, characterized by the repetition of an activity
# Roleplay occurs starting at the age of three
# Rule-based play where authoritative prescribed codes of conduct are primary
# Construction play involves experimentation and building
# Movement play aka physical play

These five types of play are often intersecting. All types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children. Children learn to think creatively when they learn through play. Specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan. Play as a form of learning, can occur solitarily, or involve interacting with others.

=== Enculturation ===

&quot;Enculturation&quot; is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture. Parents, other adults, and peers shape the individual&#x27;s understanding of these values. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture. This is different from acculturation, where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one.

Multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally. Collaborative practices in the Mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience. As the children participated in everyday activities, they learned the cultural significance of these interactions. The collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by Mexican and Mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being &quot;acomedido&quot;. Chillihuani girls in Peru described themselves as weaving constantly, following behavior shown by the other adults.

=== Episodic learning ===
&quot;Episodic learning&quot; is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event. For example, a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning. Episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory, which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval, along with perceptual memory and semantic memory. Episodic memory remembers events and history that are embedded in experience and this is distinguished from semantic memory, which attempts to extract facts out of their experiential context or – as some describe – a timeless organization of knowledge. For instance, if a person remembers the Grand Canyon from a recent visit, it is an episodic memory. He would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the Grand Canyon is. A study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it. This is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to.

=== Multimedia learning ===

&quot;Multimedia learning&quot; is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information. This type of learning relies on dual-coding theory.

=== E-learning and augmented learning ===

&quot;Electronic learning&quot; or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning. A specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning (m-learning), which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment, such as cellular phones.

When a learner interacts with the e-learning environment, it is called augmented learning. By adapting to the needs of individuals, the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner&#x27;s natural environment. Augmented digital content may include text, images, video, audio (music and voice). By personalizing instruction, augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime. See also minimally invasive education.

Moore (1989) purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality, effective online learning:
* Learner–learner (i.e. communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present),
* Learner–instructor (i.e. student-teacher communication), and
* Learner–content (i.e. intellectually interacting with content that results in changes in learners&#x27; understanding, perceptions, and cognitive structures).
In his theory of transactional distance, Moore (1993) contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances (known as transactional distance).

=== Rote learning ===

&quot;Rote learning&quot; is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. The major technique used for rote learning is &quot;learning by repetition&quot;, based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly (but not its meaning) if the information is repeatedly processed. Rote learning is used in diverse areas, from mathematics to music to religion.

=== Meaningful learning ===

&quot;Meaningful learning&quot; is the concept that learned knowledge (e.g., a fact) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge. To this end, meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding. Meaningful learning, on the other hand, implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned.

===Evidence-based learning===

Evidence-based learning is the use of evidence from well designed scientific studies to accelerate learning. Evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase the rate at which a student learns.

=== Formal learning ===
&quot;Formal learning&quot; is a deliberate way attaining of knowledge, which takes place within a teacher-student environment, such as in a school system or work environment. The term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning, but rather the way it is directed and organized. In formal learning, the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning and oftentimes learners will be awarded with a diploma, or a type of formal recognition.

=== Non-formal learning ===

&quot;Non-formal learning&quot; is organized learning outside the formal learning system. For example, learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints, in clubs or in (international) youth organizations, and workshops. From the organizer&#x27;s point of reference, non-formal learning does not always need a main objective or learning outcome. From the learner&#x27;s point of view, non-formal learning, although not focused on outcomes, often results in an intentional learning opportunity.

=== Informal learning ===

&quot;Informal learning&quot; is less structured than &quot;non-formal learning&quot;. It may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations (for example, one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the possible dangers inherent in not paying attention to where one is going). It is learning from life, during a meal at the table with parents, during play, and while exploring etc.. For the learner, informal learning is most often an experience of happenstance, and not a deliberately planned experience. Thus this does not require enrollment into any class. Unlike formal learning, informal learning typically does not lead to accreditation. Informal learning begins to unfold as the learner ponders his or her situation. This type of learning does not require a professor of any kind, and learning outcomes are unforeseen following the learning experience.

Informal learning is self-directed and because it focuses on day-to-day situations, the value of informal learning can be considered high. As a result, information retrieved from informal learning experiences will likely be applicable to daily life. Children with informal learning can at times yield stronger support than subjects with formal learning in the topic of mathematics. Daily life experiences take place in the workforce, family life, and any other situation that may arise during one&#x27;s lifetime. Informal learning is voluntary from the learner&#x27;s viewpoint, and may require making mistakes and learning from them. Informal learning allows the individual to discover coping strategies for difficult emotions that may arise while learning. From the learner&#x27;s perspective, informal learning can become purposeful, because the learner chooses which rate is appropriate to learn and because this type of learning tends to take place within smaller groups or by oneself.

=== Nonformal learning and combined approaches ===
The educational system may use a combination of formal, informal, and nonformal learning methods. The UN and EU recognize these different forms of learning (cf. links below). In some schools, students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits. They may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses, on the condition they prepare, contribute, share, and can prove this offered valuable new insight, helped to acquire new skills, a place to get experience in organizing, teaching, etc.

To learn a skill, such as solving a Rubik&#x27;s Cube quickly, several factors come into play at once:
* Reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.
* Practicing the moves repeatedly helps build &quot;muscle memory&quot; and speed.
* Thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts, which speeds future attempts.
* Observing the Rubik&#x27;s Cube&#x27;s six colors help anchor solutions in the mind.
* Revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill.

=== Tangential learning ===
&quot;Tangential learning&quot; is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy. For example, after playing a music-based video game, some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument, or after watching a TV show that references Faust and Lovecraft, some people may be inspired to read the original work. Self-education can be improved with systematization. According to experts in natural learning, self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning.

&quot;Extra Credits&quot; writer and game designer James Portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for &quot;tangential learning&quot;. Mozelius &quot;et al.&quot; points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor, and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results. The built-in encyclopedias in the &quot;Civilization&quot; games are presented as an example – by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay. The importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by Moreno, C., in a case study about the mobile game Kiwaka. In this game, developed by Landka in collaboration with ESA and ESO, progress is rewarded with educational content, as opposed to traditional education games where learning activities are rewarded with gameplay.

=== Dialogic learning ===

&quot;Dialogic learning&quot; is a type of learning based on dialogue.

=== Incidental learning ===
In &quot;incidental teaching&quot; learning is not planned by the instructor or the student, it occurs as a byproduct of another activity — an experience, observation, self-reflection, interaction, unique event (e.g. in response to incidents/accidents), or common routine task. This learning happens in addition to or apart from the instructor&#x27;s plans and the student&#x27;s expectations. An example of incidental teaching is when the instructor places a train set on top of a cabinet. If the child points or walks towards the cabinet, the instructor prompts the student to say &quot;train&quot;. Once the student says &quot;train&quot;, he gets access to the train set.

Here are some steps most commonly used in incidental teaching:
* An instructor will arrange the learning environment so that necessary materials are within the student&#x27;s sight, but not within his reach, thus impacting his motivation to seek out those materials.
* An instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement.
* An instructor prompts the student to respond if needed.
* An instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student.
* The instructor fades out the prompting process over a period of time and subsequent trials.

Incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment. This type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses. Research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities. Both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students. Additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically.

== Domains ==

Benjamin Bloom has suggested three domains of learning in his taxonomy which are:
* Cognitive: To recall, calculate, discuss, analyze, problem solve, etc.
* Psychomotor: To dance, swim, ski, dive, drive a car, ride a bike, etc.
* Affective: To like something or someone, love, appreciate, fear, hate, worship, etc.

These domains are not mutually exclusive. For example, in learning to play chess, the person must learn the rules (cognitive domain)—but must also learn how to set up the chess pieces and how to properly hold and move a chess piece (psychomotor). Furthermore, later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself, value its applications in life, and appreciate its history (affective domain).

== Transfer ==
Transfer of learning is the application of skill, knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation that happens when certain conditions are fulfilled. Research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent; most common when &quot;... cued, primed, and guided...&quot; and has sought to clarify what it is, and how it might be promoted through instruction.

Over the history of its discourse, various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced. First, it is speculated that different types of transfer exist, including: near transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context; and far transfer, the application of skill to solve a novel problem presented in a different context. Furthermore, Perkins and Salomon (1992) suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving, and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks, such as second or third-language learning. Concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history; researchers in the early 20th century described the possibility that &quot;...habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities&quot;. Finally, Schwarz, Bransford and Sears (2005) have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote.

A significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur. Early research by Ruger, for example, found that the &quot;level of attention&quot;, &quot;attitudes&quot;, &quot;method of attack&quot; (or method for tackling a problem), a &quot;search for new points of view&quot;, a &quot;careful testing of hypothesis&quot; and &quot;generalization&quot; were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer. To encourage transfer through teaching, Perkins and Salomon recommend aligning (&quot;hugging&quot;) instruction with practice and assessment, and &quot;bridging&quot;, or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content.

== Factors affecting learning ==
=== Genetics ===

Some aspects of intelligence are inherited genetically, so different learners to some degree have different abilities with regard to learning and speed of learning.

=== Socioeconomic and physical conditions ===

Problems like malnutrition, fatigue, and poor physical health can slow learning, as can bad ventilation or poor lighting at home, and unhygienic living conditions.

The design, quality, and setting of a learning space, such as a school or classroom, can each be critical to the success of a learning environment. Size, configuration, comfort—fresh air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture—can all affect a student&#x27;s learning. The tools used by both instructors and students directly affect how information is conveyed, from the display and writing surfaces (blackboards, markerboards, tack surfaces) to digital technologies. For example, if a room is too crowded, stress levels rise, student attention is reduced, and furniture arrangement is restricted. If furniture is incorrectly arranged, sightlines to the instructor or instructional material are limited and the ability to suit the learning or lesson style is restricted. Aesthetics can also play a role, for if student morale suffers, so does motivation to attend school.

=== Psychological factors and teaching style ===

Intrinsic motivation, such as a student&#x27;s own intellectual curiosity or desire to experiment or explore, has been found to sustain learning more effectively than extrinsic motivations such as grades or parental requirements. Rote learning involves repetition in order to reinforce facts in memory, but has been criticized as ineffective and &quot;drill and kill&quot; since it kills intrinsic motivation. Alternatives to rote learning include active learning and meaningful learning.

The speed, accuracy, and retention, depend upon aptitude, attitude, interest, attention, energy level, and motivation of the students. Students who answer a question properly or give good results should be praised. This encouragement increases their ability and helps them produce better results. Certain attitudes, such as always finding fault in a student&#x27;s answer or provoking or embarrassing the student in front of a class are counterproductive.

Certain techniques can increase long-term retention:
* The spacing effect means that lessons or studying spaced out over time (spaced repetition) are better than cramming
* Teaching material to other people
* &quot;Self-explaining&quot; (paraphrasing material to oneself) rather than passive reading
* Low-stakes quizzing

===Epigenetic factors===

The underlying molecular basis of learning appears to be dynamic changes in gene expression occurring in brain neurons that are introduced by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves, most notably, chemical modification of DNA or DNA-associated histone proteins. These chemical modifications can cause long-lasting changes in gene expression. Epigenetic mechanisms involved in learning include the methylation and demethylation of neuronal DNA as well as methylation, acetylation and deacetylation of neuronal histone proteins.

During learning, information processing in the brain involves induction of oxidative modification in neuronal DNA followed by the employment of DNA repair processes that introduce epigenetic alterations. In particular, the DNA repair processes of non-homologous end joining and base excision repair are employed in learning and memory formation.

===General cognition-related factors===
===Adult learning vs children&#x27;s learning===
Learning is often more efficient in children and takes longer or is more difficult with age. A study using neuroimaging identified rapid neurotransmitter GABA boosting as a major potential explanation-component for why that is.

Children&#x27;s brains contain more &quot;silent synapses&quot; that are inactive until recruited as part of neuroplasticity and flexible learning or memories. Neuroplasticity is heightened during critical or sensitive periods of brain development, mainly referring to brain development during child development.

However researchers, after subjecting late middle aged participants to university courses, suggest perceived age differences in learning may be a result of differences in time, support, environment, and attitudes, rather than inherent ability.

What humans learn at the early stages, and what they learn to apply, sets humans on course for life or has a disproportional impact. Adults usually have a higher capacity to select what they learn, to what extent and how. For example, children may learn the given subjects and topics of school curricula via classroom blackboard-transcription handwriting, instead of being able to choose specific topics/skills or jobs to learn and the styles of learning. For instance, children may not have developed consolidated interests, ethics, interest in purpose and meaningful activities, knowledge about real-world requirements and demands, and priorities.

== In animal evolution ==
Animals gain knowledge in two ways. First is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it learns not to eat that again. The second is innate knowledge that is genetically inherited. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it. In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true—animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior. In these situations, learning evolves in the species.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge ===
In a changing environment, an animal must constantly gain new information to survive. However, in a stable environment, this same individual needs to gather the information it needs once, and then rely on it for the rest of its life. Therefore, different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determines whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation, or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighs the benefit of having it, then the animal does not evolve to learn in this scenario—but instead, non-learning evolves. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighs the cost of obtaining it, then the animal is far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs, then learning is simply unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves. Similarly, if an environment is in a constant state of change, learning is also disadvantageous, as anything learned is immediately irrelevant because of the changing environment. The learned information no longer applies. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning evolves. In fact, a study of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; showed that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity, possibly because egg-laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the newly learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning.

However, in environments where change occurs within an animal&#x27;s lifetime but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing. An example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change. In these environments, learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live.

== In plants ==
In recent years, plant physiologists have examined the physiology of plant behavior and cognition. The concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues, a behavior necessary for survival. Monica Gagliano, an Australian professor of evolutionary ecology, makes an argument for associative learning in the garden pea, &quot;Pisum sativum&quot;. The garden pea is not specific to a region, but rather grows in cooler, higher altitude climates. Gagliano and colleagues&#x27; 2016 paper aims to differentiate between innate phototropism behavior and learned behaviors. Plants use light cues in various ways, such as to sustain their metabolic needs and to maintain their internal circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms in plants are modulated by endogenous bioactive substances that encourage leaf-opening and leaf-closing and are the basis of nyctinastic behaviors.

Gagliano and colleagues constructed a classical conditioning test in which pea seedlings were divided into two experimental categories and placed in Y-shaped tubes. In a series of training sessions, the plants were exposed to light coming down different arms of the tube. In each case, there was a fan blowing lightly down the tube in either the same or opposite arm as the light. The unconditioned stimulus (US) was the predicted occurrence of light and the conditioned stimulus (CS) was the wind blowing by the fan. Previous experimentation shows that plants respond to light by bending and growing towards it through differential cell growth and division on one side of the plant stem mediated by auxin signaling pathways.

During the testing phase of Gagliano&#x27;s experiment, the pea seedlings were placed in different Y-pipes and exposed to the fan alone. Their direction of growth was subsequently recorded. The &#x27;correct&#x27; response by the seedlings was deemed to be growing into the arm where the light was &quot;predicted&quot; from the previous day. The majority of plants in both experimental conditions grew in a direction consistent with the predicted location of light based on the position of the fan the previous day. For example, if the seedling was trained with the fan and light coming down the same arm of the Y-pipe, the following day the seedling grew towards the fan in the absence of light cues despite the fan being placed in the opposite side of the Y-arm. Plants in the control group showed no preference to a particular arm of the Y-pipe. The percentage difference in population behavior observed between the control and experimental groups is meant to distinguish innate phototropism behavior from active associative learning.

While the physiological mechanism of associative learning in plants is not known, Telewski et al. describes a hypothesis that describes photoreception as the basis of mechano-perception in plants. One mechanism for mechano-perception in plants relies on MS ion channels and calcium channels. Mechanosensory proteins in cell lipid bilayers, known as MS ion channels, are activated once they are physically deformed in response to pressure or tension. Ca2+ permeable ion channels are &quot;stretch-gated&quot; and allow for the influx of osmolytes and calcium, a well-known second messenger, into the cell. This ion influx triggers a passive flow of water into the cell down its osmotic gradient, effectively increasing turgor pressure and causing the cell to depolarize. Gagliano hypothesizes that the basis of associative learning in &quot;Pisum sativum&quot; is the coupling of mechanosensory and photosensory pathways and is mediated by auxin signaling pathways. The result is directional growth to maximize a plant&#x27;s capture of sunlight.

Gagliano et al. published another paper on habituation behaviors in the &quot;mimosa pudica&quot; plant whereby the innate behavior of the plant was diminished by repeated exposure to a stimulus. There has been controversy around this paper and more generally around the topic of plant cognition. Charles Abrahmson, a psychologist and behavioral biologist, says that part of the issue of why scientists disagree about whether plants have the ability to learn is that researchers do not use a consistent definition of &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;cognition&quot;. Similarly, Michael Pollan, an author, and journalist, says in his piece &quot;The Intelligent Plant&quot; that researchers do not doubt Gagliano&#x27;s data but rather her language, specifically her use of the term &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;cognition&quot; with respect to plants. A direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers&#x27; definitions of &quot;cognition&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;.

== Machine learning ==


Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. Most of the Machine Learning models are based on probabilistic theories where each input (e.g. an image ) is associated with a probability to become the desired output.

<text>Charles Lee (January 1, 1758 – June 24, 1815) was an American lawyer and politician from Virginia who served as United States Attorney General from 1795 until 1801, and as United States Secretary of State &quot;ad interim&quot; from May 13, 1800, to June 5, 1800, after serving as prosecutor for the City of Alexandria and serving in the Virginia House of Delegates from Fairfax County.

==Early and family life==
Charles was the third of eleven children born to Henry (1730–1787) and Lucy (Grymes) Lee on his father&#x27;s Leesylvania plantation in Prince William County, Virginia. A member of the First Families of Virginia, his elder brother became General Henry &quot;Light-Horse Harry&quot; Lee. Another lawyer brother became Congressman Richard Bland Lee, and future President Zachary Taylor would be his third cousin. This Lee also handled legal affairs for more distant relatives, including administering the will of Richard Henry Lee, one of whose sons/heirs Ludwell Lee also practiced law in Alexandria.

Lee received a private education suitable to his class, then traveled to Princeton, New Jersey, for studies at the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1775. Lee then read law with Jared Ingersoll in Philadelphia before returning to Virginia.

His father&#x27;s 1787 will appointed Charles as Executor and the guardian of his three siblings under 21 years of age (Edmund, Lucy, Ann). Upon his mother&#x27;s death in 1792, Charles received the Leesylvania plantation.

In 1789, Charles married Anne Lee (December 1, 1770 – September 9, 1804), his second cousin and the daughter of Richard Henry Lee (his first cousin once removed), and they lived at 220 N. Washington Street in Alexandria until 1800, then 407 N. Washington Street until her death (though Charles Lee continued to live there with his brother Edmund and his wife (Anne&#x27;s sister Sara) until a year after his remarriage). The couple had six children: Anne Lucinda Lee (1790–1845), infant son (Arthur) Lee (1791–1791), Richard Henry Lee (February–March 1793), Charles Henry Lee (b. October 1794), William Arthur Lee (September 1796 – 1817), and Alfred Lee (1799–1865). In July 1809, Lee remarried, to Margaret Scott Peyton of Fauquier County (1783–1843). Lee had sold property in Alexandria shortly before that marriage, then sold several lots in Warrenton (the Fauquier County seat) and leased a two-story brick house on Prince Street in Alexandria. Charles and Margaret Lee had four children: Robert Eden Lee (1810–1843), Elizabeth Gordon Lee (1813–1892), Willis Drury Lee (d.1843), and Alexander Lee (1815–1815).

==Career==

After admission to the Virginia bar, Lee practiced law in Alexandria (for much of this time part of the District of Columbia), as did his brothers Richard Bland Lee and Edmund J. Lee, his uncle Arthur Lee (at least technically), and cousin/brother-in-law Ludwell Lee. In addition to his government duties described below Lee had a private legal practice, and one of his clients was George Washington (from 1785 until his appointment as Attorney General as described below in 1795). He also was the Alexandria city prosecutor until resigning that office in 1794, and a local judicial position in 1801. Like his uncle squire Richard Lee, Charles Lee also held appointed positions as (most lucratively) tax collector for the Port of Alexandria (1789–1793), naval officer for the South Potomac (1777–1789), secretary of the Potomac Company (1785), and clerk for the Common Council of Alexandria (1785).

Fairfax County voters thrice elected Lee and Samuel Arell as their two delegates in the Virginia House of Delegates—in 1793, 1794 and 1795 (though Arell died in that final and was replaced by Elisha C. Dick, and both were replaced by Charles Simms and Augustine J. Smith in 1796).

President George Washington appointed Lee the Attorney General after William Bradford died in office. After Senate approval, Lee took office on December 10, 1795, and served until Washington left office. His successor, President John Adams continued Lee in that position for nearly the entire Adams administration (until February 19, 1801). On February 18, 1801, Adams nominated Lee for one of 16 new circuit court judgeships created by the Judiciary Act of 1801 (a judicial reorganization that also reduced the U.S. Supreme Court to five judges and temporarily eliminated circuit riding for justices). Although the Senate confirmed his appointment on March 3, 1801 (along with the &quot;midnight judges&quot; President Adams appointed as his administration ended), that judicial reorganization act was repealed on April 8, 1802 (by the Judiciary Act of 1802).

Both before and during his federal service, Lee lived in Alexandria, which was then part of the capital district. He was elected to the Alexandria City Council in 1794 and re-elected. He advocated returning the southern part of the District of Columbia to Virginia, which finally happened in 1847. In 1804 fellow councilors elected Lee as Alexandria&#x27;s mayor, but he refused to serve, so Dr. Elisha C. Dick was selected instead. The previous year, his brother Edmund J. Lee had served as the council&#x27;s recorder, and would first be elected to represent the third ward in 1805, later became the council&#x27;s president (in 1810) and mayor (in 1815). Lee had inherited Leesylvania plantation from his father, although his mother Lucy was entitled to live there for the rest of her life (which ended in 1792), but to ease financial problems (probably related to investments of or with his brother Light-Horse Harry Lee), Charles Lee mortgaged it to his cousin William Lee, and the residence burned down, so eventually the acreage was also sold.

After his time as Attorney General, in addition to becoming among the most prominent trial lawyers in Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia, Lee became the port officer for the District of the Potomac. As a private attorney Lee represented William Marbury and other &quot;midnight judge&quot; appointees of President Adams in &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, the landmark case against the Jefferson administration for unfulfilled political appointments. Simultaneously, Lee defended Hugh Stuart in &quot;Stuart v. Laird&quot;. Lee also defended former vice president Aaron Burr in his famous treason trial.

Most members of the Lee family operated plantations using enslaved labor. Charles Lee owned two slaves in Alexandria in 1787, and either he or a man of the same common name owned slaves in several Tidewater Virginia counties where his ancestors had plantations.

==Death and legacy==

Charles Lee died on June 24, 1815, in Fauquier County, Virginia, at the age of 57, and is buried in the Warrenton Cemetery in Warrenton.

<text>Hell on Earth is a heavy metal and industrial rock band from Tampa, Florida.

In 1996, the group’s debut album, &quot;Biomechanical Ejaculations Of The Damned&quot; was released. It was followed by tours which showcased their live music and visually stimulating performance art. They made regular guest appearances on regional and national radio shows. 

In 2002, their sophomore album titled &quot;All Things Disturbingly Sassy&quot; was released. The band toured extensively and further developed their legendary concerts. 

In September 2003 lead singer BillY Tourtelot said the band accepted a terminally-ill fan&#x27;s request to die onstage during the band&#x27;s concert scheduled for October 4, 2003 at The State Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida. The intent was to bring attention to physician-assisted suicide on behalf of those who were suffering from terminal illness with the goal that laws could be changed to allow those individuals to have end-of-life choices. Consequently, Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist spun the band’s message and announced that the band would be prosecuted for assisting with suicide. In 2004, the Florida Senate, in response to the band&#x27;s actions, passed a bill barring the &quot;exploitation of self-murder&quot; for &quot;commercial or entertainment purposes,&quot; subsequently signed into law by Governor Bush.

In 2011, their third album, &quot;Demon Alien Angels&quot; was released. 

In 2022, the band’s music video, &quot;For The Good Of The Hole&quot; was released. It is also the first single from their forthcoming album.
