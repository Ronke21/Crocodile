<text>Audio feedback (also known as acoustic feedback, simply as feedback) is a positive feedback situation that may occur when an acoustic path exists between an audio output (for example, a loudspeaker) and its audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting howl is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. The principles of audio feedback were first discovered by Danish scientist Søren Absalon Larsen, hence it is also known as the Larsen effect.

Feedback is almost always considered undesirable when it occurs with a singer&#x27;s or public speaker&#x27;s microphone at an event using a sound reinforcement system or PA system. Audio engineers typically use directional microphones with cardioid pickup patterns and various electronic devices, such as equalizers and, since the 1990s, automatic feedback suppressors, to prevent feedback, which detracts from the audience&#x27;s enjoyment of the event and may damage equipment or hearing.

Since the 1960s, electric guitar players in rock music bands using loud guitar amplifiers, speaker cabinets and distortion effects have intentionally created guitar feedback to create different sounds including long sustained tones that cannot be produced using standard playing techniques. The sound of guitar feedback is considered to be a desirable musical effect in heavy metal music, hardcore punk and grunge. Jimi Hendrix was an innovator in the intentional use of guitar feedback in his guitar solos to create unique musical sounds.

==History and theory==
The conditions for feedback follow the Barkhausen stability criterion, namely that, with sufficiently high gain, a stable oscillation can (and usually will) occur in a feedback loop whose frequency is such that the phase delay is an integer multiple of 360 degrees and the gain at that frequency is equal to 1. If the small-signal gain is greater than 1 for some frequency then the system will start to oscillate at that frequency because noise at that frequency will be amplified. Sound will be produced without anyone actually playing. The sound level will increase until the output starts clipping, reducing the loop gain to exactly unity. This is the principle upon which electronic oscillators are based; in that case, although the feedback loop is purely electronic, the principle is the same. If the gain is large but slightly less than 1, then ringing will be introduced, but only when at least some input sound is already being sent through the system.

Early academic work on acoustical feedback was done by Dr. C. Paul Boner. Boner was responsible for establishing basic theories of acoustic feedback, room-ring modes, and room-sound system equalizing techniques. Boner reasoned that when feedback happened, it did so at one precise frequency. He also reasoned that it could be stopped by inserting a very narrow notch filter at that frequency in the loudspeaker&#x27;s signal chain. He worked with Gifford White, founder of White Instruments to hand craft notch filters for specific feedback frequencies in specific rooms.

===Distance===
To maximize gain before feedback, the amount of sound energy that is fed back to the microphones must be reduced as much as is practical. As sound pressure falls off with 1/r with respect to the distance r in free space, or up to a distance known as reverberation distance in closed spaces (and the energy density with 1/r²), it is important to keep the microphones at a large enough distance from the speaker systems. As well, microphones should not be positioned in front of speakers and individuals using mics should be asked to avoid pointing the microphone at speaker enclosures.

===Directivity===
Additionally, the loudspeakers and microphones should have non-uniform directivity and should stay out of the maximum sensitivity of each other, ideally in a direction of cancellation. Public address speakers often achieve directivity in the mid and treble region (and good efficiency) via horn systems. Sometimes the woofers have a cardioid characteristic.

Professional setups circumvent feedback by placing the main speakers away from the band or artist, and then having several smaller speakers known as &quot;monitors&quot; pointing back at each band member, but in the opposite direction to that in which the microphones are pointing taking advantage of microphones with a cardioid pickup pattern which are common in sound reinforcement applications. This configuration reduces the opportunities for feedback and allows independent control of the sound pressure levels for the audience and the performers.

===Frequency response===
Almost always, the natural frequency response of a sound reinforcement systems is not ideally flat as this leads to acoustical feedback at the frequency with the highest loop gain, which may be a resonance with much higher than the average gain over all frequencies. It is therefore helpful to apply some form of equalization to reduce the gain at this frequency.

Feedback can be reduced manually by ringing out a sound system prior to a performance. The sound engineer can increase the level of a microphone until feedback occurs. The engineer can then attenuate the relevant frequency on an equalizer preventing feedback at that frequency but allowing sufficient volume at other frequencies. Many professional sound engineers can identify feedback frequencies by ear but others use a real-time analyzer to identify the ringing frequency.

To avoid feedback, automatic feedback suppressor can be used. Some of these work by shifting the frequency slightly, with this upshift resulting in a &quot;chirp&quot;-sound instead of a howling sound of unaddressed feedback. Other devices use sharp notch filters to filter out offending frequencies. Adaptive algorithms are often used to automatically tune these notch filters.

==Deliberate uses==

To intentionally create feedback, an electric guitar player needs a guitar amplifier with very high gain (amplification) or the guitar brought near the speaker. The guitarist then allows the strings to vibrate freely and brings the guitar close to the loudspeaker of the guitar amp. The use of distortion effects units adds additional gain and facilitates the creation of intentional feedback.

===Early examples in popular music===
A deliberate use of acoustic feedback was pioneered by blues and rock and roll guitarists such as Willie Johnson, Johnny Watson and Link Wray. According to AllMusic&#x27;s Richie Unterberger, the very first use of feedback on a commercial rock record is the introduction of the song &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; by the Beatles, recorded in 1964. Jay Hodgson agrees that this feedback created by John Lennon leaning a semi-acoustic guitar against an amplifier was the first chart-topper to showcase feedback distortion. The Who&#x27;s 1965 hits &quot;Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; featured feedback manipulation by Pete Townshend, with an extended solo in the former and the shaking of his guitar in front of the amplifier to create a throbbing noise in the latter. Canned Heat&#x27;s &quot;Fried Hockey Boogie&quot; also featured guitar feedback produced by Henry Vestine during his solo to create a highly amplified distorted boogie style of feedback. In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feed back.

Feedback was used extensively after 1965 by the Monks, Jefferson Airplane, the Velvet Underground and the Grateful Dead, who included in many of their live shows a segment named &quot;Feedback&quot;, a several-minute long feedback-driven improvisation. Feedback has since become a striking characteristic of rock music, as electric guitar players such as Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Dave Davies, Steve Marriott and Jimi Hendrix deliberately induced feedback by holding their guitars close to the amplifier&#x27;s speaker. An example of feedback can be heard on Hendrix&#x27;s performance of &quot;Can You See Me?&quot; at the Monterey Pop Festival. The entire guitar solo was created using amplifier feedback. Jazz guitarist Gábor Szabó was one of the earliest jazz musicians to use controlled feedback in his music, which is prominent on his live album &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; (1967). Szabó&#x27;s method included the use of a flat-top acoustic guitar with a magnetic pickup. Lou Reed created his album &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; (1975) entirely from loops of feedback played at various speeds.

===Introductions, transitions, and fade-outs===
In addition to &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, feedback was used on the introduction to songs including Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;, Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot;, David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Little Wonder&quot;, the Strokes&#x27;s &quot;New York City Cops&quot;, Ben Folds Five&#x27;s &quot;Fair&quot;, Midnight Juggernauts&#x27;s &quot;Road to Recovery&quot;, Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot;, the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s &quot;Tumbledown&quot; and &quot;Catchfire&quot;, the Stone Roses&#x27;s &quot;Waterfall&quot;, Porno for Pyros&#x27;s &quot;Tahitian Moon&quot;, Tool&#x27;s &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, and the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Prayer For Rain&quot;. Examples of feedback combined with a quick volume swell used as a transition include Weezer&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot; and &quot;Say It Ain&#x27;t So&quot;; The Strokes&#x27; &quot;Reptilia&quot;, &quot;New York City Cops&quot;, and &quot;Juicebox&quot;; Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;As I Am&quot;; as well as numerous tracks by Meshuggah and Tool.

Cacophonous feedback fade-outs ending a song are most often used to generate rather than relieve tension, often cross-faded too after a thematic and musical release. Examples include Modwheelmood&#x27;s remix of Nine Inch Nail&#x27;s &quot;The Great Destroyer&quot;; and the Jesus and Mary Chain&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Lust&quot;, &quot;Tumbledown&quot;, &quot;Catchfire&quot;, &quot;Sundown&quot;, and &quot;Frequency&quot;.

===Examples in modern classical music===
Though closed circuit feedback was a prominent feature in many early experimental electronic music compositions, intentional acoustic feedback as sound material gained more prominence with compositions such as John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Variations II&quot; (1961) performed by David Tudor and Robert Ashley&#x27;s &quot;The Wolfman&quot; (1964). Steve Reich makes extensive use of audio feedback in his work &quot;Pendulum Music&quot; (1968) by swinging a series of microphones back and forth in front of their corresponding amplifiers. Hugh Davies and Alvin Lucier both use feedback in their works. Roland Kayn based much of his compositional oeuvre, which he termed &quot;cybernetic music,&quot; on audio systems incorporating feedback. More recent examples can be found in the work of, for example, Lara Stanic, Paul Craenen, Anne Wellmer, Adam Basanta, Lesley Flanigan, Ronald Boersen, Erfan Abdi. and Tyler Quinn 

===Pitched feedback===
Pitched melodies may be created entirely from feedback by changing the angle between a guitar and amplifier after establishing a feedback loop. Examples include Tool&#x27;s &quot;Jambi&quot;, Robert Fripp&#x27;s guitar on David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot; (album version), and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; and his live performance of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; at the Monterey Pop Festival.

Regarding Fripp&#x27;s work on &quot;Heroes&quot;:
===Contemporary uses===
Audio feedback became a signature feature of many underground rock bands during the 1980s. American noise-rockers Sonic Youth melded the rock-feedback tradition with a compositional and classical approach (notably covering Reich&#x27;s &quot;Pendulum Music&quot;), and guitarist/producer Steve Albini&#x27;s group Big Black also worked controlled feedback into the makeup of their songs. With the alternative rock movement of the 1990s, feedback again saw a surge in popular usage by suddenly mainstream acts like Nirvana, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and the Smashing Pumpkins. The use of the &quot;no-input-mixer&quot; method for sound generation by feeding a mixing console back into itself has been adopted in experimental electronic and noise music by practitioners such as Toshimaru Nakamura.
===Devices===

The principle of feedback is used in many guitar sustain devices. Examples include handheld devices like the EBow, built-in guitar pickups that increase the instrument&#x27;s sonic sustain, and sonic transducers mounted on the head of a guitar. Intended closed-circuit feedback can also be created by an effects unit, such as a delay pedal or effect fed back into a mixing console. The feedback can be controlled by using the fader to determine a volume level. The Boss DF-2 Super Feedbacker and Distortion pedal is an electronic effect unit that helps electric guitarists create feedback effects. The halldorophone is an electro-acoustic string instrument specifically made to work with string based feedback.

<text>Bokn is a municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Haugaland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Føresvik, the only urban area in Bokn. Other villages in Bokn include Arsvågen, Trosnavåg, and Loten. The island municipality is mostly located on the three islands of Ognøya, Vestre Bokn, and Austre Bokn. All three main islands are connected to the mainland via a network of bridges.

The municipality is the 348th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Bokn is the 341st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 868. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 0.3% over the previous ten-year period.

==General information==
The municipality of Bokn (historically spelled &quot;Bukken&quot;) was established in 1849 when it was separated from the large municipality of Skudenes. Initially, Bokn had 1,035 residents. The borders of Bokn have not changed since that time.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the islands of Austre Bokn and Vestre Bokn (). The meaning of the name is uncertain. It is possible that the word was derived from the Old High German word which means &quot;sea mark&quot; or &quot;beacon&quot;, possibly referring to the local mountain that was a navigational mark for boats. Before 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Bukken&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 8 August 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, six plates, one over two over three&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a set of six circles. The set of circles has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue background represents the sea and the set of six circles represent coins, which symbolize the richness from the sea since it is an island municipality and therefore dependent on fishing and sailing. The six circles are set in a triangle to symbolize a cairn, representing the fact that the island was historically used as a sea mark for sailors. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Bokn. It is part of the Haugaland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger.

===Buildings and structures===
There is a tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting at located at .

==Geography==

The island municipality of Bokn is located on the northern side of the Boknafjorden, at the southern end of the Karmsundet strait. The island of Karmøy lies to the west and the mainland of Tysvær is located to the northeast. The island municipality of Kvitsøy lies south of Bokn and the island municipality of Rennesøy lies to the southeast of Bokn.

Bokn is one of the smallest municipalities in Rogaland, consisting of three main islands: Ognøya, Austre Bokn, and Vestre Bokn. There are also some smaller, uninhabited islands surrounding the main islands.

The islands are rugged with many small hills with small lakes in the valleys. The hills are largely covered with heather, but bushes and trees are increasingly competing, especially birch. The highest point is the high Boknafjellet, a small mountain on Vestre Bokn island.

==Transportation==

The three islands of Bokn are now linked via bridges to Tysvær municipality on the mainland. These bridges are part of the European route E39 highway and they are part of the main coastal highway between the cities of Stavanger and Bergen. There is a ferry connection southward across the Boknafjorden to Rennesøy which is connected by road to Stavanger. The planned Rogfast undersea tunnel will directly connect both sides of the Boknafjorden from Stavanger to Bokn, with a planned completion date of 2023.

==Economy==
Apart from a factory producing various tanks made of glassfiber-reinforced plastic (Bokn Plast), there is no industry on the islands other than some fish farming. People have traditionally lived off fishing and farming, but more recently, some work has been in the North Sea petroleum industry. Tourism is likely to play a bigger part in the future.

* Lars Elisæus Vatnaland (1892 in Bokn – 1983), a Norwegian politician and Mayor of Bokn municipality from 1925 to 1934

<text>The Milky Way Adventure Park (Downland Farm) is an amusement park in North Devon. It was named as Devon&#x27;s Large Attraction of the Year by Visit Devon in 2023/24 and as one of the UK&#x27;s best amusement parks by Trip Advisor every year since 2015 in their Travellers Choice Awards. The Milky Way park has over 110,000 sq ft of indoor and outdoor activities.

The Milky Way park has roller coasters, adventure rides, indoor dodgems, bouncing pillows, exhibition of Sci-Fi memorabilia (including &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; costumes), a mini-train, birds of prey displays, archery, and huge indoor soft-play areas for all ages. It also runs a daily programme of shows, with some featuring Merlin from Britain&#x27;s Got Talent.

Its soft-play centre, Little Stars, opened in 2014. It is designed specifically for children aged 0–6 and has areas set aside exclusively for those aged 0–3 and 0-6, including a sensory room for babies.

==History==
On 1 April 1984, changes to European Union milk quotas resulted in the Stanburys&#x27; successful dairy farm and cattle dealing business collapsing almost overnight, through no fault of their own. Trevor and Christine Stanbury made the decision to diversify, and opened the farm to the public three months later on the 1st of July. Over the years, the family have transformed the farm into an all weather adventure park with the addition of various attractions, rides and shows.

In 2007, Trevor Stanbury was awarded a MBE for his services to tourism in southwest England. In 2009, he said he was keen to promote businesses in the area as he felt the most qualified of workers in Devon tended to move away.

In 2015, the park opened The Old Barn, a DIY wedding venue in a converted 17th century barn located on the edge of the site. In 2016, the park was listed by Tripadvisor as one of the ten best amusement parks in Britain.

==Attractions==
The park organises events all year round. These include an annual Santa&#x27;s Grotto. In 2015, the theme park started offering weddings in the ground, complete with rides on dodgems.

The Lynbarn Railway is a narrow-gauge railway inside the park&#x27;s grounds. It is a renovation of the old Lynton and Barnstaple Railway and uses coaches that were previously used in Thorpe Park.
The park also has the cosmic typhoon roller coaster, cosmic caterpillar roller coaster and ziggy&#x27;s blast quest, a unique mix of a dark ride and rollercoaster.

<doc id="176725" wikidata="Q848797" url="?curid=176725" title="The Open Championship">
<text>The Open Championship, often referred to as The Open or the British Open, is the oldest golf tournament in the world, and one of the most prestigious. Founded in 1860, it was originally held annually at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland. Later the venue rotated between a select group of coastal links golf courses in the United Kingdom. It is organised by The R&amp;A.

The Open is one of the four men&#x27;s major golf championships, the others being the Masters Tournament, the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open. Since the PGA Championship moved to May in 2019, the Open has been chronologically the fourth and final major tournament of the year. It is held in mid-July.

It is called The Open because it is in theory &quot;open&quot; to all, i.e. professional and amateur golfers. In practice, the current event is a professional tournament in which a small number of the world&#x27;s leading amateurs also play, by invitation or qualification. The success of the tournament has led to many other open golf tournaments to be introduced around the world. 

The winner is named &quot;the Champion Golfer of the Year&quot;, a title that dates to the first Open in 1860, and receives the Claret Jug, a trophy first awarded in 1872. The reigning champion is American Xander Schauffele, who won the 2024 Open at Royal Troon Golf Club with a score of 275.

==History==
===Early tournament years (1860–1870)===

The first Open Championship was played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland, over three rounds of the twelve-hole links course. In the mid-19th century golf was played mainly by well-off gentlemen, as hand-crafted clubs and balls were expensive. Professionals made a living from playing for bets, caddying, ball and club making, and instruction. Allan Robertson was the most famous of these pros, and was regarded as the undisputed best golfer between 1843 and his death in 1859. James Ogilvie Fairlie of Prestwick Golf Club decided to form a competition in 1860, &quot;to be played for by professional golfers&quot;, and to decide who would succeed Robertson as the &quot;Champion Golfer&quot;. Blackheath (England), Perth, Bruntsfield (Edinburgh), Musselburgh and St Andrews golf clubs were invited to send up to three of their best players known as a &quot;respectable caddie&quot; to represent each of the clubs. The winner received the Challenge Belt, made from red leather with a silver buckle and worth £25, which came about thanks to being donated by the Earl of Eglinton, a man with a keen interest in medieval pageantry (belts were the type of trophy that might have been competed for in archery or jousting).

The first rule of the new golf competition was &quot;The party winning the belt shall always leave the belt with the treasurer of the club until he produces a guarantee to the satisfaction of the above committee that the belt shall be safely kept and laid on the table at the next meeting to compete for it until it becomes the property of the winner by being won three times in succession&quot;. Eight golfers contested the event, with Willie Park, Sr. winning the championship by 2 shots from Old Tom Morris, and he was declared &quot;The Champion Golfer of the Year&quot;.

A year later, it became &quot;open&quot; to amateurs as well as professionals. Ten professionals and eight amateurs contested the event, with Old Tom Morris winning the championship by 4 shots from Willie Park, Sr. A prize fund (£10) was introduced in 1863 split between 2nd, 3rd and 4th (the winner only received the Challenge Belt). From 1864 onwards a cash prize was also paid to the winner. Before this the only financial incentive was scheduling Prestwick&#x27;s own domestic tournament the same week, this allowed professionals to earn a few days&#x27; work caddying for the wealthier gentlemen. Willie Park, Sr. went on to win two more tournaments, and Old Tom Morris three more, before Young Tom Morris won three consecutive titles between 1868 and 1870. The rules stated that he was allowed to keep the belt for achieving this feat. Because no trophy was available, the tournament was not held in 1871.

===The introduction of course rotation and the Claret Jug (1872–1889)===
On 11 September 1872 agreement was reached between Prestwick, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club. They decided that each of the three clubs would contribute £10 towards the cost of a new silver trophy, which became known as the Claret Jug, known officially as The Golf Champion Trophy, and hosting of the Open would be rotated between the three clubs. These decisions were taken too late for the trophy to be presented to the 1872 Open champion, who was once again Young Tom Morris. Instead, he was awarded with a medal inscribed &#x27;The Golf Champion Trophy&#x27;, although he is the first to be engraved on the Claret Jug as the 1872 winner. Medals have been given to, and kept by the winner ever since. Young Tom Morris died in 1875, aged 24.

The tournament continued to be dominated and won by Scottish professionals, to be rotated between the three Scottish golf courses, and played over 36 holes in a single day until 1889.

===English hosts and winners, and the Great Triumvirate (1890–1914)===
In the 1890s, the tournament was won four times by three Englishman (two of whom were amateurs). In 1892 the tournament was played for the first time at the newly built Muirfield, which replaced Musselburgh as the host venue used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. A few years later St George&#x27;s and Royal Liverpool in England were added to the rotation. From 1892 the tournament was increased in duration to four 18-hole rounds over two days (Prestwick had been extended to an 18-hole course by then).

Between 1898 and 1925 the tournament either had a cut after 36 holes, or a qualifying event, and the largest field was 226 in 1911. The large field meant sometimes the tournament was spread across up to four days. In 1907 Arnaud Massy from France became the first non-British winner. Royal Cinque Ports in England became the 6th different Open host course in 1909.

The pre-war period is most famous for the Great Triumvirate of Harry Vardon (Jersey), John Henry Taylor (England), and James Braid (Scotland). The trio combined to win The Open Championship 16 times in the 21 tournaments held between 1894 and 1914; Vardon won six times (a record that still stands today) with Braid and Taylor winning five apiece. In the five tournaments in this span the Triumvirate did not win, one or more of them finished runner-up. These rivalries enormously increased the public&#x27;s interest in golf, but the First World War meant another Open was not held until 1920, and none of the trio won another Open.

===American success with Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones, and the last Open at Prestwick (1920–1939)===
In 1920 the Open returned, and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club became the sole organiser of the Open Championship. In 1926 they standardised the format of the tournament to spread over three days (18 holes on day 1 and 2, and 36 on day 3), and include both qualifying and a cut.

In 1921 eleven U.S.-based players travelled to Scotland financed by a popular subscription called the &quot;British Open Championship Fund&quot;, after a campaign by the American magazine &quot;Golf Illustrated&quot;. Five of these players were actually British born, and had emigrated to America to take advantage of the high demand for club professionals as the popularity of golf grew. A match was played between the Americans and a team of British professionals, which is seen as a forerunner of the Ryder Cup. When the Open was held two weeks later, one of these visitors, Jock Hutchison, a naturalised American citizen, won in St Andrews, the town of his birth.

In 1922 Walter Hagen won the first of his four Opens, and become the first American-born winner. The period between 1923 and 1933 saw an American-based player win every year (two were British-born), and included three wins by amateur Bobby Jones, and one by Gene Sarazen, who had already won top tournaments in the United States. English players won every year between 1934 and 1939, including two wins by Henry Cotton (he would go on to win a third in 1948).

After overcrowding issues at the 1925 Open at Prestwick, it was decided it was no longer suitable for the growing size of the event, being too short, having too many blind shots, and it could not cope with the volume of spectators. The Open&#x27;s original venue was replaced on the rota with Carnoustie, which hosted for the first time in 1931. Troon hosted for the first time in 1923, and Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes was also added, hosting for the first time in 1926. Prince&#x27;s hosted its one and only Open in 1932.

===Bobby Locke, Peter Thomson, and Ben Hogan&#x27;s Triple Crown (1946–1958)===
The Open returned after the Second World War to St Andrews, with a victory for American Sam Snead. Bobby Locke became the first South African winner, winning three times in four years between 1949 and 1952, and later winning a fourth title in 1957. Having already won the Masters and the U.S. Open earlier in the year, Ben Hogan won in his one and only Open appearance in 1953 to win the &quot;Triple Crown&quot;. His achievement was so well regarded he returned to New York City to a ticker-tape parade. Peter Thomson became the first Australian winner, winning four times in five years between 1954 and 1958, and later winning a fifth title in 1965. After flooding prevented Royal Cinque Ports from hosting, both in 1938 and 1949, it was removed from the rota. The Open was played outside of England and Scotland for the first time in 1951 at Royal Portrush, Northern Ireland.

The period saw fewer American entrants, as the PGA Tour had grown to be quite lucrative, and the PGA Championship was often played at the same or similar time paying triple the prize money. A larger golf ball was also used in America, which meant they had to adjust for the Open.

===Player, Palmer, Nicklaus – The Big Three (1959–1974)===
In 1959, Gary Player, a young South African, won the first of his three Opens. Only four Americans had entered, but in 1960 Arnold Palmer travelled to Scotland after winning the Masters and U.S. Open, in an attempt to emulate Hogan&#x27;s 1953 feat of winning all three tournaments in a single year. Although he finished second to Kel Nagle, he returned and won the Open in 1961 and 1962. Palmer was hugely popular in America, and his victories are likely to have been the first time many Americans would have seen the Open on television. This, along with the growth of trans-Atlantic jet travel, inspired many more Americans to travel in the future.

The period is primarily defined by the competition between Player, Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus won three times (1966, 1970, 1978) and had a record seven runner-ups. American Lee Trevino also made his mark winning his two Opens back to back in 1971 and 1972, the latter denying Nicklaus a calendar year Grand Slam. The only British champion in this period was Tony Jacklin, and it is also notable for having the first winner from Argentina, Roberto De Vicenzo.

===Watson, Ballesteros, Faldo, and Norman (1975–1993)===
By 1975, the concept of the modern majors had been firmly established, and the PGA Championship had been moved to August since 1969, so no longer clashed with the Open. This meant the Open had a feel similar to the current tournament, with the leaders after 36 holes going off last (1957 onwards), all players having to use the &quot;bigger ball&quot; (1974 onwards), play spread over four days (1966 onwards, although the days were Wednesday to Saturday until 1980), and a field containing all the world&#x27;s best players.

American Tom Watson won in 1975. Turnberry hosted for the first time in 1977, and Watson won the Open for the second time, after one of the most celebrated contests in golf history, when his duel with Jack Nicklaus went to the final shot before Watson emerged as the champion. He would go on to win again in 1980, 1982 and 1983, to win 5 times overall, a record only bettered by Harry Vardon, and he became regarded as one of the greatest links golf players of all time.

In 1976, 19-year-old Spaniard Seve Ballesteros gained attention in the golfing world when he finished second. He would go on to win three Opens (1979, 1984, 1988), and was the first continental European to win since Arnaud Massy in 1907. Other multiple winners in this period were Englishman Nick Faldo with three (1987, 1990, 1992), and Australian Greg Norman with two (1986, 1993).
===Tiger Woods and the modern era (1994 onwards)===
Every year between 1994 and 2004 had a first-time winner. In 1999, the Open at Carnoustie was famously difficult, and Frenchman Jean van de Velde had a three-shot lead teeing off on the final hole. He ended up triple bogeying after finding the Barry Burn, and Scotman Paul Lawrie, ranked 241st in the world, ended up winning in a playoff. He was 10 strokes behind the leader going into the final round, a record for all majors. He was not the only unheralded champion during this span, as 396th-ranked Ben Curtis and 56th-ranked Todd Hamilton won in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

In 2000, Tiger Woods, having just won the U.S. Open, became champion by a post-war record 8 strokes to become the youngest player to win the career Grand Slam at age 24. After winning the 2002 Masters and U.S. Open, he became the latest American to try to emulate Ben Hogan and win the Open in the same year. His bid came to a halt on Saturday with the worst round of his career up to that time, an 81 (+10) in cold, gusty rain. He went on to win again back-to-back in 2005 and 2006 to bring his total to three wins. Other multiple winners in this era are South African Ernie Els (2002, 2012) and Irishman Pádraig Harrington (2007, 2008).
In 2009, 59-year-old Tom Watson led the tournament through 71 holes and needed just a par on the last hole to become the oldest ever winner of a major championship, and also match Harry Vardon&#x27;s six Opens. Watson bogeyed, setting up a four-hole playoff, which he lost to Stewart Cink. In 2015, Jordan Spieth became another American to arrive having already won the year&#x27;s Masters and U.S. Open tournaments. He finished tied for fourth as Zach Johnson became champion. Spieth would go on to win the 2017 Open at Royal Birkdale.

American Phil Mickelson won his first Open, and fifth major, in 2013. In 2016, he was involved in an epic duel with Sweden&#x27;s Henrik Stenson, which many people compared to the 1977 Duel in the Sun between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. Stenson emerged the winner, and the first Scandinavian winner of a male professional major championship, with a record Open (and major) score of 264 (−20), three shots ahead of Mickelson, and 14 shots ahead of third place. Jack Nicklaus shared his thoughts on the final round, saying: &quot;Phil Mickelson played one of the best rounds I have ever seen played in the Open and Henrik Stenson just played better—he played one of the greatest rounds I have ever seen&quot;.

Francesco Molinari won the 2018 Open at Carnoustie by two shots, to become the first Italian major winner. Shane Lowry won the 2019 Open when the tournament returned to Royal Portrush Golf Club, to become the second champion from the Republic of Ireland.

In 2020, the Open Championship was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time the championship had been cancelled since World War II. The R&amp;A also confirmed that Royal St George&#x27;s, which would have hosted the championship in 2020, would be the host venue in 2021, effectively retaining the Old Course at St Andrews as the venue for the 150th Open.

==Traditions==
===Links golf course===
The Open is always played on a coastal links golf course. Links golf is often described as the &quot;purest&quot; form of golf and keeps a connection with the way the game originated in Scotland in the 15th century. The terrain is open, often without any trees, and will generally be undulating with a sandy base. The golf courses are often primarily shaped by nature, rather than &#x27;built&#x27;. Weather, particularly wind, plays an important role, and although there will be a prevailing onshore breeze, changes in the wind direction and strength over the course of the tournament can mean each round of golf has to be played slightly differently. The courses are also famous for deep pot bunkers, and gorse bushes that make up the &quot;rough&quot;. A golfer playing on a links course will often adapt his game so the flight of the ball is lower and so is less impacted by the wind, but this will make distance control more difficult. Also due to the windy conditions the speed of the greens are often slower than a golfer might be used to on the PGA Tour, to avoid the ball being moved by a gust.

===Old Course at St Andrews===
The Old Course at St Andrews is regarded as the oldest golf course in the world, and winning the Open there is widely considered to be one of the pinnacles of achievement in golf. Given the special status of the Old Course, the Open is generally played there once every five years in the modern era, much more frequently than the other courses used for the Open. 

Previous champions will often choose St Andrews as their final Open tournament. It has become traditional to come down the 18th fairway to huge applause from the amphitheatre crowds, and to pose for final pictures on the Swilken Bridge with the picturesque clubhouse and town in the background.

=== Trophy presentation ===

The Open trophy is the Claret Jug, which has been presented to the champion since 1873 (it was first awarded to Young Tom Morris in 1872, however the trophy was not ready in time—his name is the first to be engraved on it). The original trophy permanently resides on display in the R&amp;A&#x27;s Clubhouse at St Andrews. Therefore, the trophy that is presented at each Open is a replica which is retained by the winner for a year. It used to be the responsibility of the winner to get his name engraved on the trophy, but 1967 winner Roberto De Vicenzo returned the trophy without having done so. Subsequently, the winner&#x27;s name is already engraved on it when presented, which often results in television commentators speculating as to when it is safe for the engraver to start. 

The winner of the Open is announced as &quot;The Champion Golfer of the Year&quot;, a title which has been used since the first Open in 1860. He will nearly always pose for photos with the trophy sitting on one of the distinctive pot bunkers. Three-time winner Jack Nicklaus said holding the Claret Jug was like holding &quot;a newborn baby&quot;, and on other players putting champagne or other drinks inside it to celebrate their Open win, he said &quot;I never used the Claret Jug for anything other than what it symbolized – Champion Golfer of the Year.&quot;

==Name==
The first event was held as an invitational tournament, but the next year Prestwick Golf Club declared that &quot;the belt... on all future occasions, shall be open to all the world&quot;. In its early years it was often referred to as The Championship but with the advent of the Amateur Championship in 1885, it became more common to refer to it as The Open Championship or simply The Open. The tournament inspired other national bodies to introduce open golf tournaments of their own, such as the U.S. Open, and later many others. To distinguish it from their own national open, it became common in many countries to refer to the tournament as the &quot;British Open&quot;. The R&amp;A (the tournament&#x27;s organiser) continued to refer to it as The Open Championship. During the interwar years, a period with many U.S.-based winners, the term British Open would occasionally be used during the trophy presentation and in British newspapers.

In 2017, a representative of the R&amp;A openly stated that it is a priority to &quot;eradicate the term British Open&quot; and have a single identity and brand of &quot;The Open&quot; in all countries. Tournament partners, such as the PGA Tour, now refer to it without &quot;British&quot; in the title, media rightsholders are contractually required to refer to the event as The Open Championship, and the official website has released a statement titled &quot;Why it&#x27;s called &#x27;The Open&#x27; and not the &#x27;British Open&#x27;&quot; stating that &quot;The Open is the correct name for the Championship. It is also the most appropriate&quot;. The R&amp;A&#x27;s stance has attracted criticism from some commentators.

The R&amp;A also run The Senior Open, the over 50s equivalent of the Open, which was officially known as the &quot;Senior British Open&quot; from its inception in 1987 until 2007, when &quot;British&quot; was dropped from the name. The Women&#x27;s Open, seen by some as the women&#x27;s equivalent to the Open (although unlike the Open it is not always held on a links course, and was not run by the R&amp;A until 2017) was officially known as the &quot;Women&#x27;s British Open&quot; from its inception in 1976 until 2020, when the word &quot;British&quot; was dropped from the name as part of a sponsorship deal with AIG.

== Status ==
The Open is recognised as one of the four major championships in golf, and is an official event on the PGA Tour, European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour.

The Open began in 1860, and for many years it was not the most-followed event in golf, as challenge matches between top golfers were more keenly followed and drew larger crowds. The Great Triumvirate dominated the Open between 1894 and 1914 and were primarily responsible for the formation of the PGA in 1901 which had a big impact in promoting interest in professional golf (and therefore The Open) and increasing playing standards. Between the World Wars, the first wins by Americans were widely celebrated when they broke the dominance previously held by British players. After World War II, although the profile of the tournament remained high in the UK and Commonwealth countries, the low prize money compared to the US events and the cost of travel meant fewer Americans participated. High-profile visits and wins by Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer, the growth of cheaper and faster transatlantic flights, and the introduction of television coverage recovered its prestige.

When the modern concept of the majors was cemented, the Open was included as one of those four. Thus, the Open is now one of the four majors in golf, along with the U.S. Open, PGA Championship, and Masters Tournament. The term &quot;major&quot; is a universally-acknowledged unofficial term used by players, the media, and golf followers to define the most important tournaments, and performance in them is often used to define the careers of the best golfers. There is often discussion amongst the golfing community as to whether the Open, U.S. Open, or the Masters Tournament is the most prestigious major, but opinion varies (often linked to nationality). The PGA Championship is usually seen as the least prestigious of the four.

In terms of official recognition, the tournament has been an event on the European Tour since its formation in 1972. In 1995, prize money won in the Open was included in the PGA Tour official money list for the first time, a change that caused an increase in the number of American entries. In addition all previous PGA Tour seasons have been retroactively adjusted to include the Open in official money and win statistics. Currently the Open, along with the other three majors and The Players Championship, are the top-tier tournaments in the PGA Tour&#x27;s FedEx Cup, offering more points than any other non-playoff event. The Open is also an official event on the Japan Golf Tour.

==Structure==
===Qualifying===

Qualifying was introduced in 1907, and for much of its history, all players had to go through the qualification process. In the modern era, the majority of players get an exemption from qualification which is awarded for previous performance in the Open, performance in high-profile global tournaments (such as other majors), performance in top golf tours, or a high position in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR). Five amateurs are also exempt from qualifying by winning various global amateur titles provided they maintain their amateur status prior to The Open.

Another way of qualifying is to finish in a high position in the Open Qualifying Series of global events, which are about twelve tour events across the globe, run by various local golfing organisations.

Any male professional golfer, male amateur golfer whose playing handicap does not exceed 0.4 (i.e. scratch) or has been within World Amateur Golf Ranking listing 1–2,000 during the current calendar year, and any female golfer who finished in the top 5 and ties in the latest edition of any of the five women&#x27;s majors is eligible to enter local qualifying. If they perform well they will go on to Final Qualifying, which is four simultaneous 36-hole one-day events held across the UK, with 12 players qualifying for the Open. If there are any spots left, then alternates are made up from the highest ranked players in the OWGR who are not already qualified, which brings the total field up to 156 players.

In 2018, the OWGR gave the Open a strength of field rating of 902 (the maximum possible is 1000 if the top 200 players in the world were all in a tournament). This was only bettered by the PGA Championship, a tournament which actively targets a high strength of field rating.

===Format===

Field: 156 players

Basic Format: 72 hole stroke play. Play 18 holes a day over four days, weather permitting.

Date of Tournament: starts on the day before the third Friday in July.

Tournament Days: Thursday to Sunday.

Tee off times: each player has one morning and one afternoon tee time in first two days in groups of three, which are mostly randomised (with some organiser discretion). Groupings of two on the last two days with last place going off first and leaders going out last.

Cut: after 36 holes, only top 70 and ties play the final 36 holes.

Playoff: if there is a tie for the lead after 72 holes, a three-hole aggregate playoff is held; followed by sudden death if the lead is still tied.

==Prizes==
Up until 2016, the purse was always stated, and paid, in pounds sterling (£), but was changed in 2017 to US dollars ($) in recognition of the fact that it is the most widely adopted currency for prize money in golf.

===Champion&#x27;s prizes and benefits===
The champion receives trophies, the winner&#x27;s prize money, and several exemptions from world golf tours and tournaments. He is also likely to receive a winner&#x27;s bonus from his sponsors. The prizes and privileges on offer for the champion included:

* The Golf Champion Trophy (commonly known as the Claret Jug). The winner keeps the trophy until the next Open, at which point it must be returned, and a replica is provided as a replacement.
* The winner&#x27;s gold medal (originally awarded in 1872 when the Claret Jug was not yet ready, and since awarded to all champions).
* If the winner is a professional, then the winner&#x27;s share (18%) of the purse.
* Guaranteed entry to all future Open Championships until the age of 55 (60 prior to 2024), and entry to the next ten Opens, even if over the age of 55.
* Entry to the next five editions of the Masters Tournament, PGA Championship, and U.S. Open.
* Five year membership to the PGA Tour and the European Tour.
* Entry to the next edition of the WGC-HSBC Champions.
* Entry to the next five editions of The Players Championship, and the five invitational tournaments (Genesis Invitational, Fort Worth Invitational, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the RBC Heritage, and the Memorial Tournament) on the PGA Tour.
*Automatic invitations to three of the five senior majors once they turn 50; they receive a one-year invitation to the U.S. Senior Open and a lifetime invitation to the Senior PGA Championship and Senior Open Championship.
*FedEx Cup, Race to Dubai, Ryder Cup/Presidents Cup, and Official World Golf Ranking points.

From 1860 to 1870, the winner received the challenge belt. When this was awarded to Young Tom Morris permanently for winning three consecutive tournaments, it was replaced by the gold medal (1872 onwards), and the Claret Jug (1873 onwards).

===Other prizes and benefits, based upon finishing position===

There are several benefits from being placed highly in the Open. These are:

* The runners up each receive a silver salver.
*If the player is a professional, then a share of the purse. There is a distribution curve for those who make the cut, with 1st place getting 18%, 2nd 10.4%, 3rd 6.7%, 4th 5.2%, and 5th 4.2%. The percentage continues to fall by placing with 21st getting 1% and 37th 0.5%. Professionals who miss the cut received between US$7,375 and US$4,950.
* The top 10 players, including ties, get entry to the next edition of The Open Championship.
* The top 4 players, including ties, get entry to the next edition of the Masters Tournament.
*FedEx Cup, Race to Dubai, Ryder Cup/Presidents Cup, and Official World Golf Ranking points.

===Amateur medals===

Since 1949 the leading amateur completing the final round receives a silver medal. Since 1972, any other amateur who competes in the final round receives a bronze medal. Amateurs do not receive prize money.

===Professional Golfers&#x27; Association (of Great Britain and Ireland) awards===
The Professional Golfers&#x27; Association (of Great Britain and Ireland) also mark the achievements of their own members in The Open.

* Ryle Memorial Medal – awarded since 1901 to the winner if he is a PGA member.
* Braid Taylor Memorial Medal – awarded since 1966 to the highest finishing PGA member.
* Tooting Bec Cup – awarded since 1924 to the PGA member who records the lowest single round during the championship.

The Braid Taylor Memorial Medal and the Tooting Bec Cup are restricted to members born in, or with a parent or parents born in, the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland.

==Courses==
The Open Championship has always been held on a coastal links golf course in Scotland, England or Northern Ireland. The hosting pattern has been:&lt;ref name=&quot;List of Winners/Venues&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*1860–1870: Prestwick Golf Club is the sole host.
*1872–1892: three-year rotation among Prestwick, St Andrews, and Musselburgh (replaced by Muirfield in 1892) golf clubs.
*1893–1907: five-year rotation among Prestwick, Royal St George&#x27;s, St Andrews, Muirfield, and Royal Liverpool Golf Clubs.
*1908–1939: six-year rotation, initially among Prestwick, Royal Cinque Ports, St Andrews, Royal St George&#x27;s, Muirfield, and Royal Liverpool Golf Clubs, thus alternating between Scotland and England. A few changes were made to the rota of 6 courses after World War I.
*1946–1972: alternating between Scottish and English golf clubs continues, but without a fixed rota. Exceptions were St Andrews hosting pre- and post-World War II, and Northern Ireland hosting in 1951.
*Since 1973: usually three Scottish and two English courses hosting in a five-year period, mostly alternating between the two countries, with St Andrews hosting about every five years. Northern Ireland returned in 2019.

===Overview===
A total of 14 courses have hosted the Open, with ten currently active as part of the rotation, and four have been retired from the rotation (shown in italics). The year the golf course was originally built is shown in parentheses.

Prestwick Golf Club (1851): Prestwick is The Open&#x27;s original venue, and hosted 24 Opens in all, including the first 12. Old Tom Morris designed the original 12 hole course, but it was subsequently redesigned and expanded to be an 18-hole course in 1882. Serious overcrowding problems at Prestwick in 1925 meant that the course was never again used for the Open, and was replaced by Carnoustie Golf Links as the third Scottish course.

Old Course at St Andrews (1552): considered the oldest golf course in the world, and referred to as &quot;the home of golf&quot;. In 1764, the Society of St Andrews Golfers reduced the course from 22 to 18 holes and created what became the standard round of golf throughout the world. Famous features include the &quot;Hell Bunker&quot; (14th) and the Road Hole (17th). Due to its special status St Andrews usually hosts the Open every five years in the modern era. It is designed to be played in wind, so can result in low scores in benign conditions.

Musselburgh Links (c. 1672): a 9-hole course that hosted six Opens as it was used by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, one of the organisers of The Open between 1872 and 1920. When the Honourable Company built their own course in 1891 (Muirfield), it took over hosting duties. Musselburgh was unhappy with this and organised another rival &#x27;Open&#x27; competition prior to the Muirfield event, one with greater prize money.

Muirfield (1891): built by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers to replace Musselburgh on the rota. Known for the circular arrangement the course has, which means the wind direction on each hole changes, and can make it tricky to navigate. Briefly removed from the rota in 2016–17 due to not having any female members.

Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club (1887): often simply referred to as Sandwich. The first venue to host in England, and the only venue on the current rota in Southern England. It went 32 years without hosting between 1949 and 1981, but returned following the rebuilding of three holes, tee changes to another two holes, and improved road links. Known for having the deepest bunker on the rota (4th hole).

Royal Liverpool Golf Club (1869): often simply referred to as Hoylake. Royal Liverpool went 39 years without hosting between 1967 and 2006, but returned following changes to tees, bunkers, and greens. In 2006, Tiger Woods won by using his driver just once.

Royal Cinque Ports Golf Club (1892): hosted the 1909 and 1920 Opens, and was scheduled to host in 1938 and 1949 but both had to be moved to Royal St George&#x27;s Golf Club due to abnormally high tides flooding the course. It was removed from the rota but is still used for qualifying.

Royal Troon Golf Club (1878): first used in 1923 instead of Muirfield when &quot;some doubts exists as to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers being desirous of their course being used for the event&quot;. Redesigned, lengthened, and strengthened by James Braid shortly before it held its first Open. Famous features include the &quot;Postage Stamp&quot; 8th hole, and the 601 yards 6th.

Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club (1886): a relatively short course, but has 167 bunkers which demand accuracy. Slightly inland as some coastal homes have been built since the course first opened.

Carnoustie Golf Links (1835): replaced Prestwick after it was no longer suitable for the Open. It went through modifications prior to the 1999 Open. Thought of as being the toughest of the Open venues, especially the last three holes, and is well remembered for Jean van de Velde triple bogeying on the 18th when he only needed a double bogey to win. 

Prince&#x27;s Golf Club (1906): only hosted once in 1932. Has been redesigned in 1950 due to war damage.

Royal Portrush Golf Club (1888): the only venue to host the Open outside England and Scotland when it hosted in 1951. With the Troubles in Northern Ireland significantly diminished since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and after the successful hosting of the Irish Open it returned as host in 2019. The course underwent significant changes before the 2019 Open, including replacing the 17th and 18th holes, which also provided the space for spectators and corporate hospitality that a modern major requires.

Royal Birkdale Golf Club (1894): extensively redesigned by Fred Hawtree and JH Taylor to create the current layout in 1922, it is known for its sand dunes towering the fairways. Often ranked as England&#x27;s best Open venue.

Turnberry (1906): made its Open debut in 1977, when Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus famously played the Duel in the Sun. Known to be one of the most picturesque Open venues, it was bought by Donald Trump in 2014, who has spent substantial amounts renovating the course. On 11 January 2021, in the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack the week prior, the R&amp;A announced that it will not stage a championship at Turnberry &quot;in the foreseeable future&quot;.

==Silver Medal winners==
Since 1949, the silver medal is awarded to the leading amateur, provided that the player completes all 72 holes. In the earlier years wealthy individuals would often maintain their amateur status, and hence could win multiple times, such as Frank Stranahan who won it four times in the first five years (and was also the low amateur in 1947). In the modern era players often turn professional soon after winning the silver medal, and hence never have a chance for multiple wins. Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only silver medal winners who have gone on to win the Open.

==Broadcasting==

The distribution of The Open is provided by a partnership between R&amp;A Productions, European Tour Productions (both run by IMG) and CTV Outside Broadcasting. The broadcasters with onsite production are Sky (UK), NBC (USA), BBC (UK), and TV Asahi (Japan).

Many non-British broadcasters referred to the Open as the &quot;British&quot; Open in their coverage until 2010, when The R&amp;A introduced use of contractual terms in their media contracts, similar to the Masters, and now rights holders are obliged to refer to the tournament as &quot;The Open&quot;. On 7 November 2018, the parent company of the U.S. rights holder, NBC, completed a takeover of the U.K. rights holder, Sky. This means the media rights in the two primary markets are owned by the same company, albeit produced separately by two different subsidiaries. There are over 170 cameras on site during the tournament, including cameras in the face of the Open&#x27;s pot bunkers.

Ivor Robson was the announcer for 41 years; he died in October 2023.

===United Kingdom===
The BBC first started to broadcast the Open in 1955, with Peter Alliss involved since 1961, and having the role of lead commentator since 1978. With the growth of pay television, and the increasing value of sporting rights, the BBC&#x27;s golf portfolio began to reduce. The loss of the rights to the Scottish Open, and BMW PGA Championship in 2012 left the BBC&#x27;s only golf coverage as the Open, and the final two days of the Masters (which it shared with Sky). With so little golf, the BBC was accused of neglecting investment in production and was criticised about its &#x27;quality of coverage and innovation&#x27; compared to Sky, which held the rights to most golf events. The tournament is considered a Category B event under the Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events, which allows its rights to be held by a pay television broadcaster as long as sufficient secondary coverage is provided by a free-to-air broadcaster.

Many were hoping that a deal similar to the Masters would be reached, where Sky had coverage of all four days, and the BBC also provided live weekend coverage, but Sky were not keen on this and won the full rights in 2015. Some were angered about the demise of golf on terrestrial television, and the impact that could have on the interest in golf in the U.K., whilst others were pleased about the perceived improved coverage that Sky would give. Despite Peter Alliss promising on air that the BBC would cover the 2016 event, the BBC reached a deal for Sky to take the coverage. The BBC still covers the tournament, showing highlights from 8pm–10pm on tournament days and radio coverage on Radio 5 Live. The deal with Sky required the broadcaster to restrict its advertisement breaks to 4 minutes every hour, similar to the Masters. Sky also offers complete coverage online through NOW to non-subscribers, which is £7.99 for one day, or £12.99 for a weeks access.

====Timeline of U.K. broadcasting rights====

===United States===
ABC began broadcasting the Open in 1962, with taped highlights on Wide World of Sports. In the pre-digital age the coverage had to be converted from the U.K.&#x27;s PAL colour encoding system, to the U.S.&#x27;s NTSC, which meant picture quality could be impacted, especially in the early years. The coverage expanded over the years, and as is common in America, there was a different early round rights holder, which was ESPN until 2003 when TNT took over. Co-owned ESPN became responsible for ABC&#x27;s sports coverage in 2006; it won the rights to cover all four days of the championship in 2010, and concurrently moved coverage to its channels. The Open became the first golf major to be covered exclusively on pay television in America, as ESPN left only highlights for its partner broadcast network.

After losing the rights to the U.S. Open in 2015, NBC bid aggressively to win the rights to the Open, and become a broadcaster of a golf major again. NBC also had a track record of broadcasting European sporting events successfully in the morning U.S. time with the Premier League, Formula One, and &quot;Breakfast at Wimbledon&quot;, and was able to place early round coverage on its subsidiary Golf Channel. NBC won the rights from 2017 to 2028. ESPN also sold them the rights for 2016.

The 2019 edition of the Open Championship had a total of 49 hours of coverage in the United States, with 29 hours being on Thursday and Friday, and 20 hours being on Saturday and Sunday; the Golf Channel cable network had a total of 34 hours of coverage, with 29 hours on Thursday and Friday, and 5 hours on Saturday and Sunday. The NBC broadcast network had a total of 15 hours of coverage on the weekend, with 8 hours Saturday, and 7 hours Sunday. The 49 total hours of coverage on Golf Channel and NBC is down 30 minutes from 2018; the difference is that NBC&#x27;s Sunday coverage is down 30 minutes, from 7.5 hours in 2018, to 7 hours in 2019.

====Timeline of U.S. broadcasting rights====

=== TheOpen.com ===
The Open provides limited coverage for free on its website including highlights, featured groups, featured holes, and radio coverage. The Open&#x27;s local rights holders usually provide these feeds as part of their broadcast package.

=== Rest of the world ===
The Open produces a &#x27;world feed&#x27; for use by international broadcasters if they require. The other large golf markets in a similar time zone as the U.K. are the rest of Europe (where Sky, the U.K. broadcast company often has a presence), and South Africa where it is covered by SuperSport.

Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and increasingly China are markets with high media interest in golf and the Open, but the time zone means the prime coverage is shown in the early hours of the morning.

<doc id="176730" wikidata="Q4751662" url="?curid=176730" title="Anarchists (film)">
<text>Anarchists is a 2000 South Korean action film directed by Yoo Young-sik and co-written by Park Chan-wook. Set in Shanghai in 1924, the film is about the Heroic Corps: a covert cell of insurrectionist anarchists who attempt to overthrow the Japanese government&#x27;s occupation of Korea through propaganda of the deed. Told from the perspective of the youngest member, Sang-gu, years after the fact, the story is a sympathetic look at a group of revolutionaries through the eyes of one of their own.

==Plot==
In the opening scene the protagonist begins to reminisce about his youth and remembers the day he was saved from execution in a raid performed by the anarchist cell he would later join. After reaching a safe house the group begins to teach him the tricks of their trade. He later takes part in several missions, though he continues to have difficulty throughout the film with the violence of his new job.

Eventually a string of tragic events strike the team. One of their members is fatally betrayed during a mission, leading to their covers being blown during the next. Now wanted by the Japanese and Chinese authorities, their funders turn away from them and instead choose to support socialist electoral politics to further their cause. This angers the group, and they leave the larger organization, attempting to survive on their own by earning money through gambling and bank robbery. Over time the group becomes agitated with simply scraping by and several voice a desire to return to their old ways of clandestine warfare. They collectively decide to strike at the Japanese government in a high-profile attack, leading up to a dramatic finale.

==Production notes and historical significance==
&quot;Anarchists&quot; was the first Korean and Chinese co-production in the history of Korean cinema. The project was put together through the efforts of the Korean Film Commission and the international exchange division of the city of Busan, using connections they had been developing in Shanghai. The film was shot entirely in China over a period of three months in Shanghai and in towns nearby, with a budget of US$3,000,000. For &quot;Anarchists&quot;, the production team worked with a Chinese-based A-level staff who participated in the production of Chen Kaige&#x27;s &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; and &quot;Temptress Moon&quot;. The actors and the core production staff came from Korea, while the production design, elaborate sets, supporting talent and hundreds of extras were supplied by the Shanghai Film Studio.

The film was co-winner of the audience choice award at the 2001 Cinequest Film Festival.

<doc id="176732" wikidata="Q39401" url="?curid=176732" title="Scent hound">
<text>Scent hounds (or scenthounds) are a type of hound that primarily hunts by scent rather than sight. These breeds are hunting dogs and are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among dogs. Scent hounds specialize in following scent or smells. Most of them tend to have long, drooping ears and large nasal cavities to enhance smell sensitivity. They need to have relatively high endurance to be able to keep track of scent over long distances and rough terrain. It is believed that they were first bred by the Celts by crossbreeding mastiff-type dogs with sighthounds. The first established scent hounds were St. Hubert Hounds (the ancestor of today&#x27;s bloodhounds) bred by monks in Belgium during the Middle Ages.

== Description ==
Hounds are hunting dogs that hunt either by following the scent of a game animal (&quot;scent hounds&quot;) or by following the animal by sight (&quot;sighthounds&quot;). There are many breeds in the &quot;scent hound type&quot;, and scent hounds may do other work as well, so exactly which breeds should be called &quot;scent hound&quot; can be controversial. Kennel clubs assign breeds of dogs to &quot;groups&quot;, which are loosely based on breed &quot;types&quot;. Each kennel club determines which breeds it will place in a given group.

Scent hounds specialize in following a smell or scent. Most of these breeds have long, drooping ears. One theory says that this trait helps to collect scent from the air and keep it near the dog&#x27;s face and nose. They also have large nasal cavities, which helps them scent better. Their typically loose, moist lips are said to assist in trapping scent particles.

Because scent hounds tend to walk or run with their noses to the ground, many scent hound breeds have been developed such that the dog will hold their tail upright when on a scent. In addition, some breeds (e.g., beagle) have been bred to have white hair on the tips of their tails. These traits allow the dog&#x27;s master to identify it at a distance or in longer grass.

Scent hounds do not need to be as fast as sighthounds, because they do not need to keep prey in sight, but they need endurance so they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is several days old. Most scent hounds are used for hunting in packs of multiple dogs. Longer-legged hounds run more quickly and usually require that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-legged hounds allow hunters to follow on foot. Hunting with some breeds, such as German Bracke, American Foxhounds, or coonhounds, involves allowing the pack of dogs to run freely while the hunters wait in a fixed spot until the dogs&#x27; baying announces that the game has been &quot;treed&quot;. The hunters then go to the spot on foot, following the sound of the dogs&#x27; baying.

==Vocalization==
Most scent hounds have a range of vocalizations, which can vary depending upon the situation the dog finds itself in. Their baying voice—most often used when excited and useful in informing their master that they are following a scent trail—is deep and booming and can be distinct from their barking voice, which itself can have variations in tone, from excited to nervous or fearful.

As they are bred to &quot;give voice&quot; when excited, scent hounds may bark much more frequently than other dog breeds. Although this can be a nuisance in settled areas, it is a valuable trait that allows the dog&#x27;s handler to follow the dog or pack of dogs during a hunt even when they are out of sight, such as when following a fox or raccoon through woodland.

== Classification ==
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) places scent hounds into their classification &quot;Group 6&quot;. This includes a subdivision, &quot;Section 2, Leash Hounds&quot;, some examples of which are the Bavarian Mountain Hound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217), the Hanover Hound (Hannover&#x27;scher Schweisshund, no. 213), and the Alpine Dachsbracke (Alpenländische Dachsbracke, no. 254). In addition, the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian Ridgeback are placed in Group 6 as &quot;Related breeds&quot;.

== Genetic history ==
Genetic studies indicate that the scent hounds are more closely related to each other than they are with other branches on the dog family tree.

== United Kennel Club (US) Scenthound Group ==
The &quot;Scenthound Group&quot; is the group category used by the United Kennel Club (US), which it divides into two categories. The first includes the American hunting dogs known as coonhounds and the European hounds from which they were developed. These are referred to as Tree Hounds. The category also includes curs, American dogs bred for hunting a variety of game, such as squirrels, raccoons, opossums, bobcats, cougars, American black bears, and feral pigs. The second category is referred to as Trailing Scenthounds, and includes dogs used for tracking of humans, reputedly descended from the St. Hubert Hounds.

<doc id="176733" wikidata="Q211851" url="?curid=176733" title="Cylindrical coordinate system">
<text>A cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system that specifies point positions by the distance from a chosen reference axis &quot;(axis L in the image opposite)&quot;, the direction from the axis relative to a chosen reference direction &quot;(axis A)&quot;, and the distance from a chosen reference plane perpendicular to the axis &quot;(plane containing the purple section)&quot;. The latter distance is given as a positive or negative number depending on which side of the reference plane faces the point.

The &quot;origin&quot; of the system is the point where all three coordinates can be given as zero. This is the intersection between the reference plane and the axis.
The axis is variously called the &quot;cylindrical&quot; or &quot;longitudinal&quot; axis, to differentiate it from the &quot;polar axis&quot;, which is the ray that lies in the reference plane, starting at the origin and pointing in the reference direction.
Other directions perpendicular to the longitudinal axis are called &quot;radial lines&quot;.

The distance from the axis may be called the &quot;radial distance&quot; or &quot;radius&quot;, while the angular coordinate is sometimes referred to as the &quot;angular position&quot; or as the &quot;azimuth&quot;. The radius and the azimuth are together called the &quot;polar coordinates&quot;, as they correspond to a two-dimensional polar coordinate system in the plane through the point, parallel to the reference plane. The third coordinate may be called the &quot;height&quot; or &quot;altitude&quot; (if the reference plane is considered horizontal), &quot;longitudinal position&quot;, or &quot;axial position&quot;.

Cylindrical coordinates are useful in connection with objects and phenomena that have some rotational symmetry about the longitudinal axis, such as water flow in a straight pipe with round cross-section, heat distribution in a metal cylinder, electromagnetic fields produced by an electric current in a long, straight wire, accretion disks in astronomy, and so on.

They are sometimes called &quot;cylindrical polar coordinates&quot; or &quot;polar cylindrical coordinates&quot;, and are sometimes used to specify the position of stars in a galaxy (&quot;galactocentric cylindrical polar coordinates&quot;).

==Definition==
The three coordinates (, , ) of a point are defined as:
* The &quot;radial distance&quot; is the Euclidean distance from the -axis to the point .
* The &quot;azimuth&quot; is the angle between the reference direction on the chosen plane and the line from the origin to the projection of on the plane.
* The &quot;axial coordinate&quot; or &quot;height&quot; is the signed distance from the chosen plane to the point .

===Unique cylindrical coordinates===
As in polar coordinates, the same point with cylindrical coordinates has infinitely many equivalent coordinates, namely and where is any integer. Moreover, if the radius is zero, the azimuth is arbitrary.

In situations where someone wants a unique set of coordinates for each point, one may restrict the radius to be non-negative () and the azimuth to lie in a specific interval spanning 360°, such as or .

===Conventions===
The notation for cylindrical coordinates is not uniform. The ISO standard 31-11 recommends , where is the radial coordinate, the azimuth, and the height. However, the radius is also often denoted or , the azimuth by or , and the third coordinate by or (if the cylindrical axis is considered horizontal) , or any context-specific letter.

In concrete situations, and in many mathematical illustrations, a positive angular coordinate is measured counterclockwise as seen from any point with positive height.

==Coordinate system conversions==
The cylindrical coordinate system is one of many three-dimensional coordinate systems. The following formulae may be used to convert between them.

===Cartesian coordinates===
For the conversion between cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, it is convenient to assume that the reference plane of the former is the Cartesian -plane (with equation ), and the cylindrical axis is the Cartesian -axis. Then the -coordinate is the same in both systems, and the correspondence between cylindrical and Cartesian are the same as for polar coordinates, namely
formula_1
in one direction, and
formula_2
in the other. The arcsine function is the inverse of the sine function, and is assumed to return an angle in the range = . These formulas yield an azimuth in the range . 

By using the arctangent function that returns also an angle in the range = , one may also compute formula_3 without computing formula_4 first
formula_5
For other formulas, see the article Polar coordinate system.

Many modern programming languages provide a function that will compute the correct azimuth , in the range , given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, without the need to perform a case analysis as above. For example, this function is called by in the C programming language, and in Common Lisp.

===Spherical coordinates===
Spherical coordinates (radius , elevation or inclination , azimuth ), may be converted to or from cylindrical coordinates, depending on whether represents elevation or inclination, by the following:

==Line and volume elements==
In many problems involving cylindrical polar coordinates, it is useful to know the line and volume elements; these are used in integration to solve problems involving paths and volumes.

The line element is
formula_6

The volume element is
formula_7

The surface element in a surface of constant radius (a vertical cylinder) is
formula_8

The surface element in a surface of constant azimuth (a vertical half-plane) is
formula_9

The surface element in a surface of constant height (a horizontal plane) is
formula_10

The del operator in this system leads to the following expressions for gradient, divergence, curl and Laplacian:
formula_11

==Cylindrical harmonics==
The solutions to the Laplace equation in a system with cylindrical symmetry are called cylindrical harmonics.

==Kinematics==
In a cylindrical coordinate system, the position of a particle can be written as
formula_12
The velocity of the particle is the time derivative of its position,
formula_13
where the term formula_14 comes from the Poisson formula formula_15. Its acceleration is
formula_16

<text>Neolithic architecture refers to structures encompassing housing and shelter from approximately 10,000 to 2,000 BC, the Neolithic period. In southwest Asia, Neolithic cultures appear soon after 10,000 BC, initially in the Levant (Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B) and from there into the east and west. Early Neolithic structures and buildings can be found in southeast Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq by 8,000 BC with agriculture societies first appearing in southeast Europe by 6,500 BC, and central Europe by ca. 5,500 BC (of which the earliest cultural complexes include the Starčevo-Koros (Cris), Linearbandkeramic, and Vinča.

Architectural advances are an important part of the Neolithic period (10,000-2000 BC), during which some of the major innovations of human history occurred. The domestication of plants and animals, for example, led to both new economics and a new relationship between people and the world, an increase in community size and permanence, a massive development of material culture, and new social and ritual solutions to enable people to live together in these communities. New styles of individual structures and their combination into settlements provided the buildings required for the new lifestyle and economy, and were also an essential element of change.

==Housing==

The Neolithic people in the Levant, Anatolia, Syria, northern Mesopotamia and central Asia were great builders, utilising mud-brick to construct houses and villages. At Çatalhöyük, houses were plastered and painted with elaborate scenes of humans and animals.

In Europe, the Neolithic long house with a timber frame, pitched, thatched roof, and walls finished in wattle and daub could be very large, presumably housing a whole extended family. Villages might comprise only a few such houses.

Neolithic pile dwellings have been excavated in Sweden (Alvastra pile dwelling) and in the circum-Alpine area, with remains being found at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria. Early archaeologists like Ferdinand Keller thought they formed artificial islands, much like the Scottish crannogs, but today it is clear that the majority of settlements was located on the shores of lakes and were only inundated later on. Reconstructed pile dwellings are shown in open-air museums in Unteruhldingen and Zürich (Pfahlbauland).

In Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, Neolithic settlements included wattle-and-daub structures with thatched roofs and floors made of logs covered in clay. This is also when the burdei pit-house (below-ground) style of house construction was developed, which was still used by Romanians and Ukrainians until the 20th century.

Neolithic settlements and &quot;cities&quot; include:
* Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, ca. 9,000 BC
* Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the Levant, Neolithic from around 8,350 BC, arising from the earlier Epipaleolithic Natufian culture
* Nevali Cori in Turkey, ca. 8,000 BC
* Çatalhöyük in Turkey, 7,500 BC
* Mehrgarh in Pakistan, 7,000 BC
* Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, from 3,500 BC
* over 3,000 settlements of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, some with populations up to 15,000 residents, flourished in present-day Romania, Moldova and Ukraine from 5,400 to 2,800 BC.

==Tombs and ritual monuments==

Elaborate tombs for the dead were also built. These tombs are particularly numerous in Ireland, where there are many thousand still in existence. Neolithic people in the British Isles built long barrows and chamber tombs for their dead and causewayed camps, henges and cursus monuments.

===Megalithic architecture===

Megaliths found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. These monuments include megalithic tombs, temples and several structures of unknown function. Tomb architecture is normally easily distinguished by the presence of human remains that had originally been buried, often with recognizable intent. Other structures may have had a mixed use, now often characterised as religious, ritual, astronomical or political. The modern distinction between various architectural functions with which we are familiar today, now makes it difficult for us to think of some megalithic structures as multi-purpose socio-cultural centre points. Such structures would have served a mixture of socio-economic, ideological, political functions and indeed aesthetic ideals.

The megalithic structures of Ġgantija, Tarxien, Ħaġar Qim, Mnajdra, Ta&#x27; Ħaġrat, Skorba and smaller satellite buildings on Malta and Gozo, first appearing in their current form around 3600 BC, represent one of the earliest examples of a fully developed architectural statement in which aesthetics, location, design and engineering fused into free-standing monuments. Stonehenge, the other well-known building from the Neolithic would later, 2600 and 2400 BC for the sarsen stones, and perhaps 3000 BC for the blue stones, be transformed into the form that we know so well. At its height Neolithic architecture marked geographic space; their durable monumentality embodied a past, perhaps made up of memories and remembrance.

In the Central Mediterranean, Malta also became home of a subterranean skeuomorphised form of architecture around 3600 BC. At the Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum, the inhabitants of Malta carved out an underground burial complex in which surface architectural elements were used to embellish a series of chambers and entrances. It is at the Neolithic Ħal-Saflieni Hypogeum that the earliest known skeuomorphism first occurred in the world. This architectural device served to define the aesthetics of the underworld in terms that well known in the larger megaliths. On Malta and Gozo, surface and subterranean architecture defined two worlds, which later, in the Greek world, would manifest themselves in the myth of Hades and the world of the living. In Malta, therefore, we encounter Neolithic architecture which is demonstrably not purely functional, but which was conceptual in design and purpose.

==Other structures==
Early Neolithic water wells from the Linear Pottery culture have been found in central Germany near Leipzig. These structures are built in timber with complicated woodworking joints at the edges and are dated between 5,200 and 5,100 BC.

The world&#x27;s oldest known engineered roadway, the Sweet Track in England, also dates from this time.

<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury (HM Treasury), occasionally referred to as the Exchequer, or more informally the Treasury, is a ministerial department of the Government of the United Kingdom. It is responsible for developing and executing the government&#x27;s public finance policy and economic policy. The Treasury maintains the Online System for Central Accounting and Reporting, the replacement for the Combined Online Information System, which itemises departmental spending under thousands of category headings, and from which the Whole of Government Accounts annual financial statements are produced.

==History==

The origins of the Treasury of England have been traced by some to an individual known as Henry the Treasurer, a servant to King William the Conqueror. This claim is based on an entry in the Domesday Book showing the individual Henry &quot;the treasurer&quot; as a landowner in Winchester, where the royal treasure was stored.

The UK Treasury traces its origins to the Treasury of the Kingdom of England, founded by 1126, in the reign of King Henry I. The Treasury emerged from the Royal Household. It was where the king kept his treasures, such as in The King&#x27;s Chamber. The head of the Treasury was called the Lord Treasurer. Starting in Tudor times, the Lord Treasurer became one of the chief officers of state, and competed with the Lord Chancellor for the principal place. Thomas Cromwell transformed the financial administration of the country, restoring authority to the Exchequer and making the King&#x27;s Chamber, of central importance under Henry VII, back into a small spending department overseeing the Royal Household. The fact that Cromwell had a key post in the old Chamber system as well as being Chancellor of the Exchequer shows how he did this. For the majority of the medieval period the office of the Treasury was within the Exchequer (responsible for managing the royal revenue in addition to collecting and issuing money). As is often the case, wars are expensive and in 1433 war with France led to a deficit of £30,000 – the equivalent of over £100 billion today. Money that the Treasury received was recorded by using tallies. These were sticks with notches marked on them according to the amount of money involved. The stick was cut in two and one half given to the Sheriff as receipt for the money. They were in use until 1834 when a fire destroyed the Palace of Westminster. By 1584, the deficit had been turned into a surplus equivalent to one year&#x27;s revenue. Monarchs tended to bypass the Exchequer because of its ineffectiveness until it was reformed by Lord Treasurer Winchester and his successor, Lord Burghley, under Elizabeth I.

In contrast, the Stuarts failed to enforce limits on inflation, war, corruption and extravagant tendencies and were forced into debt again. In 1667, King Charles II was responsible for appointing George Downing, the builder of Downing Street, to radically reform the Treasury and the collection of taxes. The Treasury was first put in commission (placed under the control of several people instead of only one) in May or June 1660. The first commissioners were the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Ashley, (Sir) W. Coventry, (Sir) J. Duncomb, and (Sir) T. Clifford. From the middle of the 17th century the need for a national bank became pressing. England and, in particular, London was greatly changing due to fast expansion of The Empire&#x27;s trade, not least N.America, but also entrepot trade that grew to over one third of trade and with Continental Europe, however, what was needed was a &quot;fund of money,&quot; or a term familiar today, but by which is really meant either precious metals or &#x27;hard&#x27; currency such as US dollars mainly that grew in importance after WW1 to pay external trade bills i.e. questions of financial liquidity or circulation needed to maintain and grow the nation&#x27;s national income and trade, but above all to honour the nation&#x27;s foreign obligations. Failures to do so can lead to casus belli.

The early 1700s saw the meteoric rise of the banking and financial markets, with the emerging stock market revolving around government funds. The ability to raise money by means of creating debt through the issue of bills and bonds heralded the beginning of the National Debt. Improved controls over public spending ensured that creditors were more willing to lend money to the government. By the 1730s an early version of the public spending survey and the annual Budget had been established. In its evolution the Treasury had to learn some valuable lessons. In 1711, the Treasury established a scheme whereby it secured government debt by the authorisation of its subscription into the capital of the South Sea Company, with government creditors in return holding stock in the company. After 1714, the Treasury was always in commission. The commissioners were referred to as the Lords of the Treasury and were given a number based on their seniority. In 1720 the South Sea bubble burst and thousands of investors were affected; such was the outrage that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was sent to the Tower of London. Eventually the First Lord of the Treasury came, however, to be seen as the natural head of government, and from Robert Walpole on, the holder of the office became known, unofficially, as the Prime Minister. Until 1827, the First Lord of the Treasury, when a commoner, also held the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer, while if the First Lord was a peer, the Second Lord usually served as Chancellor. Since 1827, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has always been Second Lord of the Treasury.

If important lessons were learnt that the National Debt (and public finances) require prudent management, when the Exchequer was abolished in 1833, HM Treasury became the ministerial department under the Chancellor of the Exchequer. When the Treasury was under commission, junior Lords were each paid £1,600 a year. It is insensible to consider the Treasury&#x27;s history without the Bank of England, set up in the 17th century. The argument for England&#x27;s bank grew after the &quot;Glorious Revolution&quot; of 1688 when William of Orange and Queen Mary ascended to England&#x27;s throne. London-based Scottish entrepreneur, William Paterson proposed a &quot;Bank of England&quot; with a &quot;fund for perpetual Interest&quot; (not yet bonds or bills) that was passed by Parliament, supported by Charles Montagu, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Michael Godfrey, another leading City merchant. The public were invited to invest subscriptions totalling £1.2 million forming the initial capital stock onward loaned to the Government in return for a Royal Charter. At the same time the National Debt was born, paper money came into existence.







== Ministers ==
=== Chancellor of the Exchequer ===

Although the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland had been united by the Acts of Union 1800, the exchequers of the two kingdoms were not consolidated until 1817 under the Consolidated Fund Act 1816 (56 Geo. 3. c. 98). For the holders of the Irish office before this date, see Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland.

=== Current Treasury Ministers ===
As of 14 January 2025, the Treasury Ministers are as follows, with cabinet ministers in bold:
==Timeline==

=== 1817–2020 ===

== Whips ==
Some of the government whips are also associated in name with the Treasury: the Chief Whip is nominally Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and traditionally had an office in 12 Downing Street. Some of the other whips are nominally Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, though they are all members of the House of Commons. Being a whip is a party, rather than a government, position; the appointments to the Treasury are sinecure positions which allow the whips to be paid ministerial salaries. This has led to the Government front bench in the Commons being known as the Treasury Bench. However, since the whips no longer have any effective ministerial roles in the Treasury, they are usually not listed as Treasury ministers.

==Permanent secretaries==

The position of Permanent Secretary to the Treasury is generally regarded as the second most influential in the British Civil Service; two recent incumbents have gone on to be Cabinet Secretary, the only post outranking it.

From October 2022, the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury is James Bowler and there are two Second Permanent Secretaries: Cat Little and Beth Russell. The previous Permanent Secretary, Sir Tom Scholar, was sacked by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss shortly after they took office.

==Guidance==
The Treasury publishes cross-government guidance including &quot;Managing Public Money&quot; and &quot;The Green Book: Central Government Guidance on appraisal and evaluation&quot;, current version dated 2020. &quot;Managing Public Money&quot; includes a definition of &quot;value for money&quot; and sets out the responsibilities of an Accounting Officer within central government: The Treasury appoints the permanent head of each central government department to be its Accounting Officer.

The &quot;Green Book&quot; includes the historic five case model, which requires consideration of the policy, economic, commercial, financial and management dimensions of a proposed project.

== Banknote issue ==

Banknotes in the UK are normally issued by the Bank of England and a number of commercial banks (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). At the start of the First World War, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914 was passed, giving the Treasury temporary powers to issue banknotes in two denominations, one at £1 and another at 10 shillings, in the UK. Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible for gold through the Bank of England. They replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable purchases of raw materials for armaments production. These notes featured an image of King George V (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was &quot;UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND — Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 &amp; 5 Geo. V c.14)&quot;. Notes issued after the partition of Ireland from 1922 had the wording changed to read &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;.

The promise (never adhered to) was that they would be removed from circulation after the war had ended. In fact, the notes were issued until 1928, when the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 returned note-issuing powers to the banks.

== History of the Treasury Main Building ==
The Treasury Main Building at 1 Horse Guards Road, often referred to as the Government Offices, Great George Street (GOGGS), was designed by John Brydon following a competition. Construction took place in two phases. The West end was completed in 1908 and the East end was completed in 1917. It was originally built as offices for the Board of Education, the Local Government Board, and the Ministry of Works Office; HM Treasury moved into the building in 1940. A major refurbishment of the building was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2000. The works, which were designed by Foster and Partners together with Feilden and Mawson and carried out by Bovis Lend Lease at a cost of £140 million, were completed in 2002.

<text>The private finance initiative (PFI) was a United Kingdom government procurement policy aimed at creating &quot;public–private partnerships&quot; (PPPs) where private firms are contracted to complete and manage public projects. Initially launched in 1992 by Prime Minister John Major, and expanded considerably by the Blair government, PFI is part of the wider programme of privatisation and macroeconomic public policy, and presented as a means for increasing accountability and efficiency for public spending.

PFI is controversial in the UK. In 2003, the National Audit Office felt that it provided good value for money overall; according to critics, PFI has been used simply to place a great amount of debt &quot;off-balance-sheet&quot;. In 2011, the parliamentary Treasury Select Committee recommended:
In October 2018, the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the UK government would no longer use PFI for new infrastructure projects; however, PFI projects would continue to operate for some time to come.

==Overview==

The private finance initiative (PFI) is a procurement method which uses private sector investment in order to deliver public sector infrastructure and/or services according to a specification defined by the public sector. It is a sub-set of a broader procurement approach termed public-private partnership (PPP), with the main defining characteristic being the use of project finance (using private sector debt and equity, underwritten by the public) in order to deliver the public services. Beyond developing the infrastructure and providing finance, private sector companies operate the public facilities, sometimes using former public sector staff who have had their employment contracts transferred to the private sector through the TUPE process which applies to all staff in a company whose ownership changes.

==Mechanics==

===Contracts===
A public sector authority signs a contract with a private sector consortium, technically known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV). This consortium is typically formed for the specific purpose of providing the PFI. It is owned by a number of private sector investors, usually including a construction company and a service provider, and often a bank as well. The consortium&#x27;s funding will be used to build the facility and to undertake maintenance and capital replacement during the life-cycle of the contract. Once the contract is operational, the SPV may be used as a for contract amendment discussions between the customer and the facility operator. SPVs often charge fees for this go-between &#x27;service&#x27;.

PFI contracts are typically for 25–30 years (depending on the type of project); although contracts less than 20 years or more than 40 years exist, they are considerably less common. During the period of the contract the consortium will provide certain services, which were previously provided by the public sector. The consortium is paid for the work over the course of the contract on a &quot;no service no fee&quot; performance basis.

The public authority will design an &quot;output specification&quot; which is a document setting out what the consortium is expected to achieve. If the consortium fails to meet any of the agreed standards it should lose an element of its payment until standards improve. If standards do not improve after an agreed period, the public sector authority is usually entitled to terminate the contract, compensate the consortium where appropriate, and take ownership of the project.

Termination procedures are highly complex, as most projects are not able to secure private financing without assurances that the debt financing of the project will be repaid in the case of termination. In most termination cases the public sector is required to repay the debt and take ownership of the project. In practice, termination is considered a last resort only.

Whether public interest is at all protected by a particular PFI contract is highly dependent on how well or badly the contract was written and the determination (or not) and capacity of the contracting authority to enforce it. Many steps have been taken over the years to standardise the form of PFI contracts to ensure public interests are better protected.

===Structure of providers===
The typical PFI provider is organized into three parts or legal entities: a holding company (called &quot;Topco&quot;) which is the same as the SPV mentioned above, a capital equipment or infrastructure provision company (called &quot;Capco&quot;), and a services or operating company (called &quot;Opco&quot;). The main contract is between the public sector authority and the Topco. Requirements then &#x27;flow down&#x27; from the Topco to the Capco and Opco via secondary contracts. Further requirements then flow down to subcontractors, again with contracts to match. Often the main subcontractors are companies with the same shareholders as the Topco.

===Method of funding===
Prior to the 2007–2008 financial crisis, large PFI projects were funded through the sale of bonds and/or senior debt. Since the crisis, funding by senior debt has become more common. Smaller PFI projects – the majority by number – have typically always been funded directly by banks in the form of senior debt. Senior debt is generally slightly more expensive than bonds, which the banks would argue is due to their more accurate understanding of the credit-worthiness of PFI deals – they may consider that monoline providers underestimate the risk, especially during the construction stage, and hence can offer a better price than the banks are willing to.

Refinancing of PFI deals is common. Once construction is complete, the risk profile of a project can be lower, so cheaper debt can be obtained. This refinancing might in the future be done via bonds – the construction stage is financed using bank debt, and then bonds for the much longer period of operation.

The banks who fund PFI projects are repaid by the consortium from the money received from the government during the lifespan of the contract. From the point of view of the private sector, PFI borrowing is considered low risk because public sector authorities are very unlikely to default. Indeed, under IMF rules, national governments are not permitted to go bankrupt (although this is sometimes ignored, as when Argentina &#x27;restructured&#x27; its foreign debt). Repayment depends entirely on the ability of the consortium to deliver the services in accordance with the output specified in the contract.

Under guidance issued prior to the reform proposals initiated in December 2011, public sector partners were permitted to contribute up to 30% of the construction costs as a capital contribution, generally handed over at the end of the construction period and subject to appropriate risk transfer and performance regimes being in place. The government indicated in its reform consultation that allowance for higher levels of capital contribution was being considered, noting the some international practice also offered examples of higher levels of capital contribution.

===Insurance===
PFI contracts generally allocate risks to the private sector contractor, who takes out appropriate insurance to cover these risks and includes anticipated insurance costs in its PFI charges. However, it has been recognised that levels of insurance premium are variable following cyclical economic changes, and difficult to predict over the lifetime of a PFI project. PFI terms were amended in 2002 and standardised in 2006 to allow for insurance cost sharing mechanisms, whereby the client and contractor could share the risk of market fluctuation in insurance premium costs.

==History==
===Development===
PFI was implemented in the UK by the Conservative Government led by John Major in 1992. It was introduced against the backdrop of the Maastricht Treaty which provided for European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). To participate in EMU, EU member states were required to keep public debt below a certain threshold, and PFI was a mechanism to take debt off the government balance sheet and so meet the Maastricht convergence criteria. PFI immediately proved controversial, and was attacked by Labour critics such as the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Harriet Harman, who said that PFI was really a back-door form of privatisation (House of Commons, 7 December 1993), and the future Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, warned that &quot;apparent savings now could be countered by the formidable commitment on revenue expenditure in years to come&quot;.

Initially, the private sector was unenthusiastic about PFI, and the public sector was opposed to its implementation. In 1993, the Chancellor of the Exchequer described its progress as &quot;disappointingly slow&quot;. To help promote and implement the policy, he created the Private Finance Office within the Treasury, with a Private Finance Panel headed by Alastair Morton. These institutions were staffed with people linked with the City of London, and accountancy and consultancy firms who had a vested interest in the success of PFI. The largest of the early PFI projects was Pathway, announced by Peter Lilley in 1995, which was to automate the handling of benefit payments at post offices.

Two months after Tony Blair&#x27;s Labour Party took office, the Health Secretary, Alan Milburn, announced that &quot;when there is a limited amount of public-sector capital available, as there is, it&#x27;s PFI or bust&quot;. PFI expanded considerably in 1996 and then expanded much further under Labour with the NHS (Private Finance) Act 1997, resulting in criticism from many trade unions, elements of the Labour Party, the Scottish National Party (SNP), and the Green Party, as well as commentators such as George Monbiot. Proponents of the PFI include the World Bank, the IMF and the Confederation of British Industry.

Both Conservative and Labour governments sought to justify PFI on the practical grounds that the private sector is better at delivering services than the public sector. This position has been supported by the UK National Audit Office with regard to certain projects. However, critics claim that many uses of PFI are ideological rather than practical; Dr. Allyson Pollock recalls a meeting with the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown who could not provide a rationale for PFI other than to &quot;declare repeatedly that the public sector is bad at management, and that only the private sector is efficient and can manage services well.&quot;
To better promote PFI, the Labour government appointed Malcolm Bates to chair the efforts to review the policy with a number of Arthur Andersen staffers. They recommended the creation of a Treasury Task Force (TTF) to train public servants into PFI practice and to coordinate the implementation of PFI. In 1998, the TTF was renamed to &quot;Partnership UK&quot; (PUK) and sold 51% of its share to the private sector. PUK was then chaired by Sir Derek Higgs, director of Prudential Insurance and chairman of British Land plc. These changes meant that the government transferred the responsibility of managing PFI to a corporation closely related with the owners, financiers, consultants, and subcontractors that stood to benefit from this policy. This created a strong appearance of conflict of interest.

Trade unions such as Unison and the GMB, which are Labour supporters, strongly opposed these developments. At the 2002 Labour Party Conference, the delegates adopted a resolution condemning PFI and calling for an independent review of the policy, which was ignored by the party leadership.

=== Implementation ===
In education, the first PFI school opened in 2000. In 2005/2006 the Labour Government introduced Building Schools for the Future, a scheme introduced for improving the infrastructure of Britain&#x27;s schools. Of the £2.2 billion funding that the Labour government committed to BSF, £1.2 billion (55.5%) was to be covered by PFI credits. Some local authorities were persuaded to accept Academies in order to secure BSF funding in their area.

In 2003 the Labour Government used public-private partnership (PPP) schemes for the privatisation of London Underground&#x27;s infrastructure and rolling stock. The two private companies created under the PPP, Metronet and Tube Lines were later taken into public ownership.

By October 2007 the total capital value of PFI contracts signed throughout the UK was £68bn, committing the British taxpayer to future spending of £215bn over the life of the contracts. The 2007–2008 financial crisis presented PFI with difficulties because many sources of private capital had dried up. Nevertheless, PFI remained the UK government&#x27;s preferred method for public sector procurement under Labour. In January 2009 the Labour Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, reaffirmed this commitment with regard to the health sector, stating that &quot;PFIs have always been the NHS’s &#x27;plan A&#x27; for building new hospitals … There was never a &#x27;plan B&#x27;&quot;. However, because of banks&#x27; unwillingness to lend money for PFI projects, the UK government now had to fund the so-called &#x27;private&#x27; finance initiative itself. In March 2009 it was announced that the Treasury would lend £2bn of public money to private firms building schools and other projects under PFI. Labour&#x27;s Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Yvette Cooper, claimed the loans should ensure that projects worth £13bn – including waste treatment projects, environmental schemes and schools – would not be delayed or cancelled. She also promised that the loans would be temporary and would be repaid at a commercial rate. But, at the time, Vince Cable of the Liberal Democrats, subsequently Secretary of State for Business in the coalition, argued in favour of traditional public financing structures instead of propping up PFI with public money:

In opposition at the time, even the Conservative Party considered that, with the taxpayer now funding it directly, PFI had become &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Philip Hammond, subsequently Secretary of State for Transport in the coalition, said:

In an interview in November 2009, Conservative George Osborne, subsequently Chancellor of the Exchequer in the coalition, sought to distance his party from the excesses of PFI by blaming Labour for its misuse. At the time, Osborne proposed a modified PFI which would preserve the arrangement of private sector investment for public infrastructure projects in return for part-privatisation, but would ensure proper risk transfer to the private sector along with transparent accounting:

Despite being so critical of PFI while in opposition and promising reform, once in power George Osborne progressed 61 PFI schemes worth a total of £6.9bn in his first year as Chancellor. According to Mark Hellowell from the University of Edinburgh:

The high cost of PFI deals is a major issue, with advocates for renegotiating PFI deals in the face of reduced public sector budgets, or even for refusing to pay PFI charges on the grounds that they are a form of odious debt. Critics such as Peter Dixon argue that PFI is fundamentally the wrong model for infrastructure investment, saying that public sector funding is the way forward.

In November 2010 the UK government released spending figures showing that the current total payment obligation for PFI contracts in the UK was £267 billion. Research has also shown that in 2009 the Treasury failed to negotiate decent PFI deals with publicly owned banks, resulting in £1bn of unnecessary costs. This failure is particularly grave given the coalition&#x27;s own admission in their national infrastructure plan that a 1% reduction in the cost of capital for infrastructure investment could save the taxpayer £5bn a year.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) withdrew funding support from seven waste management PFI projects as a result of the 2010 Spending Review, directing the cuts to those projects where least progress had been made with contract procurement and obtaining planning permission.

In February 2011 the Treasury announced a project to examine the £835m Queen&#x27;s Hospital PFI deal. Once savings and efficiencies are identified, the hope - as yet unproven - is that the PFI consortium can be persuaded to modify its contract. The same process could potentially be applied across a range of PFI projects.

===PF2===
In December, 2012 the Treasury published a White Paper outlining the results of a review of the PFI and proposals for change. These aimed to:
* centralise procurement by and for government departments, increase Treasury involvement in the procurement process, and move the management of all public sector investment in PFI schemes into a central unit in the Treasury;
* draw funding providers into projects at an earlier stage to reduce windfall gains when they were sold on;
* exclude &quot;soft services&quot; from PFI schemes where the specification was likely to change at short notice (such as catering and cleaning);
* reduce the role of bank debt in financing;
* improve transparency and accountability by both public and private sector participants;
* increase the proportion of risk carried by the public sector.
Under this &quot;new approach&quot;, the government would become a minority equity co-investor in future projects, partly to better align the private and public sector interests in new projects. A consultation exercise was subsequently undertaken by the government regarding the terms on which the public sector stake would be managed, aiming for a generally consistent approach across projects but with scope for details to be finalised prior to operation to reflect any project-specific issues. The government&#x27;s response to the consultation and the &quot;Standard PF2 Equity Documents&quot; were published in October 2013.

Under the Priority School Building Programme which was launched in 2014 by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, the rebuilding and/or refurbishment of 46 schools in England was funded and procured using the PF2 model.

===Scotland===
A specialist unit was set up within the Scottish Office in 2005 to handle PFI projects. In November 2014, Nicola Sturgeon announced a £409m public-private funding package which would be funded through a non-profit distributing model which would cap private sector returns, returning any surplus to the public sector. On Monday 11 April 2016, 17 PFI-funded schools in Edinburgh failed to open after the Easter break because of structural problems identified in two of them the previous Friday; the schools had been erected in the 1990s by Miller Construction.

===Ending of PFI for new infrastructure projects===
A January 2018 report by the National Audit Office found that the UK had incurred many billions of pounds in extra costs for no clear benefit through PFIs.

In October 2018, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced that the UK Government will no longer use PF2, the current model of Private Finance Initiative, for new infrastructure projects, due to value-for-money considerations and the difficulties caused by the collapse of PFI construction company Carillion.

A Centre of Excellence is to be established within the Department of Health and Social Care to manage the existing PFI contracts in the NHS.

==Examples of projects==
There have been over 50 English hospitals procured under a PFI contract with capital cost exceeding £50 million:

There have been some six Scottish hospitals procured under a PFI contract with capital cost exceeding £50 million:
The following is a selection of major projects in other sectors procured under a PFI contract:
&quot;The Guardian&quot; published a full list of PFI contracts by department in July 2012, and HM Treasury published a full list of PFI contracts by department in March 2015.

==Impact==

===Analysis===
A study by HM Treasury in July 2003 was supportive, showing that the only deals in its sample which were over budget were those where the public sector changed its mind after deciding what it wanted and from whom it wanted it.

A later report by the National Audit Office in 2009 found that 69 per cent of PFI construction projects between 2003 and 2008 were delivered on time and 65 per cent were delivered at the contracted price.

However, a report by the National Audit Office in 2011 was much more critical, finding that the use of PFI &quot;has the effect of increasing the cost of finance for public investments relative to what would be available to the government if it borrowed on its own account&quot; and &quot;the price of finance is significantly higher with a PFI.&quot;

An article in &quot;The Economist&quot; reports that:

On the other hand, Monbiot argues that the specifications of many public infrastructure projects have been distorted to increase their profitability for PFI contractors.

PFI projects allowed the Ministry of Defence to gain many useful resources &quot;on a shoestring&quot;; PFI deals were signed for barracks, headquarters buildings, training for pilots and sailors, and an aerial refuelling service, amongst other things.

Individuals have speculated that some PFI projects have been shoddily specified and executed. For example, in 2005 a confidential government report condemned the PFI-funded Newsam Centre at Seacroft Hospital for jeopardising the lives of 300 patients and staff. The Newsam Centre is for people with lifelong learning difficulties and the mentally ill. The report said that there were shortcomings &quot;in each of the five key areas of documentation, design, construction, operation and management&quot; at the hospital, which cost £47m. Between 2001 and 2005 there were four patient suicides, including one which was left undiscovered for four days in an out-of-order bathroom. The coroner said that Leeds Mental Health Teaching NHS Trust, which is responsible for the facility, had failed to keep patients under proper observation. The government report said that the design and construction of the building did not meet the requirements for a facility for mental patients. The building has curving corridors which make patient observation and quick evacuation difficult. The report said that the building also constituted a fire hazard, as it was constructed without proper fire protection materials in the wall and floor joints. In addition, mattresses and chairs used below-standard fire-retardant materials. Patients were allowed to smoke in rooms where they could not be easily observed. The fire-safety manual was described as &quot;very poor&quot;, and the fire-safety procedure consisted of a post-it note marked &quot;to be provided by the Trust&quot;. The report concluded that &quot;every section of the fire safety code&quot; had been breached.

On the other hand, the building of two new PFI Police Stations on behalf of Kent Police serving the Medway area and the North Kent area (Gravesend and Dartford) is credited as a successful PFI project. Supporters say that the new buildings take into account the modern needs of the police better than the 60s/70s building, and that another advantage is that the old buildings can be sold for income or redeveloped into the police estate.

===Education===
KPMG investigations in 2008 and 2009 found that school renewals had beneficial impacts on educational outcomes and that the rate of improvement was higher in PFI schools than where construction or renewal was conventionally funded.

===National Health Service (NHS)===
In 2017 there were 127 PFI schemes in the English NHS. The contracts vary greatly in size. Most include the cost of running services such as facilities management, hospital portering and patient food, and these amount to around 40% of the cost. Total repayments will cost around £2.1 billion in 2017 and will reach a peak in 2029. This is around 2% of the NHS budget.

A 2009 study by University College London, studying data at hospitals built since 1995, supports the argument that private-sector providers are more accountable to provide quality services: It showed that hospitals operating under PFI have better patient environment ratings than conventionally funded hospitals of similar age. The PFI hospitals also have higher cleanliness scores than non-PFI hospitals of similar age, according to data collected by the NHS.

Jonathan Fielden, chair of the British Medical Association&#x27;s consultants&#x27; committee has said that PFI debts are &quot;distorting clinical priorities&quot; and affecting the treatment given to patients. Fielden cited the example of University Hospital Coventry where the NHS Trust was forced to borrow money to make the first £54m payment owed to the PFI contractor. He said that the trust was in the ignominious position of struggling for money before the hospital&#x27;s doors even opened. The trust could not afford to run all the services that it had commissioned and was having to mothball services and close wards.
The high cost of hospitals built under PFI is forcing service cuts at neighbouring hospitals built with public money. Overspending at the PFI-funded Worcestershire Royal Hospital has put a question mark over services at neighbouring hospitals. A strategic health authority paper in 2007 noted debts at two hospitals in south-east London: Princess Royal University Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The paper attributed the debts in part to their high fixed PFI costs and suggested that the same would soon apply to Lewisham Hospital.

In 2012, seven NHS trusts were unable to meet the repayments for their private finance schemes and were given £1.5 billion in emergency funding, to help them avoid cutting patient services.
* Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust
* Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust
* Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust
* North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust
* Peterborough and Stamford Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
* St Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust
* South London Healthcare NHS Trust

Peter Dixon, Chairman of University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, with the largest PFI-built hospital in England, has gone on the record to say:

The trust complained in July 2019 that inflexible Treasury rules were preventing it from buying out its 40-year PFI contract, which could deliver savings of £30 million a year. The contract equity holders are receiving around £20 million in annual dividends which is &quot;double the figure envisaged at the start of the project and [is] projected to rise to £60m by the end of the deal&quot;.

An anonymous NHS finance director pointed out in November 2015, that PFI payments are often linked to the Retail Price Index which has risen more rapidly than the NHS tariff. He estimated that payments were about 3 percent higher than those incurred using traditional public dividend capital.

Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was the first to buy out a PFI contract, borrowing £114.2 million from Northumbria County Council in a deal which reduced its costs by £3.5 million per year.

A report by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest in 2017 calculated that PFI companies had made pre-tax profits from the NHS of £831m in the previous six years. They calculate that PFI payments in the NHS will rise from £2.2 billion in 2019–20 to a peak of £2.7 billion in 2029–30.

===Private sector===
Semperian, Innisfree Ltd and the HICL Infrastructure Company are the main players in NHS contracts.

===Employment===
When spending is tight, hospitals may prefer to retain medical staff and services by spending less on building maintenance. But under PFI, hospitals are forced to prioritise the contractual payments for their buildings over jobs and, according to figures published by the Department of Health, these committed payments can account for up to 20% of operating budget. Nigel Edwards, head of policy for the NHS Confederation, noted that:

Dr Jonathan Fielden, chair of the British Medical Association&#x27;s consultants&#x27; committee has said that as a result of the high costs of a PFI scheme in Coventry &quot;they are potentially reducing jobs&quot;. In fact by 2005 the hospital trust in Coventry was anticipating a deficit of £13m due to PFI and &quot;drastic measures&quot; were required to plug the gap including shutting one ward, removing eight beds from another, shortening the opening hours of the Surgical Assessment Unit, and the &quot;rationalisation of certain posts&quot; – which meant cutting 116 jobs.

Under PFI, many staff have their employment contracts automatically transferred to the private sector, using a process known as TUPE. In many cases this results in worse terms of employment and pension rights. Heather Wakefield, UNISON&#x27;s national secretary for local government, has said:

===Debt===
The debt created by PFI has a significant impact on the finances of public bodies. As of October 2007 the total capital value of PFI contracts signed throughout the UK was £68bn. However, central and local government are committed to paying a further £267bn over the lifetime of these contracts. To give regional examples, the £5.2bn of PFI investment in Scotland up to 2007 has created a public sector liability of £22.3bn and the investment of just £618m via PFI in Wales up to 2007 has created a public sector liability of £3.3bn. However, these debts are small compared to other public-sector liabilities.

Annual payments to the private owners of the PFI schemes are due to peak at £10bn in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timmins 03/2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases Trusts are having to &#x27;rationalise&#x27; spending by closing wards and laying off staff, but they are not allowed to default on their PFI payments. As &quot;The Guardian&quot; explained &quot;In September 1997 the government declared that these payments would be legally guaranteed: beds, doctors, nurses and managers could be sacrificed, but not the annual donation to the Fat Cats Protection League&quot;.

Mark Porter, of the British Medical Association said: &quot;Locking the NHS into long-term contracts with the private sector has made entire local health economies more vulnerable to changing conditions. Now the financial crisis has changed conditions beyond recognition, so trusts tied into PFI deals have even less freedom to make business decisions that protect services, making cuts and closures more likely.&quot; John Appleby, chief economist at the King&#x27;s Fund health think-tank, said:

Officials at the Treasury have also admitted that they may have to attempt to renegotiate certain PFI contracts in order to reduce payments, although it is far from certain that the private investors would accept this.

PFI contracts are generally off-balance-sheet, meaning that they do not show up as part of the national debt. This fiscal technicality has been characterized as a benefit and a flaw of PFI.

In the UK, the technical reason why PFI debts are off-balance-sheet is that the government authority taking out the PFI theoretically transfers one or more of the following risks to the private sector: risk associated with demand for the facility (e.g. under-utilisation); risk associated with construction of the facility (e.g. overspend and delay); or risk associated with the &#x27;availability&#x27; of the facility. The PFI contract bundles the payment to the private sector as a single (&#x27;unitary&#x27;) charge for both the initial capital spend and the ongoing maintenance and operation costs. Because of supposed risk transfer, the entire contract is deemed to be revenue rather than capital spending. As a result, no capital spend appears on the government&#x27;s balance sheet (the revenue expenditure would not have been on the government balance sheet in any event). Public accounting standards are being changed to bring these numbers back onto the balance sheet. For example, in 2007 Neil Bentley, the CBI&#x27;s Director of Public Services, told a conference that the CBI was keen for the government to press ahead with accounting rule changes that would put large numbers of PFI projects onto the government&#x27;s books. He was concerned that accusations of &quot;accounting tricks&quot; were delaying PFI projects.

===Risk===
Supporters of PFI claim that risk is successfully transferred from public to private sectors as a result of PFI, and that the private sector is better at risk management. As an example of successful risk transfer they cite the case of the National Physical Laboratory. This deal ultimately caused the collapse of the building contractor Laser (a joint venture between Serco and John Laing) when the cost of the complex scientific laboratory, which was ultimately built, was very much larger than estimated.

On the other hand, Allyson Pollock argues that in many PFI projects risks are not in fact transferred to the private sector and, based on the research findings of Pollock and others, George Monbiot argues that the calculation of risk in PFI projects is highly subjective, and is skewed to favour the private sector:

Following an incident in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh where surgeons were forced to continue a heart operation in the dark following a power cut caused by PFI operating company Consort, Dave Watson from Unison criticised the way the PFI contract operates:

In February 2019 the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch produced a report into mistakes involving piped air being mistakenly supplied to patients rather than piped oxygen and said that cost pressures could make it difficult for trusts to respond to safety alerts because of the financial costs of replacing equipment. Private finance initiative contracts increased those costs and exacerbated the problem.

===Value for money===
A National Audit Office study in 2003 endorsed the view that PFI projects represent good value for taxpayers&#x27; money, but some commentators have criticised PFI for allowing excessive profits for private companies at the expense of the taxpayer. An investigation by Professor Jean Shaoul of Manchester Business School into the profitability of PFI deals based on accounts filed at Companies House revealed that the rate of return for the companies on twelve large PFI Hospitals was 58%. Excessive profits can be made when PFI projects are refinanced. An article in the Financial Times recalls the

While it is a catchy term, it is unclear what &quot;value-for-money&quot; means in practice and technical detail. A Scottish auditor once called it &quot;technocratic mumbo-jumbo&quot;. A number of PFI projects have cost considerably more than originally anticipated. The duplication of design costs when each bidder in the latter stages of project procurement is preparing its own design was the subject of some criticism: the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) put forward a model known as &quot;Smart PFI&quot; in 2005, under which a traditionally appointed design team would prepare &quot;example plans&quot; which would be finalised and costed by PFI bidders.

More recent reports indicate that PFI represents poor value for money. A treasury select committee stated that &#x27;PFI was no more efficient than other forms of borrowing and it was &quot;illusory&quot; that it shielded the taxpayer from risk&#x27;.

One key criticism of PFI, when it comes to value for money, is the lack of transparency surrounding individual projects. This means that independent attempts, such as that by the Association for Consultancy and Engineering, to assess PFI data across government departments have been able to find significant variations in the costs to the taxpayer.

===Tax===
Some PFI deals have also been associated with tax avoidance, including a deal to sell properties belonging to the UK government&#x27;s own tax authority. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee criticised HM Revenue and Customs over the PFI STEPS deal to sell about 600 properties to a company called Mapeley, based in the tax haven of Bermuda. The committee said it was &quot;a very serious blow indeed&quot; for the government&#x27;s own tax-collecting services to have entered into the contract with Mapeley, whom they described as &quot;tax avoiders&quot;. Conservative MP Edward Leigh said there were &quot;significant weaknesses&quot; in the way the contract was negotiated. The government agencies had failed to clarify Mapeley&#x27;s tax plans until a late stage in the negotiations. Leigh said: &quot;It is incredible that the Inland Revenue, of all departments, did not, during contract negotiations, find out more about Mapeley&#x27;s structure&quot;.

===Bureaucracy===
The National Audit Office has accused the government&#x27;s PFI dogma of ruining a £10bn Ministry of Defence project. The Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project to develop a fleet of multi-role RAF tanker and passenger aircraft was delayed for over 5 years while, in the meantime, old and unreliable planes continue to be used for air-to-air refuelling, and for transporting troops to and from Afghanistan. Edward Leigh, then Conservative chair of the Public Accounts Committee which oversees the work of the NAO, said: &quot;By introducing a private finance element to the deal, the MoD managed to turn what should have been a relatively straightforward procurement into a bureaucratic nightmare&quot;. The NAO criticised the MoD for failing to carry out a &quot;sound evaluation of alternative procurement routes&quot; because there had been the &quot;assumption&quot; in the ministry that the aircraft must be provided through a PFI deal in order to keep the numbers off the balance sheet, due to &quot;affordability pressures and the prevailing policy to use PFI wherever possible&quot;.

====Complexity====
Critics claim that the complexity of many PFI projects is a barrier to accountability. For example, a report by the Trade Union UNISON entitled &quot;What is Wrong with PFI in Schools?&quot; says:

Malcolm Trobe, the President of the Association of School and College Leaders has said that the idea that contracting out the school building process via PFI would free up head teachers to concentrate on education has turned out to be a myth. In many cases it has in fact increased the workload on already stretched staff.

===Waste===
A BBC Radio 4 investigation into PFI noted the case of Balmoral High School in Northern Ireland which cost £17m to build in 2002. In 2007 the decision was made to close the school because of lack of pupils. But the PFI contract is due to run for another 20 years, so the taxpayer will be paying millions of pounds for an unused facility.

With regard to hospitals, Prof. Nick Bosanquet of Imperial College London has argued that the government commissioned some PFI hospitals without a proper understanding of their costs, resulting in a number of hospitals which are too expensive to be used. He said:

In 2012, it was reported that dozens of NHS Trusts labouring under PFI-related debts were at risk of closure.

According to Stella Creasy, a self-acknowledged PFI &quot;nerd&quot;, the fundamental problem was the rate of interest charged because of a lack of competition between providers. &quot;Barts was a £1bn project. They’ll pay back £7bn. That is not good value for money&quot;. She wants to see a windfall tax on the PFI companies.

==Relationship with government==

=== Treasury ===
In July 1997 a PFI taskforce was established within the Treasury to provide central co-ordination for the roll-out of PFI. Known as the Treasury Taskforce (TTF), its main responsibilities are to standardise the procurement process and train staff throughout government in the ways of PFI, especially in the private finance units of other government departments. The TTF initially consisted of a policy arm staffed by five civil servants, and a projects section employing eight private sector executives led by Adrian Montague, formally co-head of Global Project Finance at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. In 1999 the policy arm was moved to the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), but it was subsequently moved back to the Treasury. The projects section was part-privatised and became Partnerships UK (PUK). The Treasury retained a 49% &#x27;golden share&#x27;, while the majority stake in PUK was owned by private sector investors. PUK was then staffed almost entirely by private sector procurement specialists such as corporate lawyers, investment bankers, consultants and so forth. It took the lead role in evangelising PFI and its variants within government, and was in control of the policy&#x27;s day-to-day implementation.

In March 2009, in the face of funding difficulties caused by the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Treasury established an Infrastructure Finance Unit with a mandate to ensure the continuation of PFI projects. In April 2009, the unit stumped up £120m of public money to ensure that a new waste disposal project in Manchester would go ahead. Andy Rose, the unit head, said: &quot;This is what we were set up to do, to get involved where private sector capital is not available.&quot; In May 2009 the unit proposed to provide £30m to bail out a second PFI project, a £700m waste treatment plant in Wakefield. In response, Tony Travers, Director of the Greater London Group at the London School of Economics described the use of public money to finance PFI as &quot;Alice in Wonderland economics&quot;.

The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee has criticised the Treasury for failing to negotiate better PFI funding deals with banks in 2009. The committee revealed that British taxpayers are liable for an extra £1bn because the Treasury failed to find alternative ways to fund infrastructure projects during the financial crisis. The committee &quot;suggests that the government should have temporarily abandoned PFI to directly fund some projects, instead of allowing the banks – many of which were being bailed out with billions of pounds of public money at the time – to increase their charges . . . by up to 33%&quot;.

=== Scrutiny ===
The House of Commons Liaison Committee has said that claims of commercial confidentiality are making it difficult for MPs to scrutinise the growing number of PFI contracts in the UK. The National Audit Office (NAO) is responsible for scrutinising public spending throughout the UK on behalf of the British Parliament and is independent of Government. It provides reports on the value for money of many PFI transactions and makes recommendations. The Public Accounts Committee also provides reports on these issues at a UK-wide level. The devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own equivalents of the NAO such as the Wales Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Audit Office which review PFI projects in their respective localities. In recent years the Finance Committees of the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales have held enquiries into whether PFI represents good value for money.

=== Local government ===
PFI is used in both central and local government. In the case of local government projects, the capital element of the funding which enables the local authority to pay the private sector for these projects is given by central government in the form of what are known as PFI &quot;credits&quot;. The local authority then selects a private company to perform the work, and transfers detailed control of the project, and in theory the risk, to the company.

In 2000, South Gloucestershire Council used PFI for household waste and recycling services, selecting private company Suez to deliver these services for 25 years.

=== Appraisal process ===
Jeremy Colman, former deputy general of the National Audit Office and Auditor General for Wales is quoted in the Financial Times saying that many PFI appraisals suffer from &quot;spurious precision&quot; and others are based on &quot;pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo&quot;. Some, he says, are simply &quot;utter rubbish&quot;. He noted government pressures on contracting authorities to weight their appraisals in favour of taking their projects down the PFI route: &quot;If the answer comes out wrong you don&#x27;t get your project. So the answer doesn&#x27;t come out wrong very often.&quot;

In a paper published in the British Medical Journal, a team consisting of two public health specialists and an economist concluded that many PFI appraisals do not correctly calculate the true risks involved. They argued that the appraisal system is highly subjective in its evaluation of risk transferral to the private sector. An example was an NHS project where the risk that clinical cost savings might not be achieved was theoretically transferred to the private sector. In the appraisal this risk was valued at £5m but in practice the private contractor had no responsibility for ensuring clinical cost-savings and faced no penalty if there were none. Therefore, the supposed risk transfer was in fact spurious.

<doc id="176739" wikidata="Q18817" url="?curid=176739" title="War of the First Coalition">
<text>The War of the First Coalition () was a set of wars that several European powers fought between 1792 and 1797, initially against the constitutional Kingdom of France and then the French Republic that succeeded it. They were only loosely allied and fought without much apparent coordination or agreement; each power had its eye on a different part of France it wanted to appropriate after a French defeat, which never occurred.

Relations between the French revolutionaries and neighbouring monarchies had deteriorated following the Declaration of Pillnitz in August 1791. Eight months later, following a vote of the revolutionary-led Legislative Assembly, France declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792; Prussia, having allied with Austria in February, declared war on France in June 1792. In July 1792, an army under the Duke of Brunswick and composed mostly of Prussians joined the Austrian side and invaded France. The capture of Verdun (2 September 1792) triggered the September massacres in Paris. France counterattacked with the victory at Valmy (20 September) and two days later the National Convention, which had replaced the Legislative Assembly, proclaimed the French Republic.

Subsequently, these powers made several invasions of France by land and sea, in association with Prussia and Austria attacking from the Austrian Netherlands and the Rhine, and Great Britain supporting revolts in provincial France and laying siege to Toulon in October 1793. France suffered reverses (Battle of Neerwinden, 18 March 1793) and internal strife (War in the Vendée) and responded with draconian measures. The Committee of Public Safety was formed (6 April 1793) and the &quot;levée en masse&quot; drafted all potential soldiers aged 18 to 25 (August 1793). The new French armies counterattacked, repelled the invaders, and advanced beyond France.

The French established the Batavian Republic as a sister republic (May 1795) and gained Prussian recognition of French control of the Left Bank of the Rhine by the first Peace of Basel. With the Treaty of Campo Formio, Austria ceded the Austrian Netherlands to France and Northern Italy was turned into several French sister republics. Spain made a separate peace accord with France (Second Treaty of Basel) and the French Directory annexed more of the Holy Roman Empire.

North of the Alps, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defeated the invading armies during the Rhine campaign, but Napoleon Bonaparte succeeded against Sardinia and Austria in northern Italy (1796–1797) near the Po Valley, culminating in the Peace of Leoben and the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797). The First Coalition collapsed, leaving only Britain in the field fighting against France.

==Background==
===Revolution in France===
As early as 1791, other monarchies in Europe were watching the developments in France with alarm, and considered intervening, either in support of Louis XVI or to take advantage of the chaos in France. The key figure, the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, brother of the French Queen Marie Antoinette, had initially looked on the Revolution calmly. He became increasingly concerned as the Revolution grew more radical, although he still hoped to avoid war.

On 27 August 1791, Leopold and King Frederick William II of Prussia, in consultation with &quot;émigré&quot; French nobles, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which declared the concern of the monarchs of Europe for the well-being of Louis and his family, and threatened vague but severe consequences if anything should befall them. Although Leopold saw the Pillnitz Declaration as a way of taking action that would enable him to avoid actually doing anything about France, at least for the moment, Paris saw the Declaration as a serious threat and the revolutionary leaders denounced it.

In addition to the ideological differences between France and the monarchical powers of Europe, disputes continued over the status of Imperial estates in Alsace, and the French authorities became concerned about the agitation of &quot;émigré&quot; nobles abroad, especially in the Austrian Netherlands and in the minor states of Germany. In the end, France declared war on Austria first, with the Assembly voting for war on 20 April 1792, after the presentation of a long list of grievances by the newly appointed foreign minister Charles François Dumouriez, who sought a war which might restore some popularity and authority to the King.

==1792==
===Invasion of the Austrian Netherlands===

Dumouriez prepared an invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, where he expected the local population to rise against Austrian rule. However, the revolution had thoroughly disorganized the French army, which had insufficient forces for the invasion. Its soldiers fled at the first sign of battle, deserting &quot;en masse&quot;, in one case murdering General Théobald Dillon. The French soldiers were insulted, hissed, even assaulted. The situation of the &quot;Flanders Campaign&quot; was alarming.

While the revolutionary government frantically raised fresh troops and reorganized its armies, an allied army under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick assembled at Koblenz on the Rhine. The invasion commenced in July 1792. The Duke then issued a declaration on 25 July 1792, which had been written by the brothers of Louis XVI, that declared his [Brunswick&#x27;s] intent to restore the King of France to his full powers, and to treat any person or town who opposed him as rebels to be condemned to death by martial law. This motivated the revolutionary army and government to oppose the Prussian invaders by any means necessary, and led almost immediately to the overthrow of the King by a crowd which stormed the Tuileries Palace.

===Prussian progress===

Brunswick&#x27;s army, composed mostly of Prussian veterans, crossed into French territory on 19 August and easily took the fortresses of Longwy and Verdun. But at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792 they came to a stalemate against Dumouriez and Kellermann in which the highly professional French artillery distinguished itself. Although the battle was a tactical draw, it bought time for the revolutionaries and gave a great boost to French morale. Furthermore, the Prussians, facing a campaign longer and more costly than predicted, decided against the cost and risk of continued fighting and determined to retreat from France to preserve their army.

===Fronts in Italy and Germany===
Meanwhile, the French had been successful on several other fronts, occupying the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice until the Massif de l&#x27;Authion, while General Custine invaded Germany, capturing Speyer, Worms and Mainz along the Rhine, and reaching as far as Frankfurt. Dumouriez went on the offensive in the Austrian Netherlands once again, winning a great victory over the Austrians at Jemappes on 6 November 1792, and occupying the entire country by the beginning of winter.

==1793==
On 21 January the revolutionary government executed Louis XVI after a trial. This united all European governments, including Spain, Naples &amp; Sicily, and the Netherlands against the Revolution. France declared war against Britain and the Netherlands on 1 February 1793 and soon afterwards against Spain. In the course of the year 1793 the Holy Roman Empire (on 23 March), the kings of Portugal and Naples, and the Grand Duke of Tuscany declared war against France. Thus the First Coalition was formed.

===Introduction of conscription===
France introduced a new levy of hundreds of thousands of men, beginning a French policy of using &quot;levée en masse&quot; (mass conscription) to deploy more of its manpower than the other states could, and remaining on the offensive so that these mass armies could commandeer war material from the territory of their enemies. The Girondin faction of the French government sent Citizen Genet to the United States to encourage them to enter the war on France&#x27;s side. The newly formed nation refused, and the Washington administration&#x27;s 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality threatened legal action against any citizen providing assistance to any side in the conflict.

After a victory in the Battle of Neerwinden in March, the Austrians suffered twin defeats at the battles of Wattignies and Wissembourg. British land forces were defeated at the Battle of Hondschoote in September.

==1794==

===Battle of Fleurus===

1794 brought increased success to the revolutionary armies. A major victory against combined coalition forces at the Battle of Fleurus gained all of the Austrian Netherlands and the Rhineland for France. Although the British navy maintained its supremacy at sea, it was unable to support effectively any land operations after the fall of the Belgian provinces. The Prussians were slowly driven out of the eastern provinces and by the end of the year they had retired from any active part in the war. Against Spain, the French made successful incursions into both Catalonia and Navarre in the War of the Pyrenees.

===Actions in the West Indies===
Action extended into the French colonies in the West Indies. A British fleet occupied Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe, although a French fleet arrived later in the year and recovered the latter by ousting the invaders.

==1795==
===French capture of the Low Countries===

After seizing the Low Countries in a surprise winter attack, France established the Batavian Republic as a puppet state. Even before the close of 1794 Prussia retired from any active part in the war, and on 5 April 1795 King Frederick William II concluded with France the Peace of Basel, which recognized France&#x27;s occupation of the left bank of the Rhine. The new French-dominated Dutch government bought peace by surrendering Dutch territory to the south of that river. A treaty of peace between France and Spain followed in July. The grand duke of Tuscany had been admitted to terms in February. The coalition thus fell into ruin and France proper would be free from invasion for many years.

===Battle of Quiberon===
Britain attempted to reinforce the rebels in the Vendée by landing French Royalist troops at Quiberon, but failed, and attempts to overthrow the government in Paris by force were foiled by the military garrison led by Napoleon Bonaparte, leading to the establishment of the Directory.

===Battle of Mainz===

On the Rhine frontier, General Pichegru, negotiating with the exiled Royalists, betrayed his army and forced the evacuation of Mannheim and the failure of the siege of Mainz by Jourdan.

==1796==
The French prepared a great advance on three fronts, with Jourdan and Jean Victor Marie Moreau on the Rhine and the newly promoted Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy. The three armies were to link up in Tyrol and march on Vienna.

===Rhine campaign===
In the Rhine campaign of 1796, Jourdan and Moreau crossed the Rhine river and advanced into Germany. Jourdan advanced as far as Amberg in late August while Moreau reached Bavaria and the edge of Tyrol by September. However Jourdan was defeated by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen and both armies were forced to retreat back across the Rhine.

===Invasion of Italy===
Napoleon, on the other hand, was successful in a daring invasion of Italy. In the Montenotte Campaign, he separated the armies of Sardinia and Austria, defeating each one in turn, and then forced a peace on Sardinia. Following this, his army captured Milan and started the Siege of Mantua. Bonaparte defeated successive Austrian armies sent against him under Johann Peter Beaulieu, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and József Alvinczi while continuing the siege.

===End of the War of the Vendée===
The rebellion in the Vendée was also crushed in 1796 by Louis Lazare Hoche. Hoche&#x27;s subsequent attempt to land a large invasion force in Munster to aid the United Irishmen was unsuccessful.

==1797==
===Battle of Mantua===

On 2 February Napoleon finally captured Mantua, with the Austrians surrendering 18,000 men. Archduke Charles of Austria was unable to stop Napoleon from invading the Tyrol, and the Austrian government sued for peace in April. At the same time, there was a new French invasion of Germany under Moreau and Hoche.

===Invasion of Great Britain===
On 22 February, a French invasion force consisting of 1,400 troops from the &quot;La Legion Noire&quot; (The Black Legion) under the command of Irish American Colonel William Tate landed near Fishguard in Wales. They were met by a quickly assembled group of around 500 British reservists, militia and sailors under the command of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor. After brief clashes with the local civilian population and Lord Cawdor&#x27;s forces on 23 February, Tate was forced into an unconditional surrender by 24 February. This would be the only battle fought on British soil during the Revolutionary Wars.

===Austrian peace===
Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October, ceding Belgium to France and recognizing French control of the Rhineland and much of Italy. The ancient Republic of Venice was partitioned between Austria and France. This ended the War of the First Coalition, although Great Britain and France remained at war.

<doc id="176742" wikidata="Q342723" url="?curid=176742" title="Gene Autry">
<text>Orvon Grover &quot;Gene&quot; Autry (September 29, 1907 – October 2, 1998), nicknamed the Singing Cowboy, was an American actor, musician, singer, composer, rodeo performer, and baseball team owner, who largely gained fame by singing in a crooning style on radio, in films, and on television for more than three decades, beginning in the early 1930s. During that time, he personified the straight-shooting hero — honest, brave, and true.

Autry was the owner of a television station and several radio stations in Southern California. From 1961 to 1997, he was the founding owner of the California Angels franchise of Major League Baseball (MLB).

From 1934 to 1953, Autry appeared in 93 motion pictures. Between 1950 and 1956, he hosted &quot;The Gene Autry Show&quot; television series. In many of them, he appeared with Champion, his Morgan horse.

Autry was also one of the most important pioneering figures in the history of country music, considered the second major influential artist of the genre&#x27;s development after Jimmie Rodgers. His films were the first media vehicle to carry Western music to a nationwide audience.

In addition to his signature song &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;, as well as his recording hit &quot;At Mail Call Today&quot;, Autry is still remembered for his association with Christmas music, having debuted the seasonal standards &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, and &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot;.

Autry is a member of both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for film, television, music, radio, and live performance.

The town of Gene Autry, Oklahoma was named in his honor, as was the Gene Autry precinct in Mesa, Arizona.

== Life and career ==
=== Early years ===
Autry was born September 29, 1907, near Tioga in Grayson County, Texas, the grandson of a Methodist preacher. His parents, Delbert Autry and Elnora Ozment, moved in the 1920s to Ravia in Johnston County in southern Oklahoma. Gene Autry worked on his father&#x27;s ranch while growing up and going to school. In 1925, Autry left the family ranch. With only his high school education, Autry became a telegrapher for the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway. His talent at singing and playing guitar led to performing at local dances.

=== Singing career ===

While working as a telegraph operator in Chelsea, Oklahoma, Autry would sing and accompany himself on the guitar to pass the lonely hours, especially when he had the midnight shift. This later got him fired. One night, he was encouraged to sing professionally by a customer, humorist Will Rogers, who had heard him singing.

As soon as he could save money to travel, he went to New York. In the autumn of 1928, he auditioned for the Victor Talking Machine Company, shortly before purchase by David Sarnoff&#x27;s Radio Corporation of America (RCA). According to Nathaniel Shilkret, director of Light Music for Victor at the time, Autry asked to speak to Shilkret after finding that he had been turned down. Shilkret explained to Autry that he was turned down not because of his voice, but because Victor had just made contracts with two similar singers. Autry left with a letter of introduction from Shilkret and the advice to sing on radio to gain experience and to come back in a year or two. In 1928, Autry was singing on Tulsa radio station KVOO (now KOTV) as &quot;Oklahoma&#x27;s Yodeling Cowboy&quot;. The Victor archives show an October 9, 1929, entry stating that the vocal duet of Jimmie Long and Gene Autry with two Hawaiian guitars, directed by L. L. Watson, recorded &quot;My Dreaming of You&quot; (Matrix 56761) and &quot;My Alabama Home&quot; (Matrix 56762).

Autry signed a recording deal with Columbia Records in 1929. He worked in Chicago on the WLS-AM radio show &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; for four years, and with his own show, where he met singer-songwriter Smiley Burnette. In his early recording career, Autry covered various genres, including a labor song, &quot;The Death of Mother Jones&quot;, in 1931.

Autry also recorded many &quot;hillbilly&quot;-style records in 1930 and 1931 in New York City, which were certainly different in style and content from his later recordings. These were much closer in style to the Prairie Ramblers or Dick Justice, and included the &quot;Do Right, Daddy Blues&quot; and &quot;Black Bottom Blues&quot;, both similar to &quot;Deep Elem Blues&quot;. These late Prohibition-era songs deal with bootlegging, corrupt police, and women whose occupation was certainly vice. These recordings are generally not heard today, but are available on European import labels, such as JSP Records. His first hit was in 1932 with &quot;That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine&quot;, a duet with fellow railroad man Jimmy Long that Autry and Long co-wrote.

As Autry&#x27;s movie career flourished, so did his record sales. His unofficial theme song became the Ray Whitley composition &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;. Autry made 640 recordings, including more than 300 songs written or co-written by himself. His records sold more than 100 million copies and he has more than a dozen gold and platinum records, including the first record ever certified gold.

Today&#x27;s listeners associate Gene Autry with Christmas songs, which are played perennially during each holiday season. These include &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, his own composition &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, &quot;Up on the Housetop&quot;, and his biggest hit, &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. He wrote &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot; after being the Grand Marshal of the 1946 Santa Claus Lane Parade (now the Hollywood Christmas Parade). He heard all of the spectators watching the parade saying, &quot;Here comes Santa Claus!&quot; virtually handing him the title for his song. He recorded his version of the song in 1947 and it became an instant classic.

In the late 1950s he began recording other artists, as the original owner of Challenge Records. The label&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Tequila&quot; by The Champs in 1958, which started the rock and roll instrumental craze of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He sold the label soon after, but the maroon (later green) label has the &quot;GA&quot; in a shield above the label name.

=== Film career ===

Autry and Burnette were discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934. Together, Autry and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. in &quot;In Old Santa Fe&quot; as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial &quot;The Phantom Empire&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the newly formed Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940. Most were low-budget Westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Smiley Burnette as his regular sidekick, and had many opportunities to sing in each film. His films were tremendously successful, so much so that almost every other studio tried to compete by showcasing their own singing cowboys. By 1940 Autry was Republic&#x27;s biggest star, and his films became more costly and more elaborate. They played first-run in large cities, unlike the usual &quot;B&quot; westerns that played in neighborhood theaters.
In the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Autry was listed every year from the first poll in 1936 to 1942 and 1946 to 1954 (he was serving in the AAF 1943–45), holding first place 1937 to 1942, and second place (after Roy Rogers) 1947 to 1954, when the poll ceased. He appeared in the similar &quot;Boxoffice&quot; poll from 1936 to 1955, holding first place from 1936 to 1942 and second place (after Rogers) from 1943 to 1952. While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Autry also appeared in the Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll of all films from 1940 to 1942, His &quot;Gene Autry Flying &quot;A&quot; Ranch Rodeo&quot; show debuted in 1940.

Autry served in the U. S. Army Air Corps during World War II. Part of his military service included his broadcast of a radio show for one year; it involved music and true stories. Several decades ago on an early afternoon show featuring Republic westerns, one of Gene&#x27;s sidekicks said that when Gene told Republic Pictures of his intentions to join the military during World War II, Republic threatened to promote Roy Rogers as &quot;King of the Cowboys&quot; in Gene&#x27;s absence, which it did. Republic reissued old Autry westerns during the war years, to keep his name before the public.

Autry&#x27;s contract had been suspended for the duration of his military service, and he had tried to have it declared void after his discharge. The courts found in Republic&#x27;s favor, and Autry returned to Republic after the war. He finished out his contract with four more features, with Autry now publicized as &quot;King of the Singing Cowboys&quot;.

In 1947 Autry left Republic for Columbia Pictures, which offered him his own production unit. He chose a new sidekick, Pat Buttram, recently returned from his World War II service. Buttram would co-star with Gene Autry in more than 40 films and in more than 100 episodes of Autry&#x27;s television show. In 1951, Autry formed his own company (Flying A Productions) to make westerns under his own control, and Columbia continued to distribute them through 1953.

==== Melody Ranch ====
Autry purchased the 110-acre Monogram Ranch in 1953, in Placerita Canyon near Newhall, California, in the northern San Gabriel Mountains foothills. He renamed it the Melody Ranch after his movie &quot;Melody Ranch&quot;. Autry then sold 98 acres of the property, most of the original ranch. The Western town, adobes, and ranch cabin sets and open land for location shooting were retained as a movie ranch on 12 acres. Numerous &quot;B&quot; Westerns and TV shows were shot there during Autry&#x27;s ownership, including the initial years of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; with James Arness. A decade after he purchased Melody Ranch, a brushfire swept through in August 1962, destroying most of the original standing sets and dashing Autry&#x27;s plans to turn it into a museum. However, the devastated landscape did prove useful for productions such as &quot;Combat!&quot;. A complete adobe ranch survived at the northeast section of the ranch.

According to a published story by Autry, the fire caused him to turn his attention to Griffith Park, where he would build his Museum of Western Heritage (now known as the Autry Museum of the American West).

In 1990, after his favorite horse Champion Three, which lived in retirement there, died, Autry put the remaining 12-acre ranch up for sale. It was purchased by the Veluzat family in 1991 and rebuilt. It is now known as the Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio and Melody Ranch Studios on 22 acres. The ranch has the Melody Ranch Museum open year-round; and one weekend a year, the entire ranch is open to the public during the Cowboy Poetry and Music Festival, another legacy of Autry&#x27;s multiple talents.

=== Radio and television career ===

From 1940 to 1956, Autry had a huge hit with a weekly show on CBS Radio, &quot;Gene Autry&#x27;s Melody Ranch&quot;. His horse, Champion, also had a Mutual radio series, &quot;The Adventures of Champion&quot; and a CBS-TV series of the same name. In response to his many young radio listeners aspiring to emulate him, Autry created the Cowboy Code, or Ten Cowboy Commandments. These tenets promoting an ethical, moral, and patriotic lifestyle that appealed to youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts, which developed similar doctrines. The Cowboy Code consisted of rules that were &quot;a natural progression of Gene&#x27;s philosophies going back to his first &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; programs—and early pictures.&quot; According to the code:
# The Cowboy must never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage.
# He must never go back on his word, or a trust confided in him.
# He must always tell the truth.
# He must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals.
# He must not advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas.
# He must help people in distress.
# He must be a good worker.
# He must keep himself clean in thought, speech, action, and personal habits.
# He must respect women, parents, and his nation&#x27;s laws.
# The Cowboy is a patriot.

Beginning in 1950, he produced and starred in his own television show on [CBS through his Flying A Productions studio. In the late 1950s, Autry also made several appearances on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Jubilee USA&quot;.

=== Military career ===
During World War II, Autry enlisted in the United States Army in 1942, and became a tech sergeant in the United States Army Air Corps. Holding a private pilot certificate, he was determined to become a military pilot and earned his Service Pilot rating in June 1944, serving as a C-109 transport pilot with the rank of flight officer. Assigned to a unit of the Air Transport Command, he flew as part of the dangerous airlift operation over the Himalayas between India and China, nicknamed the Hump.

=== Rodeo ===

In 1941, at the height of his screen popularity, Autry had a string of rodeo stock based north of Ardmore, Oklahoma. It was known as the Flying A Ranch and encompassed 1200 acres. It served as headquarters for his traveling rodeo. The nearby town of Berwyn, then honored Autry by naming the town after him. Thirty Five thousand people attended the ceremony on November 16, 1941. A year later, he became a partner in the World Championship Rodeo Company, which furnished livestock for many of the country&#x27;s major rodeos. In 1954, he acquired Montana&#x27;s top bucking string from the estate of Leo J. Cremer Sr., and put Canadian saddle bronc riding champion Harry Knight in charge of the operation. A merger with the World Championship Rodeo Company in 1956 made Autry the sole owner. He moved the entire company to a ranch near Fowler, Colorado, with Knight as the working partner in the operation. For the next 12 years, they provided livestock for most of the major rodeos in Texas, Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska. When the company was sold in 1968, both men continued to be active in rodeo. For his work as a livestock contractor, Autry was inducted into the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association&#x27;s ProRodeo Hall of Fame in 1979. Autry received several honors for his contributions to rodeo.

=== Gene Autry comics ===
Gene Autry was often portrayed in the comics, primarily during the heyday of Western-themed comics, the 1940s and 1950s.

The Register and Tribune Syndicate comic strip &quot;Gene Autry Rides&quot; by Till Goodan was the first entry, lasting from 1940 to 1941. From 1941 to 1943, Autry was the subject of a comic book initially published by Fawcett Comics and then picked up by Dell Comics that ran 12 issues. Dell then published 101 issues of &quot;Gene Autry Comics&quot; from 1946 to 1955. That title was changed to &quot;Gene Autry and Champion&quot;, and ran an additional 20 issues from 1955 to 1959, making it the longest-running (by number of issues) cowboy actor comic book.

Meanwhile, Autry was the subject of an &quot;Air-Western-Adventure Strip&quot; comic strip syndicated by General Features from 1952 to 1955. The strip was produced in association with Whitman Publishing.

The Mexican publisher Editorial Novaro released 423 issues of &quot;Gene Autry&quot; comics from 1954 to 1984.

=== Toys ===
In 1937, Kenton Hardware Company of Kenton, Ohio, began producing Gene Autry cast-iron cap guns as a part of its line of iron toys. The toy was commissioned by Kenton vice-president Willard Bixler, who had conceptualized an iron cap revolver modeled after the pearl-handled gun used by Gene Autry. Selling at 50 cents per gun, the cap pistols were extremely popular and by 1939, two million units of the toy had been sold in the United States and abroad. Autry received a portion of all sales revenues.

=== Baseball ===

In the 1950s, Autry had been a minority owner of the minor-league Hollywood Stars. In 1960, when Major League Baseball announced plans to add an expansion team in Los Angeles, Autry—who had once declined an opportunity to play in the minor leagues—expressed an interest in acquiring the radio broadcast rights to the team&#x27;s games. Baseball executives were so impressed by his approach that he was persuaded to become the owner of the franchise rather than simply its broadcast partner. The team, initially called the Los Angeles Angels upon its 1961 debut, moved to suburban Anaheim in 1966, and was renamed the California Angels, then the Anaheim Angels from 1997 until 2005, when it became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Autry served as vice president of the American League from 1983 until his death. In 1995, he sold a quarter share of the team to the Walt Disney Company and a controlling interest the following year, with the remaining share to be transferred after his death. Earlier, in 1982, he sold Los Angeles television station KTLA for $245 million. He also sold several radio stations he owned, including KSFO in San Francisco, KMPC in Los Angeles, KOGO in San Diego, and other stations in the Golden West radio network.

The number 26 was retired by the Angels in Autry&#x27;s honor. The chosen number reflected that baseball&#x27;s rosters (at the time) had 25 men, so Autry&#x27;s unflagging support for his team made him the &quot;26th man&quot; (see also the &quot;12th man&quot;, a similar concept in football). When the Angels finally won their first (and to date, only) World Series championship in 2002, star outfielder Tim Salmon held Autry&#x27;s cowboy hat aloft during the on-field celebration, and the public address system played his hit song, &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;.

===Hotels===
He invested in property, owning by 1964 the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco; the Hotel Continental in Hollywood; the Sahara Inn, a $12-million motel near Chicago; plus property in Palm Springs.

=== Retirement ===
Autry retired from show business in 1964, having made almost 100 films up to 1955 and over 600 records. He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1969 and to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970. After retiring, he invested widely in real estate, radio, and television. He also invested in ownership of the KOOL-TV CBS-affiliate (now Fox affiliate KSAZ-TV) in Phoenix, Arizona, which created local shows such as the weekly bilingual children&#x27;s show &quot;Niños Contentos&quot;.

Republic Pictures, its finances failing, had shut down production in 1957. By the late 1960s Republic was barely operational, managing only its film library. Gene Autry, correctly assessing the company&#x27;s cash-poor situation, made a cash offer for the rights and negatives to his Republic films. The company accepted Autry&#x27;s terms, and Autry now controlled the film materials for home-movie reprints and home-video tapes and discs.

=== Death ===

Autry died of lymphoma on October 2, 1998, at his home in Studio City, California. He was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. His epitaph read, &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Cowboy ... American Hero, Philanthropist, Patriot and Veteran, Movie Star, Singer, Composer, Baseball Fan and Owner, 33rd Degree Mason, Media Entrepreneur, Loving Husband, Gentleman&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1932, Autry married Ina Mae Spivey, the niece of Jimmy Long. During this marriage he had a sustained affair with Gail Davis, the actress who played Annie Oakley in the television series of the same name that Autry produced. After Spivey died in 1980, he married Jacqueline Ellam, who had been his banker, in 1981.

While Autry was quiet about his political views during his life, his voting records listed him as a registered Republican, and he supported the Civil Rights Movement.

Autry was raised into Freemasonry in 1927 at Catoosa Lodge No. 185, Catoosa Oklahoma. He later became a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Mason, as recorded on his headstone.

== Legacy ==

On November 16, 1941, the town of Berwyn, Oklahoma, north of Ardmore, was renamed Gene Autry in his honor. Though Autry was born in Tioga, Texas, his family moved to Oklahoma while he was an infant. He was raised in the southern Oklahoma towns of Achille and Ravia. Autry had also worked as a telegraph operator near Berwyn. In 1939, he bought the Flying A Ranch on the west edge of Berwyn, and the town decided to honor him by changing its name. Approximately 35,000 people attended the ceremonies broadcast live from the site on Autry&#x27;s &quot;Melody Ranch&quot; radio show. Expectations that Autry would make his permanent home on the ranch were heightened when Autry&#x27;s house in California burned down just 8 days before the name change ceremony, but dashed three weeks later with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Autry
joined the military in 1942 and sold the ranch after the war.

In 1972, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Autry was a life member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Burbank Lodge No. 1497. His 1976 autobiography, co-written by Mickey Herskowitz, was titled &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot; after his 1939 hit and signature tune. He is also featured year after year, on radio and &quot;shopping mall music&quot; at the holiday season, by his recording of &quot;Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. &quot;Rudolph&quot; became the first No. 1 hit of the 1950s. In 2003, he was ranked No. 38 in CMT&#x27;s list of the &quot;40 Greatest Men of Country Music&quot;.

In 1977, Autry was awarded the American Patriots Medal by Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

Johnny Cash recorded a song in 1978 about Autry called &quot;Who is Gene Autry?&quot; Cash also got Autry to sign his famous black Martin D-35 guitar, which he plays in the video of &quot;Hurt&quot;.

In 1983, Autry received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Autry was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1991.

When the Anaheim Angels won their first World Series in 2002, much of the championship was dedicated to him. The interchange of Interstate 5 and State Route 134, near the Autry National Center in Los Angeles, is signed as the &quot;Gene Autry Memorial Interchange&quot;. There is also a street named after Autry in Anaheim, California, called Gene Autry Way, and there is a street in Palm Springs, California named Gene Autry Trail.

Autry was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2004, Starz joined forces with the Autry estate to restore all of his films, which have been shown on Starz&#x27;s Encore Westerns channel on premium television on a regular basis to date since.

In 2007, he became a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana.

In May 2019, Warner Chappell Music acquired the Gene Autry Music Group, a music publisher comprising four smaller publishers, 1,500 compositions (including &quot;Back in the Saddle Again&quot;, &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot;, &quot;Just Walkin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;You Belong To Me&quot;), and several of Autry&#x27;s master recordings.

=== Hollywood Walk of Fame ===

Autry is the only person to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories defined by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. All of Autry&#x27;s stars are located along Hollywood Boulevard: Recording at 6384, Radio at 6520, Motion pictures at 6644, Television at 6667, and Live theatre at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard. His first four stars were placed during the initial inductions of 1960 while the final one was placed in 1987, in the additional category named &quot;Live theatre&quot;—later renamed &quot;Live performance&quot;—introduced in 1984.

=== Museum of the American West ===
The Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles&#x27; Griffith Park was founded in 1988 as the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum featuring much of Autry&#x27;s personal collection of Western art and memorabilia as well as collections of his friends and other Western film stars. Since 2004, the museum is partnered with the Southwest Museum of the American Indian and is divided into two locations, eight miles apart from each other.

=== Holiday 100 chart entries ===
Since many radio stations in the US adopt a format change to Christmas music each December, many holiday hits have an annual spike in popularity during the last few weeks of the year and are retired once the season is over. In December 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; began a Holiday Songs chart with 50 positions that monitors the last five weeks of each year to &quot;rank the top holiday hits of all eras using the same methodology as the Hot 100, blending streaming, airplay, and sales data&quot;, and in 2013, the number of positions on the chart was doubled, resulting in the Holiday 100. A few Autry recordings have made appearances on the Holiday 100 and are noted below according to the holiday season in which they charted there.

<text>Hibernian Football Club (), commonly known as Hibs, is a professional football club in Edinburgh, Scotland. The team competes in the Scottish Premiership, the top division of Scottish football. The club was founded in 1875 by members of Edinburgh&#x27;s Irish community, and the name is derived from the Latin for Ireland. The Irish heritage of Hibernian is reflected in the name, colours and badge of the club. The green main shirt colour is usually accompanied by white sleeves and shorts. Their local rivals are Heart of Midlothian, with whom they contest the Edinburgh derby.

Home matches are played at Easter Road, which has been in use since 1893, when the club joined the Scottish Football League. The name of the club is regularly shortened to &quot;Hibs&quot;, with the team also being known as &quot;The Hibees&quot; (pronounced ) and supporters known as &quot;Hibbies&quot;. Another nickname is &quot;The Cabbage&quot;, derived from the shortened rhyming slang for Hibs (&quot;Cabbage and Ribs&quot;).

Hibernian have won the Scottish league championship four times, most recently in 1952. Three of those four championships were won between 1948 and 1952, when the club had the services of The Famous Five forward line. The club have won the Scottish Cup three times, in 1887, 1902 and 2016, with the latter victory ending a notorious drought. Hibs have also won the Scottish League Cup three times, in 1972, 1991 and 2007. Hibernian reached the semi-final of the first ever European Cup in 1955–56, becoming the first British side to participate in European competition. They reached the same stage of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1960–61.

==History==

===Foundation and early history (1875–1939)===
The club was founded in 1875 by Irishmen living in the Cowgate area of Edinburgh. The name &quot;Hibernian&quot; (deriving from Hibernia, an ancient name for Ireland), the colour green, the Celtic harp and the Irish language phrase &quot;Erin go bragh&quot; (meaning &quot;Ireland Forever&quot;) were adopted as symbols early on. Founder Fr. Edward Joseph Hannan was the first president of the club and Michael Whelahan its first team captain. James Connolly, the famous socialist and Irish Republican leader, was a Hibs fan, while the club were &quot;closely identified&quot; with the Irish Home Rule movement during the 1880s. There was some sectarian resistance initially to an Irish club participating in Scottish football, but Hibs established themselves as a force in Scottish football in the 1880s. Hibs were the first club from the east coast of Scotland to win a major trophy, the 1887 Scottish Cup. They went on to defeat Preston North End, who had reached the semi-finals of the 1887 FA Cup, in a friendly match described as the &quot;Association Football Championship of the World Decider&quot;.

Mismanagement over the next few years led to Hibs becoming homeless and the club temporarily ceased operating in 1891. A lease on the Easter Road site was acquired in late 1892 and Hibs played its first match at Easter Road on 4 February 1893. Despite this interruption, the club today views the period since 1875 as one continued history and therefore counts the honours won between 1875 and 1891, including the 1887 Scottish Cup. The club were admitted to the Scottish Football League in 1893, although they had to win the Second Division twice before being elected into the First Division in 1895.

A significant change at this time was that players were no longer required to be members of the Catholic Young Men&#x27;s Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, as it was in the early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club&#x27;s identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography as well as ethnicity and religion shapes the modern fan base of the club, with Hibs drawing most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.

Hibs had some success after being reformed, winning the 1902 Scottish Cup and their first league championship a year later. After this, however, the club endured a long barren spell. The club lost its placing in the league and were relegated for the first time in 1931, although they were promoted back to the top division two years later. The notorious Scottish Cup drought began as they reached three cup finals, two in consecutive years, but lost each of them.

===The Famous Five (1939–1959)===
Hibs&#x27; most successful era was in the decade following the end of the Second World War, when it was &quot;among the foremost clubs in Britain&quot;. The forward line of Gordon Smith, Bobby Johnstone, Lawrie Reilly, Eddie Turnbull and Willie Ormond, collectively known as the Famous Five, was &quot;regarded as the finest ever seen in Scottish football&quot;. Each of the Famous Five scored more than 100 goals for Hibs. The north stand at Easter Road is now named in their honour. Smith was signed by Hibs in 1941, while Ormond, Turnbull, Reilly and Johnstone were all signed during 1946. Of the five, only Ormond cost Hibs a transfer fee, £1200 from Stenhousemuir. Reilly, Johnstone, Smith and Turnbull were all signed from youth or junior leagues.

In the first season of competitive football after the Second World War, Hibs reached the 1947 Scottish Cup final. They took an early lead in the match, but went on to lose 2–1 to Aberdeen. With Reilly added to the first team in 1947–48, Hibs won the Scottish league championship for the first time since 1903. This was achieved despite the death of team manager Willie McCartney in January 1948. McCartney was succeeded by Hugh Shaw, who added Johnstone to the first team during 1948. Hibs finished third in the league in 1948–49. In a friendly match against Nithsdale Wanderers on 21 April 1949, Hibs included all of the famous five players in the same team for the first time. They then made their collective competitive debut on 15 October 1949, in a 2–0 win against Queen of the South. They improved on their season from the year before, by finishing second in the league to Rangers by one point.

1950–51 was the high point of the Famous Five era. With other internationalists such as Tommy Younger and Bobby Combe, Hibs won the league by 10 points (when two points were awarded for each win). They reached the 1950 Scottish League Cup final. Turnbull had scored a hattrick in the semi-final but was unavailable for the final. Jimmy Bradley started at left wing with Ormond moved to inside left. Motherwell beat them 3–0. Hibs retained the league championship in 1951–52, this time winning by four points. Hibs were narrowly denied a third consecutive title in 1952–53 on the last day of the season. A late Rangers equaliser against Queen of the South took the title to Ibrox on goal average. The Famous Five forward line remained in place until March 1955, when Johnstone was sold to Manchester City.
Despite only finishing fifth in the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs were invited to participate in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the floodlights necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. Floodlights had been used at Easter Road for the first time in a friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954. Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the English Football League secretary Alan Hardaker persuaded Chelsea, the English champions, not to enter.

Hibs played their first match against Rot-Weiss Essen, winning 4–0 in the Georg-Melches-Stadion and drawing 1–1 at Easter Road. They defeated Djurgårdens IF to reach the semi-final, but in that clash they were defeated 3–0 on aggregate by Stade de Reims, who had the famous France international player Raymond Kopa in their side. Reims lost 4–3 to Real Madrid in the final.

===Turnbull&#x27;s Tornadoes (1960–1989)===
Hibs frequently participated in the Fairs Cup during the 1960s, winning matches against Barcelona and Napoli. However, the club achieved little domestically until former player Eddie Turnbull was persuaded to return to Easter Road as manager in 1971. The team, popularly known as &quot;Turnbull&#x27;s Tornadoes&quot;, finished second in the league in 1974 and 1975 and won the League Cup in 1972. The club also won the Drybrough Cup in 1972 and 1973, and recorded a 7–0 win over Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts at Tynecastle on 1 January 1973.

Performances went into decline after the mid-1970s, as Hibs were replaced by the New Firm of Aberdeen and Dundee United as the main challengers to the Old Firm. Turnbull resigned as manager and Hibs were relegated, for the second time in their history, in 1980. They were immediately promoted back to the Scottish Premier Division in 1981, but the club struggled during the 1980s, failing to qualify for European competition until 1989.

===1990s: Attempted takeover by Hearts===
After mismanagement during the late 1980s, Hibs were on the brink of financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the &quot;Hands off Hibs&quot; group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control despite the fact that he had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.

===2000s: &quot;Golden generation&quot;===
Hibs enjoyed a good season in 2000–01 as they finished third in the league and reached the 2001 Scottish Cup final, which was lost 3–0 to Celtic. Manager Alex McLeish departed for Rangers in December 2001; team captain Franck Sauzée was appointed as the new manager, despite the fact that he had no previous coaching experience. A terrible run of form followed and Sauzée was fired after being in charge for 69 days.

Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson was then hired, but he proved to be unpopular with Hibs supporters. However, a &quot;golden generation&quot; of exciting young players emerged, including Garry O&#x27;Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup final, only to lose 2–0 to Livingston. Williamson departed near the end of that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. Hibs finished third in his first season as manager, while Mowbray won the SFWA Manager of the Year award.
Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 to manage West Bromwich Albion, and was replaced by former player John Collins. The team won the 2007 Scottish League Cup final under his management, but the club sold Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown and Steven Whittaker for fees totalling more than £8 million. Collins resigned later that year, frustrated by the lack of funds provided to sign new players. Former Hibs player Mixu Paatelainen was hired to replace Collins, but he left after the end of his first full season.

Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, was soon appointed in place of Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs to a good start to the 2009–10 season.

===2010s: Scottish Cup success===
Hibs finished fourth in 2010 and qualified for the Europa League, but a poor start to the 2010–11 season led to John Hughes leaving the club. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who was himself sacked a year later. The club avoided relegation in 2011–12 and reached the 2012 Scottish Cup final under new manager Pat Fenlon, but this was lost 5–1 to Hearts. Fenlon largely rebuilt the team after this defeat. This resulted in an improved league position in 2012–13 and the team reaching the 2013 Scottish Cup final, which was lost 3–0 to league champions Celtic. Hibs qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, but they suffered a Scottish record defeat in European competition (9–0 on aggregate against Malmö). Fenlon resigned on 1 November and was replaced by Terry Butcher. A run of 13 games without a win to finish the 2013–14 Scottish Premiership season meant that Hibs fell into a relegation play-off, which was lost after a penalty shootout against Hamilton Academical.

Butcher was sacked in June 2014 and was replaced by Alan Stubbs. He was unable to lead the team to promotion, but the 2015–16 season saw considerable cup success. The team reached the League Cup final, which was lost to Ross County. This was followed by victory in the Scottish Cup for the first time since 1902 with a 3–2 win in the final against Rangers. As well as ending the unwanted long-term cup record, the result helped shake off a reputation of Hibs building up expectations of success only to fail, popularised among opposing supporters and in Scottish media as having &#x27;Hibsed it&#x27;; the club&#x27;s own fans then adopted the phrase as a positive reference to the occasion though it would still be repeated in future when the club was seen as underachieving. Soon after the cup win, Stubbs resigned as Hibs manager to take charge at Rotherham United and was replaced by Neil Lennon, who led the team to promotion by winning the 2016–17 Scottish Championship. In their first season back in the top flight, Hibs finished fourth in the Premiership and qualified for the Europa League. Lennon left the club in January 2019 and was replaced by Paul Heckingbottom, who only held the post for seven months. Jack Ross was appointed on 15 November 2019.

===2020s: Managerial turnover===
Hibs finished seventh in a 2019–20 league season that was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the following season they finished third in the league and reached the 2021 Scottish Cup final, but this was lost 1–0 to St Johnstone. Ross guided Hibs to the League Cup final later that year, but was sacked 10 days before the final after a run of seven defeats in nine league games. Shaun Maloney was appointed as manager in December 2021, but was himself sacked four months later, having won six games out of nineteen. His successor, Lee Johnson, was appointed manager on 19 May 2022. Hibs finished fifth and qualified for European competition under Johnson, but his &quot;rollercoaster&quot; 15-month spell was ended when the team lost three consecutive games to start the 2023–24 league season.

==Colours and badge==
The predominant club colours are green and white, which have been used since the formation of the club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten a boycott of Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.

Hibs wore green and white hooped shirts during the 1870s, which was the inspiration for the style later adopted by Celtic. Hibs then wore all-green shirts from 1879 until 1938, when white sleeves were added to the shirts. This was similar in style to Arsenal, who had added white sleeves to their red shirts earlier in the 1930s. The colour of the shorts was changed to a green which matched the shirts in 2004, to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of a friendly win in October 1964 against Real Madrid. Green shorts were used in that match to avoid a colour clash with the all-white colours of Real Madrid. Hibs also used green shorts in the 2006–07, 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons. For the 2012–13 season, Hibs changed the primary colour of the shirts to a darker &quot;bottle&quot; green, instead of the normal emerald green. A darker green had been used until the 1930s. For the 2014–15 season, Hibs removed the traditional white sleeves from their home kit, as they changed to a darker green shirt in commemoration of the Famous Five forward line.

The badge used to identify the club has changed frequently over the years, which has reflected an ongoing debate about its identity. This debate has centred on whether its Irish heritage should be proudly displayed, or ignored for fear of being accused of sectarianism. The Irish harp was first removed in the 1950s, then re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. Scottish Football Museum director Ged O&#x27;Brien said in 2001, that the current design shows that Hibs &quot;are comfortable with all the strands of their tradition – it has Leith, Edinburgh and Ireland in it.&quot; As well as the harp representing Ireland, the present badge includes a ship (for the port of Leith) and a castle (as in Edinburgh Castle).

==Stadium==
Hibs played on The Meadows for the first two years of their history, before moving to grounds in Newington (Mayfield Park) and Bonnington Road, Leith (Powderhall), in different spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as Hibernian Park, on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. Hibs failed to secure the ground lease and a builder started constructing houses on the site in 1890. Hibs obtained a lease on a site that is now known as Easter Road in 1892 and have played their home matches there since February 1893.

Before the Taylor Report demanded that the stadium be all-seated, Easter Road had vast banks of terracing on three sides, which meant that it could hold crowds in excess of 60,000. The record attendance of 65,860, which is also a record for a football match played in Edinburgh, was set by an Edinburgh derby played on 2 January 1950. Such vast crowds were drawn by the success of the Famous Five.

The pitch had a pronounced slope, but this was removed in 2000. The ground is currently all-seated and has a capacity of . Easter Road is a modern stadium, with all four of its stands having been built since 1995. The most recent redevelopment was the construction of a new East Stand in 2010.

Scotland have played seven of their home matches at Easter Road, between 1998 and 2017. Scotland women played their first match at Easter Road in August 2019, a Euro 2022 qualifying match against Cyprus. The ground has hosted one international not involving the Scotland teams, a friendly played between Ghana and South Korea preceding the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Easter Road has also sometimes been used as a neutral venue for Scottish League Cup semi-final matches and once hosted a Scottish Challenge Cup final.

==Rivalry==

Hibs have a traditional local rivalry in Edinburgh with Hearts; the derby match between the two clubs is one of the oldest rivalries in world football. Graham Spiers has described it as &quot;one of the jewels of the Scottish game&quot;. The clubs first met on Christmas Day 1875, when Hearts won 1–0 in the first match ever contested by Hibs. The two clubs became distinguished in Edinburgh after a five-game struggle for the Edinburgh Football Association Cup in 1878, which Hearts finally won with a 3–2 victory after four successive draws. The clubs have met each other in two Scottish Cup finals, in 1896 and 2012, both of which were won by Hearts. The 1896 match was the only Scottish Cup Final to be played outside Glasgow.

Both clubs have been champions of Scotland four times, although Hearts have the better record in derby matches. Hibs recorded the biggest derby win in a competitive match when they won 7–0 at Tynecastle on New Year&#x27;s Day 1973. While it has been noted that religious, ethnic or political background lies behind the rivalry, that aspect is &quot;muted&quot; and is a &quot;pale reflection&quot; of the sectarianism in Glasgow. Although the clubs are inescapable rivals, the rivalry is mainly &quot;good-natured&quot; and has had beneficial effects.

==Supporters and culture==
Hibernian are one of only two full-time professional football clubs in Edinburgh, which is the capital of and second largest city in Scotland. The club had the fourth largest average attendance in the Scottish leagues during the 2022–23 season (17,469). In the period after the Second World War, Hibs attracted average attendances in excess of 20,000, peaking at 31,567 in the 1951–52 season. Since Easter Road was redeveloped into an all-seater stadium in the mid-1990s, average attendance has varied between a high of 18,124 in 2017–18 and a low of 9,150 in 2003–04. There has been a significant increase in recent seasons, inspired by the Scottish Cup victory in 2016 and promotion in 2017. In the 1980s and 1990s, a minority of the club&#x27;s supporters had a reputation as one of Britain&#x27;s most prominent casuals groups, known as the Capital City Service.

===Literature===
The works of author Irvine Welsh, particularly &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, contain several references to Hibernian. The team is often mentioned in casual conversation and is the team many of his characters support. Visual references to Hibs are noticeable in Danny Boyle&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;; Francis Begbie wears a Hibs shirt while he plays five-a-side football, while many Hibs posters and pictures can be seen on the walls of Mark Renton&#x27;s bedroom.

In the final short story of Welsh&#x27;s &quot;The Acid House&quot;, Coco Bryce, a boy from the &quot;Hibs firm&quot; Capital City Service, is struck by lightning while under the influence of LSD in a Pilton park. His soul is then transferred to the body of an unborn child from one of the more affluent areas of Edinburgh. The appearances by Hibs in the 2012 and 2016 Scottish Cup finals are described in Welsh&#x27;s novels &quot;A Decent Ride&quot; and &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Trousers&quot; respectively.

Hibernian are also frequently referred to in the Inspector Rebus series of detective novels by Ian Rankin. Rankin has stated that Rebus is a Raith Rovers supporter but he is a Hibs fan in the 2000s television adaptation of the series. That version of Rebus is played by a Hearts supporter, Ken Stott. DS Siobhan Clarke, his colleague in the later books, is a &quot;loyal supporter&quot; of Hibs.

===Music===
The Hibs anthem &quot;Glory, Glory to the Hibees&quot; was written and performed by the Scottish comedian, Hector Nicol. Former Marillion singer Fish is a Hibs fan; Easter Road is mentioned in the song &quot;Lucky&quot;, from the album &quot;Internal Exile&quot;. The Proclaimers are lifelong Hibs fans and were heavily involved with the &#x27;Hands off Hibs&#x27; campaign to save the club in 1990. &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; has become a Hibs anthem, which is traditionally played after big victories at Easter Road and the finals of cup competitions. In their song &quot;Cap in Hand&quot;, from the &quot;Sunshine on Leith&quot; album, The Proclaimers make a reference to the Hibs player Andy Goram:
The song &quot;Joyful Kilmarnock Blues&quot;, from the first Proclaimers&#x27; album, is about a Hibs victory away from home.
===Television===
Hibs are featured in the TV series &quot;Succession,&quot; during episode &quot;Dundee&quot; in the second season&quot;,&quot; when Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) purchases Hearts believing them to be his father&#x27;s favourite football team. Upon receiving the gift Logan Roy reveals he is a Hibs supporter.

===Video games===

Grove Street and the Ballas, two rival gangs in the 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, dress in green and maroon clothes respectively. Since Grand Theft Auto developer Rockstar North is based in Edinburgh, fans believe this to be a reference to Hibernian and their Edinburgh derby rivals Heart of Midlothian.

==Ownership and finances==
Although the football club was formed in 1875, it was not incorporated until 1903. The club remained a private company until 1988, when it was publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange. This public listing, combined with poor financial performance, made Hibs vulnerable to an attempted takeover in 1990 by Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer. This attempt was averted when Mercer was unable to acquire the 75% shareholding needed to liquidate the company. The club&#x27;s parent company, Forth Investments plc, entered receivership in 1991 and Sir Tom Farmer acquired control of the club from the receiver for £3 million. Farmer funded redevelopments of Easter Road and financial losses made by Hibs, although he delegated control to other figures such as Rod Petrie.

In December 2014, the club said it intended to sell up to 51% ownership of the club to its supporters. By November 2017, supporters had increased their shareholding in the club to 34%. The majority ownership of the club was sold in July 2019 to Peruvian-born US-based businessman Ronald Gordon, who became the executive chairman. On 21 February 2023 Hibernian announced that Gordon had died of cancer at the age of 68, and his majority shareholding was passed to his family.

The agm held in February 2024 ratified a deal with Black Knight, the majority shareholder of English club AFC Bournemouth. The result of the deal is that the Gordon family will retain majority control (60%), with Black Knight acquiring 25% for a £6 million investment. Minority shareholders, such as fans group Hibernian Supporters Limited, saw their holdings diluted.

===Women&#x27;s team===
The club that became the Hibernian women&#x27;s team was founded in 1997 by Iain Johnston and Paul Johnston, but for the initial two seasons of its existence the club was under the auspices of Preston Athletic. The name changed to Hibernian Ladies in 1999 and they became one of the leading women&#x27;s teams in Scotland.

Hibernian won the Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup in 2010, for the fifth time in eight years. Their success in the national cup competition was contrasted to the male affiliate, who went over a century without winning the equivalent competition until their victory in 2016. Hibernian Ladies won domestic cup doubles in 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Ahead of the 2020 season, the club was rebranded as Hibernian Women and players were offered their first part-time professional contracts. The women&#x27;s first team was fully integrated into the men&#x27;s club in July 2022, with the youth sides still being run by the Hibernian Community Foundation.

==Noted players==

Lewis Stevenson holds the record for most league appearances for Hibs, passing 450 in 2023, taking the place of Arthur Duncan who made 446. All of the Famous Five – Gordon Smith, Eddie Turnbull, Lawrie Reilly, Bobby Johnstone and Willie Ormond – scored more than 100 league goals for Hibs.

Hibernian players have been capped at full international level for 30 different national teams, with 68 Hibernian players appearing for Scotland. Hibernian rank fifth amongst all clubs in providing players for Scotland, behind the Old Firm, Hearts and Queen&#x27;s Park. James Lundie and James McGhee were the first Hibs players to play for Scotland, in an 1885–86 British Home Championship match against Wales. Lawrie Reilly holds the record for most international caps earned while a Hibs player, making 38 appearances for Scotland between 1949 and 1957. In 1959, Hibs forward Joe Baker became the first player who had not previously played for an English club to win a cap for England.

To mark the club&#x27;s 135th birthday, the club created a Hall of Fame in 2010. The first group of nominees, including 13 former players, were inducted at a dinner later that year.

==Noted managers==

From 1875 until 1903, Hibs were managed by a committee, although Dan McMichael, who also acted as treasurer, secretary and physiotherapist, was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 Scottish Cup and the 1903 league championship. Willie McCartney took charge of part of the league-winning 1947–48 season, but he collapsed and died after a Scottish Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team and went on to win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alan Stubbs won the Scottish Cup in 2015–16, ending a 114-year drought in that competition. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one Scottish League Cup each. Bobby Templeton, Bertie Auld, Alex McLeish and Neil Lennon all won second tier championships.

<text>Crowborough is a town and civil parish in East Sussex, England, in the Weald at the edge of Ashdown Forest and the highest town in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

It is located south-west of Royal Tunbridge Wells and south of London. It had a population of 21,688 at the 2021 Census, making it the largest town in inland East Sussex.

The highest point in the town is above sea level, making it the second highest point in East Sussex after Ditchling Beacon.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name means &quot;hill or mound frequented by crows&quot;, from the Old English &quot;crāwe&quot; + &quot;beorg&quot;.

In 1734, Sir Henry Fermor, a local benefactor, bequeathed money for a church and charity school for the benefit of the &quot;very ignorant and heathenish people&quot; that lived in the part of Rotherfield &quot;in or near a place called Crowborough and Ashdown Forest&quot;. The church, dedicated to All Saints, and primary school still survive today.

The railway arrived in 1868, leading to significant growth of the town. By 1880, the town had grown so much that the ecclesiastical parish of All Saints was separated from that of St Denys, Rotherfield.

In the late 19th century, Crowborough was promoted as a health resort based on its high elevation, the rolling hills and surrounding forest. Estate agents even called it &quot;Scotland in Sussex&quot;. The town&#x27;s golf course opened in 1895, followed by a fire station and hospital in 1900.

From 1942 to 1982, a site near Crowborough hosted notable radio transmitters, including the Aspidistra transmitter during World War II and, after the war, the BBC External Service broadcasts to Europe transmitters.

==Governance==
Crowborough became an ecclesiastical parish in 1880: previously it had been part of Rotherfield. A civil parish was established on 6 April 1905; the parish council was renamed as a Town Council on 24 May 1988.

Until 2012, Crowborough shared the headquarters of Wealden District Council with Hailsham, 14 miles (22 km) to the south. The Council moved all of their operations to Hailsham in 2012 although East Sussex County Council still operates a library service from the Pine Grove building. In July 2014, the Crowborough Community Association put in a bid to buy Pine Grove to retain the library and develop the rest of the building as an &quot;enterprise hub&quot;.

=== Parliament ===
In the House of Commons, Crowborough is in the Sussex Weald constituency, represented by Conservative Nus Ghani, one of the Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons. Former MPs include Charles Hendry (2001–2015), and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith (1965–2001).

==Geography==
Crowborough is located in the northern part of East Sussex, around from the county border with Kent. The town is south of central London. The nearest major towns are Royal Tunbridge Wells, to the north-east; Brighton, to the south-west; and Crawley, to the west. The county town of Lewes is to the south-west.

The town is located on the eastern edge of the Ashdown Forest, an ancient area of open heathland which is protected for its ecological importance and was the setting for A. A. Milne&#x27;s stories about Winnie-the-Pooh.

The highest point in the town is 242 metres above sea level. This summit is the highest point of the High Weald and second highest point in East Sussex (the highest is Ditchling Beacon). Its relative height is 159 m, meaning Crowborough qualifies as one of England&#x27;s Marilyns. The summit is not marked on the ground.

The town has grown from a series of previously separate villages and hamlets including Jarvis Brook, Poundfield, Whitehill, Stone Cross and Alderbrook, Sweet Haws and Steel Cross.

==Transport==
The main road in Crowborough is the A26. From Crowborough, the A26 runs north-east to Mereworth via Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge. To the south, it runs to Newhaven, via Uckfield and Lewes.

Two B roads run through the town. The B2100 starts at the junction with the A26 (Crowborough Cross) and runs east to Lamberhurst via Jarvis Brook, Rotherfield, Mark Cross and Wadhurst. The B2157 Green Lane is a short link between Steel Cross and Crowborough Hill, within the town.

Crowborough railway station is located in Jarvis Brook at the bottom of Crowborough Hill. Trains run on the Oxted line which is operated by Southern, providing a direct link with , , and . The journey time to London Bridge is approximately one hour.

The Brighton &amp; Hove Buses Regency Route 29 runs every half-hour (Mon-Sat) or hourly (Sundays/public holiday) to/from Brighton and Tunbridge Wells via Lewes, Uckfield and Crowborough.

==Education==

Crowborough has one secondary school, Beacon Academy, and seven primary schools: 
* Ashdown Primary School, formed from the merging of Whitehill Infant School and Herne Junior School in September 2015.
* High Hurstwood Church of England (controlled) School
* Jarvis Brook County Primary School
* St Johns Church of England (aided) School
* St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic School
* Sir Henry Fermor Church of England School
* Grove Park School

In addition there are two independent preparatory schools.

== Media ==

Local television news programmes are BBC South East Today and ITV Meridian. In 2014 a local news website (Hyperlocal) called CrowboroughLife.com was established by Stephan Butler. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.5 FM, Heart South on 102.4 FM and Ashdown Radio on 94.7 FM.

==Health==

Crowborough War Memorial Hospital on Southview Road is a small NHS hospital with minor injury unit and midwife-led maternity unit. Opening hours are Monday to Sunday, 8am to 8pm.

It has been threatened with closure numerous times, but services are still offered, in part due to a strong local campaign. Non-maternity services are provided at hospitals in Pembury and Haywards Heath.

1st Crowborough Scout Group comprises 1 Squirrels, 3 Beavers, 3 Cubs and 3 Scouts sections.

=== Recreation ===
Crowborough has several recreation grounds, including Goldsmiths Recreation Ground, which was given to the parish by private owners in 1937. The town council has since purchased additional land and has developed the ground into a recreation centre. There are a sports centre with swimming pool; a boating lake; and a miniature railway.

Crowborough Common is an ancient common covering over 220 acres, or about 90 hectares, to which the public was granted a legal right of access &quot;for the taking of air and exercise&quot; in 1936. The common is owned by Crowborough Beacon Golf Club. Most of the common is heathland and woodland. In 2012 Wealden District Council refused permission for the golf club to build a new car park in woodland on the common after a campaign involving local residents and organisations including the Open Spaces Society. On 1 February 2013 the Club served notice to DEFRA to revoke the Section 193 agreement which governed the public&#x27;s right of access on the Common. On 7 February 2013 DEFRA confirmed the revocation of the rights. Due to Health and Safety reasons, not least of which is the outcome of a court case known as the &#x27;Nidry Castle&#x27; case members of the public are requested to keep to official public footpaths and bridleways to mitigate the possible incidence of accident and injury. The club however are in consultation with Wealden District Council and other interested parties to endeavor to relocate some footpaths to make it safer for members of the public who use such footpaths. In addition, to give better access to the common for members of the public, the club are looking at ways of introducing some permissive pathways to give access to areas not served by public footpaths. The club, with the assistance of Natural England, have embarked upon a 10-year programme to restore as much of the common as possible to heathland so this endangered environment will be preserved for future generations. Adjacent to the fourth fairway is a memorial to nine Canadian soldiers of the Lincoln and Welland Regiment who were killed by a flying bomb on 5 July 1944.

Crowborough Country Park is a 16-acre (6 hectare) nature reserve located in the southern part of Crowborough. The park was previously a clay quarry serving the Crowborough Brickworks which closed in 1980. The topography of the site is evidence of its industrial past. The site of the brickworks was developed into Farningham Road industrial estate and housing in the area of Osborne Road. For nearly 30 years the quarry was left to natural regeneration and local people used it for informal play, with stories of swimming in the ponds and losing Wellington boots in the wet areas of the site. In 2008 Crowborough Town Council acquired the site to develop it for informal recreation and also to enhance the site&#x27;s biodiversity. In 2008 work began in the Country Park, with a stone track and bridges installed. The site was declared a Local Nature Reserve in 2009 ensuring the future management of the site for the benefit of the wildlife and for people to enjoy quiet recreation.

The Crowborough Players, established in 1933, are the resident community drama group at the 300-seater hall at Crowborough Community Centre which opened in June 2012.

<text>Illinois State University (ISU) is a public research university in Normal, Illinois, United States. It was founded in 1857 as Illinois State Normal University and is the oldest public university in Illinois. The university emphasizes teaching and is recognized as one of the top ten largest producers of teachers in the US according to the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are members of the Missouri Valley Conference and the Missouri Valley Football Conference and are known as the &quot;Redbirds,&quot; in reference to the state bird, the cardinal.

==History==
ISU was founded in 1857, the same year Illinois&#x27; first Board of Education was convened and two years after the Free School Act was passed by the state legislature. Among its supporters were judge and future Supreme Court Justice, David Davis and local businessman and land holder Jesse W. Fell whose friend, Abraham Lincoln, was the attorney hired by the board of education to draw up legal documents to secure the school&#x27;s funding.

Founded as Illinois State Normal University, it was the first state university in Illinois. Its classes were initially held in downtown Bloomington, occupying space in Major&#x27;s Hall, which was previously the site of Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Lost Speech.&quot; With the completion of Old Main in 1860, the school moved to its current campus in what was then the village of North Bloomington, which was chartered as the town of &quot;Normal&quot; in 1865. The new town had named itself after the university.

The editor of the Bloomington &quot;Pantagraph&quot; wrote in 1882: &quot;The intention was to gather around the institution the different colleges, - classical, agricultural, industrial, law medical, and the other departments of a university, - until, in the end, the State should have here a grand university, equal to any.&quot; Thus the school was originally designed as a wide-ranging university with one department of teacher training. That left only a teacher-training school—indeed what was then called a &quot;normal college&quot;. It later added many other roles and became a wide-ranging university in the 20th century.

On January 1, 1964, the institution&#x27;s name was changed to Illinois State University at Normal, and then again in 1967 to the current Illinois State University. The school&#x27;s motto was originally &quot;and gladly wold he lerne and gladly teche&quot;, in the Middle English spelling of Geoffrey Chaucer. It has since been updated to modern English in the gender-neutral form &quot;Gladly We Learn and Teach&quot;.

The Illinois Board of Higher Education in 2022 approved plans for a new College of Engineering, with the university seeking to add three programs: general engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. In January 2023, the university announced that Thomas Keyser would be the first dean of the College of Engineering, which was set to welcome its first students in 2025.

==Campus==

Initially designed by William Saunders, the Illinois State University campus quadrangle (commonly known as The Quad), is a popular outdoor venue for students and the local community. Lined with benches and shady trees, the site is a popular spot for students to relax, study, and play informal games of sports. Outdoor events such as the annual RSO showcase, Festival ISU and Concerts on the Quad are popular in the campus community. John W. Cook Hall, or Cook Hall, is a building built in 1898 that resembles a castle on the Quad of Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. Cook Hall, named for the university&#x27;s fourth president, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since the winter of 1986.

The ISU Quad is also host to the Fell Arboretum, which is part of a 490-acre site that represents over 154 species of trees from the state of Illinois. Trees on the north side of the quad are from Northern Illinois, and those on the south side of the quad from southern parts of the state. The Fell Arboretum is part of the Arbor Day Foundation&#x27;s Tree Campus Higher Education Institution.

Illinois State University has six residence halls, one apartment complex, and dedicated apartments for upper class and graduate students. Facilities are administered by the ISU&#x27;s University Housing Services.

==Academics==

Founded as a teachers&#x27; college, the university now offers a range of programs at the bachelor, master, and doctoral levels. Illinois State is accredited by the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The teacher preparation programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and certified by the Illinois State Board of Education. In addition, 22 programs hold discipline-based accreditation.

The university comprises seven colleges:
* College of Applied Science and Technology
* College of Arts and Sciences
* College of Business
* College of Education
* College of Engineering
* Mennonite College of Nursing
* Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts

===Laboratory schools===
The university has two laboratory schools: University High School and Thomas Metcalf Laboratory School.

Bloomington/Normal Japanese Saturday School (ブルーミントン・ノーマル補習授業校 &quot;Burūminton Nōmaru Hoshū Jugyō Kō&quot;), a Japanese weekend school, was established in 1986 and held at the Thomas Metcalf School. It has a separate office in Normal

===Milner Library===
Milner Library has a collection of more than 1.63 million volumes and an ever-increasing number of electronic materials accessible by the Internet to students and faculty. The library&#x27;s collection is distinguished by materials related to educational theory and policy, curriculum development, and issues related to special education and assistive technology. The Special Collections include extensive Circus and Allied Arts materials and a children&#x27;s literature collection that features more than 100 first edition volumes signed by author Lois Lenski. Milner Library is also a selective federal depository for government information.

Milner Library administers the Jo Ann Rayfield University Archives, which houses selected official records from university departments and organizations, faculty papers, and memorabilia and ephemera on student life. The archives also hosts a branch of the Illinois Regional Archives Depository (IRAD). In addition to making physical collections available for in-person use, the Rayfield Archives has made many of the university&#x27;s official publications freely available for online research use. Additional library facilities include book storage both on and off-site as well as a preservation department.

The Milner Library was named for Angeline &quot;Ange&quot; Vernon Milner (1856–1928), a Bloomington-Normal native and the first full-time librarian of Illinois State Normal University. Milner is credited with organizing the university&#x27;s initial collection of more than 40,000 items and was a prolific author of more than seventy articles and short monographs in library and education journals during her tenure as University Librarian from 1890 to 1927.

The current library building, opened in 1976, is the second facility constructed to be a dedicated library. The university library has resided in five campus locations: Old Main (demolished 1958), John W. Cook Hall, North Hall (demolished 1965), Williams Hall (first known as Milner Library), and the current Milner Library.

===Reputation and rankings===
In the 2025 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Illinois State University (tied for) 220 among a combined list of America&#x27;s best 439 private and public &quot;national universities&quot; and (tied for) 112 among 227 public &quot;national universities&quot; in the United States that qualified for the list.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranks Illinois State #254 out of 500 American colleges.

==Student life==
As of September 2024, total on-campus enrollment was 21,546, with 19,107 undergraduate students and 2,439 graduate students. The total amount of first time in college (FTIC) students at Illinois State University is 4,285. As of 2019 56.6 percent of students are female, while 43.4 percent are male. About 28.8% of all students were from minority groups. There are currently 613 international students. The average new freshman student had an ACT score near 24 and a gpa of 3.6 out of 4.0.

The school newspaper, &quot;The Vidette&quot; first published in 1888 as a subscription-based newspaper serving both the university and Town of Normal. In 1915, the paper received funding from the university and dropped its subscription model. In 2021, &quot;The Vidette&quot; ceased printing newspapers and became an entirely online news source.

ISU owns a public radio station WGLT (&quot;News, Blues and All That Jazz&quot;), which broadcasts on 89.1 in Normal, 103.5 in Peoria, and by streaming audio. The call letters are from keywords of the school&#x27;s motto: &quot;Gladly-Learn-Teach.&quot; The university also maintains a student radio station, WZND. On January 20, 2010, WZND changed its format from a dual format (Rock and Jamz) to a college shuffle format. The station broadcasts on 103.3 FM, channels 4 &amp; 5 in the residence halls and on the web. TV-10, a part of the School of Communication, provides the only live local television newscast produced entirely in Bloomington-Normal.

===Student organizations===
ISU has over 400 registered student organizations (RSO) and several university groups that sponsor student-focused events. The Multicultural Center is home to student diversity advocacy organizations such as the Asian Pacific American Coalition (APAC), the Association of Latin American Students (ALAS), Black Student Union (BSU), and Pride.

Illinois State University&#x27;s student spirit organization, RED ALERT, has over 4,100 members, roughly one-fourth of the student body. The group was founded in 2006 to promote student involvement in university athletics.

ISU is the home of the Gamma Phi Circus, the oldest collegiate circus in the world, founded in 1929. It is one of two collegiate circuses in the US; the other is run by Florida State University.

The ISU Forensics Individual Events team is one of the most successful forensics individual events teams in the country. In 1995, 1999, and 2000 it won the National Forensic Association team championship and in 2005 its team won the American Forensic Association team championship. Illinois State has been selected as the host of the 2011 NFA National Championship. Famous alumni include Nelsan Ellis of HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot;.

The Illinois State University Mock Trial Team was created in 1987 and competes in intercollegiate tournaments sponsored by the American Mock Trial Association.

===Greek life===
The Illinois State University Greek community was established in 1967. Statistics kept by those involved claim more than 10% of the student population as active members of Greek Life.

===Folklore===
The ghost of Angeline Vernon Milner, the university&#x27;s first librarian, is said to haunt the former library building, now called Williams Hall.

==Athletics==

The school&#x27;s fight song is &quot;Go, You Redbirds,&quot; a song written specifically for ISU and frequently played at sporting events. The Alma Mater song, also played at sporting events from time to time, is &quot;Glory Hast Thou,&quot; written to the tune of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser,&quot; and better known as the tune used for &quot;Deutschlandlied,&quot; the German national anthem.

In addition to the Redbird teams linked above, the ice hockey club is the oldest registered student organization on campus. The Grossinger Motors Arena located in downtown Bloomington is home to the university&#x27;s three club ice hockey teams, which compete in ACHA Divisions 1, 2, and 3.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
The Illinois State University Alumni Center, located at 1101 N. Main in Normal, is designed to serve over 215,000 alumni of Illinois State University, as well as current students, faculty/staff, and the Bloomington/Normal community.

<doc id="176751" wikidata="Q429599" url="?curid=176751" title="Duke of Aquitaine">
<text>The duke of Aquitaine (, , ) was the ruler of the medieval region of Aquitaine (not to be confused with modern-day Aquitaine) under the supremacy of Frankish, English, and later French kings.

As successor states of the Visigothic Kingdom (418–721), Aquitania (Aquitaine) and Languedoc (Toulouse) inherited both Visigothic law and Roman Law, which together allowed women more rights than their contemporaries would enjoy until the 20th century. Particularly under the Liber Judiciorum as codified in 642/643 and expanded by the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and titles and manage their holdings independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, represent themselves and bear witness in court from the age of 14, and arrange for their own marriages after the age of 20. As a consequence, male-preference primogeniture was the practiced succession law for the nobility.

==Coronation==

The Merovingian kings and dukes of Aquitaine used Toulouse as their capital. The Carolingian kings used different capitals situated farther north. In 765, Pepin the Short bestowed the captured golden banner of the Aquitainian duke, Waiffre, on the Abbey of Saint Martial in Limoges. Pepin I of Aquitaine was buried in Poitiers. Charles the Child was crowned at Limoges and buried at Bourges. When Aquitaine briefly asserted its independence after the death of Charles the Fat, it was Ranulf II of Poitou who took the royal title. In the late tenth century, Louis the Indolent was crowned at Brioude.

The Aquitainian ducal coronation procedure is preserved in a late twelfth-century &quot;ordo&quot; (formula) from Saint-Étienne in Limoges, based on an earlier Romano-German &quot;ordo&quot;. In the early thirteenth century a commentary was added to this &quot;ordo&quot;, which emphasised Limoges as the capital of Aquitaine. The &quot;ordo&quot; indicated that the duke received a silk mantle, coronet, banner, sword, spurs, and the ring of Saint Valerie.

==Direct rule of Carolingian kings==
==Restored dukes of Aquitaine under Frankish kings==

The Carolingian kings again appointed Dukes of Aquitaine, first in 852, and again since 866. Later, this duchy was also called &quot;Guyenne&quot;.

** Louis the Younger (1137–1152), also King of France, duke in right of his wife.
From 1152, the Duchy of Aquitaine was held by the Plantagenets, who also ruled England as independent monarchs and held other territories in France by separate inheritance (see Plantagenet Empire). The Plantagenets were often more powerful than the kings of France, and their reluctance to do homage to the kings of France for their lands in France was one of the major sources of conflict in medieval Western Europe.

=== House of Plantagenet ===


==Plantagenet rulers of Aquitaine==

In 1337, King Philip VI of France reclaimed the fief of Aquitaine from Edward III, King of England. Edward in turn claimed the title of King of France, by right of his descent from his maternal grandfather King Philip IV of France. This triggered the Hundred Years&#x27; War, in which both the Plantagenets and the House of Valois claimed supremacy over Aquitaine.

=== Lord of Aquitaine (1360-1369) ===

In 1360, both sides signed the Treaty of Brétigny, in which Edward renounced the French crown but remained sovereign Lord of Aquitaine (rather than merely duke). However, when the treaty was broken in 1369, both these English claims and the war resumed.

On 6 October 1372, Prince Edward (who had returned to England the previous year) resigned the Principality of Aquitaine and Gascony, stating that the revenues he earned from Aquitaine were no longer sufficient to cover his expenses. Thus, King Edward III, his father, resumed his title as Duke of Aquitaine.

==Valois and Bourbon dukes of Aquitaine==

The Valois kings of France, claiming supremacy over Aquitaine, granted the title of duke to their heirs, the Dauphins.

* John II (1345–1350), son of Philip VI of France, acceded in 1350 as King of France.
*Charles, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne (1392?–1401), son of Charles VI of France, Dauphin.
* Louis (1401–1415), son of Charles VI of France, Dauphin.

With the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Aquitaine returned under direct rule of the king of France and remained in the possession of the king. Only occasionally was the duchy or the title of duke granted to another member of the dynasty.

* Charles, Duc de Berry (1469–1472), son of Charles VII of France.
* Xavier (1753–1754), second son of Louis, Dauphin of France.

The Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, son of Alfonso XIII of Spain, was one of the Legitimist pretenders to the French throne; as such he named his son, Gonzalo, Duke of Aquitaine (1972–2000); Gonzalo had no legitimate children.

<doc id="176752" wikidata="Q110701" url="?curid=176752" title="Overhead line">
<text>An overhead line or overhead wire is an electrical cable that is used to transmit electrical energy to electric locomotives, electric multiple units, trolleybuses or trams. The generic term used by the International Union of Railways for the technology is &quot;overhead line&quot;. It is known variously as overhead catenary, overhead contact line (OCL), overhead contact system (OCS), overhead equipment (OHE), overhead line equipment (OLE or OHLE), overhead lines (OHL), overhead wiring (OHW), traction wire, and trolley wire.

An overhead line consists of one or more wires (or rails, particularly in tunnels) situated over rail tracks, raised to a high electrical potential by connection to feeder stations at regularly spaced intervals along the track. The feeder stations are usually fed from a high-voltage electrical grid.

== Overview ==
Electric trains that collect their current from overhead lines use a device such as a pantograph, bow collector or trolley pole. It presses against the underside of the lowest overhead wire, the contact wire. Current collectors are electrically conductive and allow current to flow through to the train or tram and back to the feeder station through the steel wheels on one or both running rails. Non-electric locomotives (such as diesels) may pass along these tracks without affecting the overhead line, although there may be difficulties with overhead clearance. Alternative electrical power transmission schemes for trains include third rail, ground-level power supply, batteries and electromagnetic induction.

Vehicles like buses that have rubber tyres cannot provide a return path for the current through their wheels, and must instead use a pair of overhead wires to provide both the current and its return path.

== Construction ==

To achieve good high-speed current collection, it is necessary to keep the contact wire geometry within defined limits. This is usually achieved by supporting the contact wire from a second wire known as the &quot;&quot; or &quot;catenary&quot;. This wire approximates the natural path of a wire strung between two points, a catenary curve, thus the use of &quot;catenary&quot; to describe this wire or sometimes the whole system. This wire is attached to the contact wire at regular intervals by vertical wires known as &quot;droppers&quot; or &quot;drop wires&quot;. It is supported regularly at structures, by a pulley, link or clamp. The whole system is then subjected to mechanical tension.

As the pantograph moves along under the contact wire, the carbon insert on top of the pantograph becomes worn with time. On straight track, the contact wire is zigzagged slightly to the left and right of the centre from each support to the next so that the insert wears evenly, thus preventing any notches. On curves, the &quot;straight&quot; wire between the supports causes the contact point to cross over the surface of the pantograph as the train travels around the curve. The movement of the contact wire across the head of the pantograph is called the &quot;sweep&quot;.

The zigzagging of the overhead line is not required for trolley poles. For tramways, a contact wire without a messenger wire is used.

Depot areas tend to have only a single wire and are known as &quot;simple equipment&quot; or &quot;trolley wire&quot;. When overhead line systems were first conceived, good current collection was possible only at low speeds, using a single wire. To enable higher speeds, two additional types of equipment were developed:

* Stitched equipment uses an additional wire at each support structure, terminated on either side of the messenger/catenary wire.
* Compound equipment uses a second support wire, known as the &quot;auxiliary&quot;, between the messenger/catenary wire and the contact wire. Droppers support the auxiliary from the messenger wire, while additional droppers support the contact wire from the auxiliary. The auxiliary wire can be of a more conductive but less wear-resistant metal, increasing transmission efficiency.

Earlier dropper wires provided physical support of the contact wire without joining the catenary and contact wires electrically. Modern systems use current-carrying droppers, eliminating the need for separate wires.

The present transmission system originated about 100 years ago. A simpler system was proposed in the 1970s by the Pirelli Construction Company, consisting of a single wire embedded at each support for of its length in a clipped, extruded aluminum beam with the wire contact face exposed. A somewhat higher tension than used before clipping the beam yielded a deflected profile for the wire that could be easily handled at by a pneumatic servo pantograph with only 3 g acceleration.

=== Parallel overhead lines ===

An electrical circuit requires at least two conductors. Trams and railways use the overhead line as the positive terminal of the circuit and the steel rails as the negative terminal of the circuit. For a trolleybus or a trolleytruck, no rails are available for the return current, as the vehicles use rubber tyres on the road surface. Trolleybuses use a second parallel overhead line for the return, and two trolley poles, one contacting each overhead wire. (Pantographs are generally incompatible with parallel overhead lines.) The circuit is completed by using both wires. Parallel overhead wires are also used on the rare railways with three-phase AC railway electrification.

== Types of wires ==

In the Soviet Union the following types of wires/cables were used. For the contact wire, cold drawn solid copper was used to ensure good conductivity. The wire is not round but has grooves at the sides to allow the hangers to attach to it. Sizes were (in cross-sectional area) 85, 100, or 150 mm2. To make the wire stronger, 0.04% tin might be added. The wire must resist the heat generated by arcing and thus such wires should never be spliced by thermal means.

The messenger (or catenary) wire needs to be both strong and have good conductivity. They used multi-strand wires (or cables) with 19 strands in each cable (or wire). Copper, aluminum, and/or steel were used for the strands. All 19 strands could be made of the same metal or a mix of metals based on the required properties. For example, steel wires were used for strength, while aluminium or copper wires were used for conductivity. Another type looked like it had all copper wires but inside each wire was a steel core for strength. The steel strands were galvanized but for better corrosion protection they could be coated with an anti-corrosion substance.

In Slovenia, where 3 kV system is in use, standard sizes for contact wire are 100 and 150 mm2. The catenary wire is made of copper or copper alloys of 70, 120 or 150 mm2. The smaller cross sections are made of 19 strands, whereas the bigger has 37 strands.
Two standard configurations for main lines consist of two contact wires of 100 mm2 and one or two catenary wires of 120 mm2, totaling 320 or 440 mm2. Only one contact wire is often used for side tracks.

In the UK and EU countries, the contact wire is typically made from copper alloyed with other metals. Sizes include cross-sectional areas of 80, 100, 107, 120, and 150 mm2. Common materials include normal and high strength copper, copper-silver, copper-cadmium, copper-magnesium, and copper-tin, with each being identifiable by distinct identification grooves along the upper lobe of the contact wire. These grooves vary in number and location on the arc of the upper section. Copper is chosen for its excellent conductivity, with other metals added to increase tensile strength. The choice of material is chosen based on the needs of the particular system, balancing the need for conductivity and tensile strength.

== Tensioning ==
Catenary wires are kept in mechanical tension because the pantograph causes mechanical oscillations in the wire. The waves must travel faster than the train to avoid producing standing waves, which could break the wire. Tensioning the line makes waves travel faster, and also reduces sag from gravity.

For medium and high speeds, the wires are generally tensioned by weights or occasionally by hydraulic tensioners. Either method is known as &quot;auto-tensioning&quot; (AT) or &quot;constant tension&quot; and ensures that the tension is virtually independent of temperature. Tensions are typically between per wire. Where weights are used, they slide up and down on a rod or tube attached to the mast, to prevent them from swaying. Recently, spring tensioners have started to be used. These devices contain a torsional spring with a cam arrangement to ensure a constant applied tension (instead of varying proportionally with extension). Some devices also include mechanisms for adjusting the stiffness of the spring for ease of maintenance.

For low speeds and in tunnels where temperatures are constant, fixed termination (FT) equipment may be used, with the wires terminated directly on structures at each end of the overhead line. The tension is generally about . This type of equipment sags in hot conditions and is taut in cold conditions.

With AT, the continuous length of the overhead line is limited due to the change in the height of the weights as the overhead line expands and contracts with temperature changes. This movement is proportional to the distance between anchors. Tension length has a maximum. For most 25 kV OHL equipment in the UK, the maximum tension length is .

An additional issue with AT equipment is that, if balance weights are attached to both ends, the whole tension length is free to move along the track. To avoid this a midpoint anchor (MPA), close to the centre of the tension length, restricts movement of the messenger/catenary wire by anchoring it; the contact wire and its suspension hangers can move only within the constraints of the MPA. MPAs are sometimes fixed to low bridges, or otherwise anchored to vertical catenary poles or portal catenary supports. A tension length can be seen as a fixed centre point, with the two half-tension lengths expanding and contracting with temperature.

Most systems include a brake to stop the wires from unravelling completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a single large tensioning pulley (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lift the pulley so its teeth are well clear of a stop on the mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.

== Breaks ==
Lines are divided into sections to limit the scope of an outage and to allow maintenance.

=== Section break ===
To allow maintenance to the overhead line without having to turn off the entire system, the line is broken into electrically separated portions known as &quot;sections&quot;. Sections often correspond with tension lengths. The transition from section to section is known as a &quot;section break&quot; and is set up so that the vehicle&#x27;s pantograph is in continuous contact with one wire or the other.

For bow collectors and pantographs, this is done by having two contact wires run side by side over the length between 2 or 4 wire supports. A new one drops down and the old one rises up, allowing the pantograph to smoothly transfer from one to the other. The two wires do not touch (although the bow collector or pantograph is briefly in contact with both wires). In normal service, the two sections are electrically connected; depending on the system this might be an isolator, fixed contact or a Booster Transformer. The isolator allows the current to the section to be interrupted for maintenance.

On overhead wires designed for trolley poles, this is done by having a neutral section between the wires, requiring an insulator. The driver of the tram or trolleybus must temporarily reduce the power draw before the trolley pole passes through, to prevent arc damage to the insulator.

Pantograph-equipped locomotives must not run through a section break when one side is de-energized. The locomotive would become trapped, but as it passes the section break the pantograph briefly shorts the two catenary lines. If the opposite line is de-energized, this voltage transient may trip supply breakers. If the line is under maintenance, an injury may occur as the catenary is suddenly energized. Even if the catenary is properly grounded to protect the personnel, the arc generated across the pantograph can damage the pantograph, the catenary insulator or both.

=== Neutral section (phase break) ===

Sometimes on a larger electrified railway, tramway or trolleybus system, it is necessary to power different areas of track from different power grids, without guaranteeing synchronisation of the phases. Long lines may be connected to the country&#x27;s national grid at various points and different phases. (Sometimes the sections are powered with different voltages or frequencies.) The grids may be synchronised on a normal basis, but events may interrupt synchronisation. This is not a problem for DC systems. AC systems have a particular safety implication in that the railway electrification system would act as a &quot;Backdoor&quot; connection between different parts, resulting in, amongst other things, a section of the grid de-energised for maintenance being re-energised from the railway substation creating danger.

For these reasons, Neutral sections are placed in the electrification between the sections fed from different points in a national grid, or different phases, or grids that are not synchronized. It is highly undesirable to connect unsynchronized grids. A simple section break is insufficient to guard against this as the pantograph briefly connects both sections.

In countries such as France, South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom, a pair of permanent magnets beside the rails at either side of the neutral section operate a bogie-mounted transducer on the train which causes a large electrical circuit-breaker to open and close when the locomotive or the pantograph vehicle of a multiple unit passes over them. In the United Kingdom equipment similar to Automatic Warning System (AWS) is used, but with pairs of magnets placed the running rails (as opposed to the AWS magnets placed midway between the rails). Lineside signs on the approach to the neutral section warn the driver to shut off traction power and coast through the dead section.

A neutral section or phase break consists of two insulated breaks back-to-back with a short section of line that belongs to neither grid. Some systems increase the level of safety by the midpoint of the neutral section being earthed. The presence of the earthed section in the middle is to ensure that should the transducer controlled apparatus fail, and the driver also fail to shut off power, the energy in the arc struck by the pantograph as it passes to the neutral section is conducted to earth, operating substation circuit breakers, rather than the arc either bridging the insulators into a section made dead for maintenance, a section fed from a different phase, or setting up a Backdoor connection between different parts of the country&#x27;s national grid.

On the Pennsylvania Railroad, phase breaks were indicated by a position light signal face with all eight radial positions with lenses and no center light. When the phase break was active (the catenary sections out of phase), all lights were lit. The position light signal aspect was originally devised by the Pennsylvania Railroad and was continued by Amtrak and adopted by Metro North. Metal signs were hung from the catenary supports with the letters &quot;PB&quot; created by a pattern of drilled holes.

=== Dead section ===
A special category of phase break was developed in America, primarily by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Since its traction power network was centrally supplied and only segmented by abnormal conditions, normal phase breaks were generally not active. Phase breaks that were always activated were known as &quot;Dead Sections&quot;: they were often used to separate power systems (for example, the Hell&#x27;s Gate Bridge boundary between Amtrak and Metro North&#x27;s electrifications) that would never be in-phase. Since a dead section is always dead, no special signal aspect was developed to warn drivers of its presence, and a metal sign with &quot;DS&quot; in drilled-hole letters was hung from the catenary supports.

=== Gaps ===
Occasionally gaps may be present in the overhead lines, when switching from one voltage to another or to provide clearance for ships at moveable bridges, as a simpler alternative for moveable overhead power rails. Electric trains coast across the gaps. To prevent arcing, power must be switched off before reaching the gap and usually the pantograph would be lowered.

== Overhead conductor rails ==
Given limited clearance such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by a rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a Π section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line was raised in the Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock, a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. In modern uses, it is very common for underground sections of trams, metros, and mainline railways to use a rigid overhead wire in their tunnels, while using normal overhead wires in their above ground sections.
In a movable bridge that uses a rigid overhead rail, there is a need to transition from the catenary wire system into an overhead conductor rail at the bridge portal (the last traction current pylon before the movable bridge). For example, the power supply can be done through a catenary wire system near a swing bridge. The catenary wire typically comprises messenger wire (also called catenary wire) and a contact wire where it meets the pantograph. The messenger wire is terminated at the portal, while the contact wire runs into the overhead conductor rail profile at the transition end section before it is terminated at the portal. There is a gap between the overhead conductor rail at the transition end section and the overhead conductor rail that runs across the entire span of the swing bridge. The gap is required for the swing bridge to be opened and closed. To connect the conductor rails together when the bridge is closed, there is another conductor rail section called &quot;rotary overlap&quot; that is equipped with a motor. When the bridge is fully closed, the motor of the rotary overlap is operated to turn it from a tilted position into the horizontal position, connecting the conductor rails at the transition end section and the bridge together to supply power.

Short overhead conductor rails are installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.

== Crossings ==

Trams draw their power from a single overhead wire at about 500 to 750 V DC. Trolleybuses draw from two overhead wires at a similar voltage, and at least one of the trolleybus wires must be insulated from tram wires. This is usually done by the trolleybus wires running continuously through the crossing, with the tram conductors a few centimetres lower. Close to the junction on each side, the tram wire turns into a solid bar running parallel to the trolleybus wires for about half a metre. Another bar similarly angled at its ends is hung between the trolleybus wires, electrically connected above to the tram wire. The tram&#x27;s pantograph bridges the gap between the different conductors, providing it with a continuous pickup.

Where the tram wire crosses, the trolleybus wires are protected by an inverted trough of insulating material extending below.

Until 1946, a level crossing in Stockholm, Sweden connected the railway south of Stockholm Central Station and a tramway. The tramway operated on 600–700 V DC and the railway on 15 kV AC. In the Swiss village of Oberentfelden, the Menziken–Aarau–Schöftland line operating at 750 V DC crosses the SBB line at 15 kV AC; there used to be a similar crossing between the two lines at Suhr but this was replaced by an underpass in 2010. Some crossings between tramway/light rail and railways are extant in Germany. In Zürich, Switzerland, VBZ trolleybus line 32 has a level crossing with the 1,200 V DC Uetliberg railway line; at many places, trolleybus lines cross the tramway. In some cities, trolleybuses and trams shared a positive (feed) wire. In such cases, a normal trolleybus frog can be used.

Alternatively, section breaks can be sited at the crossing point, so that the crossing is electrically dead.

=== Australia ===
Many cities had trams and trolleybuses using trolley poles. They used insulated crossovers, which required tram drivers to put the controller into neutral and coast through. Trolleybus drivers had to either lift off the accelerator or switch to auxiliary power.

In Melbourne, Victoria, tram drivers put the controller into neutral and coast through section insulators, indicated by insulator markings between the rails.

Melbourne has several remaining level crossings between electrified suburban railways and tram lines. They have mechanical switching arrangements (changeover switch) to switch the 1500 V DC overhead of the railway and the 650 V DC of the trams, called a Tram Square. Several such crossings have been grade separated in recent years as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project.

=== Greece ===
Athens has two crossings of tram and trolleybus wires, at Vas. Amalias Avenue and Vas. Olgas Avenue, and at Ardittou Street and Athanasiou Diakou Street. They use the above-mentioned solution.

=== Italy ===
In Rome, at the crossing between Viale Regina Margherita and Via Nomentana, tram and trolleybus lines cross: tram on Viale Regina Margherita and trolleybus on Via Nomentana. The crossing is orthogonal, therefore the typical arrangement was not available.

In Milan, most tram lines cross its circular trolleybus line once or twice. Trolleybus and tram wires run parallel in streets such as viale Stelvio, viale Umbria and viale Tibaldi.

== Multiple overhead lines ==
Some railways used two or three overhead lines, usually to carry three-phase current. This is used only on the Gornergrat Railway and Jungfrau Railway in Switzerland, the Petit train de la Rhune in France, and the Corcovado Rack Railway in Brazil. Until 1976, it was widely used in Italy. On these railways, the two conductors are used for two different phases of the three-phase AC, while the rail was used for the third phase. The neutral was not used.

Some three-phase AC railways used three overhead wires. These were an experimental railway line of Siemens in Berlin-Lichtenberg in 1898 (length ), the military railway between Marienfelde and Zossen between 1901 and 1904 (length ) and an -long section of a coal railway near Cologne between 1940 and 1949.

On DC systems, bipolar overhead lines were sometimes used to avoid galvanic corrosion of metallic parts near the railway, such as on the Chemin de fer de la Mure.

All systems with multiple overhead lines have a high risk of short circuits at switches and therefore tend to be impractical in use, especially when high voltages are used or when trains run through the points at high speed.

The Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn had two lines with different electrification. To be able to use different electric systems on shared tracks, the Sihltal line had its overhead wire right above the train, whilst the Uetliberg line had its overhead wire off to one side. This configuration was used up until summer 2022, since then the Uetliberg line has been switched to the standard 15kV 16.7 Hz configuration.

==Overhead catenary==


A catenary is a system of overhead wires used to supply electricity to a locomotive, tram (streetcar), or light rail vehicle that is equipped with a pantograph.

Unlike simple overhead wires, in which the uninsulated wire is attached by clamps to closely spaced crosswires supported by poles, catenary systems use at least two wires. The catenary or messenger wire is hung at a specific tension between line structures, and a second wire is held in tension by the messenger wire, attached to it at frequent intervals by clamps and connecting wires known as &quot;droppers&quot;. The second wire is straight and level, parallel to the rail track, suspended over it as the roadway of a suspension bridge is over water.

Catenary systems are suited to high-speed operations whereas simple wire systems, which are less expensive to build and maintain, are common on light rail or tram (streetcar) lines, especially on city streets. Such vehicles can be fitted with either a pantograph or trolley pole.

=== Electrification support structures ===
Overhead line equipment may be supported above the running lines by a range of different methods. Support structures are often designed to allow mechanically independent registration (MIR) which refers to a setup where each contact and catenary wire for each track is mechanically independent from the adjacent wire runs. Support structures are required to provide &quot;support&quot; and &quot;registration&quot; to the OLE wires. In OLE terminology, &quot;support&quot; refers to vertical position of catenary wire (and of the contact wire via the catenary wire), while &quot;registration&quot; refers to the horizontal position of both catenary and contact wires. The metal parts the provide OLE registration are typically designed to adjust in the vertical plane as the pantograph moves under it. The generic types of support structures are summarised below.

* Single Cantilever
** The most basic and common type of OLE structure that supports and registers one wire run above one track.
* Double Cantilever
** Similar to the previous but with two cantilever arms adjacent to each other on one mast. Often used where two wire runs converge.
* Back to Back Cantilever
** Two wire runs over two tracks supported and registered by one mast placed in the centre of the tracks with cantilever arms attached to opposite sides. Frequently used on tram and light rail systems but can appear on heavy rail lines.
* Two Track Cantilever (TTC)
** Two wire runs over two tracks supported by one mast with a boom structure extending over to the second track. TTCs typically provide mechanically independent registration, but subtypes exists called the &quot;span-wire two track cantilever&quot; which has both registration arms mechanically linked. TTCs are often used where there are poor ground conditions or obstructions on one side of a two track railway. They are also sometimes used to minimised piling since only one track must be taken out of service for this phase of construction.
* Portals
** Also known generically as &quot;gantries&quot;, portals are large structures with masts on either side and a fixed steel beam between them. They are frequently used on sections of railway line with more than two tracks. Portals typically provide mechanically independent registration, however variants exist with registration span-wires that mechanically link adjacent wire runs. Portals are sometimes used on two track railways over bridges and viaducts or where ground conditions are poor. This is because portals inflict fewer rotational forces on their foundations.
* Headspans
** An alternative method to supporting multi-track areas, headspans consist of a mast at either side of the railway and various cables running horizontally between the two masts (called span wires) to support and register all wire runs at tension. Because the tension of all wire runs and span wires are required simultaneously to hold up the OLE wires, headspans by definition do not provide mechanically independent registration and a failure of one OLE or span wire will bring all wire runs out of geometric limits. Headspans are cheaper and less obtrusive than portals and so are well suited to low speed complex multitrack areas like stations, station approaches, depots and sidings, and areas where visual intrusion is an important consideration. They are also capable of supporting tracks with speeds up to 200km/h (125mph) but provide significant reliability disadvantages over portals or TTCs for this application.
Tunnels, low overbridges and other location specific features (retaining walls, adjacent rockfaces etc) frequently require bespoke OLE structures that may incorporate some features of the generic types above.

===Overhead catenary systems in the United States===
The Northeast Corridor in the United States has catenary over the between Boston, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., for Amtrak&#x27;s inter-city trains. Commuter rail agencies including MARC, SEPTA, NJ Transit, and Metro-North Railroad utilize the catenary to provide local service.

In Cleveland, Ohio, the interurban/light rail lines and the heavy rail line use the same overhead wires, due to a city ordinance intended to limit air pollution from the large number of steam trains that passed through Cleveland between the east coast and Chicago. Trains switched from steam to electric locomotives at the Collinwood railyards about east of Downtown and at Linndale on the west side. When Cleveland constructed its rapid transit (heavy rail) line between the airport, downtown, and beyond, it employed a similar catenary, using electrification equipment left over after railroads switched from steam to diesel. Light and heavy rail share trackage for about along the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Red (heavy rail) line, Blue and Green interurban/light rail lines between Cleveland Union Terminal and just past East 55th Street station, where the lines separate.

Part of Boston&#x27;s Blue Line through the northeast suburbs uses overhead lines, as does the Green Line.

The Yellow Line on the Chicago &quot;L&quot; used an overhead catenary system for the west half of the route, transitioning to third rail for the east half. This was discontinued in 2004 when the entire route was converted to third rail.

On the San Francisco peninsula in California, the Caltrain commuter rail system completed the installation of an overhead contact system (OCS) in 2023, to prepare for the conversion of its 160-year old San Francisco to San José Peninsula Corridor to fully-electrified revenue service in September 2024.

=== Height ===
The height of the overhead line can create hazards at level crossings, where it may be struck by road vehicles. Warning signs are placed on the approaches, advising drivers of the maximum safe height.

The wiring in most countries is too low to allow double stack container trains. The Channel Tunnel has an extended height overhead line to accommodate double-height car and truck transporters. China and India operate lines electrified with extra height wiring and pantographs to allow for double stack container trains.

==Problems with overhead equipment==
Overhead lines may be adversely affected by strong winds causing wires to swing. Power storms can knock the power out with lightning strikes on systems with overhead wires, stopping trains following a power surge.

During cold or frosty weather, ice may coat overhead lines. This can result in poor electrical contact between the collector and the overhead line, resulting in electrical arcing and power surges. Ice coatings also add extra weight, as well as increase their surface area exposed to wind, consequently increasing the load on the wires and their supports.

Lines may sag during hot weather and if a pantograph gets entangled, this can result in a dewirement. Similarly, in very cold weather they may contract and snap.

The installation of overhead lines may require reconstruction of bridges to provide safe electrical clearance.

Overhead lines, like most electrified systems, require a greater capital expenditure when building the system than an equivalent non-electric system. While a unelectrified railway line requires only the grade, ballast, ties and rails, an overhead system also requires a complex system of support structures, lines, insulators, power-control systems and power lines, all of which require maintenance. This makes non-electrical systems more attractive in the short term, although electrical systems can pay for themselves eventually. Also, the added construction and maintenance cost-per-mile makes overhead systems less attractive on already existing long-distance railways, such as those found in North America, where the distances between cities are typically far greater than in Europe. Such long lines require enormous investment in overhead line equipment, which private rail companies are unlikely to be interested in, and major difficulties confront energizing long portions of overhead wire on a permanent basis, especially in areas where energy demand already outstrips supply.

Many people consider overhead lines to be &quot;visual pollution&quot;, due to the many support structures and complicated system of wires and cables that fill the air. Such considerations have driven the move towards replacing overhead power and communications lines with buried cables where possible. The issue came to a head in the UK with the Great Western Main Line electrification scheme, especially through the Goring Gap. A protest group with their own website has been formed.

The valuable copper conductor can also be subject to theft, as for example the Lahore-Khanewal line in Pakistan and the Gweru-Harare section of line in Zimbabwe.

== History ==
The first tram with overhead lines was presented by Werner von Siemens at the 1881 International Exposition of Electricity in Paris: the installation was removed after that event. In October 1883, the first permanent tram service with overhead lines was on the Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram in Austria. The trams had bipolar overhead lines, consisting of two U-pipes, in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles. From April to June 1882, Siemens had tested a similar system on his Electromote, an early precursor of the trolleybus.

Much simpler and more functional was an overhead wire in combination with a pantograph borne by the vehicle and pressed at the line from below. This system, for rail traffic with a unipolar line, was invented by Frank J. Sprague in 1888. From 1889 it was used at the Richmond Union Passenger Railway in Richmond, Virginia, pioneering electric traction.

<text>Moseley ( &quot;&quot;) is an affluent suburb of south Birmingham, England, south of the city centre.

It is located within the Moseley ward of the city, in the constituency of Hall Green and Moseley. Historically it lay within Worcestershire.

==History==
Moseley was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Museleie.

St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Moseley was licensed by the Bishop of Worcester (authorised by Pope Innocent VII) in February 1405, and the 600th anniversary was celebrated in 2005 with a series of special events. In 2012 the church bells, which had been named as the worst sounding in the country, were replaced. Moseley itself developed around a Victorian shopping area known as &quot;Moseley Village&quot;.

Moseley Hall was rebuilt in parkland in the early 1600s, and rebuilt again by 1795 after being set on fire during rioting in 1791. It was donated in 1891 to the City of Birmingham by Richard Cadbury and now forms part of Moseley Hall Hospital.

Spring Hill College (Moseley School), a Gothic revival construction built in 1857, is located in the south of the district. Former pupils include comedian Jasper Carrott and musician Bev Bevan of the Electric Light Orchestra.

St Anne&#x27;s Church, Moseley was opened in 1874.

Moseley was served by Moseley railway station from 1867 to 1941. It was opened by the Midland Railway on the Camp Hill line. A previously named Moseley Station on the same line changed its name to Kings Heath Station upon the opening of the station.

Moseley and the surrounding areas were much developed after 1910, being built upon the once extensive farm land that was predominant in this area. The new properties being mostly of large houses, designed to cater for the Edwardian middle-class families that settled in the suburbs surrounding Birmingham&#x27;s industrial centre. These large houses relied upon at least one servant or &quot;tweeny&quot; as they were often termed, to help the lady of the house run the household. With the advent of the First World War, staff were hard to find to maintain houses of this size. The heating bills and high maintenance made them unpopular after the war and many were split into flats to cater for the requirements of the expanding working population who moved from the city centre as extensive redevelopment took place in the 1960s.

In some respects Moseley and the surrounding area suffered a serious decline in the last part of the 20th century. Much property fell into neglect, and problems with crime, drugs and prostitution became commonplace in the areas bordering Balsall Heath. During this same period, however, with a great deal of cheap accommodation on offer, it is arguable that Moseley also enjoyed its most creative and cosmopolitan phase as the focus of artistic and student communities. In 1970s, the small triangular shaped green in the heart of Moseley village, which was then home to the underground public toilets, was a convenient meeting place for local youth, and was known as &quot;Bog Island&quot;.

Local band Ocean Colour Scene were active in the mid-1990s British Britpop–indie scene with songs such as &quot;The Riverboat Song&quot;, inspired by locations within the suburb of Moseley. Their most successful album (in terms of weeks on chart) was &quot;Moseley Shoals&quot;. Moseley is also the birthplace of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran.

The politician Joseph Chamberlain had his Birmingham residence at Highbury, on the edge of Moseley. The property was entrusted to the city after Chamberlain&#x27;s death and is currently used as a conference venue and location for civil ceremonies.

==Literature==
J. R. R. Tolkien spent his early years in Moseley, living close to Sarehole Mill in Hall Green before moving to the site now occupied by Shades Music off the Alcester Road. Sarehole Mill is believed to have been his inspiration for the tranquil Shire in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He also drew inspiration from Moseley Bog for the landscape of Middle-earth.

==Sport==
Moseley has a rich history of success in Rugby Union. Its most famous team is Moseley Rugby Football Club, who were one of Europe&#x27;s best teams in the late 1960s to the 1980s. Notable players include Sam Doble, J. F. Byrne, Peter Cranmer, Alain Rolland, Mike Teague and Victor Ubogu.

The Moseley Wanderers team of 1900 won the Silver Medal in the Rugby Union competition at the 1900 Olympics.

==Present==
A monthly Farmers&#x27; Market in Moseley - set up by the Moseley Neighbourhood Forum- has won various awards including best FARMA Certified Urban Farmers&#x27; Market 2009 and in 2009 local farmer Dominic Butler won the Most Unique Produce award with his micro blue beetroots. Similarly, Moseley has a well defined and established community spirit and ethos, exemplified by Moseley Neighbourhood Forum - a neighbourhood forum - that works to develop the area for the betterment of everyone. The Moseley Society exists to protect the heritage of the area; meetings of the Society discuss and debate a wide range of local issues and the interests of its residents.

The Moseley Community Development Trust (CDT) invests in the social and physical capital of the area. Established with funding from charitable trust funds and with the support of the Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Committee, the CDT is now managing a series of initiatives to improve the environment of Moseley.

It has its own monthly magazine, Moseley B13 (formerly Birmingham 13), reporting on local events and personalities. It has been printing .

A group of volunteers have formed Moseley in Bloom (MiB). Much like the Moseley Community Development Trust, the group undertake many projects which look at the greener issues around Moseley. Many projects take place throughout the year to enhance the landscape of Moseley as well as renovate dilapidated areas.

Every summer Moseley hosts Moseley Festival, a festival of arts and culture that sees people in the community come together and hold a series of music, art, food, cultural and sporting events.

Moseley Folk &amp; Arts Festival happens later in the year, and attracts big names from the world of folk. Moseley Jazz, Funk &amp; Soul Festival takes place in Moseley Park during the summer as well. Moseley also has its own literary festival, Pow-Wow LitFest, which has taken place annually at the Prince of Wales pub .

Moseley is also home to many pubs, restaurants and cafés.

In 2015 Moseley was named as the &quot;best urban place to live&quot; by The Sunday Times, with the newspaper citing its &#x27;Arts and Crafts&#x27;, &#x27;Bohemian culture&#x27; and &#x27;Victorian Architecture&#x27; as reasons to live in the suburb. This award followed its being highlighted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013 as a place to move, with similar reasons being cited.

==Education==
Moseley has two secondary schools, Moseley School, a language college and Queensbridge School, an Arts College. It also has several Primary schools such as Moseley C of E Primary School a one form entry school that has connections with St. Mary&#x27;s Church and Park Hill Primary School on Alcester Road and St Martin de Porres Catholic Primary School.

Moseley is also home to Uffculme School, an all age special school for children on the autism spectrum. It is also home to James Brindley Academy&#x27;s Willows Centre which provides education to inpatients at Parkview Clinic.

<text>Foot binding (), or footbinding, was the Chinese custom of breaking and tightly binding the feet of young girls to change their shape and size. Feet altered by foot binding were known as lotus feet and the shoes made for them were known as lotus shoes. In late imperial China, bound feet were considered a status symbol and a mark of feminine beauty. However, foot binding was a painful practice that limited the mobility of women and resulted in lifelong disabilities.

The prevalence and practice of foot binding varied over time and by region and social class. The practice may have originated among court dancers during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in 10th-century China and gradually became popular among the elite during the Song dynasty, later spreading to lower social classes by the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Manchu emperors attempted to ban the practice in the 17th century but failed. In some areas, foot binding raised marriage prospects. It has been estimated that by the 19th century 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, rising to almost 100% among upper-class Han Chinese women.

While Christian missionaries and Chinese reformers challenged the practice in the late 19th century, it was not until the early 20th century that the practice began to die out, following the efforts of anti-foot binding campaigns. Additionally, upper-class and urban women dropped the practice sooner than poorer rural women. By 2007, only a handful of elderly Chinese women whose feet had been bound were still alive.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these accounts is of Pan Yunu, a favourite consort of the Southern Qi Emperor Xiao Baojuan. In the story, Pan Yunu, renowned for having delicate feet, performed a dance barefoot on a floor decorated with the design of a golden lotus. The Emperor, expressing admiration, said that &quot;lotus springs from her every step!&quot; ( ), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati, under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms &#x27;golden lotus&#x27; or &#x27;lotus feet&#x27; used to describe bound feet; there is no evidence, however, that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated during the reign of the 10th-century Emperor Li Yu of the Southern Tang, just before the Song dynasty. Li Yu created a golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls and asked his concubine Yao Niang to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon. She then performed a dance on the points of her bound feet on the lotus. Yao Niang&#x27;s dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice. Soon after 1148, in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar wrote that a bound foot should be arch shaped and small. He observed that &quot;women&#x27;s foot binding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras.&quot; In the 13th century, scholar wrote the first known criticism of the practice: &quot;Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small. I do not know what use this is.&quot;

The earliest archeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each woman&#x27;s remains showed feet bound with gauze strips measuring in length. Zhou&#x27;s skeleton, particularly well preserved, showed that her feet fit into the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her. The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras—an ideal known as the &#x27;three-inch golden lotus&#x27;—may be a later development in the 16th century.

===Later eras===
At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe, the heel of which contained a small cup. During the Yuan dynasty some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called &#x27;toast to the golden lotus&#x27; and lasted until the late Qing dynasty.

The first European to mention foot binding was the Italian missionary Odoric of Pordenone in the 14th century, during the Yuan dynasty. However no other foreign visitors to Yuan China mentioned the practice, including Ibn Battuta and Marco Polo (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women, who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time. The practice was encouraged by Mongol rulers for their Chinese subjects. The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general populace, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted foot binding. By the Ming period the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry and had instead come to be considered a status symbol. As foot binding restricted the movement of a woman, one side effect of its rising popularity was the corresponding decline of the art of women&#x27;s dance in China, and it became increasingly rare to hear about beauties and courtesans who were also great dancers after the Song era.

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader Hong Taiji declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the Kangxi Emperor. Few Han Chinese complied with the edicts, and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40–50% of Chinese women had bound feet. Among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%. Bound feet became a mark of beauty and were also a prerequisite for finding a husband. They also became an avenue for poorer women to marry up in some areas, such as Sichuan. In late 19th century Guangdong it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would be assumed never to have the need to work. Women, their families and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the &#x27;Golden Lotus&#x27;, being about three Chinese inches () long—around . This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Handmade shoes served to exhibit the embroidery skill of the wearer as well. These shoes also served as support, as some women with bound feet might not have been able to walk without the support of their shoes and would have been severely limited in their mobility. Contrary to missionary writings, many women with bound feet were able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitations than their non-bound counterparts.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were dancers with bound feet as well as circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in Yunnan Province formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire. In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s assisted in the rice fields (albeit in a limited capacity) even into the early 21st century.

=== Decline ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the leaders of the Taiping Rebellion were men of Hakka background whose women did not bind their feet, and they outlawed foot binding in areas under their control. However the rebellion failed and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice that had deleterious social effect on women, then played a part in changing elite opinion on foot binding through education, pamphleteering and lobbying of the Qing court, as no other culture in the world practised the custom of foot binding.

The earliest-known Western anti-foot binding society was formed in Amoy (Xiamen) in 1874. 60–70 Christian women in Xiamen attended a meeting presided over by a missionary, John MacGowan, and formed the Natural Foot Society ( , literally Heavenly Foot Society). MacGowan held the view that foot binding was a serious problem that called into doubt the whole of Chinese civilization; he felt that &quot;the nefarious civilization interferes with Divine Nature.&quot; Members of the Heavenly Foot Society vowed not to bind their daughters&#x27; feet. In 1895, Christian women in Shanghai led by Alicia Little, also formed a Natural Foot Society. It was also championed by the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Movement founded in 1883 and advocated by missionaries including Timothy Richard, who thought that Christianity could promote equality between the sexes. This missionary-led opposition had stronger impacts than earlier Han or Manchu opposition. Western missionaries established the first schools for girls, and encouraged women to end the practice of foot binding. Christian missionaries did not conceal their shock and disgust either when explaining the process of foot binding to Western peers and their descriptions shocked their audience back home.

Reform-minded Chinese intellectuals began to consider foot binding to be an aspect of their culture that needed to be eliminated. In 1883, Kang Youwei founded the Anti-footbinding Society near Canton to combat the practice, and anti-foot binding societies appeared across the country, with membership for the movement claimed to reach 300,000. The anti-foot binding movement stressed pragmatic and patriotic reasons rather than feminist ones, arguing that abolition of foot binding would lead to better health and more efficient labour. Kang Youwei submitted a petition to the throne commenting on the fact that China had become a joke to foreigners and that &quot;footbinding was the primary object of such ridicule.&quot;

Reformers such as Liang Qichao, influenced by Social Darwinism, also argued that it weakened the nation, since enfeebled women supposedly produced weak sons. In his &quot;On Women&#x27;s Education&quot;, Liang Qichao asserts that the root cause of national weakness inevitably lies the lack of education for women. Qichao connected education for women and foot binding: &quot;As long as foot binding remains in practice, women&#x27;s education can never flourish.&quot; Qichao was also disappointed that foreigners had opened the first schools as he thought that the Chinese should be teaching Chinese women. At the turn of the 20th century, early feminists, such as Qiu Jin, called for the end of foot binding. In 1906, Zhao Zhiqian wrote in &quot;Beijing Women&#x27;s News&quot; to blame women with bound feet for being a national weakness in the eyes of other nations. Many members of anti-foot binding groups pledged to not bind their daughters&#x27; feet nor to allow their sons to marry women with bound feet. In 1902, Empress Dowager Cixi issued an anti-foot binding edict, but it was soon rescinded.

In 1912 the new Republic of China government banned foot binding, though the ban was not actively implemented, and leading intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement saw foot binding as a major symbol of China&#x27;s backwardness. Provincial leaders, such as Yan Xishan in Shanxi, engaged in their own sustained campaign against foot binding with foot inspectors and fines for those who continued the practice, while regional governments of the later Nanjing regime also enforced the ban. The campaign against foot binding was successful in some regions. In one province, a 1929 survey showed that, while only 2.3% of girls born before 1910 had unbound feet, 95% of those born after were not bound. In a region south of Beijing, Dingxian, where over 99% of women once had bound feet, no new cases were found among those born after 1919. In Taiwan, the practice was also discouraged by the ruling Japanese from the beginning of Japanese rule, and from 1911 to 1915 it was gradually made illegal. The practice lingered on in some regions in China. In 1928, a census in rural Shanxi found that 18% of women had bound feet, while in some remote rural areas, such as Yunnan Province, it continued to be practiced until the 1950s. In most parts of China the practice had virtually disappeared by 1949. The practice was also stigmatized in Communist China, and the last vestiges of foot binding were stamped out, with the last new case of foot binding reported in 1957. By the 21st century, only a few elderly women in China still had bound feet. In 1999, the last shoe factory making lotus shoes, the Zhiqian Shoe Factory in Harbin, closed.

==Practice==
=== Variations and prevalence ===
Foot binding was practised in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called &quot;cucumber foot&quot; ( ) due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel or taper the ankle. Some working women in Jiangsu made a pretence of binding while keeping their feet natural. Not all women were always bound—some women once bound remained bound throughout their lives, some were only briefly bound and some were bound until marriage. Foot binding was most common among women whose work involved domestic crafts and those in urban areas; it was also more common in northern China, where it was widely practised by women of all social classes, but less so in parts of southern China such as Guangdong and Guangxi, where it was largely a practice of women in the provincial capitals or among the gentry. Feet were bound to their smallest in the northern provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and Shaanxi, but the binding was less extreme and less common in the southern provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou, where not all daughters of the wealthy had bound feet. Foot binding limited the mobility of girls, so they became engaged in handwork from childhood. It is thought that the necessity for female labour in the fields owing to a longer growing season in the South and the impracticability of bound feet working in wet rice fields limited the spread of the practice in the countryside of the South. However some farming women bound their daughter&#x27;s feet, but &quot;the process began later than in elite families, and feet were bound more loosely among the poor.&quot;
Manchu women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the Eight Banners, did not bind their feet. The most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance. The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These Manchu platform shoes were known as &quot;flower bowl&quot; shoes () or &quot;horse-hoof&quot; shoes (); they have a platform generally made of wood in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing did not bind their feet either, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50–60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Han immigrant women to the Northeast came under Manchu influence and abandoned foot binding. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.

The Hakka people were unusual among Han Chinese in not practising foot binding. Most non-Han Chinese people, such as the Manchus, Mongols and Tibetans, did not bind their feet. Some non-Han ethnic groups did. Foot binding was practised by the Hui Muslims in Gansu Province. The Dungan Muslims, descendants of Hui from northwestern China who fled to central Asia, were also practising foot binding up to 1948. In southern China, in Canton (Guangzhou), 19th-century Scottish scholar James Legge noted a mosque that had a placard denouncing foot binding, saying Islam did not allow it since it constituted violating the creation of God.

=== Process ===
The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of four and nine. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb and the pain would not be as extreme.

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood. This was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, long and wide, were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot and around the heel, the broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. The foot was drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot forcibly broken. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, pressing the toes beneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.

The girl&#x27;s broken feet required a great deal of care and attention and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound they were washed, the toes checked for injury, and the nails trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl&#x27;s feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused necrotic flesh to fall off.

Immediately after this procedure, the girl&#x27;s broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl&#x27;s feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl&#x27;s family or a professional footbinder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter&#x27;s pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.

Once a girl&#x27;s foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful, and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain again. The timing and degree of foot binding varied among communities.

=== Health problems ===

The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl&#x27;s toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would initially give off a foul odour. Later the smell may have come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds. Most of the women receiving treatment did not go out often and were disabled.

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off. This was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk of medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections owing to foot binding.

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However as the girl grew older the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to rebreaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls&#x27; feet would often be deliberately broken again to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the girl&#x27;s toes, which were broken several times since small toes were especially desirable. Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance properly on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position. Other issues that may have arisen from foot binding included paralysis and muscular atrophy. By the turn of the century foot binding had been exposed in photographs, X-rays and detailed textual descriptions. These scientific investigations detailed how foot binding deformed the leg, covered the skin with cracks and sores and altered the posture.
There is also some evidence that points to some older women in select rural areas experiencing higher levels of osteoporosis morbidities.

== Views and interpretations ==
There are many interpretations to the practice of foot binding. The interpretive models used include fashion (with the Chinese customs somewhat comparable to the more extreme examples of Western women&#x27;s fashion such as corsetry), seclusion (sometimes evaluated as morally superior to the gender mingling in the West), perversion (the practice imposed by men with sexual perversions), inexplicable deformation, child abuse and extreme cultural traditionalism. In the late 20th century some feminists introduced positive overtones, reporting that it gave some women a sense of mastery over their bodies and pride in their beauty.

===Beauty and erotic appeal===

Before foot binding was practised in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the Tang dynasty tale of Ye Xian written around 850 by Duan Chengshi. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of Cinderella and is thought to be one of its antecedents. For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman&#x27;s beauty and made her movement more dainty, and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. Even while not much was written on the subject of foot binding prior to the latter half of the 19th century, the writings that were done on this topic, particularly by educated men, frequently alluded to the erotic nature and appeal of bound feet in their poetry. The desirability varies with the size of the feet—the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called ) would be around 3 Chinese inches (around ) or smaller, while those larger were called (4 Chinese inches—around ) or (5 Chinese inches—around —or larger, and thus the least desirable for marriage). Therefore people had greater expectations for foot binding brides. The belief that foot binding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of foot binding.

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic. Some men preferred never to see a woman&#x27;s bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny &#x27;lotus shoes&#x27; and wrappings. According to Robert van Gulik, the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman&#x27;s body. In erotic art of the Qing period where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered. Howard Levy, however, suggests that the barely revealed bound foot may also only function as an initial tease.

An effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered to be erotically attractive to some men. Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud considered foot binding to be a &quot;perversion that corresponds to foot fetishism&quot;, and that it appeased male castration anxiety.

===Role of Confucianism===
During the Song dynasty, the status of women declined. A common argument is that it was the result of the revival of Confucianism as neo-Confucianism and that, in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the cult of widow chastity, it also contributed to the development of foot binding. According to Robert van Gulik, the prominent Song Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate. It was claimed by Lin Yutang among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that Zhu Xi also promoted foot binding in Fujian as a way of encouraging chastity among women; that by restricting their movement, it would help keep men and women separate. However, historian Patricia Ebrey suggests that this story might be fictitious, and argued that the practice arose so as to emphasize the gender distinction during a period of societal change in the Song dynasty.

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of foot binding, and unbound women were also praised. The Neo-Confucian Cheng Yi was said to be against foot binding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet. Modern Confucian scholars such as Tu Weiming also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and foot binding, as Confucian doctrine prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not &quot;injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father&quot;. It is argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.

Historian Dorothy Ko proposed that foot binding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that foot binding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized. Foot binding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation. One from 1591, for example, placed foot binding in a section on &quot;Female Adornments&quot; that included hairdos, powders, and ear piercings. According to Ko, the perception of foot binding as a civilized practice may be evinced from a Ming dynasty account that mentioned a proposal to &quot;entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs&quot; by encouraging foot binding among their womenfolk. The practice was carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age. Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of foot binding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.

===Feminist perspective===

Foot binding is considered an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture. It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women. Bound feet rendered women dependent on their families, particularly the men, as they became largely restricted to their homes. Thus, the practice ensured that women were much more reliant on their husbands. The early Chinese feminist Qiu Jin, who underwent the painful process of unbinding her own bound feet, attacked foot binding and other traditional practices. She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient by imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls could ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era. The end of the practice of foot binding is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China, and a major event in the history of Chinese feminism.

In the late 20th century, some feminists have pushed back against the prevailing Western critiques of foot binding, arguing that the presumption that foot binding was done solely for the sexual pleasure of men denies the agency and cultural influence of women.

===Other interpretations===
Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the notion that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well (in general, bound women did not improve their class position by marriage). Foot binding is believed to have spread from elite women to civilian women and there were large differences in each region. The body and labor of unmarried daughters belonged to their parents, thereby the boundaries between work and kinship for women were blurred. They argued that foot binding was an instrumental means to reserve women to handwork, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork, and keep them close at hand. This argument has been challenged by John Shepherd in his book &quot;Footbinding as Fashion&quot;, and shows there was no connection between handicraft industries and the proportion of women bound in Hebei.

Foot binding was common when women could do light industry, but where women were required to do heavy farm work they often did not bind their feet because it hindered physical work. These scholars argued that the coming of the mechanized industry at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, such as the introduction of industrial textile processes, resulted in a loss of light handwork for women, removing a reason to maintain the practice. Mechanization resulted in women who worked at home facing a crisis. Coupled with changes in politics and people&#x27;s consciousness, the practice of foot binding disappeared in China forever after two generations. More specifically, the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing (after the First Opium War) opened five cities as treaty ports where foreigners could live and trade. This led to foreign citizens residing in the area, where many proselytized as Christian missionaries. These foreigners condemned many long-standing Chinese cultural practices like foot binding as &quot;uncivilized&quot; — marking the beginning of the end for the centuries-long practice.

It has been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus&#x27; conquest in 1644, as it was then practised only by Han women. During the Qing dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries. John Shepherd provides a critical review of the evidence cited for the notion that foot binding was an expression of &quot;Han identity&quot; and rejects this interpretation.

==In popular culture==

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of Pearl Buck&#x27;s &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral or empirical, implying respect for Chinese culture. Sometimes, the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply condescension or contempt for China.

* Quoted in the &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; (): &quot;displaying her exquisite feet, three inches long and no wider than a thumb, very pointed and with high insteps.&quot;
* Anna Bunina mentions the custom in her 1810 fable &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Peking Stadium&quot;), which describes a Chinese woman attempting to run a race and barely finishing the boys&#x27; course, yet still getting applause for the effort. Bunina used the custom as an allegory to her own difficulties in getting recognition as a poet.
* &quot;Flowers in the Mirror&quot; (1837) by Ju-Chen Li includes chapters set in the &quot;Country of Women&quot;, where men bear children and have bound feet.
* &quot;The Three-Inch Golden Lotus&quot; (1994) by Feng Jicai presents a satirical picture of the movement to abolish the practice, which is seen as part of Chinese culture.
* In the film &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958), Ingrid Bergman portrays a British missionary to China Gladys Aylward, who is assigned as a foreigner the task by a local Mandarin to unbind the feet of young women, an unpopular order that the civil government had failed to fulfil. Later, the children are able to escape troops by walking miles to safety.
* Ruthanne Lum McCunn wrote a biographical novel, &quot;Thousand Pieces of Gold&quot; (1981, adapted into a 1991 film), about Polly Bemis, a Chinese American pioneer woman. It describes her feet being bound and later unbound when she needed to help her family with farm labor.
* Emily Prager&#x27;s short story &quot;A Visit from the Footbinder&quot;, from her collection of short stories of the same name (1982), describes the last few hours of a young Chinese girl&#x27;s childhood before the professional footbinder arrives to initiate her into the adult woman&#x27;s life of beauty and pain.
* Jung Chang&#x27;s family autobiography &quot;Wild Swans&quot; presents the story of Yu-fang, the grandmother, who had bound feet from the age of two.
* Lisa Loomer&#x27;s play &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; (1994) deals with themes of body modification. One of the three main characters is an 18th-century Chinese woman who arrives in a modern hospital waiting room, seeking medical help for complications resulting from her bound feet. She describes the foot-binding process, as well as the physical and psychological harm her bound feet have caused.
* Lensey Namioka&#x27;s novel &quot;Ties that Bind, Ties that Break&quot; (1999) follows a girl named Ailin in China who refuses to have her feet bound, which comes to affect her future.
* Lisa See&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Flower and the Secret Fan&quot; (2005) is about two Chinese girls who are destined to be friends. The novel is based upon the sacrifices women make to be married and includes the two girls being forced into getting their feet bound. The book was adapted into a 2011 film directed by Wayne Wang.
* The Filipino horror film &quot;Feng Shui&quot; and its sequel &quot;Feng Shui 2&quot; feature a ghost of a foot-bound woman inhabits a bagua and cursed those who holds the item.
* Sieglinde Sullivan from &quot;Black Butler&quot; had her feet bound when she was young as part of the &quot;Emerald Witch&quot; hoax invented by the German military.
* Lisa See&#x27;s novel &quot;China Dolls&quot; (2014) describes Chinese family traditions including foot binding.
* Xiran Jay Zhao&#x27;s novel &quot;Iron Widow&quot; (2021) is set in a futuristic world inspired by medieval China that still practices foot binding. The main character, Wu Zetian, had her feet bound in childhood and suffers from chronic pain due to it.
* Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s novel &quot;China&quot;: An Epic Novel, is set in late Qing Dynasty China, when foot binding was still common practice among Han Chinese in the north. Bright Moon, the daughter of a main character Mei-Ling, has her feet bound to increase her chances of a good marriage, and the practice is described in detail. The character soon resents that she has her feet bound, as it causes her severe pain, and stops her from participating in many activities.
* In episode 9 of the anime series &quot;The Apothecary Diaries&quot;, a servant girl was found dead in a moat. After an autopsy, it was found that she had her feet bound.

<doc id="176762" wikidata="Q19393" url="?curid=176762" title="Whale Rider">
<text>Whale Rider is a 2002 New Zealand drama film written and directed by Niki Caro. Based on the 1987 novel &quot;The Whale Rider&quot; by Witi Ihimaera, the film stars Keisha Castle-Hughes as Kahu Paikea Apirana, a twelve-year-old Māori girl whose ambition is to become the chief of the tribe. Her grandfather believes that this is a role reserved for males only.

The film was a coproduction between New Zealand and Germany. It was shot on location in Whangara, the setting of the novel. The world premiere was on 9 September 2002, at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received critical acclaim upon its release. At age 13, Keisha Castle-Hughes became the youngest nominee for the Academy Award for Best Actress before she was surpassed by Quvenzhané Wallis, at age 9, for &quot;Beasts of the Southern Wild&quot;, in 2012, less than a decade later. The film earned $41.4 million on a NZ$9,235,000 budget. In 2005, the film was named on the BFI &quot;List of the 50 Films You Should See By the Age of 14&quot;.

==Plot==
The film&#x27;s plot follows the story of Paikea Apirana. The village leader should be the first-born son, a direct patrilineal descendant of Paikea, the Whale Rider, he who rode on top of a whale (&quot;Tohorā&quot;) from Hawaiki. Pai is originally born a twin, but her twin brother and her mother died during childbirth. Pai is female and so technically cannot inherit the leadership. While her grandfather, Koro, later forms an affectionate bond with his granddaughter, carrying her to school every day on his bicycle, he also condemns her and blames her for conflicts within the tribe.

After the death of his wife and despite overwhelming pressure from Koro, Pai&#x27;s father refuses to assume traditional leadership or finish the waka that he had started building for the baby son; instead, he moves to Germany to pursue a career as an artist. At one point, Paikea decides to live with her father because her grandfather says he doesn&#x27;t want her. However, as they are driving away, she finds that she cannot bear to leave the sea as the whale seems to be calling her back. Pai tells her father to return her home.

Koro leads a cultural school for the village&#x27;s first-born boys, hoping to find a new leader. He teaches the boys to use a taiaha (fighting stick), which is traditionally reserved for males. Pai is interested in the lessons, but is discouraged and scolded by Koro for doing so. Pai feels that she can become the leader (although no woman has ever done so) and is determined to succeed. Her grandmother, Nanny, tells Pai that her second son, Pai&#x27;s uncle, had won a taiaha tournament in his youth while he was still slim and so Pai secretly learns from him. She also secretly follows Koro&#x27;s lessons. One of the students, Hemi, is also sympathetic towards her.

Koro is enraged when he finds out, particularly when she wins a taiaha fight against Hemi. Koro is devastated when none of the boys succeeds at the traditional task of recovering the rei puta (whale tooth) that he threw into the ocean, the mission that would prove one of them worthy of becoming leader. With the loss of the rei puta, Koro in despair calls out the ancient ones, the whales. In an attempt to help, Pai also calls out to them and they hear her call.

One day Pai, her uncle, her uncle&#x27;s girlfriend Shilo, and others take the boat to where Koro flung the rei puta into the sea. Pai confidently declares she&#x27;ll find it and dives into the water. She finds the rei puta, which means that she is the rightful leader. Nanny does not think Koro is ready to accept this and does not tell him. Pai, in an attempt to bridge the rift that has formed, invites Koro to be her guest of honour at a concert of Māori chants that her school is putting on. Unknown to all, she had won an interschool speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village. However, Koro was late, and as he was walking to the school, he notices that numerous southern right whales - &quot;tohorā&quot; are beached near Pai&#x27;s home.

The entire village attempts to coax and drag them back into the water, but all efforts prove unsuccessful, and even a tractor does not help. Koro sees that as a sign of his failure and despairs further. He admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because she has &quot;done enough&quot; damage with her presumption.

When Koro walks away, Pai climbs onto the back of the largest whale on the beach and coaxes it to re-enter the ocean. The whale leads the entire pod back into the sea; Pai submerges completely underwater before being thrown off the whale&#x27;s back. Fearing Pai is lost, Nanny reveals to Koro that his granddaughter found the rei puta, and Koro realises the error of his ways. When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro declares her the leader and asks for her forgiveness.

The film ends with Pai&#x27;s father, grandparents, and uncle coming together to celebrate her status as the next leader, as the finished waka is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage. In voiceover, Pai declares, &quot;My name is Paikea Apirana, and I come from a long line of chiefs stretching all the way back to the Whale Rider. I&#x27;m not a prophet, but I know that our people will keep going forward, all together, with all of our strength.&quot;

==Production==

The film had budget of NZ$9,235,000. It received $2.5 million from the New Zealand Film Production Fund. Additional financing came from ApolloMedia, Filmstiftung NRW, the New Zealand Film Commission and NZ On Air. Casting director Diana Rowan visited numerous schools to find an actress to play Pai. 10,000 children were auditioned before narrowing it down to 12. Castle-Hughes impressed Caro in the resulting workshop and was cast as Pai. 

The film was shot in Whangara, and in Auckland. Producer John Barnett said &quot;This novel was set in Whangara and it would almost have been heresy to shoot anywhere else. There are very physical things that are described in the book – the sweep of the bay, the island that looks like a whale, the meeting houses, the number of houses that are present and of course, the people whose legend we were telling... If we&#x27;d gone somewhere else and tried to manufacture the surroundings and the ambience, then I think it would have been noticeable in the picture.&quot; 

The whale beaching was depicted using full-scale models created by Auckland-based Glasshammer Visual Effects. The -long waka seen at the end of the film was made in two-halves in Auckland before being transported to Whangara. The waka was given to the Whangara community after filming concluded.

===Critical response===

Based on 155 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 91%, with an average score of 7.77 as of October 2020.

By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 79, based on 31 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton of &quot;The Movie Show&quot; both gave the film four out of five stars. Pomeranz said &quot;Niki Caro has directed this uplifting story with great sensitivity, eliciting affecting performances from a sterling cast, and a wonderful one from newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and said, &quot;The genius of the movie is the way it sidesteps all of the obvious cliches of the underlying story and makes itself fresh, observant, tough and genuinely moving.&quot; He said of Castle-Hughes: &quot;This is a movie star.&quot; Ebert later went on to name it as one of the ten best films of 2003. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Kenneth Turan praised Caro for her &quot;willingness to let this story tell itself in its own time and the ability to create emotion that is intense without being cloying or dishonest.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and praised Castle-Hughes&#x27; acting, saying &quot;so effectively does she convey her pained confusion through subtle vocal cues, tentative stance and expressive dark eyes.&quot;

The film has also been discussed and praised widely within academia. Anthropologist A.

<text>Moseley and Kings Heath is a ward within the constituency of Hall Green, covering the greater part of the Moseley and Kings Heath areas of Birmingham, England.

==Politics==
The &quot;Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Committee&quot; is part of the official structure of Birmingham City Council and exists to discuss issues which affect life within the ward, mostly (although not exclusively) related to the activity of the council. The Committee comprises the two elected Ward Councillors for the area together with the Member of Parliament for the Hall Green, Moseley and King&#x27;s Heath, Sparkbrook, and Springfield constituency, Roger Godsiff, of which the ward is part. However, meetings are well attended with all of those in attendance not only debating the issues of concern to them but voting on policy.

The Ward Committee works with The Moseley and Kings Heath Ward Advisory Board – a grouping of representatives from local groups and organisations – as a kind of executive for the full Ward Committee.

Moseley and Kings Heath Ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Muna Masood.

==Demographics==
The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 24,273 people living in the ward. 31.0% (7,520) are of an ethnic minority compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. White Irish are excluded from these figures, however.

==Transport==
The Alcester Road (A435) passes through the ward and is major route linking the city centre with Redditch and the M40. The A445 and A4040 (Outer Ring Road) are also major roads in the area. Bus routes serving the area are the Number 1, Number 11, Number 35 and Number 50, operated by National Express West Midlands.

The Camp Hill railway line passes through the area however there are no railway stations on it. The area was served by Moseley railway station (opened 1867) and Kings Heath railway station (opened 1840), which were located on the line, however, these were both closed in 1941 along with the other stations on the line.

A reopening of the line has been considered by Birmingham City Council. A feasibility study has concluded that there is a strong economic case for reopening stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and in Hazelwell/ Stirchley. There was a recommendation against opening a railway station at Balsall Heath as it is close to the city centre, however, the report only looked at potential journeys from Balsall Heath going to the city centre and did not take into account people who want to travel to Balsall Heath from districts around the city.

==Places of interest==
The ward covers two conservation areas; Moseley Village and St Agnes. These two areas include many larger residential properties reflecting the affluence of the areas. Other areas in the ward are disadvantaged though.

There are several open spaces within the ward including Cannon Hill Park in Moseley, Kings Heath Park and the private Moseley Park. Within Cannon Hill Park is mac (Midlands Art Centre) which is a non-profits art centre. Other places of interest include Moseley Golf Course and the gardens of Highbury Hall.

Kings Heath and Moseley Village serve as shopping centres for the ward. Kings Heath Library serves the area and hosts a monthly local history group.

<text>The Linux Router Project (LRP) is a now defunct networking-centric micro Linux distribution. The released versions of LRP were small enough to fit on a single 1.44MB floppy disk, and made building and maintaining routers, access servers, thin servers, thin clients, network appliances, and typically embedded systems next to trivial.

== History ==
LRP was conceived and primarily developed by Dave Cinege from 1997 until 2002. It began originally as a &#x27;router on a floppy&#x27; and evolved into a streamlined general purpose network operating system.

As LRP is the oldest embedded Linux distribution, it formed (in whole or in part) the basis of many other embedded system distributions and commercial products which followed it. Several parts developed or specifically enhanced for LRP are still found in common usage today such as POSIXness and BusyBox.

==Pioneering Features==
* Small base OS footprint
* A simplified packaging system
* Menu based system and package configuration
* Strict separation of volatile, non-volatile, Read Only, and Read/Write areas of the root hierarchy
* Unpacked and run from ramdisk or run directly from flash
* A system to commit configuration changes to a non-volatile medium (Disk/Flash)

==Unreleased Work==
Dave Cinege worked on a version 4.0 rewrite of LRP from late 2000 into January 2001. He then began testing some ideas he had with proof of concept code, which he claimed was a radical departure from the status quo. To his surprise, this new direction seemed ideal, prompting him to abandon all work done on LRP 4.0 and begin from scratch on a new OS named LRP 5.0.

LRP 5.0 development was headed towards a complete rewrite and reimplementation of Linux userland with a new standard design outside of the POSIX specification. The stated purpose of this was to provide a modern standard base operating system suitable for any application including embedded systems, appliances, servers, and desktop computers.

Cinege however stopped work several months later due to financial reasons. He refused to release any further work, or even the name of this OS, due to animosity towards the computer industry and what he perceived as the plundering of open source authors&#x27; work by large corporations.

On May 6, 2003 Cinege updated the LRP website to reflect that the project was being abandoned.

==LRP 5.0 Proposed Features==
* A base OS size of 8MB
* A new shell and scripting language unrelated to bourne shell
* A new packaging scheme that would retrofit other OSes
* An application management system
* A core process management system

<doc id="176767" wikidata="Q186285" url="?curid=176767" title="University of Copenhagen">
<text>The University of Copenhagen (, KU) is a public research university in Copenhagen, Denmark. Founded in 1479, the University of Copenhagen is the second-oldest university in Scandinavia after Uppsala University.

The University of Copenhagen consists of six different faculties, with teaching taking place in its four distinct campuses, all situated in Copenhagen. The university operates 36 different departments and 122 separate research centres in Copenhagen, as well as a number of museums and botanical gardens in and outside the Danish capital. The University of Copenhagen also owns and operates multiple research stations around Denmark, with two additional ones located in Greenland. Additionally, The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the public hospitals of the Capital and Zealand Region of Denmark constitute the conglomerate Copenhagen University Hospital.

As of October 2022, 10 Nobel laureates and 1 Turing Award laureate have been affiliated with the University of Copenhagen as students, alumni or faculty. Alumni include one president of the United Nations General Assembly and at least 24 prime ministers of Denmark.

==History==

The University of Copenhagen was founded on 1 June 1479 and is the oldest university in Denmark. In 1475, Christian I of Denmark received a papal bull from Pope Sixtus IV with permission to establish a university in Denmark. The bull was issued on 19 June 1475 as a result of the visit to Rome by Christian I&#x27;s wife, Dorothea of Brandenburg, Queen of Denmark.

On 4 October 1478 Christian I of Denmark issued a royal decree by which he officially established the University of Copenhagen. In this decree, Christian I set down the rules and laws governing the university. The royal decree elected magistar Peder Albertsen as vice chancellor of the university, and the task was his to employ various learned scholars at the new university and thereby establish its first four faculties: theology, law, medicine and philosophy. The royal decree made the University of Copenhagen enjoy royal patronage from its very beginning. Furthermore, the university was explicitly established as an autonomous institution, giving it a great degree of juridical freedom. As such, the University of Copenhagen was to be administered without royal interference, and it was not subject to the usual laws governing the Danish people.

The University of Copenhagen was dissolved in about 1531 as a result of the spread of Protestantism. It was re-established in 1537 by King Christian III after the Lutheran Reformation. The king charged Johannes Bugenhagen, who came from Wittenberg to Copenhagen to take up a chair of theology, with the drawing up of a new University Charter. The resulting Charter was issued in 1539. Between 1675 and 1788, the university introduced the concept of degree examinations. An examination for theology was added in 1675, followed by law in 1736. By 1788, all faculties required an examination before they would issue a degree.

In 1807, the British Bombardment of Copenhagen destroyed most of the university&#x27;s buildings. By 1836, however, the new main building of the university was inaugurated amid extensive building that continued until the end of the century. The University Library (now a part of the Royal Library), the Zoological Museum, the Geological Museum, the Botanic Garden with greenhouses, and the Technical College were also established during this period.
Between 1842 and 1850, the faculties at the university were restructured. Starting in 1842, the University Faculty of Medicine and the Academy of Surgeons merged to form the Faculty of Medical Science, while in 1848 the Faculty of Law was reorganised and became the Faculty of Jurisprudence and Political Science. In 1850, the Faculty of Mathematics and Science was separated from the Faculty of Philosophy. In 1845 and 1862 Copenhagen co-hosted Nordic student meetings with Lund University.

The first female student was enrolled at the university in 1877. The university underwent explosive growth between 1960 and 1980. The number of students rose from around 6,000 in 1960 to about 26,000 in 1980, with a correspondingly large growth in the number of employees. Buildings built during this time period include the new Zoological Museum, the Hans Christian Ørsted and August Krogh Institutes, the campus centre on Amager Island, and the Panum Institute.
The new university statute instituted in 1970 involved democratisation of the management of the university. It was modified in 1973 and subsequently applied to all higher education institutions in Denmark. The democratisation was later reversed with the 2003 university reforms. Further change in the structure of the university from 1990 to 1993 made a Bachelor&#x27;s degree programme mandatory in virtually all subjects.

Also in 1993, the law departments broke off from the Faculty of Social Sciences to form a separate Faculty of Law. In 1994, the University of Copenhagen designated environmental studies, north–south relations, and biotechnology as areas of special priority according to its new long-term plan. Starting in 1996 and continuing to the present, the university planned new buildings, including for the University of Copenhagen Faculty of Humanities at Amager (Ørestaden), along with a Biotechnology Centre. By 1999, the student population had grown to exceed 35,000, resulting in the university appointing additional professors and other personnel.
In 2003, the revised Danish university law removed faculty, staff and students from the university decision process, creating a top-down control structure that has been described as absolute monarchy, since leaders are granted extensive powers while being appointed exclusively by higher levels in the organization.

In 2005, the Center for Health and Society (Center for Sundhed og Samfund – CSS) opened in central Copenhagen, housing the Faculty of Social Sciences and Institute of Public Health, which until then had been located in various places throughout the city. In May 2006, the university announced further plans to leave many of its old buildings in the inner city of Copenhagen, an area that has been home to the university for more than 500 years. The purpose of this has been to gather the university&#x27;s many departments and faculties on three larger campuses in order to create a bigger, more concentrated and modern student environment with better teaching facilities, as well as to save money on rent and maintenance of the old buildings. The concentration of facilities on larger campuses also allows for more inter-disciplinary cooperation; for example, the Departments of Political Science and Sociology are now located in the same facilities at CSS and can pool resources more easily.

In January 2007, the University of Copenhagen merged with the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University and the Danish University of Pharmaceutical Science. The two universities were converted into faculties under the University of Copenhagen, and were renamed as the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. In January 2012, the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the veterinary third of the Faculty of Life Sciences merged with the Faculty of Health Sciences forming the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences – and the other two thirds of the Faculty of Life Sciences were merged into the Faculty of Science.

==Campuses==
The university has four main campus areas that are located in the Capital Region (three in Copenhagen and one in Frederiksberg):
*North Campus – home to most of the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.
*City Campus – home to the Faculty of Social Sciences and Central Administration as well as parts of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Science.
*South Campus – houses the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Theology, and a small proportion of the Faculty of Science.
*Frederiksberg Campus – home to sections of the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences.

The Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences and the Faculty of Science also use the Taastrup Campus, which is located in Taastrup on the western outskirts of Copenhagen. The Faculty of Science also has facilities in Helsingør, Hørsholm and Nødebo.

==Organisation and administration==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 11 members: 6 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 2 members are appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the university students. The rector, the prorector and the director of the university are appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints directors of the different parts of the central administration and deans of the different faculties. The deans appoint heads of 50 departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance, although there are elected Academic Boards at faculty level who advise the deans. , the governing body manages an annual budget of about DKK 8.9 billion.

The university is organized into six faculties and about 100 departments and research centres. The university employs about 5,600 academic staff and 4,400 technical and administrative staff. The six faculties are:
* Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences
* Faculty of Humanities
* Faculty of Law
* Faculty of Science
* Faculty of Social Sciences
* Faculty of Theology

The total number of enrolled students is about 36,500, including about 21,000 undergraduate students and 15,500 graduate students as of 2024. The university has an international graduate talent programme which provides grants for international Ph.D., students and a tenure track carrier system. It operates about fifty master&#x27;s programmes taught in English, and has arranged about 150 exchange agreements with other institutions and 800 Erasmus agreements. Each year there are about 1,700 incoming exchange students, 2,000 outbound exchange students and 4,000 international degree-seeking students. About 3,000 PhD students study there each year.

==University housing==

Most university students stay in privately owned dormitories (&quot;kollegier&quot; in Danish) or apartments in Copenhagen. There are five dormitories that are partially administered by the university; however, only students who have passed at least two years of studies are considered for admission. These are normally referred to as the &quot;old dormitories&quot;, and they consist of: Regensen, Elers&#x27; Kollegium, Borchs Kollegium, Hassagers Kollegium, and Valkendorfs Kollegium. The University of Copenhagen also offers Carlsberg Foundation researcher apartments for a duration of 6 months to 3 years for visiting research and academic research staff who affiliated with research projects funded by the Carlsberg Foundation.

The Housing Foundation Copenhagen is a separate commercial entity to the University of Copenhagen run by Chairman Erik Bisgaard Madsen and a board of directors. The Housing Foundation Copenhagen provides short-term housing exclusively for university international students ( sometimes Danish students), university staff and guest researchers. Their central office is based at South Campus. The Housing Foundation Copenhagen has received considerable criticism for the exploitation of international students for business profits and poor living conditions, and most recently the refusal of shortening contracts for many international students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Seal==
The university&#x27;s oldest known seal dates from a 1531 letter, it depicts Saint Peter with a key and a book. In a circle around him is the text

When the university was re-established by Christian III in 1537 after the Protestant Reformation, it received a new seal, showing king Christian III with crown, sceptre, and globus cruciger above a crowned coat of arms vertically divided between halved versions of the coat of arms of Denmark (to the viewer&#x27;s left, &quot;dexter&quot;) and the coat of arms of Norway (to the viever&#x27;s right, &quot;sinister&quot;). The text is
The 1537 seal is very similar to the current seal, which was made in 2000 and is shown at the top of this page. The text is different and the crowned shield shows the coat of arms of Denmark (as has been the case since 1820, when the heraldic reference to Norway was removed). The text is
In addition to the university seal, each of the university&#x27;s six faculties carry seals of their own.

<doc id="176768" wikidata="Q156742" url="?curid=176768" title="Dornier Do 17">
<text>The Dornier Do 17 is a twin-engined light bomber designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Dornier Flugzeugwerke. Large numbers were operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; throughout the Second World War.

The Do 17 was designed during the early 1930s as a &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; (&quot;fast bomber&quot;) that was intended to use its speed to outrun opposing fighter aircraft. It was a lightly built aircraft, possessing a twin tail, &quot;shoulder wing&quot; and typically powered by a pair of Bramo 323P radial engines. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 23 November 1934; it entered regular service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; three years later. Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fliegender Bleistift&quot; (&quot;flying pencil&quot;) or the &quot;Eversharp&quot;, the Do 17 was a relatively popular aircraft among its crews due to its handling, especially at low altitude, which made the type harder to hit than other German bombers of the era.

During 1937, the Do 17 made its combat debut during the Spanish Civil War, where it operated as part of the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111, it was the main bomber type of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; at the start of the Second World War. The Do 17 was used extensively throughout the first half of the conflict, seeing action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft. As such, it was deployed during the Polish Campaign, the Norwegian Campaign, the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and Operation Barbarossa amongst others. Its usage continued unabated up until the end of 1941, when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed by its limited bomb load and range capabilities.

Production of the Do 17 ended in mid-1940 in favour of the newer and more powerful Junkers Ju 88. The successor of the Do 17 was the much more powerful Dornier Do 217, which started to appear in quantity during 1942. The type was not withdrawn at this point; instead, the Do 17 continued to serve with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the latter years of the conflict in various secondary roles, including as a glider tug, research, and trainer aircraft. A considerable number were transferred to other Axis-aligned nations, including the Finnish Air Force, Bulgarian Air Force and the Spanish Air Force amongst others. Only a few aircraft are known to have survived the war and none are intact as of the twenty-first century.

==Development==
In 1932, the Ordnance Department (&quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot;) issued a specification for the construction of a &quot;freight aircraft for German State Railways&quot;, and a &quot;high speed mail plane for Lufthansa&quot;. Dornier began work on the design on 1 August 1932.

When the Nazis took power in 1933, Hermann Göring became National Commissar for aviation with former Deutsche Luft Hansa employee Erhard Milch as his deputy, soon forming the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/Reich Aviation Ministry). The Ministry of Aviation designated the new aircraft Do 17, and on 17 March 1933, just three months after taking office, Milch gave the go ahead for the building of prototypes. At the end of 1933, the Ministry of Aviation issued an order for a &quot;high speed aircraft with double tail,&quot; and for a &quot;freight aircraft with special equipment,&quot; in other words, a bomber. The original design (the Do 17 V1) configuration in 1932 had sported a single vertical stabilizer, and Dornier continued developing that model. The Do 17 was first demonstrated in mock-up form in April 1933. The &quot;special equipment&quot; was to be fitted later, to disguise its offensive role.

In April 1934, the Dornier works at Friedrichshafen began project &quot;definition.&quot; During this month, the defensive armament was designed and the bomb release mechanism details ironed out. Production of these prototypes began on 20 May 1934 and, on 23 November 1934, the Do 17 V1, with a single fin and powered by a pair of BMW VI 7.3 motors, took off on its maiden flight. Testing was delayed by a series of accidents, with V1 being damaged in landing accidents in February and April 1935. The twin-tailed V2 (powered by low-compression BMW VI 6.3 engines) first flew on 18 May 1935 and was evaluated together with the V1 by the Ministry of Aviation at Rechlin in June. During the tests, the single fin proved to be only marginally stable, resulting in the V1 being modified with a twin tail. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash after an engine failure on 21 December 1935. The V3, also fitted with a twin tail, was originally planned to be powered by Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engines, but as these were unavailable, it was fitted with BMW VI 7.3 engines like the V1 and flew on 19 September 1935. The V1 prototype remained the only built machine with the single stabilizer.

It is claimed that, unlike the Heinkel He 111 series, whose military use was planned from the start, the Do 17 V1 was contracted as a fast six-passenger mail plane to compete with the smaller Heinkel He 70 monoplane. It has been suggested that it was rejected by Luft Hansa, as the cramped cabin was too uncomfortable for passenger use and the operating costs were too high for a mail plane. According to the story, the three prototypes remained unused in the Dornier factory in Lowental for almost six months, until Flugkapitän Untucht of Luft Hansa came across them. After receiving permission to fly one of the machines, he proceeded to put it through an almost stunt flying routine. After landing, he said that &quot;the machine is as nimble as a fighter, give it more lateral stability and we&#x27;ll have a high speed bomber!&quot; Untucht&#x27;s comments prompted Dornier to redesign the tail unit and revived interest in the type.

Dornier was then ordered to produce the V4 prototype. Some sources state this differed from the V3 in that the passenger portholes were removed and the single fin was replaced with two smaller ones. Photographic evidence demonstrates the V3 had twin stabilizers from the start of its construction. The tests of the &quot;twin-tailed&quot; V4, V6 and V7 prototypes were positive and more prototypes like the V8 emerged as the forerunner of the long-range reconnaissance version, while the V9 was tested as a high-speed airliner. The V9 machine was still flying in 1944.

During 1937, the Do 17 made a high-profile public debut in Zürich at the International Military Aircraft Competition. By this time, bomber squadrons of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; were already being equipped with the first two productions models, the Do 17E and F. During 1938, both these versions were flying combat missions in the Spanish Civil War.

==Design==
The forward fuselage had a conventional stepped cockpit, with a fully glazed nose. Early variants were labelled the &quot;flying pencil&quot; owing to its sleek and continuous &quot;stick-like&quot; lines. As a result of the lessons learned in the Spanish Civil War, the cockpit roof was raised and the lower, or bottom half, of the crew compartment was a typical under-nose gondola or &quot;Bodenlafette&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Bola&quot;): this inverted-casemate design ventral defensive armament position was a common feature of most German medium bombers. The &quot;Bola&quot; was extended back to the leading edge of the wings where the lower-rear gunners position and upper-rear gunner position were level with each other. As with contemporary German bombers, the crew were concentrated in a single compartment. 

The cockpit layout consisted of the pilot seat and front gunner in the forward part of the cockpit. The pilot sat on the left side, close up to the Plexiglas windshield. One of the gunners sat on the right seat, which was set further back to provide room for the MG 15 machine gun to be traversed in use. The Do 17 usually carried a crew of four: the pilot, a bombardier and two gunners. The bomb-aimer also manned the MG 15 in the nose glazing and &quot;Bola&quot;-housed rear lower position. The two gunners operated the forward-firing MG 15 installed in the front windshield, the two MGs located in the side windows (one each side) and the rearward firing weapon. The cockpit offered a bright and panoramic view at high altitude. The standard ammunition load was 3,300 rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition in 44 double-drum magazines.
The wings were of a broad area and had a span of with a straight leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with the top of the fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway down the side of the fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.

The fuselage was long. It was thin and narrow, which presented an enemy with a difficult target to hit. The fuselage had twin vertical stabilizers to increase lateral stability. The power plant of the Z-1 was to have been the Daimler-Benz DB 601 but, owing to shortages from priority allocation for Bf 109E and Bf 110 fighter production, it was allocated Bramo 323 A-1 power plants. The Bramos could only reach at . The limited performance of the Bramo 323s ensured the Do 17 could not reach at in level flight when fully loaded. The range of the Do 17Z-1 at ground level was ; this increased to 1,370 km (850 nm) at . This gave an average attack range of . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased the Z-2 performance slightly in all areas.

The Dornier had self-sealing fuel tanks to protect fuel stored in the wings and fuselage. This reduced the loss of fuel and risk of fire when hit in action, and often enabled the aircraft to return. Twenty oxygen bottles were provided for crew use during long flights above . Communications usually consisted of FuG X, the later FuG 10, navigational direction finder &quot;PeilG V&quot; direction finder (PeilG - &quot;Peilgerät&quot;) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the Siemens K4Ü, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder&#x27;s control surfaces.

The bomb bay had four bomb racks, the No. 5 for SC50 bombs and two ETC 500 racks to carry heavier loads of up to each. A &quot;Lotfe&quot; A, or B bombsight was issued together with the BZA-2 aperture (a modernised optical lens system). The bomb bay allowed two options, one was to carry four bombs for a load of , which reduced aircraft range. With half the maximum load, ten bombs, additional fuel tanks could be placed into the forward part of the bomb bay to increase range. The bomb aimer aimed the bombs via the Lotfe (A, B or C 7/A, depending on the variant) bomb sight which was in the left side of the nose compartment directly under and forward of the pilot. When fully loaded, the Z-1 weighed .

==Variants==
===Early Daimler-Benz-powered variants===

The initial production variants were the Do 17E-1 bomber, which was tested with two Daimler-Benz DB 600, and Do 17F-1 reconnaissance aircraft, powered like the early prototypes with BMW VI engines, which entered production in late 1936. The first Luftwaffe units converted to the Do 17 in early 1937.

The Do 17E-1 was equipped with two BMW VI 7.3D inline engines of 750 PS each. The crew numbered three. The radio operator manned the two 7.92 mm MG 15 machine guns within a &quot;B-Stand&quot; pod in the rear cockpit; they had 750 rounds of ammunition. The bomb bay was divided into two compartments. Each had five bomb racks with individual capacity of . A single ETC 500/IX bomb rack could be mounted externally underneath the aircraft to carry a 500 kg bomb. A Do 17 E-1 with the designation D-AJUN was tested with an unusual configuration, two SC 500 bombs mounted side by side under the fuselage. It showed a notable performance reduction due to the increase in weight and drag, this configuration was not used operationally. The E-1 continued to carry low bomb loads into the Second World War. The performance of the E-1 enabled it to reach a speed of at . Conducting a shallow dive the light frame of the Do 17 could reach . Its maximum ceiling was . Several E-1s were rebuilt as E-2 or E-3, at least three E-2 and one E-3 were used by DVL and Hansa-Luftbild GmbH (Hansa Aerial Photography Ltd) in a secret military reconnaissance role prior to the war.

The Do 17F-1 was a long-range reconnaissance aircraft based on field modified Do 17Es. The Do 17 prototype V8 was used to test the configuration of the F-1 and V11 for the F-2. The defensive armament consisted of a MG 15 in the B- and C-Stand (B-Stand - an upper rear firing position, C-Stand — lower gun emplacement). The fuselage had two cameras along with six ejector tubes for flashlight cartridges. The F-1 saw service until replaced by the Do 17 P in 1938. Only one F-2 was ever built, it was designated D-ACZJ and was used by Zeiss-Jena Company as a factory aircraft.

Conversion of two E-2 series aircraft with two BMW 132F radial engines led to the Do 17 J-1 and J-2. These aircraft served as flight testing machines to evaluate the BMW 132 for usage in the Do 17. The aircraft were the V18 (&quot;Wrk Nr&quot;, or &quot;Werknummer&quot; meaning works/factory number, 2021) and V19 (Wrk Nr 2022) prototypes. Trials began in late 1937. A similar conversion, but with Bramo 323 radial engines, led to the designation Do 17 L-1 and L-2. Two Do 17 (Wrk Nr 2031 and 2032) were renamed as V20 and V21 prototypes and used to evaluate the Bramo 323 for usage in the Do 17. The test was satisfactory and all future production models were equipped with this engine.

After seeing the Do 17M V1 at the Zürich air races in 1937, the Yugoslav Royal Air Force bought license rights for production at the &quot;Drzavna Fabrika Aviona&quot; factory in 1938. They equipped it with the more powerful Gnome-Rhône 14 NO radial engine. Dornier designs were delivered to the &quot;Pomorsko Vazduhoplovstvo&quot; (Naval Aviation - PV) in 1926, namely the Dornier Komet and Dornier Do Y heavy bombers. The Yugoslavs were familiar with Dornier designs, and on 19 November 1935 Yugoslav pilots test-flew the Do 17 V-3 prototype, D-ABIH, &quot;W.Nr.&quot; 258. They decided to select the Do 17 for service, despite it being more expensive than any other aircraft, because of the German willingness to deliver them quickly without limitations on numbers.

The Do 17L-0 and Do 17M-0 were developed in parallel as replacements for the earlier E and Fs, the L being the reconnaissance version. Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about . Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose. The first prototype of the revised version, the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of .

At the International Military Aircraft Competition at Zürich, Switzerland, in 1937, the Dornier Do 17M V1 proved a leader in its class and was faster than the fastest foreign fighter, the French Dewoitine D.510. The Do 17, along with the Messerschmitt Bf 109, won many prizes, demonstrating the prowess of German aviation design.

===Radial variants===
Despite its success, owing to shortages in the supply of the Daimler-Benz engine, the production Do 17M was fitted with the Bramo 323 engine, with the corresponding reconnaissance aircraft, the Do 17P, being powered by BMW 132Ns to give better range.

The supply of the DB 600 remained extremely limited as production was soon switched over to the fuel-injected DB 601, which was reserved for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters. Therefore, production versions of the basic Do 17M model airframe were fitted with the new Bramo 323A-1 Fafnir engines of , which gave reasonable performance and raised the bomb load to . The resulting Do 17 M-1 was produced in small numbers and operated until 1941.

The prototypes for the M-1 series were Do 17M V1 (Werk Nr 691) and Do 17M V2 (&quot;Werk Nr&quot; 692) which were tested with bomb loads of a medium bomber. The third prototype, Do 17M V3 was evaluated as a fast bomber. The M V1 was fitted with two Daimler Benz DB 601 inline engines while the M V2 and M V3 had the Bramo 323 A and D respectively. The Ministry of Aviation favoured the widespread use of the DB 601, but demand for the DB 601s in fighter aircraft and the lack of production forced the use of the Bramo.

The Do 17 M-1 started its service as a medium bomber and was able to carry of bombs. It was equipped with two air-cooled Bramo 323 A-1 or A-2. The defensive armament consisted of two, and later three, MG 15 machine guns. The first was operated in an A-Stand pod operated by the navigator through the windshield. The position was allocated 370 rounds of ammunition. The rearward firing B-Stand was operated by the radio operator and allocated 750 rounds. The rear position in the lower fuselage was allocated 375 rounds in a C-Stand pod. The Do 17M could carry a bomb load of either 20 SC50 or two SC250 bombs or 10 SC50 and a single SC250 bomb. The speed of the M was superior to that of the E variant. The Do 17M could reach at altitudes of and could achieve a maximum service ceiling of and a range of .
Reconnaissance aircraft based on the M-1, the under-surfaces of the wing were covered with duralumin and it had a wider engine axis and longer engine nacelles. The demand for a reconnaissance aircraft based on the M-1 led to the development of the P-1 variant. The L version would not be able to enter production with the DB 600 owing to its use in the Bf 109, and the Bramo engine was rather thirsty on fuel and left the M models with too short a range for reconnaissance use. BMW 132N radials of 865 PS were selected instead, which had lower fuel consumption for better range. Another two prototypes with DB 600 engines were produced as the Do 17R-0, but did not enter production. During reconnaissance missions the P-1 was armed with four MG 15s in the A, B and C—Stands. One machine gun was located in the rear of the cockpit, another in the lower rear &quot;Bola&quot; mount, one facing forward through the windscreen and the other in the nose glazing. In earlier variants the B-Stand (the gun position in the upper rear cockpit) was open to the elements, but the P-1 now provided an enclosed bulb-shaped mount protecting the radio operator from the weather.

The P variant had similar features to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines with a maximum performance of 865 PS ( each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (&quot;Funkgerät&quot;), the PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - &quot;Peilgerät&quot;) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - &quot;Funkblindlandegerät&quot;). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -&quot;Eigenverständigungsanlage&quot;). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.

Due to a shortage of night fighters, at least one Do 17P-1 was assigned to this role. A smooth metal sheet was installed in place of its glass nose and it was armed with three MG 151/20 cannons. The machine operated under &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 1.

The Do 17P-2 was identical to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage. These aircraft were designed for night reconnaissance. It is assumed that Dornier converted most, if not all, P-2 models from existing P-1 production aircraft.

Unlike the P-2, the Do 17R-1 did not see series production. The experiences of the Spanish Civil War proved that unarmed aircraft were easy prey for fighter aircraft. The R-1 was to be a fast long-range reconnaissance aircraft with two additional fuel cells inside the fuselage aft of the bomb bay. Two variants were suggested, the first (variant I) had a Rb 50/30 and two Rb 20/30 cameras, while variant II had a third fuel cell to replace the rear Rb 20/30. The aircraft had a gross weight of but could be overloaded to in emergencies. The crew usually numbered three, but a fourth was added depending on the missions to be flown. To achieve a high performance at increased altitudes two DB 600 Gs were to be used. The power plants were tested in the Do 17R V1 prototype registered D-ABEE. The second, the R V2, registered D-ATJU, received the even more powerful DB 601 Aa engines. The power plant of the R-1s that did exist is not known.

The lessons from the Spanish Civil War had led Dornier&#x27;s designers to incorporate more defensive machine guns. Battles with Soviet-built fighter aircraft had demonstrated that the Dornier was not as fast and invulnerable as was first thought. To cope with this, a completely new pod-like cockpit was designed to give the crew more room and better visibility. The roof was extended upward over the line of the fuselage, sloping down to meet it just in front of the wing. The dorsal gun was moved to the rear of the pod where it had a considerably better field of fire. The floor was dropped under the fuselage as a &quot;Bola&quot; casemate-style defensive armament emplacement, and the ventral gun moved to the back of the &quot;Bola&quot;, allowing it to fire directly to the rear. The changes in the roof and floor made the front of the aircraft much larger and the rest of the airframe remained the same. The new cockpit design was nicknamed &quot;Kampfkopf&quot; (German: &quot;battle head&quot;).

Three S variant prototypes with the DB 600 G inline engines were tested. The S-01 (designation D-AFFY), 03 and 04 were flown. The inverted V-12 engines were constructed as the Do 17 S-0 reconnaissance version, but it did not go into production. An additional 15 Do 17 U-1 pathfinder models were built, similar to the S-0 but adding another crewman (taking the total to five) to operate the extra radio equipment. The U models were to fly ahead of other bombers on night missions, using the radio equipment to locate the target and drop flares on it. They were personally requested by KG 100 as experimental models for this role. The U-1 had a maximum speed of and a combat ceiling of . The U-1 had a cruising speed of and a maximum reachable height of , owing to the &quot;rather low performance of the Bramo 323 A-1 engines&quot;. The three prototypes (U-01 - U-03) and twelve production aircraft were built by 1938.

===Dornier Do 17Z: The main variant===
The Dornier Do 17Z series was the most recognised and mass-produced variant, and saw more combat service than the E-U types. The type was modified as a result of combat experience during the Spanish Civil War. The forward fuselage was redesigned, with the cockpit area being &quot;dropped&quot;, or extended further to enable a rear firing gunner position to be installed, and the canopy extended aft, until it was nearly parallel with the leading edge and wing root.

To test the design, the Do 17S and Do 17U were produced, both to be powered by the DB 600 power plants. However, a call for all DB 600 series engines to be reserved for fighters led to the variants being fitted with Bramo Fafnir 323 A radial engines. The bomb load was increased to and a fourth crew member was added. It proved to be underpowered, so Bramo 323 P engines were then fitted. Only three Do 17S and 15 Do 17Us were built. With the updates, the Dornier, with a full bomb load, had a combat radius of . Later variants, in the Do 17Z-3, Z-4 and Z-5, which were fitted with cameras, dual trainer controls and flotation aids (for maritime operations) respectively, still could not solve the problems with range and bomb load.

At first, a batch of Z-0s were built with the Fafnir for testing, the DB 600 again proving to be too hard to obtain. These were quickly replaced with the Z-1 model, which added another gun for the bombardier, but the additional weight of the nose and guns meant the bomb load was reduced to . The Luftwaffe, not being satisfied with the test outcome of the Z series, immediately ordered performance and design studies to increase the overall performance of the bomber. These resulted in very optimistic speeds and altitudes for all future Z variants, especially for the Z-5 aircraft. Planned performance altitudes of up to at a maximum speed of with an aircraft weight of were planned. Unfortunately, production aircraft never reached these optimistic performances during the service career of the Do 17Z. At , the heavy Do 17Z-1 used two Bramo 323 A-1 engines with self-sealing fuel cells in the fuselage and wings. The crew of four consumed approximately 20 bottles of oxygen during long flights above . The Do 17Z-1 had a speed of at . However, the performance of the Bramo 323s did not permit the Do 17 to reach at and level flight when fully loaded. Range of the Z-1 at ground level was while at this increased to . This gave an average range of . The introduction of the Bramo 323P increased subsequent performance in the following sub variants.

This was addressed in the major production model, the Do 17Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with , which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from . However the combat range with a full bomb load was a very short . The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of the sides of the upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only one of them could be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17Z-2s flew with &quot;Kampfgeschwader 2&quot; &quot;Holzhammer&quot; (Wooden mallet), &quot;Kampfgeschwader 3&quot; &quot;Blitz (Lightning), &quot;Kampfgeschwader 76&quot; and &quot;Kampfgeschwader 77&quot;. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from . After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers.

The Z-3 formed part of the bomber versions of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight of the particular unit. The engines and the general equipment were identical to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras — the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 were identical visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants.
The Z-4 was designed as trainer. Although nearly identical to the Z-2 and Z-3, it featured several equipment changes optimised for blind flying training. The four-seat aircraft had a single control column with dual steering, which was achieved by a jib protruding to the right. Rudder pedals were in front of both seats. The defensive armament and bomb racks were reduced, or in most cases omitted to reduce weight. The Z-5 was similar to the Z-3 with a weight of . Designed as an anti-shipping aircraft, the Z-5, was fitted with flotation cells in the fuselage and engine nacelles in case it was forced down on water. Usually the flotation devices took the form of inflatable bags stored in the rear of the engine nacelles and in bulges on either side of the nose, just behind the front glazing.

Later variants of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 was to be a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 L (578 imperial gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.
The Z-8 &quot;Geier&quot; (Vulture) was not produced. It was intended as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective armour. An increase in armour would have meant a decrease in speed which would have exposed the aircraft further to enemy fire. The Z-9, which was fitted with special bomb release equipment, and delayed release gear for low-level attack missions. Its purpose was to suppress enemy air defences. Therefore, it was designed to fly over anti-aircraft positions and drop Butterfly Bombs, an early form of cluster bomb munitions. This could only be done with air superiority, as the Z-9 was unarmoured. The airframe and equipment was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 version. Only the bomb bay was altered to accommodate 16 bomb-dispenser systems. The maximum weight of the Z-9 was . The design did not reach serial production.

After bomber production ended in 1940, the Z model was modified with a &quot;solid&quot; nose from the Ju 88C, fitted with one 20 mm MG FF cannon and three 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, to be used as night fighters. Three prototypes were converted from existing Z-series airframes to the Do 17Z-7 Kauz I (&quot;screech-owl&quot;) configuration. The standard Z-7 was fitted with Bramo 323P-1 radial engines and had a crew of three airmen. In comparison to the standard bomber version, the fuel load arrangement was altered by subdividing into cells. Two cells were in the wings, with a capacity of 770 litres (154 imperial gallons) each. A third cell was placed in the bomb bay within the main fuselage, having a capacity of 895 litres (179 imperial gallons). The oxygen supply for the three man crew was reduced to nine bottles, as intercepts at high altitudes were not anticipated. Add-on armour in the form of heavy steel plates was bolted to the nose bulkhead to protect the crew against frontal fire. Originally, it was planned to completely armour the crew compartment. This idea, was given up again as the increased weight would have reduced flight performance of an already slow aircraft. The ammunition loads for the three 7.92 mm MG 17s amounted to 3,000 rounds and 400 rounds of ammunition for the 20 mm MG 151 cannon (although some Do 17Z bombers carried a single 20 mm for ground attack missions).
Later, the design was further modified to the Do 17Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infrared searchlight for the &quot;Spanner Anlage&quot; infrared detection system. The infrared lamp in the nose was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the pilot. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20 mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20 mm cannons&#x27; drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (&quot;Spanner-Anlage&quot;) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single &quot;Kauz&quot; II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.

Only 10 of these &quot;Kauz&quot; II designs were converted from Z-series airframes. The &quot;Spanner&quot; system proved to be essentially useless and many Z-10 were left without any detection system. At least one Z-10, coded CD+PV, was used as a flying test bed to help developing the early low-UHF band B/C version of the Lichtenstein radar system in late 1941–1942. When the Z-10 was stripped of all non-night fighter equipment, it had a maximum weight of . Armament fit was similar to that of the Z-7, with an added MG 17 and an additional 1,000 rounds of ammunition in the nose section. Defensive gun positions included the B and C stand, each equipped with a MG 15.

==Production==
===German===

Official figures state 2,139 Do 17s were built on German assembly lines. At the Dornier factory at Oberpfaffenhofen, 328 Do 17Es were built along with a further 77 Do 17Fs and 200 Do 17M variants. Do 17Z production figures for Oberpfaffenhofen stand at 420. At Friedrichshafen, 84 Do 17Ks were built, some of which were sold to the Yugoslav Royal Air Force. Do 17P production was spread out over different factory lines. At Siebel/Halle, eight were built. At the Henschel factory at Berlin-Schönefeld 73 were constructed. At the HFB plant in Hamburg 149 were built. Henschel also produced some 320 Do 17Zs, HFB contributed to construction of 74 at its Hamburg plant, and another 73 were built at Siebel. It was the interest shown by Yugoslavia in the Do 17Z which gave rise to the designation Dornier Do 215, allotted for no apparent reason to the Do 17Z sent to Yugoslavia for demonstration purposes. Some 105 examples of the Dornier Do 215B was later built at Oberpfaffenhofen.

By 19 September 1938, the Luftwaffe had received 579 Dornier Do 17s. These were mostly Do 17E, F, M and P variants.
During 1939–1940, some 475 Dornier Do 17Z bombers, 16 reconnaissance aircraft and nine night fighters were built. Another 100 Dornier Do 215s, an updated variant of the Do 17, were built during this period also.

===Yugoslav===
Other governments were interested in the Do 17. In June 1936, the Yugoslav government ordered 36 Do 17E variants from Germany. The negotiations for a licence were completed on 27 June 1938 for 36 Do 17Ka&#x27;s at the cost of 1,829,825 Reichsmarks. On 18 March 1938, Yugoslavia ordered 16 complete Do 17 Ka-2&#x27;s and Ka-3&#x27;s at a cost of 3,316,788 Reichsmarks. They received the last on 21 April 1939. The machines were from 72 to 96% complete.

The Dorniers were devoid of German equipment, including engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer to supply the powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was to be used in the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, claiming it to have and a speed of at . The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.
Only one of the Do 17s delivered was fitted out complete with German equipment. The rest of the Dorniers were equipped with Belgian FN 7.9 mm (.31 in) machine guns, Czech camera equipment and eventually Telefunken radio sets. Altogether, 70 Do 17s were produced by Yugoslav factories.

==Operators and operational history==

* The Bulgarian Air Force received 11 Do 17 Ms and Ps in 1940 and at least 11 ex-Yugoslav aircraft in 1941. Six more Do 17 Ms were delivered in 1943. They remained in service until at least 1945.
* The Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (&quot;Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske&quot;) received at least 21 Do 17Zs (the last 12 in 1945), 11 ex-Yugoslav Do 17Ka&#x27;s in 1942 and 30 Do 17Es in 1943.
* Finnish Air Force
** 46 Squadron received 15 aircraft in January 1942:
* Luftwaffe
* Royal Hungarian Air Force received one ex-Yugoslavian Do 17Ka-3.
*&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; operated at least one ex-Yugoslavian Do 17Ka-3 under &quot;1°Centro Sperimentale&quot; in Guidonia, where it was tested until September 1943.
* Royal Romanian Air Force received 10 worn Do 17Ms in November 1942.
*Spanish Air Force received ex-Legion Condor Do 17E, F, and Ps and 13 remained in service after the end of the Spanish Civil War.
* Swiss Air Force operated a single Do 17Z-2, interned after landing at Basel Airport in April 1940.
* Royal Yugoslav Air Force
* Royal Air Force pressed into service two Yugoslav-built Do 17Ks which escaped Yugoslavia carrying King Peter and gold. The aircraft were given the serials AX706 and AX707. Both aircraft were destroyed in an air attack on Ismaïlia airfield on 27 August 1941.
* United States Army Air Forces obtained at least one Do 17E-1, WkNr 2095. Renamed &quot;Axis Sally&quot;, it was taken to the United States after the war and tested.

==Surviving aircraft==

===Dornier Do 17Z &quot;Werknummer&quot; 1160===
Until 2007 none of the Dornier twin-engined bomber variants were thought to have survived intact, but various large relics of the Do 17 and Do 215 are held by public museums and private collectors. In September 2007 a Do 215 B-5 (variant of Do 17Z) was found largely intact in the shallow waters off Waddenzee in the Netherlands. On 3 September 2010, the RAF Museum announced that a Do 17 had been discovered in of water off the coast of England. The aircraft had been discovered in September 2008 on the Goodwin Sands, a large sandbank off the coast of Kent, but the discovery was kept a closely guarded secret. The Dornier Do 17Z-2, &quot;Werknummer&quot; 1160, built under license by Henschel with the full &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; (combat wing aircraft ID code) of 5K+AR, was operated by 7 &quot;Staffel&quot;, III &quot;Gruppe&quot;, &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 3.

On 26 August 1940, &quot;5K+AR&quot; was taking part in a raid by KG 2 and KG 3, targeting the RAF stations RAF Debden and RAF Hornchurch. While flying over clouds, the aircraft became separated from the bomber formation and lost its bearings; it was then attacked by Boulton Paul Defiant fighters of No. 264 Squadron RAF. One of the Dornier&#x27;s engines was disabled and the other damaged, so the wounded pilot, &quot;Feldwebel&quot; (flight sergeant) Willi Effmert, elected to make a crash landing on the Goodwin Sands. He and another crew member survived and were taken prisoner. The other two crew were killed; one is buried at Cannock Chase German war cemetery and the other in the Netherlands. The identity of the Defiant that shot down the Dornier is not certain, although it may have been one of three 264 Squadron aircraft that was shot down soon after in a battle with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter escorts from Jagdgeschwader 3.
In June 2010 diving operations were carried out and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although &quot;5K+AR&quot; lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine cowling were missing, but the discovery of a small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier&#x27;s six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been removed by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft&#x27;s discovery.

On 10 June 2013, a salvage team raised the airframe from the seabed. It was then taken to the Michael Beetham Restoration Centre at the Royal Air Force Museum&#x27;s Cosford site, where metallurgists from Imperial College London have a significant role in the post-recovery conservation of the aircraft.

===Dornier Do 17M-1 (Hansakollen, Norway)===
On 2 July 1942, a Dornier Do 17M-1 crashed in Hansakollen in Maridalen, near Oslo, Norway. The Do 17 was heading to the airport at Gardermoen, but crashed into a mountainside. All three German aviators on board were killed. They are buried in the German war cemetery at Alfaset. The wreck is well preserved and remains clearly visible, nearly 80 years after the accident.

<text>Birmingham City Council is the local authority for the city of Birmingham in the West Midlands, England. Birmingham has had an elected local authority since 1838, which has been reformed several times. Since 1974 the council has been a metropolitan borough council. It provides the majority of local government services in the city. It is the most populous local government district in England, serving over 1.1million people. The council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority since 2016.

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2012. It is based at the Council House on Victoria Square, Birmingham.

On 6 September 2023, the council declared effective bankruptcy, and central government commissioners were subsequently appointed to run the council under emergency measures.

==History==

Until the 18th century, Birmingham was governed by manorial courts and its parish vestry. A body of improvement commissioners called the Birmingham Street Commissioners was established in 1769 to provide services in the rapidly growing town. Birmingham was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1838, after which it was governed by a body formally called &#x27;the mayor, aldermen and burgesses of the borough of Birmingham&#x27;, generally known as the corporation or town council. William Scholefield became the first mayor and William Redfern was the first town clerk. The corporation absorbed the functions of the street commissioners in 1852.

Birmingham was granted city status on 14 January 1889, after which the corporation was also known as the city council. When elected county councils were established in April 1889, Birmingham was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it became a county borough, independent from the new Warwickshire County Council, whilst remaining part of the geographical county of Warwickshire. The dignity of a lord mayor was conferred in 1896, with James Smith being appointed the first Lord Mayor of Birmingham.

The city boundaries have been enlarged many times. Notable expansions were in 1891 (Balsall Heath, Harborne, Saltley and Little Bromwich), 1909 (Quinton), 1911 (Aston Manor, Erdington, Handsworth, Kings Norton, Northfield and Yardley), 1928 (Perry Barr), 1931 (Sheldon and parts of other parishes), and 1974 (Sutton Coldfield).

The county borough was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, being replaced by a metropolitan district of Birmingham, covering the area of the old county borough plus the borough of Sutton Coldfield. The new district was one of seven metropolitan districts within the new metropolitan county of the West Midlands. Birmingham&#x27;s borough and city statuses and its lord mayoralty passed to the new district and its council.

From 1974 until 1986 the council was a lower-tier authority, with upper-tier functions provided by the West Midlands County Council. The county council was abolished in 1986 and its functions passed to the county&#x27;s seven borough councils, including Birmingham City Council, with some services provided through joint committees. In 1995, New Frankley and the Kitwell Estate were transferred into the city from the parish of Frankley in Bromsgrove District.

Since 2016 the council has been a member of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which has been led by the directly elected Mayor of the West Midlands since 2017. The combined authority provides strategic leadership and co-ordination for certain functions across the county, but Birmingham City Council continues to be responsible for most local government functions.

On 5 September 2023, Birmingham City Council issued a Section 114 notice, being the local government equivalent of bankruptcy, stopping all future spending with the exception of money for statutory services, including the protection of vulnerable people. The leader of the Labour authority stated that the notice was a necessary step to get Birmingham back into a sound financial footing. The government subsequently appointed commissioners to oversee the running of the council under emergency measures. The bankruptcy has been ascribed to equal pay liabilities plus a disastrous implementation of an ERP system.

=== Women and minorities ===
The first woman elected to the council, on 1 November 1911, was Ellen Pinsent. She represented the Edgbaston Ward as a Liberal Unionist. She had earlier been co-opted as a member of the council&#x27;s Education Committee and served as Chairman of the Special School Sub-Committee. She stood down from the council in October 1913 upon appointment as Commissioner for the Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency.

Pinsent&#x27;s time on the council overlapped with that of Margaret Frances Pugh, who was elected on 22 November 1911 to serve in the North Erdington ward. She resigned in November 1913.

Birmingham&#x27;s third woman councillor, Clara Martineau, was elected on 14 October 1913 in the Edgbaston ward, and served until 1932, when she died, aged 57. Her father was former Mayor Sir Thomas Martineau, Lord Mayor Ernest Martineau was her brother, and Alderman Sir George Kenrick was her uncle.

Mary Cottrell became the first female Labour councillor in February 1917, when she was elected unopposed to the Selly Oak ward. The first female Lord Mayor, Marjorie Brown, held the post from 1973 to 1974. Theresa Stewart became the first female leader in October 1993, until 1999; and Lin Homer the first female chief executive, was in post from 2002 until 2005.

Bert Carless, a migrant from Jamaica, was elected the City&#x27;s first non-white councillor in 1979. He was later made an Honorary Alderman.

==Governance==
Birmingham City Council provides metropolitan borough services. Some strategic functions in the area are provided by the West Midlands Combined Authority; the leader and deputy leader of the city council sit on the board of the combined authority as Birmingham&#x27;s representatives. There are two civil parishes in the city at Sutton Coldfield and New Frankley in Birmingham, which form an additional tier of local government for their areas; the rest of the city is unparished.

===Political control===

The council has been under Labour majority control since 2012.

Political control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:

===Leadership===

The role of Lord Mayor of Birmingham is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The first leader of the council after the 1974 reforms, Clive Wilkinson, had been the leader of the old county borough of Birmingham since December 1973. The leaders since 1973 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to September 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2018, the council has comprised 101 councillors representing 69 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Wards and councillors===
The wards and councillors are:


==Premises==
The council meets and has some offices at the Council House on Victoria Square in the city centre. The building was first completed in 1879 for the old borough council and has been extended several times since. The council has several other office buildings, notably at 10 Woodcock Street, completed in 2011. There are two customer services centres, at 67 Sutton New Road in Erdington and at 1a Vineyard Road in Northfield. The possible closure and sale of some of the council&#x27;s buildings is being considered as part of addressing the council&#x27;s financial difficulties following the issuing of the Section 114 notice in 2023.

Past chief executives have included:
*

The city&#x27;s museums were transferred to the independent Birmingham Museums Trust in 2012. The council sold its Ogwen Cottage Outdoor Pursuits Centre, by auction, in October 2014.

===Highways===
In 2010, Birmingham City Council agreed a 25 year deal with Amey plc to manage the city&#x27;s highways, but, after allegations of sub-standard repairs to roads and pavements, the council invoked penalty clauses and entered into a prolonged legal dispute. In December 2018, Amey parent Ferrovial put the business up for sale, after allocating €237m for losses on Amey&#x27;s highway maintenance contract with the Council. In February 2019, Amey was close to a deal to exit its Birmingham contract, liabilities from which were preventing the company&#x27;s sale by Ferrovial. A £215m deal to terminate Amey&#x27;s Birmingham contract was confirmed in July 2019. The council was set to receive £160m in 2019 with a further £55m paid over the next six years, with services continuing on an interim basis until September 2019, and potentially until March 2020. However, in February 2020, it was announced the Birmingham contract would end in March 2020; Kier Group was appointed as interim contractor for 15 months while the council sought a permanent replacement for Amey. In February 2022, the city council formally began the process of identifying a contractor to deliver £2.7 billion of works over 12 years, and invited Kier and Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin to tender for the city’s restructured highways PFI contract, covering more than 2,500km of road and 5,000km of footway. However, in October 2023, the council claimed the government was preparing to &quot;pull the plug&quot; on £600m of highways funding. Kier were awarded the restructured contract, set to start in February 2024, but the deal was subject to government approval.

<text>Wisbech ( ) is a market town, inland port and civil parish in the Fenland district in Cambridgeshire, England. In 2011 it had a population of 31,573. The town lies in the far north-east of Cambridgeshire, bordering Norfolk and only 5 miles (8 km) south of Lincolnshire. The tidal River Nene running through the town is spanned by two road bridges. Wisbech is in the Isle of Ely (a former administrative county) and has been described as &quot;the Capital of The Fens&quot;.

Wisbech is noteworthy for its fine examples of Georgian architecture, particularly the parade of houses along the North Brink, which includes the National Trust property of Peckover House and the Crescent, part of a circus surrounding Wisbech Castle.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The place name &quot;Wisbech&quot; is first attested in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; for the year 656, where it appears as &quot;Wisbeach&quot;. It is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Wisbeach&quot;. The name Wisbech is popularly believed to mean &quot;on the back of the (River) Ouse&quot;, Ouse being a common Celtic word relating to water and the name of a river that once flowed through the town. A more scholarly opinion is that the first element derives from the River Wissey, which used to run to Wisbech, and that the name means &#x27;the valley of the river Wissey&#x27;.
A wide range of spellings is found on trade tokens in the Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum and in newspapers, books, maps and other documents, e.g. &quot;Wisbece&quot;, &quot;Wisebece&quot;, &quot;Wisbbece&quot;, &quot;Wysbeche&quot;, &quot;Wisbeche&quot;, &quot;Wissebeche&quot;, &quot;Wysebeche&quot;, &quot;Wysbech&quot;, &quot;Wyxbech&quot;, &quot;Wyssebeche&quot;, &quot;Wisbidge&quot;, &quot;Wisbich&quot; and &quot;Wisbitch&quot;,
until the spelling of the name of the town was fixed by the local council in the 19th century.

=== Pre-Roman ===
During the Iron Age, the area where Wisbech would develop lay in the west of the Brythonic Iceni tribe&#x27;s territory. Icenian coins have been found in both March and Wisbech.

=== Anglo-Saxon ===
Like the rest of Cambridgeshire, Wisbech was part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia. It served as a port on The Wash.

One of the first authentic references to Wisbech occurs in a charter dated 664 granting the Abbey at Medeshamstede (now Peterborough) land in Wisbech and in 1000, when Oswy and Leoflede, on the admission of their son Aelfwin as a monk, gave the vill to the monastery of Ely.

=== Norman ===
The folktale of Tom Hickathrift or Wisbech Giant is sometimes set about the time of the Norman Invasion.

In 1086, when Wisbech was held by the abbot, there may have been some 65 to 70 families, or about 300 to 350 persons, in Wisbech manor. However, Wisbech (which is the only one of the Marshland vills of the Isle to be mentioned in the Domesday Book) probably comprised the whole area from Tydd Gote down to the far end of Upwell at Welney.

A castle was built by William I to fortify the site. At the time of Domesday (1086) the population was that of a large village. Some were farmers and others were fishermen.

Richard I gave Wisbech a charter exempting the residents from paying tolls at markets across England. King John of England visited the castle on 12 October 1216 as he came from Bishop&#x27;s Lynn. Tradition has it that his baggage train was lost to the incoming tide of The Wash. Treasure hunters still seek the lost royal treasure.

On 12 November 1236 the village of Wisbech was inundated by the sea. Hundreds were drowned, entire flocks of sheep and herds of cattle were destroyed, trees felled and ships lost. The castle was &quot;utterly destroyed&quot; but was rebuilt by 1246 when the constable or keeper was William Justice.
King Edward II visited Wisbech in 1292, 1298, 1300 and 1305.
Wisbech Grammar School dates back to 1379 or earlier. The register of Bishop John Fordham of Ely records the appointment of a Master of the Grammar Scholars in 1407.

===Early Modern===

Edward IV visited Wisbech in 1469.

In 1549, Wisbech was incorporated as a borough under a charter from Edward VI. In the same year, William Bellman gave a plot of land for the Wisbech Grammar School schoolhouse.
In 1333–4 the kiln in the town was producing 120,000 bricks. There were several fisheries belonging to the manor of Wisbech and in the 1350s the reeves of Walton and Leverington each sent a porpoise to Wisbech Castle, and the reeve of Terrington a swordfish.

During the reigns of Elizabeth I, James I, and Charles I, there was a state ecclesiastical prison in Wisbech for Catholics, many of whom died there owing to the insanitary conditions.
A dispute arising amongst the Catholic prisoners was widely known as the Wisbech Stirs.
In 1588 it is claimed that Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham were committed to Wisbeach Castle on the approach of the Spanish Armada. Among those held there was John Feckenham, the last Abbot of Westminster. The palace was demolished and replaced with John Thurloe&#x27;s mansion in the mid-17th century, and Thurloe&#x27;s mansion demolished in 1816 by Joseph Medworth, who also developed The Circus comprising The Crescent, Union Place and Ely Place with Museum Square and Castle Square familiar as the settings in numerous costume dramas.

In 1620 former Wisbech residents William White and Dorothea Bradford (née May) sailed on the Mayflower to the New World with her husband William Bradford later to be Governor Bradford.

=== English Civil War and Commonwealth ===
Across the Eastern Counties, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s powerful Eastern Association was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been an element of Royalist sympathy within Wisbech. Bishop Matthew Wren was a staunch supporter of Charles I but even in 1640 was unpopular in Wisbech, after discovering his absence from a &#x27;Commission of Sewers&#x27; meeting at the Castle, a crowd of soldiers plundered shops of some of his supporters. The town was near the frontier of the Parliamentary and Royalist forces in 1643. The Castle and town were put into a state of readiness and reinforced. A troop of horse was raised. Locally based troops took part in the Siege of Crowland in 1642. The town controlled the route from Lincolnshire to Norfolk particularly during the Siege of King&#x27;s Lynn in 1643 as it prevented reinforcements by land of the Royalists holding the Norfolk port.

A town library was founded .

In 1656 the bishop&#x27;s palace was replaced by Thurloe&#x27;s mansion however after the Restoration the property reverted to the Bishops of Ely.

===Eighteenth century===
Soap was taxed and manufacturers such as the Wisbech Soap Company required a licence. Based in an Old Market property facing the river, they were able to receive oil from the blubber yards of King&#x27;s Lynn as well as coal, wood for casks and olive oil used in making the coarse, sweet and grey (speckled) soaps they produced from 1716 to about 1770.

Wisbech&#x27;s first workhouse was located in Albion Place and opened in 1722. It could accommodate three hundred inmates and cost £2,000.
 Bank House, with its walled garden, was built in 1722 and purchased by the Quaker Peckover banking family in the 1790s. The Peckover Bank later became part of Barclays Bank. The house is now owned by the National Trust and known as Peckover House.

In the 17th century, the inhabitants of the Fens became known as the &quot;Fen Tigers&quot; for their resistance to the draining of the common marshes. But the farmland created by drainage transformed Wisbech into a wealthy port handling agricultural produce. It was from this period that much of the town&#x27;s architectural richness originates.

Wisbech sat on the estuary of the River Great Ouse, but silting caused the coastline to move north, and the River Nene was diverted to serve the town.

In 1781 Wisbech Literary Society was formed at the house of Jonathan Peckover.

Theatres in both Pickard&#x27;s Lane (a barn) and North End and a third (temporary structure) in the High Street are referred to.
A new theatre (now part of the Angles Theatre had been built in Deadman&#x27;s Lane (later Great Church Street, now Alexandra Road) now Angles Theatre c. 1790. It was used to hold the auction of the contents of the castle, part of the estate of Edward Southwell on 8 November 1791.

There are three tiers of local government covering Wisbech, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Wisbech Town Council, Fenland District Council, and Cambridgeshire County Council. The district and county councils are also members of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The town council is based at Wisbech Town Hall on North Brink. Town council responsibilities include allotments and the market place. In 2018 the council took a lease on Wisbech Castle.

===Administrative history===

Wisbech was anciently a feudal vill within the Wisbech hundred of Cambridgeshire. The Wisbech hundred formed part of the Isle of Ely, which was historically a liberty under the secular jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely. The bishop&#x27;s jurisdiction was ended by the Liberty of Ely Act 1837. The vill of Wisbech was divided around 1109 into two manorial properties, which subsequently became the two parishes of Wisbech St Mary and Wisbech St Peter (the latter including the town itself). The two were treated as separate civil parishes from an early date, but remained a single ecclesiastical parish until 1854.

On 1 June 1549, Edward VI granted Wisbech a municipal charter, incorporating it as a borough. The borough covered the same area as the civil parish of Wisbech St Peter and therefore included the town itself plus an extensive rural area stretching some south-west of the town, including the hamlet of Ring&#x27;s End.

Wisbech was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country. The borough boundaries were reviewed in 1934. The borough gained part of the parish of Walsoken from Norfolk, including the more built-up area that had effectively become an eastern suburb of Wisbech, but leaving the church and the rural parts of Walsoken parish in Norfolk. A boundary marker in Wisbech Park was erected to record the event. At the same time, the more rural part of the old borough, including Ring&#x27;s End, was transferred from Wisbech to the neighbouring parish of Elm.

Between 1889 and 1965, the Isle of Ely was an administrative county with its own county council, whilst also forming part of the wider geographical county of Cambridgeshire. Between 1965 and 1974, the administrative county covering Wisbech was called Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely.

The borough of Wisbech was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new Fenland District Council. A successor parish called Wisbech was created covering the area of the abolished borough, with its parish council taking the name Wisbech Town Council. In 1990 further county boundary changes brought a small area of Walsoken, Norfolk into Wisbech.

==Transport==
=== Waterways ===

Wisbech sits on either side of the River Nene, and its port is Cambridgeshire&#x27;s only gateway to the sea. Schemes to connect the River Nene and the River Welland are proposed, allowing boats a fresh-water connection. In the past, the Port of Wisbech could accommodate sailing ships of 400 tons, but its prosperity declined after 1852 when extensive river works impeded navigation. In the previous decade it had been described as England&#x27;s most important port for the export of wheat. It had in its day been referred to as &#x27;the Milch cow of the corporation&#x27;.
Now, a river-side yacht harbour provides 128 berths for vessels, and Crab Marshboat yard operates a 75-tonne boat lift. Following the 1978 flood, in which one resident drowned, flood walls and flood gates were erected and in later years built higher. In December 2013, the town&#x27;s river flood defences were tested when an unusually high tide threatened to top the recently improved walls and flood gates.

===Roads===
In 1831 the construction of a lifting bridge at Sutton Bridge finally provided a means to travel directly between Norfolk and Lincolnshire. The town stood at the crossing of two Class A roads: from Peterborough to King&#x27;s Lynn (A47) and from Ely to Long Sutton (A1101). The A1101 now crosses the river at the newer &#x27;Freedom bridge&#x27; taking some traffic away from the older &#x27;Town Bridge&#x27;. The A47 now bypasses the town. The former part of the A47 inside the town (Lynn Rd and Cromwell Rd) is now the B198.

Current public transport provision to and from Wisbech is provided by several First Eastern Counties bus routes, including their long-distance Excel routes which call at Wisbech between Peterborough and King&#x27;s Lynn before continuing to Norwich.

===Railways===
Wisbech once had three passenger railway lines, served by Wisbech East railway station, Wisbech North railway station and Wisbech and Upwell Tramway, but they all closed between 1959 and 1968. There is an active campaign to reopen the March–Wisbech Bramley Line as part of the national rail network, with direct services to Cambridge and possibly Peterborough. It is supported by Wisbech Town Council and subject to reports commissioned by the county council in 2013. The line is currently Wisbech East railway station (2019) at GRIP 3 study stage. A report published in 2009 by the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) indicated that this was viable. The line has been identified as a priority for reopening by Campaign for Better Transport.

==Demography==

Several official places (libraries, surgeries, local council) provide translations into Lithuanian, as well as Polish, Latvian, Russian and Portuguese.

==Economy==

=== Historical ===
Before the draining of the Fens was completed, livestock was grazed on the common land and were marked to identify their owners; this was also the case with swans, which were usually marked on their bills. The riverside location and fertile soils surrounding Wisbech allowed the town to flourish.

A thriving pipe-making business was being carried out in the town by Amy White in the 1740s. Soap-making was also taking place in the 1740s

A number of breweries existed in the town; the last one remaining is Elgood&#x27;s on the North Brink. Established in 1795 and remaining a family-owned business, the brewery and gardens are a popular location for tourists to visit.

The first half of the 19th century was a very prosperous time for the town and an annual average of 40,000 tons of goods passed through the port, consisting mainly of coal, corn, timber and wine. The surrounding land produced large quantities of sheep and oxen as well as wool, hemp and flax. Such was the trade with Denmark that a consul was based in North Terrace in a Queen Anne house sometimes called the Danish House. In 1851 the population was 9,594. It decreased to 9,276 in 1861 and picked up to 9,395 in 1891. A National Provincial Bank, on the North Brink and a Savings Bank was built in Hill street in 1851 (it later became a Liberal Club, it is currently (2023) The Magwitch) In 1853 the Wisbech and Isle of Ely Permanent Building Society was established.

Ropemaking took place at the Ropewalk and tent-making also took place in the town at W. Poppleton&#x27;s, Nene Parade. Customers included the visiting J.W. Myers circus in 1881.

The Wisbech Fruit Preserving Company Ltd was wound up in 1894 and the site put up for sale.

In October 1906 the first of the annual mustard markets of the year took place where the harvest of &#x27;brown&#x27; and &#x27;white&#x27; seed took place. Regular annual Buyers included Messrs Colman&#x27;s of Norwich.

The Wisbech Mustard market held on four Saturdays in October was claimed to be unique, in 1911 it had been running for over forty years. Buyers from the major mills and producers attended and traded in and near the Rose and Crown.

Large numbers of workers were needed to pick fruit, in 1913 due to the great influx of pickers, the police had to find accommodation for 500 &#x27;homeless&#x27; workers each night. Until 1920 the train companies provided special rail fares for fruit pickers coming to the area.

Liptons had one of their jam factories in the town in the 1920s.

Samuel Wallace Smedley (1877-1958) bought the old Crosse and Blackwell jam making factory. Wisbech Produce Canners (formed in 1925), on Lynn Rd, was the first in England to produce frozen asparagus, peas and strawberries. The Wisbech Producer canners in 1931 became part of the National Canning Company. 
It was renamed Smedley&#x27;s Ltd in 1947, later Smedley HP Foods Ltd and later taken over by Hillsdown Foods. It is presently (2021) owned by Princes Group.

=== Contemporary ===
The Metal Box company established their largest manufacturing unit at Weasenham Lane in 1953. The site provides processed food cans for fruit, vegetables, soups, milk and pet foods. The workforce grew to over 1,000 before reducing as a result of automation and redundancies. Steel was brought from Welsh steelworks and also from overseas. The site had its own rail yard before the Wisbech to March line closed. The site is now part of Crown Cork.

English Brothers Ltd, another long-established company in Wisbech, are importers of timber brought in at Wisbech port. In 1900 they manufactured wooden troop hits for the war in South Africa. During World War II they produced wooden munitions boxes. Shire Garden Building Ltd based in Wisbech and Sutton Bridge have been manufacturing wooden buildings since the 1980s.

In 2010 Dutch based Partner Logistics opened a £12m frozen food warehouse on Boleness Road, employing over fifty staff. The 77,000 pallet, fully automated &quot;freezer&quot; centre had contracts with Lamb Weston, Bird&#x27;s Eye and Pinguin Foods.

In recent decades the closure of the Clarkson Geriatric hospital (1983), Bowthorpe maternity hospital (c. 1983), Balding &amp; Mansell (printers) (c. 1992), Budgens store (formerly Coop) (2017) and horticultural college (2012), Bridge Street post office (2014), as well as gradual reductions in workforce by CMB, indicate a decline in the economy.

Small family businesses such as Bodgers (2013), Franks butchers (2015) and local bakeries have given way to the supermarkets.

The larger employers in Wisbech include Nestle Purina PetCare, Cromwell Rd and Princes, Lynn Rd.

In April 2018 plans for an £8m redevelopment of the North Cambridgeshire Hospital were announced.

===Tourism===

National Trust property Peckover House and Garden attracts tourists and locals. The Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum draws in visitors to see the Charles Dickens manuscript, Thomas Clarkson memorabilia and other exhibits.

The Anglican Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul dates back in part to the 12th century. The tower contains the third oldest full peal of 10 bells in the world, cast by William Dobson in 1821; the bells are still in use. St Augustine&#x27;s church on Lynn Rd was erected in 1868–9 and consecrated on 11 May 1869. An associated school building is now the Robert Hall scouting hall. In 1997 a new parish centre was created when the church was linked to its nearby hall.

==Sport==

As the River Nene and other waterways are located in the area, water sports are popular. The rivers and canal provide opportunities for canoeing and kayaking. As an example of organised water sport, in 1955, the Wisbech Yacht Club opened their new clubhouse at Lattersley Pit, Whittlesey. Football was played in the town even before Wisbech Park was opened in 1869. The nearby St. Augustine&#x27;s club evolving into Wisbech Town

<text>The Fieseler Fi 156 &quot;Storch&quot; (, &quot;stork&quot;) is a liaison aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Fieseler. Its nickname of &quot;Storch&quot; was derived from the lengthy legs of its main landing gear, which gave the aircraft a similar appearance to that of the long-legged, big-winged bird.

Developed during the mid 1930s in response to a request from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (&quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot; or RLM), the Fi 156 was an affordable and easy to construct aircraft purpose designed for the liaison, army co-operation, and medical evacuation roles. On 24 May 1936, the Fi 156 V1 performed its maiden flight; the first deliveries took place less than a year later. It was well regarded for its excellent short field (STOL) performance and low stalling speed of 50 km/h (31 mph). Around 2,900 aircraft of various models, the most commonplace being the &quot;Fi 156C&quot;, were produced between 1937 and 1945. The Fi 156 quickly became popular on the export market, eventually being widely used by various nations.

Numerous countries deployed their aircraft in a military capacity across various theatres of the Second World War. The Fi 156 was extensively operated by the Luftwaffe, who often used it in the aerial reconnaissance role and less often as a troop transport. German aircraft saw action on the Eastern Front, Western Front, the Western Desert, and even the Arctic. During September 1943, the Storch played a pivotal role in &quot;Operation Eiche&quot;, the rescue of deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from a boulder-strewn mountain-top near the Gran Sasso. On 26 April 1945, a &quot;Storch&quot; was one of the last aircraft to land on the improvised airstrip in the Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate during the Battle of Berlin. During the conflict, a number of &quot;Störche&quot; were captured by the Allies; several were used as the personal aircraft of high ranking officers such as Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Air Vice Marshal Arthur Coningham, and Air Vice Marshal Harry Broadhurst.

Even after the end of the conflict, production of the type continued in other countries into the 1950s, both for the private market and military operators. In addition to Germany, additional production lines had been established in France, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the Soviet Union. Furthermore, there have been many attempts to recreate or imitate the Fi 156, including several three-quarter scale homebuilt aircraft, such as the Pazmany PL-9 Stork, RagWing RW19 Stork, and STOL King. The Slepcev Storch and French-built later variants of the original aircraft have often appeared at air shows and other flying events. Numerous flight-worthy aircraft are still operational into the twenty-first century.

==Development==
===Background and selection===
During 1935, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (&quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot; or RLM) issued in invitation to several aviation companies to submit their proposals for a new aircraft for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that was to be suitable for the roles of liaison, army co-operation (today called forward air control), and medical evacuation. The German aircraft manufacturer Fieseler quickly took an interest in the new requirement and opted to produce its own clean sheet design, which was largely conceived of by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director Erich Bachem. This new aircraft, which was subsequently assigned the &quot;Fi 156&quot; designation, was specifically designed to achieve particularly strong short take off and landing (&quot;STOL&quot;) performance.

In addition to Fieseler&#x27;s submission, competing proposals were submitted from various other aircraft manufacturers, including Weser Flugzeugbau and Siebel in the form of the Bf 163 and Si 201 respectively. While the Bf 163 broadly resembled the Fi 156, the Si 201 was a relatively unorthodox aircraft; all three designs were evaluated in depth by officials. The Fi 156 emerged as the favoured submission, in part due to its relatively cheap and straightforward construction offered in its design.

On 24 May 1936, the Fi 156 V1, registered &quot;D-IKVN&quot;, performed its maiden flight; it was quickly followed by a further four prototypes. From an early stage, the company had envisioned two different production versions, the &quot;Fi 156A&quot; and &quot;Fi 156B&quot;, the latter having movable leading edge slots instead of the formers&#x27; fixed slot arrangement. The first production standard aircraft were delivered in early 1937.

===German production===
About 2,900 Fi 156s, the majority being of the &quot;Fi 156C&quot; model, were produced between 1937 and 1945. The principal production line was at the Fieseler Factory in Kassel. During 1942, production started in the Morane-Saulnier factory at Puteaux in France. Due to the demand for Fieseler as a subcontractor for building the Fw 190, Fi 156 production was shifted to Leichtbau Budweis in Budweis by the end of 1943. Factories in other countries under German control manufactured aircraft, including Fi 156s, for Germany.

===Soviet production===
In 1939, after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Germany provided several aircraft, including the Fi 156C, to the Soviet Union. Oleg Antonov was made responsible for putting the aircraft into production to meet Soviet requirements, and given a choice between designing an equivalent aircraft or merely copying the German design, the latter was selected. The aircraft was titled OKA-38 and two versions were envisaged: the SS three seat liaison aircraft, and the N-2 air ambulance capable of carrying two stretchers plus a medic. A prototype was constructed in Factory No. 365, established on the basis of Lithuanian Military Aviation Works, in Kaunas, recently occupied Lithuania. The first prototype however was built in Factory No. 23 in Leningrad and flew before the end of 1940. The production in Kaunas has just started as the factory was lost to the German advance in 1941. While Antonov&#x27;s efforts had produced a heavier aircraft, which required as much as three times the field for landing and take off as the German Fi 156C (160 m vs 55 m), it also had much greater range and increased load capability. After the conflict, Antonov went on to design the legendary An-2 STOL biplane, which also has excellent STOL performance.

===Production in Czechoslovakia===
In 1944, production was moved from the Leichtbau Budweis to the Mráz factory in Choceň which produced 138 examples of the Fi 156, locally designated as &quot;K-65 Čáp&quot;. Production ended during 1949.

===Production in France===

During the Second World War, the French manufacturer Morane-Saulnier was operated under German control, during which time it built a number of German types including the Storch. Immediately after the liberation of France in 1944, the production of the Fi 156 at the Morane-Saulnier factory was continued at the request of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. The resulting batch of aircraft produced with the remaining stock of Argus air-cooled inverted V8 engines were designated &quot;MS 500 Criquet&quot;. Aircraft with further modifications and different engines (inline and radial) received various different type numbers. The use of the aircraft in Indochina highlighted the weakness of wood for the construction of the airframe; thus it was decided to build the wings out of metal instead. Among the modifications, the defensive weapon aiming through the back window was dropped, although some aircraft were modified in the field to take a MAC 34T machine gun firing through one of the side windows. Some 141 aircraft were built before the end of the Second World War while a total of 925 aircraft were built before the end of the production of all types of &quot;Criquet&quot; by Morane-Saulnier in 1965.

===Production in Romania===
Licence production was started in Romania in October 1943 at the ICAR factory in Bucharest. Only 10 were built by the time the ICAR factory was bombed in May 1944. Production resumed later that year, but only six were completed before repair work halted production. Between June 1945 and 1946, a further 64 aircraft were built.

===Summary of production===
Production per factory and per type until 31 March 1945:

===Modern developments===

Because of its superb STOL characteristics, there have been many attempts to recreate or copy the &quot;Storch&quot;, mainly in the form of various three-quarter scale homebuilt aircraft, such as the Pazmany PL-9 Stork, Roger Mann&#x27;s RagWing RW19 Stork, and Preceptors STOL King.

As an example, the Slepcev Storch is a three-quarter scale reproduction of the original with some simplifications. The use of modern materials provides better STOL performance than the original with a take-off run of 30 m and landing-roll of 50 m with no headwind. It was originally designed and manufactured in Australia and is now manufactured in Serbia.

==Design==

The Fieseler Fi 156 Storch was a high-wing monoplane that was particularly effective in terms of its short take off and landing (&quot;STOL&quot;) performance. Its nickname of &quot;Storch&quot; was derived from the lengthy legs of its main landing gear, which hung down during flight and gave the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird. As a product of its relatively low landing speed, the &quot;Storch&quot; often gave the appearance of landing vertically, or even backwards, when flying directly into strong winds. The aircraft was typically crewed by three personnel seated with its enclosed cabin, which was extensively glazed as to provide generous external views. The structure was composed of welded steel tubing while the covering was fabric. Both the tail unit and wings were composed of wood, the latter being clad in plywood.

The Fi 156 had relatively lengthy wings for its size. A fixed slat ran along the entire length of the wing&#x27;s leading edge while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This arrangement was allegedly inspired by an earlier Junkers wing design concept, referred to as a &quot;Doppelflügel&quot; or &quot;double-wing&quot; aircraft wing control surface. On the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel&#x27;s trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located flaps and outboard-located ailerons, which, in turn, included trim tab devices over half of each aileron&#x27;s trailing edge length. This combination of flaps and slats has been heavily attributed for the aircraft&#x27;s favourable STOL performance.

An uncommon feature for land-based aircraft was the ability to fold back the wings of the aircraft along the fuselage, which was somewhat similar to the wings of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber; when folded, the aircraft could be carried on a trailer or even directly towed (albeit slowly) behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin.

The long legs of the main landing gear was furnished with both oil and spring-based shock absorbers that had a travel of 40 cm (15-3/4 inches), sufficient to permit landings to be conducted on comparatively rough and uneven surfaces; this was combined with a &quot;pre-travel&quot; distance of 20 cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock.

While initial models were unarmed, starting with the C-2 variant, the Fi 156 was fitted with a raised, fully-glazed position for a flexible rear-firing MG 15 7.92mm machine gun for self-defense.

==Operational history==
===Second World War===
The &quot;Storch&quot; was extensively operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Several reconnaissance units operated the type, such as Aufklärungsgruppe 14 and Aufklärungsgruppe 21. Furthermore, each Geschwader was provided with at least one, if not multiple, Fi 156s. Numerous high ranking German officials, particularly members of the General Staff, had their own Fi 156s, including Field Marshals Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel.

Throughout the Second World War, the Fi 156 was deployed in quantity to virtually all theatres that Nazi Germany was militarily active upon; as such, it saw usage in the Eastern Front, Western Front, the Western Desert, and even the Arctic.

During the German invasion of Belgium, in addition to its more routine usage in the liaison role, around 100 Fi 156s were used to transport a battalion of Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland, two men per aircraft, landing on a stretch of road behind enemy lines (Operation Niwi).

During the North African campaign, the Afrika Korps made routine use of the &quot;Storch&quot; both for transportation and to conduct aerial surveillance. It was also operated by a pair of dedicated desert rescue squadrons to retrieve stranded pilots in this theatre.

During September 1943, the Storch played a pivotal role in &quot;Operation Eiche&quot;, the rescue of deposed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from a boulder-strewn mountain-top near the Gran Sasso. Even though the mountain was surrounded by Italian troops, German commando Otto Skorzeny and 90 paratroopers used gliders to land on the peak and quickly captured it, then faced the problem of getting back. A Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 helicopter was sent, but it broke down en route. Instead, pilot Heinrich Gerlach flew in a &quot;Storch&quot;. It landed in 30 m (100 ft), and after Mussolini and Skorzeny boarded, it took off after a run of 80 m (250 ft), even though the aircraft was overloaded. The &quot;Storch&quot; used in rescuing Mussolini bore the radio code letters, or &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot;, of &quot;SJ + LL&quot; in the motion picture coverage of the daring rescue.

On 26 April 1945, a &quot;Storch&quot; was one of the last aircraft to land on the improvised airstrip in the Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate during the Battle of Berlin and the death throes of Nazi Germany. It was flown by the test pilot Hanna Reitsch, who flew &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Robert Ritter von Greim from Munich to Berlin to answer a summons from Hitler.
A &quot;Storch&quot; was the final aircraft to be shot down by the Allies on the Western Front, and another was forced down by an L-4 Grasshopper, the military version of the American Piper J-3 Cub civilian training and sport aircraft and a direct Allied counterpart of the Storch. The pilot and co-pilot of the L-4, lieutenants Duane Francis and Bill Martin, opened fire on the &quot;Storch&quot; with their .45 caliber pistols, forcing the German air crew to land and surrender.

During the conflict, a number of &quot;Störche&quot; were captured by the Allies. One became the personal aircraft of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. Others were used as the personal aircraft of Air Vice Marshal Arthur Coningham and Air Vice Marshal Harry Broadhurst, who acquired his &quot;Storch&quot; in North Africa, and flew it subsequently in Italy and North-West Europe. The British captured 145 Fi 156s, of which 64 were given to the French as war compensation from Germany.

===Postwar activities===

Both the French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;) and the French Army Light Aviation (&quot;Aviation Légère de l&#x27;Armée de Terre&quot;) operated the &quot;Criquet&quot; between 1945 and 1958. Accordingly, the type saw battlefield service in French hands during both the Indochina War and the Algerian War.

The Swiss Air Force, as well as several other mountainous European countries, continued to use the &quot;Storch&quot; to conduct rescue operations in challenging terrain where STOL performance was necessary. One of the more historically significant operations involving the type was the Gauli Glacier crash rescue in November 1946, where a pair of &quot;Flugwaffe&quot;-flown Storches were the sole means of safely retrieving the twelve survivors of the crash. After the Second World War, numerous aircraft were used in utility roles, including agricultural spraying. Even into the twenty-first century, numerous Storches have remained operational, the type has become a common sight at air shows. In North America, both the Collings Foundation and the Fantasy of Flight museum have airworthy Fi 156 &quot;Storch&quot; aircraft in their collections.

<text>A short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft is a conventional fixed-wing aircraft that has short runway requirements for takeoff and landing. Many STOL-designed aircraft also feature various arrangements for use on airstrips with harsh conditions (such as high altitude or ice). STOL aircraft, including those used in scheduled passenger airline operations, have also been operated from STOLport airfields which feature short runways.

==Design considerations==
Many fixed-wing STOL aircraft are bush planes, though some, like the de Havilland Canada Dash-7, are designed for use on prepared airstrips; likewise, many STOL aircraft are taildraggers, though there are exceptions like the PAC P-750 XSTOL, the Quest Kodiak, the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and the Peterson 260SE. Autogyros also have STOL capability, needing a short ground roll to get airborne, but capable of a near-zero ground roll when landing.

Runway length requirement is a function of the square of the minimum flying speed (stall speed), and most design effort is spent on reducing this number. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag help the plane to accelerate for flight. The landing run is minimized by strong brakes, low landing speed, thrust reversers or spoilers (less common). Overall STOL performance is set by the length of runway needed to land or take off, whichever is longer.

Of equal importance to short ground run is the ability to clear obstacles, such as hills, on both take off and landing. For takeoff, large power/weight ratios and low drag result in a high rate of climb required to clear obstacles. For landing, high drag allows the aeroplane to descend steeply to the runway without building excess speed resulting in a longer ground run. Drag is increased by use of flaps (devices on the wings) and by a forward slip (causing the aeroplane to fly somewhat sideways through the air to increase drag).

Normally, a STOL aircraft will have a large wing for its weight. These wings often use aerodynamic devices like flaps, slots, slats, and vortex generators. Typically, designing an aircraft for excellent STOL performance reduces maximum speed, but does not reduce payload lifting ability. The payload is critical, because many small, isolated communities rely on STOL aircraft as their only transportation link to the outside world for passengers or cargo; examples include many communities in the Canadian north and Alaska.

Most STOL aircraft can land either on- or off-airport. Typical off-airport landing areas include snow or ice (using skis), fields or gravel riverbanks (often using special fat, low-pressure tundra tires), and water (using floats): these areas are often extremely short and obstructed by tall trees or hills. Wheel skis and amphibious floats combine wheels with skis or floats, allowing the choice of landing on snow/water or a prepared runway.

==Kits==

A number of aircraft modification companies offer STOL kits for improving short-field performance.

*Crosswinds STOL of Wasilla, Alaska, sells STOL kits for light aircraft, including leading edge cuffs, tip spill plates, inboard flap extensions and STOL fences. The company offers kits for Piper PA-12, PA-14, PA-18, PA-20 and 22, Bellanca Champion Model 7 series, Cessna 170B, 180 and 185.
*Horton, Inc, of Wellington, Kansas, offers STOL kits under the brand name &quot;Horton STOL-Craft&quot;, emphasizing that the modifications increase safety by allowing forced landings to occur at lower speeds and thus improve survivability. The Horton modifications include a drooped leading edge cuff, conical cambered wingtips, control surface gap seals and wing fences. The company says: &quot;On an average you can expect to get a 4-7 knot reduction in stall speeds. Flying at these lower stall speeds you can reduce the take-off and landing distances by 10%&quot;. Horton STOL kits are available for several Cessna and Piper PA-28 models.
*Micro AeroDynamics markets vortex generator modification kits for &quot;STOL benefits&quot;. The Micro kits are small vortex generators that are glued to the wing leading edge, as well as the underside of the elevator and on the fin. Kits are available for a large number of light aircraft types.
*Sierra Industries sells Robertson STOL kits, marketed under the name R/STOL, incorporate a drooped leading edge cuff, wing fences, drooping ailerons and an automatic trim system. The company says that installation &quot;allows 15 to 25 MPH slower approaches and requires up to 40% less runway distance&quot;. R/STOL kits are available for various Cessna models.&lt;ref name=&quot;R/STOLAbout&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R/STOL&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;R/STOLMods&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
*Stolairus Aviation of Kelowna, British Columbia, has developed STOL Kits for the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to increase lift and reduce stall speeds. The DHC-2 Beaver STOL Kit includes a contoured leading edge, flap-gap seals, wing fences and drooped wingtips. The DHC-3 Otter STOL Kit includes a contoured leading edge and drooped wingtips.

==STOLport==

A STOLport is an airport designed with STOL operations in mind, normally having a short single runway.

STOLports are not common but can be found, for example, at London City Airport in London, United Kingdom. There were also several STOLports in the United States that were used for scheduled passenger airline operations but are now no longer in existence.

==CESTOL==
Cruise-efficient short takeoff and landing (CESTOL), is an aircraft with both very short runway requirements and high cruise speeds (greater than Mach 0.8).

==Definitions==
Many different definitions of STOL have been used by different authorities and nations at various times and for a myriad of regulatory and military purposes. Some accepted definitions of STOL include:





Additionally, some aircraft manufacturers market their products as STOL without providing evidence that the aircraft meets any accepted definition.

==Rough-field capability==
In aviation, rough-field capability is the ability for an aircraft to land/take-off from an unprepared/damaged (usually short) runway or grass field, highway, wasteland etc. Rough-field capable aircraft usually have high wings and reinforced landing gear and STOL capability.
