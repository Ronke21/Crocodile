<text>An inselberg or monadnock ( ) is an isolated rock hill, knob, ridge, or small mountain that rises abruptly from a gently sloping or virtually level surrounding plain.
In Southern Africa, a similar formation of granite is known as a koppie, an Afrikaans word (&quot;little head&quot;) from the Dutch diminutive word &quot;kopje&quot;. If the inselberg is dome-shaped and formed from granite or gneiss, it can also be called a bornhardt, though not all bornhardts are inselbergs. 
An inselberg results when a body of rock resistant to erosion, such as granite, occurring within a body of softer rocks, is exposed by differential erosion and lowering of the surrounding landscape.

== Etymology ==
=== Inselberg ===
The word &quot;inselberg&quot; is a loan word from German, and means &quot;island mountain&quot;. The term was coined in 1900 by geologist Wilhelm Bornhardt (1864–1946) to describe the abundance of such features found in eastern Africa. At that time, the term applied only to arid landscape features. However, it has since been used to describe a broader geography and range of rock features, leading to confusion about the precise definition of the term.

In a 1973 study examining the use of the term, one researcher found that the term had been used for features in savannah climates 40% of the time, arid or semi-arid climates 32% of the time, humid-subtropical and arctic 12% of the time, and 6% each in humid-tropical and Mediterranean climates. A 1972 paper defined inselbergs as &quot;steep-sided isolated hills rising relatively abruptly above gently sloping ground&quot;. This definition includes such features as buttes; conical hills with rectilinear sides typically found in arid regions; regolith-covered concave-convex hills; rock crests over regolith slopes; rock domes with near vertical sides; tors (koppies) formed of large boulders but with solid rock cores. Thus, the terms monadnock and inselberg may not perfectly match, though some authors have explicitly argued these terms are completely synonymous.

=== Monadnock ===
&quot;Monadnock&quot; is derived from an Abenaki term for an isolated hill or a lone mountain that stands above the surrounding area, typically by surviving erosion. Geologists took the name from Mount Monadnock in southwestern New Hampshire. It is thought to derive from either () or (). In this context, &quot;monadnock&quot; is used to describe a mountain that rises from an area of relatively flat and/or lower terrain. For instance, Mount Monadnock rises above its surrounding terrain and stands, at , nearly higher than any mountain peak within .

===Geological and geographical patterns ===

Inselbergs are common in eroded and weathered shields. The presence of an inselberg typically indicates the existence of a nearby plateau or highland, or their remnants. This is especially the case for inselbergs composed of sedimentary rock, which will display the same stratigraphic units as this nearby plateau. However once exposed, the inselbergs are destroyed by marginal collapse of joint blocks and exfoliation sheets. This process leaves behind tors perched at their summits and, over time, a talus-bordered residual known as a &quot;castle koppie&quot; appears. By this association various inselberg fields in Africa and South America are assumed to be the vestiges of eroded etchplains.

Clusters of inselbergs, called inselberg fields and inselberg plains, occur in various parts of the world, including Tanzania, the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, Northeast Brazil, Namibia, the interior of Angola, and the northern portions of Finland and Sweden.

The classification of Anthony Young (1969) distinguishes six types of inselbergs; buttes, conical hills, convex-concave hills, rock crest over regolith-covered slope, rock dome (sugarloaf) and kopje or tor.

The types of rock of which inselbergs are made include granite, gneiss and gabbro.

===Origin and development===

Summarizing the understanding on the origin of inselbergs in 1974, geomorphologist Michael Thomas writes &quot;Hypotheses for the development of inselbergs have been advanced, refuted and reiterated over a period of more than seventy years.&quot; Volcanic or other processes, such as a meteor crater, may give rise to a body of rock resistant to erosion, inside a body of softer rock such as limestone, which is more susceptible to erosion. When the less resistant rock is eroded away to form a plain, the more resistant rock is left behind as an isolated mountain. The strength of the uneroded rock is often attributed to the tightness of its jointing.

Inselbergs can be reshaped by ice sheets much the same way as roches moutonnées. In northern Sweden, examples of this type of inselberg are called &quot;flyggbergs&quot;.

== Ecology ==

The inselbergs of Eastern Africa tend to be a refuge for life in the Serengeti of Tanzania and in the Masai Mara of Kenya. Where the soil is too thin or hard to support tree life in large areas, soil trapped by inselbergs can be dense with trees while the surrounding land contains only short grass. Hollows in the rock surfaces provide catchments for rainwater. Many animals have adapted to the use of inselbergs, including the lion, the hyrax, and an abundance of bird and reptile life.

<text>The Mark 24 Tigerfish was a heavyweight acoustic homing torpedo used by the Royal Navy (RN) during the 1980s and 90s. Conceptual development dates to the mid-1950s, and formally started in 1959 with a target introduction date in 1969. A lengthy development process led to a greatly reduced performance requirement, including the removal of anti-surface capabilities. The first prototype &quot;Tiger Fish&quot; examples were delivered in 1967.

The Tigerfish was fitted with both active and passive sonar and could be remotely controlled through a thin wire which connected it to the launching submarine. Wire guidance permits a torpedo to be launched on-first-warning, i.e. when a target is first detected at long range. This gives the torpedo the time needed to close the range while target course and speed are being updated by the submarine&#x27;s superior sensors and transmitted &#x27;down-the-wire&#x27;. The torpedo can also be reassigned to another target or recalled. Typically, wire-guided torpedoes initially run at low speed in order to maximize their range and to minimize their self-generated noise while they close the range, and speed up during the attack phase.

Testing in 1969 revealed many problems, especially with the seeker system. An upgrade program was ordered, producing the Mod 1 which regained the surface-attack mode. Testing from 1975 led to a production order in 1977, but it was not until 1983 that these officially entered service. Service during the 1982 Falklands War revealed serious reliability problems. A more significant upgrade program followed, the Consolidation Programme, which addressed the complete weapon system including the fire control system. This emerged as the much more reliable Mod 2, which entered service in 1987. A final upgrade series, Mod 2*, entered service in 1992. A simplified inexpensive version, Mod 3, was not produced.

While Tigerfish was being deployed, a new project was started that more closely followed the original performance requirement, and ultimately greatly surpassed it. This resulted in the much more capable Spearfish torpedo, which began replacing Tigerfish starting in 1988. The last examples of the Tigerfish retired from RN service in 2004. Tigerfish was also operated by Turkey, Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia. A total of 2,184 Mk.24s were produced.

==Design and development==

The initial concept developed in the mid-1950s was for a fast, , deep-diving torpedo driven by an internal combustion engine, carrying high pressure oxygen as oxidant, guided by a wire system developed from the Mackle wire-guidance study dated 1952 using data transmitted from the firing submarine sonars and using an autonomous active/passive sonar developed from the abandoned 1950s UK PENTANE torpedo project.

The weapon was known as Project ONGAR because Ongar railway station was, until 1994, the last on the Central line of the London Underground system. The engineers developing this weapon were confident that it would be so advanced that it would be &quot;...the end of the line for torpedo development&quot;.

The programme ran into serious problems in the late 1950s because the technology required was too advanced to meet an in-service target date of 1969. In addition, the closure of the Torpedo Experimental Establishment, Greenock, Scotland in 1959 and the transfer of its staff to Portland in Dorset disrupted the pace of development.

In the early 1960s a series of wide-ranging reviews (one report was titled &quot;Whither ONGAR?&quot; - the pun being intentional) led to a greatly reduced performance specification which was realistically expected to achieve an in-service date of 1969.

The propulsion system was changed from an internal combustion engine to an electric motor with a silver zinc battery as the power source. This reduced the planned speed of the weapon from with a short final-attack-phase capability at .

The homing system was simplified by the exclusion of the anti-surface ship capability in the Mod 0 weapon.

Only the wire-guidance system was retained relatively unchanged. This was similar to the system used on the earlier Mk 23 torpedo.

The original requirement for a crush depth of was overtaken by rapid advances in SSN deep-diving performance and the requirement was progressively increased to and then .

==In-service performance==

Early models suffered from poor reliability: only 40% of the Mod 0 ASW model performed as designed. The torpedo depended in large part on the remote-control system, but the weapon tended to dip during launch, severing the control wire. A redesigned version, designated the Tigerfish Mod 1, aimed to rectify some of the original model&#x27;s faults but failed its initial fleet acceptance trials in 1979 despite some improvements. Lacking any alternative it was nevertheless issued to the fleet (alongside the Mod 0 which also failed its own fresh acceptance trials the same year) in 1980. When HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; sank the ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; during the 1982 Falklands War she used the &quot;point and shoot&quot; 21-inch Mark VIII torpedoes rather than her Tigerfish. The Mark VIII had no homing system but, despite the design being over 50 years old at the time, was far more reliable and carried a greater high-explosive payload. In a test carried out by submarines returning to the UK after the war, two of five Mod 1 Tigerfish fired at a target hulk failed to function at all and the remaining three failed to hit the target.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s need for a reliable means of dealing with fast, deep-diving, time-urgent targets at long range resulted in a project to arm Tigerfish with a nuclear warhead to offset its poor diving depth and homing performance and to push kill probability close to 90%. Various other measures were proposed in mid-1969, including purchase of U.S. weapons such as the Mark 45 ASTOR nuclear torpedo, the Mark 48 Mod-1 torpedo or the Subroc rocket. Alternatively, at the initiative of Flag Officer Submarines (FOSM), a nuclear warhead might be fitted to the unguided, shallow-running and short-ranged, but reliable Mark VIII torpedo. Flag Officer Submarines minuted that the proposal to arm the Mark VIII with the WE.177A warhead would, despite the torpedo&#x27;s performance shortcomings, result in a torpedo &quot;much superior to any present British submarine weapon ...&quot; However, the short range of the Mark VIII put the firing submarine within damage range of the nuclear warhead of its torpedo.

The Marconi Consolidation Programme of the early 1980s finally produced the Mod 2 with reliability improved to 80%, which the Royal Navy accepted as the best that could be achieved with a basic design that was incapable of further development. By 1987, 600 Tigerfish had been modified to the Mod 2 standard.

Further improvements, including improved under-ice and anti-surface performance led to a Mod 2* (enhanced) version being accepted into the fleet in 1992. The new version featured substantial changes to batteries, sensors and warhead. Further software enhancements continued throughout its operational life.

The tribulations in the Tigerfish&#x27;s development, from its conception in the mid-1950s to the introduction of the unsuccessful Mod 0 variant into Royal Navy service in 1980, prompted the decision to purchase cruise missiles to attack ships from Royal Navy submarines.

Versions were:
:Mark 24-Mod-0 for ASW use. Dive depth .
:Mark 24-Mod-1 (or Mark 24 DP) for ASW and ASV use. Dive depth .
:Mark 24-Mod-1-N for ASW and ASV use. Dive depth . The nuclear version – paper study only.
:Mark 24-Mod-2 for ASW and ASV use. Dive depth . The Marconi upgrade.

In 1990 Cardoen of Chile was granted a licence to manufacture Tigerfish for the Chilean, Brazilian and Venezuelan navies.

The Royal Navy retired the last of its Tigerfish torpedoes from active service in February 2004.

A proposal to develop a Mod 3 configuration which might be attractive to existing export customers in Brazil and Turkey never came to fruition.

<text>The Spearfish torpedo (formally Naval Staff Target 7525) is the heavy torpedo used by the submarines of the Royal Navy. It can be guided by wire or by autonomous active or passive sonar, and provides both anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface warfare (ASuW) capability. Spearfish development began in the 1970s, with production starting in 1988, and deployment in 1992. By 2004, the new weapon had completely replaced the older Tigerfish torpedo.

==Design==
The torpedo is driven by a pump-jet coupled to a Hamilton Sundstrand 21TP04 gas turbine engine using Otto fuel II and hydroxylammonium perchlorate as oxidiser. The addition of an oxidiser improves the specific energy of the fuel by reducing the fuel-richness of the Otto fuel. The Spearfish, which are capable of travelling at , were designed to catch high-speed, deep-diving Soviet threats such as the .

A microprocessor enables the torpedo to make autonomous tactical decisions during the attack. It has a powerful blast warhead, triggered by either contact detonation (against a submarine hull) or an acoustic proximity fuse (for under-keel detonation against ships). A standoff detonation under the keel enhances blast effects against surface ships through the amplification of stress resulting from the interaction of the explosion&#x27;s products and the flexible structure of the ship.

==Guidance==
In a typical engagement, Spearfish will run out wire-guided to the general vicinity of the target and then conduct a covert passive search. The high-capacity guide wire system, specifically designed to match the Spearfish&#x27;s manoeuvre and speed envelope, provides two-way data exchange between the torpedo and launch submarine, maximising the submarine&#x27;s organic sensor and combat control capabilities.

Once at close range the Spearfish uses active sonar to classify and home in on its target. High-power transmissions and sophisticated signal processing enable Spearfish to accurately discriminate targets from background noise and ensure high resistance to acoustic countermeasures and/or evasive manoeuvres.

Should Spearfish fail to hit the target on its first attack, it automatically selects an appropriate re-attack mode until it successfully concludes the engagement.

==Testing==
Tactical software has been extensively refined through real-time, hardware in the loop simulations and demonstrated in more than 500 in-water trials and exercise firings.

==Production==
The production contract for the Spearfish Torpedo was placed with GEC-Marconi Underwater Systems Ltd (now BAE Systems) in 1983, following a development programme lasting several years. Spearfish entered full production in 1988.

==Deployment==
The first Spearfish were deployed in 1992, with deliveries completed in 2003; the number ordered has not been revealed. Spearfish torpedoes are stored and serviced at Beith Ordnance Storage facility in North Ayrshire.

==Upgrade==
In 2009, an upgrade programme began, leading to further sophisticated advances in Spearfish&#x27;s homing, warheads, tactical and fuelling systems, as well as an upgraded guidance link. This will last until 2019.

On 15 December 2014, the Ministry of Defence awarded BAE Systems a £270 million contract to upgrade the Spearfish torpedo. The upgrade includes a new insensitive-munition warhead from TDW, a change to the fuel system to improve safety, full digitisation of the weapon and a new fibre optic guidance link to improve performance. The upgraded &#x27;MOD 1&#x27; torpedoes will enter service between 2020 and 2024. In February 2021 test fired 3 upgraded &#x27;MOD 1&#x27; specification Spearfish torpedoes as part of their final testing before entry into service with the Royal Navy, whilst Vanguard-class trials were carried out in 2024.

<text>Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) is a scaled-down web server software for Windows operating systems. It has fewer features than Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Information Services (IIS) and its functions have been superseded by IIS and Visual Studio. Microsoft officially supports PWS on Windows 95-98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows NT 4.0. Prior to the release of Windows 2000, PWS was available as a free download as well as included on the Windows distribution CDs. PWS 4 was the last version and it can be found on the Windows 98 CD and the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack.

Personal Web Server was originally created by Vermeer Technologies, the same company which created Microsoft FrontPage, before they were acquired by Microsoft. It was installed by FrontPage versions 1.1 to 98 as well.

NT Workstation 4.0 shipped with Peer Web Services, which was based on IIS 2.0 and 3.0. With IIS 4.0, this was renamed Personal Web Server to be consistent with the name used in 95/98.

Since Windows 2000, PWS was renamed the same IIS name used in server versions of Windows as a standard Windows component. Windows ME and Windows XP Home Edition support neither PWS nor IIS, although PWS can be installed on Windows ME. In other editions of Windows XP, IIS is included as standard.

Before Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, PWS was useful in developing web applications on the localhost before deploying to a production web server. The IDE of Visual Studio 2005 (and later versions) now contains a built-in lightweight web server for such development purposes.

FTP, SMTP, HTTP and the usual web languages such as PHP and Perl are supported by PWS. It also supports basic CGI (Common Gateway Interface) conventions and a subset of Classic ASP. Using these technologies, web applications running on PWS are capable of performing and interpreting database queries and results.

Microsoft also produced a version of Personal Web Server for the Macintosh based on code acquired in its acquisition of ResNova Software in November 1996.

<text>alt.sex.stories is a Usenet newsgroup for erotic stories created on May 7, 1992, by Tim Pierce as an alternative to pre-existing alt erotica newsgroups. The group was initially unmoderated, a feature that was not shared by some of the other Usenet or altnet newsgroups. This feature allowed for greater user freedom.

==History==
===alt.sex.stories.moderated===
In early 1997 a moderated version of alt.sex.stories was created due to an increasing number of posts by &quot;various pay services, scam artists, and bots&quot;. During the twenty years in which it was active, the moderated newsgroup (ASSM) has always operated by cross-posting all approved stories to alt.sex.stories, and was not simply a filtered version of the unmoderated group. All stories posted to ASSM were specifically submitted there.

Day-to-day operations and general direction of ASSM were overseen by the Alt.Sex.Stories Text Repository (ASSTR), which coordinated a group of volunteers to moderate the newsgroup using a web-based voting system. ASSTR also hosts an archive of the newsgroup, and hosted a mirror of the Nifty Erotic Stories Archive (now located at nifty.org).

Eventually, ASSM became one of the few remaining active groups in the alt.sex.* hierarchy. Due to competition from web-based erotica sites and communities, the volume of stories posted to ASSM (and thus to alt.sex.stories) had dropped considerably by 2006. The group continued to be actively moderated until July 2017 but is no longer functional.

The asstr.org website was last updated in 2017 and is no longer stable, having dropped completely offline in July 2022 only to reappear (with no new content) in 2023. Much of the content is mirrored to other sites, but these may be severely out-of-date.

===Notable authors===
Alt.sex.stories is notable for assisting in the launch of several notable authors of erotica such as Elf Sternberg and Mary Anne Mohanraj.

===Story codes===
Because of the large volume of stories posted, a set of codes to describe the story content was developed. Writers were encouraged to include these story codes in the title of their stories.

<text>Hindu astrology, also called Indian astrology, jyotisha (; ) and, more recently, Vedic astrology, is the traditional Hindu system of astrology. It is one of the six auxiliary disciplines in Hinduism that is connected with the study of the Vedas.

The &quot;Vedanga Jyotisha&quot; is one of the earliest texts about astronomy within the Vedas. Some scholars believe that the horoscopic astrology practiced in the Indian subcontinent came from Hellenistic influences. However, this is a point of intense debate, and other scholars believe that Jyotisha developed independently, although it may have interacted with Greek astrology.

The scientific consensus is that astrology is a pseudoscience and has consistently failed experimental and theoretical verification.

==Etymology==
Jyotisha, states Monier-Williams, is rooted in the word &quot;Jyotish,&quot; which means light, such as that of the sun or the moon or a heavenly body. The term &quot;Jyotisha&quot; includes the study of astronomy, astrology, and the science of timekeeping using the movements of astronomical bodies. It aimed to keep time, maintain calendars, and predict auspicious times for Vedic rituals.

==History and core principles==

Jyotiṣa is one of the Vedāṅga, the six auxiliary disciplines used to support Vedic rituals. Early jyotiṣa is concerned with the preparation of a calendar to determine dates for sacrificial rituals, with nothing written regarding planets. There are mentions of eclipse-causing &quot;demons&quot; in the Atharvaveda and Chāndogya Upaniṣad, the latter mentioning Rāhu (a shadow entity believed responsible for eclipses and meteors). The Ṛigveda also mentions an eclipse-causing demon, Svarbhānu. However, the specific term &quot;graha&quot; was not applied to Svarbhānu until the later &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;.

The foundation of Hindu astrology is the notion of bandhu of the Vedas (scriptures), which is the connection between the microcosm and the macrocosm. The practice relies primarily on the sidereal zodiac, which differs from the tropical zodiac used in Western (Hellenistic) astrology in that an &quot;ayanāṃśa&quot; adjustment is made for the gradual precession of the vernal equinox. Hindu astrology includes several nuanced sub-systems of interpretation and prediction with elements not found in Hellenistic astrology, such as its system of lunar mansions (&quot;Nakṣatra&quot;). It was only after the transmission of Hellenistic astrology that the order of planets in India was fixed in that of the seven-day week. Hellenistic astrology and astronomy also transmitted the twelve zodiacal signs beginning with Aries and the twelve astrological places beginning with the ascendant. The first evidence of the introduction of Greek astrology to India is the &quot;Yavanajātaka&quot; which dates to the early centuries CE. The &quot;Yavanajātaka&quot; ( &quot;Sayings of the Greeks&quot;) was translated from Greek to Sanskrit by Yavaneśvara during the 2nd century CE, and is considered the first Indian astrological treatise in the Sanskrit language. However the only version that survives is the verse version of Sphujidhvaja which dates to AD 270. The first Indian astronomical text to define the weekday was the &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot; of Āryabhaṭa (born AD 476).

In the 300 years between the first Yavanajataka and the Āryabhaṭīya, Indian astronomers likely focused on Indianizing and Sanskritizing Greek astronomy, according to Michio Yano We no longer have the astronomical texts from these 300 years. The later &quot;Pañcasiddhāntikā&quot; of Varāhamihira summarizes the five known Indian astronomical schools of the sixth century. Indian astronomy preserved some of the older pre-Ptolemaic elements of Greek astronomy.

The main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Sārāvalī&quot; by . The &quot;Horāshastra&quot; is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the late 8th century. The &quot;Sārāvalī&quot; likewise dates to around 800 CE. N. N. Krishna Rau and V. B. Choudhari published English translations of these texts in 1963 and 1961, respectively.

== Modern Hindu astrology==

Astrology remains an important facet of folk belief in the contemporary lives of many Hindus. In Hindu culture, newborns are traditionally named based on their &quot;jyotiṣa&quot; charts (&quot;kundali&quot;), and astrological concepts are pervasive in the organization of the Hindu calendar and holidays and in making major decisions such as those about marriage, opening a new business, or moving into a new home. Many Hindus believe that heavenly bodies, including the planets, have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the &quot;fruit of karma&quot;. The Navagraha, planetary deities, are considered subordinate to Ishvara (the Hindu concept of a supreme being) in the administration of justice. Thus, it is believed that these planets can influence earthly life.

===Astrology as a science===
The scientific community has rejected astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no mechanism proposed by astrologers through which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth. In spite of its status as a pseudoscience, in certain religious, political, and legal contexts, astrology retains a position among the sciences in modern India.

India&#x27;s University Grants Commission and Ministry of Human Resource Development decided to introduce &quot;Jyotir Vigyan&quot; (i.e. &quot;&quot;) or &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; as a discipline of study in Indian universities, stating that &quot;vedic astrology is not only one of the main subjects of our traditional and classical knowledge but this is the discipline, which lets us know the events happening in human life and in universe on time scale&quot; in spite of the complete lack of evidence that astrology actually does allow for such accurate predictions. The decision was backed by a 2001 judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and some Indian universities offer advanced degrees in astrology. 
This was met with widespread protests from the scientific community in India and Indian scientists working abroad. A petition sent to the Supreme Court of India stated that the introduction of astrology to university curricula is &quot;a giant leap backwards, undermining whatever scientific credibility the country has achieved so far&quot;.

In 2004, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the teaching of astrology did not qualify as the promotion of religion. In February 2011, the Bombay High Court referred to the 2004 Supreme Court ruling when it dismissed a case which had challenged astrology&#x27;s status as a science. despite continuing complaints by scientists, astrology continues to be taught at various universities in India, and there is a movement in progress to establish a national Vedic University to teach astrology together with the study of tantra, mantra, and yoga.

Skeptics have thoroughly debunked the claims made by Indian astrologers.. For example, although the planet Saturn is in the constellation Aries roughly every 30 years (e.g. 1909, 1939, 1968), the astrologer Bangalore Venkata Raman claimed that &quot;when Saturn was in Aries in 1939 England had to declare war against Germany&quot;, ignoring all the other dates. Astrologers regularly fail in attempts to predict election results in India, and fail to predict major events such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi. Predictions by the head of the Indian Astrologers Federation about war between India and Pakistan in 1982 also failed.

In 2000, when several planets happened to be close to one another, astrologers predicted that there would be catastrophes, volcanic eruptions and tidal waves. This caused an entire sea-side village in the Indian state of Gujarat to panic and abandon their houses. The predicted events did not occur and the vacant houses were burgled.

==Texts==

The ancient extant text on Jyotisha is the &quot;Vedanga-Jyotisha&quot;, which exists in two editions, one linked to the Rigveda and other to Yajurveda. The Rigveda version consists of 36 verses, while the Yajurveda recension has 43 verses of which 29 verses are borrowed from the Rigveda. The Rigveda version is variously attributed to sage Lagadha and sometimes to sage Shuci. The Yajurveda version does not attribute credit to any specific sage, has endured into the modern era with a commentary by Somakara, and is considered the more studied version.

The Jyotisha text &quot;Brahma-siddhanta&quot;, probably composed in the 5th century CE, discusses how to use the movement of planets, sun and moon to keep time and calendar. This text also lists trigonometry and mathematical formulae to support its theory of orbits, predict planetary positions and calculate relative mean positions of celestial nodes and apsides. The text is notable for presenting very large integers, such as the lifetime of the current universe being 4.32 billion years.

The ancient Hindu texts on Jyotisha only discuss timekeeping and never mention astrology or prophecy. These ancient texts predominantly cover astronomy, but at a rudimentary level. Technical horoscopes and astrology ideas in India came from Greece and developed in the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE. Later medieval era texts such as the &quot;Yavana-jataka&quot; and the &quot;Siddhanta&quot; texts are more astrology-related.

==Evolution of Vedic timekeeping==
The field of Jyotisha deals with ascertaining time, particularly forecasting auspicious days and times for Vedic rituals. The field of Vedanga structured time into &quot;Yuga,&quot; which was a 5-year interval, divided into multiple lunisolar intervals such as 60 solar months, 61 savana months, 62 synodic months and 67 sidereal months. A Vedic Yuga had 1,860 &quot;tithis&quot; (, dates), and it defined a &quot;savana&quot;-day (civil day) from one sunrise to another.

The Rigvedic version of Jyotisha may be a later insertion into the Veda, states David Pingree, possibly between 513 and 326 BCE, when the Indus Valley was occupied by the Achaemenid from Mesopotamia. The mathematics and devices for timekeeping mentioned in these ancient Sanskrit texts, proposes Pingree, such as the water clock, may also have arrived in India from Mesopotamia. However, Yukio Ohashi considers this proposal as incorrect, suggesting instead that the Vedic timekeeping efforts, for forecasting appropriate time for rituals, must have begun much earlier and the influence may have flowed from India to Mesopotamia. Ohashi states that it is incorrect to assume that the number of civil days in a year equals 365 in both the Hindu and Egyptian–Persian years. Further, adds Ohashi, the Mesopotamian formula is different from the Indian formula for calculating time, each can only work for their respective latitude, and either would make major errors in predicting time and calendar in the other region. According to Asko Parpola, the Jyotisha and luni-solar calendar discoveries in ancient India, and similar discoveries in China in &quot;great likelihood result from convergent parallel development&quot;, and not from diffusion from Mesopotamia.

Kim Plofker states that while a flow of timekeeping ideas from either side is plausible, each may have instead developed independently, because the loan-words typically seen when ideas migrate are missing on both sides as far as words for various time intervals and techniques. Further, adds Plofker, and other scholars, that the discussion of timekeeping concepts is found in the Sanskrit verses of the &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana&quot;, a 2nd millennium BCE text. Water clocks and sun dials are mentioned in many ancient Hindu texts such as the Arthashastra. Plofker suggests that the arrival of Greek astrology ideas in India may have led to a roundabout integration of Mesopotamian and Indian Jyotisha-based systems.

The Jyotisha texts present mathematical formulae to predict the length of daytime, sunrise and moon cycles. For example,

:The length of daytime = formula_1 &quot;muhurtas&quot;
:where &quot;n&quot; is the number of days after or before the winter solstice, and one &quot;muhurta&quot; equals of a day (48 minutes).
Water clockA &quot;prastha&quot; of water [is] the increase in day, [and] decrease in night in the [sun&#x27;s] northern motion; vice versa in the southern. [There is] a six-muhurta [difference] in a half year.

— Yajurveda Jyotisha-vedanga 8, Translator: Kim Plofker
==Elements==
There are sixteen &quot;Varga&quot; (, &#x27;part, division&#x27;), or divisional, charts used in Hindu astrology:

===Zodiac===

The Nirayana, or sidereal zodiac, is an imaginary belt of 360 degrees, which, like the Sāyana, or tropical zodiac, is divided into 12 equal parts. Each part (of 30 degrees) is called a sign or &quot;rāśi&quot; (Sanskrit: &#x27;part&#x27;). Vedic (Jyotiṣa) and Western zodiacs differ in the method of measurement. While synchronically, the two systems are identical, Jyotiṣa primarily uses the sidereal zodiac (in which stars are considered to be the fixed background against which the motion of the planets is measured), whereas most Western astrology uses the tropical zodiac (the motion of the planets is measured against the position of the Sun on the spring equinox). After two millennia, as a result of the precession of the equinoxes, the origin of the ecliptic longitude has shifted by about 30 degrees. As a result, the placement of planets in the Jyotiṣa system is roughly aligned with the constellations, while tropical astrology is based on the solstices and equinoxes. 
Unlike Western astrology, Hindu astrology usually disregards Uranus (which rules Aquarius), Neptune (which rules Pisces), and Pluto (which rules Scorpio).
===Nakṣhatras, or lunar mansions===
The &quot;nakshatras&quot; or lunar mansions are 27 equal divisions of the night sky used in Hindu astrology, each identified by its prominent star(s).

Historical (medieval) Hindu astrology enumerated either 27 or 28 nakṣatras. In modern astrology, a rigid system of 27 nakṣatras is generally used, each covering 13° 20′ of the ecliptic. The missing 28th nakshatra is &quot;Abhijeeta&quot;. Each nakṣatra is divided into equal quarters or &quot;padas&quot; of 3° 20′.

The junction of two Râshis as well as Nakshatras is known as Gandanta.

===Daśās – planetary periods===
The word &quot;dasha&quot; (Devanāgarī: दशा, Sanskrit,&quot;&quot;, &#x27;planetary period&#x27;) means &#x27;state of being&#x27; and it is believed that the &quot;daśā&quot; largely governs the state of being of a person. The Daśā system shows which planets may be said to have become particularly active during the period of the Daśā. The ruling planet (the Daśānātha or &#x27;lord of the Daśā&#x27;) eclipses the mind of the person, compelling him or her to act per the nature of the planet.

There are several &quot;dasha&quot; systems, each with its own utility and area of application. There are Daśās of &quot;grahas&quot; (planets) as well as Daśās of the Rāśis (zodiac signs). The primary system used by astrologers is the Viṁśottarī Daśā system, which has been considered universally applicable in the &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; to all horoscopes.

The first Mahā-Daśā is determined by the position of the natal Moon in a given Nakṣatra. The lord of the Nakṣatra governs the Daśā. Each Mahā-Dāśā is divided into sub-periods called &quot;bhuktis&quot;, or &quot;antar-daśās&quot;, which are proportional divisions of the maha-dasa. Further proportional sub-divisions can be made, but error margins based on accuracy of the birth time grow exponentially. The next sub-division is called &quot;pratyantar-daśā&quot;, which can in turn be divided into &quot;sookshma-antardasa&quot;, which can in turn be divided into &quot;praana-antardaśā&quot;, which can be sub-divided into &quot;deha-antardaśā&quot;. Such sub-divisions also exist in all other Daśā systems.

===Heavenly bodies===
The navagraha () are the nine celestial bodies used in Hindu astrology:
* Surya (Sun)
* Chandra (Moon)
* Budha (Mercury)
* Shukra (Venus)
* Mangala (Mars)
* Bṛhaspati or Guru (Jupiter)
* Shani (Saturn)
* Rahu (North node of the Moon)
* Ketu (South node of the Moon)

The navagraha are said to be forces that capture or eclipse the mind and the decision making of human beings. When the &quot;grahas&quot; are active in their &quot;daśās&quot;, or periodicities they are said to be particularly empowered to direct the affairs of people and events.

Planets are held to signify major details, such as profession, marriage and longevity.

Of these indicators, known as Karakas, Parashara considers Atmakaraka most important, signifying broad contours of a person&#x27;s life.

Rahu and Ketu correspond to the points where the moon crosses the ecliptic plane (known as the ascending and descending nodes of the moon). Classically known in Indian and Western astrology as the &quot;head and tail of the dragon&quot;, these planets are represented as a serpent-bodied demon beheaded by the Sudarshan Chakra of Vishnu after attempting to swallow the sun. They are primarily used to calculate the dates of eclipses. They are described as &quot;shadow planets&quot; because they are not visible in the night sky. Rahu and Ketu have an orbital cycle of 18 years and they are always retrograde in motion and 180 degrees from each other.

===Gocharas – transits===
A natal chart shows the position of the &quot;grahas&quot; at the moment of birth. Since that moment, the &quot;grahas&quot; have continued to move around the zodiac, interacting with the natal chart grahas. This period of interaction is called &quot;gochara&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;, &#x27;transit&#x27;).

The study of transits is based on the transit of the Moon (Chandra), which spans roughly two days, and also on the movement of Mercury (Budha) and Venus (Śukra) across the celestial sphere, which is relatively fast as viewed from Earth. The movement of the slower planets – Jupiter (Guru), Saturn (Śani) and Rāhu–Ketu — is always of considerable importance. Astrologers study the transit of the Daśā lord from various reference points in the horoscope.

====Yogas – planetary combinations====
In Hindu astronomy, &quot;yoga&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;, &#x27;union&#x27;) is a combination of planets placed in a specific relationship to each other.

Rāja yogas are perceived as givers of fame, status and authority, and are typically formed by the association of the Lord of Keṅdras (&#x27;quadrants&#x27;), when reckoned from the Lagna (&#x27;ascendant&#x27;), and the Lords of the Trikona (&#x27;trines&#x27;, 120 degrees—first, fifth and ninth houses). The Rāja yogas are culminations of the blessings of Viṣṇu and Lakṣmī. Some planets, such as Mars for Leo Lagna, do not need another &quot;graha&quot; (or Navagraha, &#x27;planet&#x27;) to create &quot;Rājayoga&quot;, but are capable of giving &quot;Rājayoga&quot; by themselves due to their own lordship of the 4th Bhāva (&#x27;astrological house&#x27;) and the 9th Bhāva from the Lagna, the two being a Keṅdra (&#x27;angular house&#x27;—first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses) and Trikona Bhāva respectively.

Dhana Yogas are formed by the association of wealth-giving planets such as the Dhaneśa or the 2nd Lord and the Lābheśa or the 11th Lord from the Lagna. Dhana Yogas are also formed due to the auspicious placement of the Dārāpada (from &quot;dara&quot;, &#x27;spouse&#x27; and &quot;pada&quot;, &#x27;foot&#x27;—one of the four divisions—3 degrees and 20 minutes—of a Nakshatra in the 7th house), when reckoned from the Ārūḍha Lagna (AL). The combination of the Lagneśa and the Bhāgyeśa also leads to wealth through the Lakṣmī Yoga.

Sanyāsa Yogas are formed due to the placement of four or more &quot;grahas&quot;, excluding the Sun, in a Keṅdra Bhāva from the Lagna.

There are some overarching yogas in Jyotiṣa such as Amāvasyā Doṣa, Kāla Sarpa Yoga-Kāla Amṛta Yoga and Graha Mālika Yoga that can take precedence over Yamaha yogar planetary placements in the horoscope.

===Bhāvas – houses===
The Hindu Jātaka or Janam Kundali or birth chart, is the bhāva chakra (Sanskrit: &#x27;division&#x27; &#x27;wheel&#x27;), the complete 360° circle of life, divided into houses, and represents a way of enacting the influences in the wheel. Each house has associated &quot;kāraka&quot; (Sanskrit: &#x27;significator&#x27;), planets that can alter the interpretation of a particular house. Each &quot;bhāva&quot; spans an arc of 30° with twelve &quot;bhāvas&quot; in any chart of the horoscope. These are a crucial part of any horoscopic study since the &quot;bhāvas&quot;, understood as &#x27;state of being&#x27;, personalize the astrological signs to the native and each sign apart from indicating its true nature reveals its impact on the person based on the &quot;bhāva&quot; occupied. The best way to study the various facets of Jyotiṣa is to see their role in chart evaluation of actual persons and how these are construed.

The meanings of the bhāvas are very similar to the triplicities in Western astrology. The houses are divided into four &quot;purusharthas&quot; (Sanskrit: &#x27;aims in life&#x27;) which point to mood or meaning of the house. These four &quot;purusharthas&quot; are Dharma (duty), Artha (resources), Kama (pleasure) and Moksha (liberation). They correspond to the 12 &quot;bhavas&quot; as follows:

* Dharma – 1st, 5th and 9th &quot;bhavas&quot; – The need to find a path and purpose. 
* Artha – 2nd, 6th and 10th &quot;bhavas&quot; – The need to acquire the necessary resources to fulfill that path.
* Kama – 3rd, 7th and 11th &quot;bhavas&quot; – The need for pleasure and enjoyment.
* Moksha – 4th, 8th and 12th &quot;bhavas&quot; – The need to attain liberation from the world.

These 4 aims of life are repeated in above sequence 3 times through the 12 bhavas:
* The first round, bhavas 1 through 4, show the process within the Individual. 
* The second round, bhavas 5 through 8, show the alchemy in relating to other people. 
* The third round, bhavas 9 through 12, show the universalization of the self.

===Dṛiṣṭis===
&quot;Drishti&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;, &#x27;sight&#x27;) is an aspect to an entire house. &quot;Grahas&quot; cast only forward aspects, with the furthest aspect being considered the strongest. For example, Jupiter aspects the 5th, 7th and 9th house from its position, Mars aspects the 4th, 7th, and 8th houses from its position, and its 8th house.

The principle of Drishti (aspect) was devised on the basis of the aspect of an army of planets as deity and demon in a war field. Thus the Sun, a deity king with only one full aspect, is more powerful than the demon king Saturn, which has three full aspects.

Aspects can be cast both by the planets (Graha Dṛṣṭi) and by the signs (Rāśi Dṛṣṭi). Planetary aspects are a function of desire, while sign aspects are a function of awareness and cognizance.

There are some higher aspects of Graha Dṛṣṭi (planetary aspects) that are not limited to the Viśeṣa Dṛṣṭi or the special aspects. Rāśi Dṛṣṭi works based on the following formulaic structure: all movable signs aspect fixed signs except the one adjacent, and all dual and mutable signs aspect each other without exception.

<text>Future Crew was a Finnish demogroup that created PC demos and software, active mostly between 1987 and 1994.

==History==
The group was founded in 1986 by PSI (Sami Tammilehto) and JPM (Jussi Markula) as a Commodore 64 group, before moving to the PC demoscene in 1988; other members included, over time, Trug, Wildfire, Pixel, ICE, GORE, Abyss, Purple Motion, and Skaven, as well as several others.

Noteworthy demos by Future Crew include &quot;Unreal&quot; (released at Assembly 1992), &quot;Panic&quot; (released at The Party 1992) and &quot;Second Reality&quot; (released at Assembly 1993). Second Reality may be considered one of the most influential PC demos ever made. Future Crew was also responsible for the popular MOD editor &quot;Scream Tracker&quot;, which was fashioned after the Amiga Soundtracker as well as the &quot;Advanced DigiPlayer&quot; sound editor, and later became itself inspiration for other trackers like Impulse Tracker.

Future Crew was co-organizer of the first Assembly demo party in 1992. They continued organizing the annual party until 1995, when the organization set up the Finnish company &quot;ASSEMBLY Organizing&quot; in order to &quot;provide a solid financial basis for the events and a reliable partner for our sponsors&quot;. Long time Future Crew member Abyss is one of the party&#x27;s main organizers.

Future Crew did not release anything as a group after Scream Tracker 3 (July 1994). While it was never officially dissolved, its members parted ways in the second half of the 1990s. Companies like Futuremark (3DMark), Remedy (&quot;Death Rally&quot;, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;Alan Wake&quot;), Bugbear Entertainment (&quot;FlatOut&quot;, &quot;Glimmerati&quot;, &quot;Rally Trophy&quot;), Bitboys (a graphics hardware company) and Recoil Games (&quot;Rochard&quot;) were all started in whole or in part by members of Future Crew. Prior to their dissolution, they also contributed graphics to the game &quot;Ken&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; published by Epic MegaGames. Skaven contributed music to Unreal Tournament 1999.

==Reception and impact==
Future Crew was an influential pioneer of the PC demoscene and the PC as multimedia device in general, and achieved wide public recognition.

===Awards and tributes===
Slashdot voted the Future Crew demo Second Reality as one of the &quot;Top 10 Hacks of All Time&quot;.
Tributes to Future Crew include a 3D graphics benchmark called &quot;Final Reality&quot; by Remedy Entertainment (shown at Assembly 1997), and a remake of Second Reality for the Commodore 64 by Smash Designs called &quot;Second Reality 64&quot; (released at The Party 1997).
Nectarine Records has released a free-to-download album titled &quot;Metropolis&quot; containing the most known songs of Future Crew in 24-bit remastered as a tribute.

<text>Sir Gordon Howard Eliott Hodgkin (6 August 1932 – 9 March 2017) was a British painter and printmaker. His work is most often associated with abstraction.

==Early life==

Gordon Howard Eliot Hodgkin was born on 6 August 1932 in Hammersmith, London, the son of Eliot Hodgkin (1905–1973), a manager for the chemical company ICI and an amateur horticulturist, and his wife Katherine, a botanical illustrator. During the Second World War, Eliot Hodgkin was an RAF officer, rising to Wing Commander, and was assistant to Sefton Delmer in running his black propaganda campaign against Nazi Germany.

His maternal grandfather Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart was a journalist, lawyer, Member of Parliament (MP) and Lord Chief Justice; and the scientist Thomas Hodgkin was his great-great-grandfather&#x27;s older brother. Hodgkin was a cousin of the English still life painter Eliot Hodgkin (1905–1987).

During the Second World War, Hodgkin was evacuated with his mother and sister to the US, where they lived on Long Island, New York. On returning, he was educated at Eton College and then at Bryanston School in Dorset. He had decided on a career in art in early childhood and ran away from school to pursue this.

He studied at the Camberwell Art School and later at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, where Edward Piper studied drawing under him.

==Career==
&quot;Memoirs&quot; (1949), one of Hodgkin&#x27;s earliest recorded paintings, shows the artist, then aged 17, listening to a female figure reclining on a sofa. Painted with angular forms and black outlines, the work precedes Hodgkin&#x27;s distinct abstract style.

Hodgkin&#x27;s first solo show was in London in 1962.

In 1975, the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol reopened in new premises with two simultanuous solo exhibitions of Howard Hodgkin (ground floor) and Keith Milow (upper floor).

In 1980, Hodgkin was invited by John Hoyland to exhibit work as part of the Hayward Annual at the Hayward Gallery along with Gillian Ayres, Basil Beattie, Terry Setch, Anthony Caro, Patrick Caulfield, Ben Nicholson and others.

In 1981, Hodgkin had collaborated with the Rambert Dance Company&#x27;s Resident Choreographer, Richard Alston, for his abstract work 1981 for the production of &quot;Night Music&quot; and later for the production of &quot;Pulcinella&quot; in 1987.

In 1984, Hodgkin represented Britain at the Venice Biennale, in 1985 he won the Turner Prize, and in 1992 he was knighted.

=== British Council in India ===
Hodgkin was invited to design a mural for the front of Charles Correa&#x27;s 1992 headquarters for the British Council in India. Hodgkin&#x27;s mural is of a banyan tree spreading its branches across the walls. It is a symbol of the British Council&#x27;s work rooted in the Indian cultural scene. Hodgkin said of Correa: “Charles Correa is the most perfect architect you could imagine. He first suggested that I think about the mural as an Indian flag turning into a Union Jack. I said no.”

In 1995, Hodgkin printed the &quot;Venetian Views&quot; series, which depict the same view of Venice at four different times of day. &quot;Venice, Afternoon&quot; – one of the four prints – uses 16 sheets, or fragments, in a hugely complex printing process that creates a colourful, painterly effect. This piece was given to the Yale Centre of British Art in June 2006 by its Israeli family owners in order to complement the museum&#x27;s already-impressive collection of Hodgkins.

A major exhibition of his work was mounted at Tate Britain, London, in 2006. Also in 2006, &quot;The Independent&quot; declared him one of the 100 most influential gay people in Britain, as his work has helped many people express their emotions to others.

In September 2010, Hodgkin and five other British artists, John Hoyland, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Patrick Caulfield and R.B. Kitaj, were in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie,&quot; at the Yale Center for British Art.
Before his death on 9 March 2017 he was working on two UK exhibitions, one at the Hepworth Wakefield, and another at the National Portrait Gallery.

His prints were hand-painted etchings and he worked with the master printer Jack Shirreff at 107 Workshop.

A feature of his painting was that he made the frame intrinsic to the work &quot;incorporated physically into the painting as part of its making, or created as an illusion to give definition to his subject.&quot;

When asked by poet/artist Steven Vita of &quot;Veery&quot; journal why Hodgkin painted on wood rather than on canvas, Hodgkin answered, “Because wood answers back.”

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C466/286) with Howard Hodgkin between 2008 and 2017 for its Artists&#x27; Lives collection held by the British Library.

==Honours==
Hodgkin was appointed a CBE in 1977, and he was knighted in 1992. In 1997 the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Hodgkin its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his life&#x27;s work. He received an honorary fellowship from the London Institute in 1999. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary DLitt by the University of Oxford. He was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 2003 New Year Honours for his services to art. Hodgkin was named 2014 Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon.

==Personal life==
In 1955, Hodgkin married Julia Lane, by whom he had two children. Hodgkin knew he was gay, even when he was married, and later left his wife. In 2009, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that he had been with his partner, the music writer Antony Peattie, for 20 years. They lived in a four-storey Georgian house in Bloomsbury, near the British Museum.

==Death==
On 9 March 2017, Hodgkin died at the age of 84 in a hospital in London. Tributes to him were made by several figures in British art, including Tate director Nicholas Serota.

<doc id="186467" wikidata="Q1455196" url="?curid=186467" title="Language education">
<text>Language education refers to the processes and practices of teaching a second or foreign language. Its study reflects interdisciplinary approaches, usually including some applied linguistics. There are four main learning categories for language education: communicative competencies, proficiencies, cross-cultural experiences, and multiple literacies.

==Need==
Increasing globalization has created a great need for people in the workforce who can communicate in multiple languages. Common languages are used in areas such as trade, tourism, diplomacy, technology, media, translation, interpretation and science. Many countries such as Korea (Kim Yeong-seo, 2009), Japan (Kubota, 1998) and China (Kirkpatrick &amp; Zhichang, 2002) frame education policies to teach at least one foreign language at the primary and secondary school levels. Further, the governments of some countries more than one official language; such countries include India, Singapore, Malaysia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. According to GAO (2010), China has recently been putting importance on foreign language learning, especially English.

==History==

===Ancient to medieval period===
Ancient learners seem to have started by reading, memorizing and reciting little stories and dialogues that provided basic vocabulary and grammar in naturalistic contexts. These texts seem to have emphasized coherent texts rather than isolated sentences such as those modern learners often practice on. They covered topics such as getting dressed in the morning (and how to manage the slaves who helped with that task), going to school (and evading punishment for not having been there yesterday), visiting a sick friend (and how to find an individual unit in a Roman apartment block), trading insults (and how to concede a fight graciously), or getting a new job (a piece of cake if you have studied with me, an ancient teacher assured his students mendaciously). The texts were presented bilingually in two narrow columns, the language you were learning on the left and the one you already knew on the right, with the columns matching line for line: Each line was effectively a glossary, while each column was a text.

Although the need to learn foreign languages is almost as old as human history itself, the origins of modern language education are in the study and teaching of Latin in the 17th century. In the Ancient Near East, Akkadian was the language of diplomacy, as in the Amarna letters. For many centuries, Latin had been the dominant language of education, commerce, religion, and government in much of the Western world. By the end of the 16th century, it had largely been displaced by French, Italian, and English. John Amos Comenius was one of many people who tried to reverse this trend. He composed a complete course for learning Latin, covering the entire school curriculum, culminating in his &quot;Opera Didactica Omnia&quot;, 1657.

In this work, Comenius also outlined his theory of language acquisition. He is one of the first theorists to write systematically about how languages are learned and about pedagogical methodology for language acquisition. He held that language acquisition must be allied with sensation and experience. Teaching must be oral. The schoolroom should have models of things, and failing that, pictures of them. As a result, he also published the world&#x27;s first illustrated children&#x27;s book, &quot;Orbis sensualium pictus&quot;. The study of Latin diminished from the study of a living language to be used in the real world to a subject in the school curriculum. Such decline brought about a new justification for its study. It was then claimed that the study of Latin developed intellectual ability, and the study of Latin grammar became an end in and of itself.

&quot;Grammar schools&quot; from the 16th to 18th centuries focused on teaching the grammatical aspects of Classical Latin. Advanced students continued grammar study with the addition of rhetoric.

===18th century===
The study of modern languages did not become part of the curriculum of European schools until the 18th century. Based on the purely academic study of Latin, students of modern languages did much of the same exercises, studying grammatical rules and translating abstract sentences. Oral work was minimal, and students were instead required to memorize grammatical rules and apply these to decode written texts in the target language. This tradition-inspired method became known as the grammar-translation method.

===19th and 20th centuries===
Innovation in foreign language teaching began in the 19th century and became very rapid in the 20th century. It led to a number of different and sometimes conflicting methods, each claiming to be a major improvement over the previous or contemporary methods. The earliest applied linguists included Jean Manesca, Heinrich Gottfried Ollendorff (1803–1865), Henry Sweet (1845–1912), Otto Jespersen (1860–1943), and Harold Palmer (1877–1949). They worked on setting language teaching principles and approaches based on linguistic and psychological theories, but they left many practical details for others to develop.

The history of foreign-language education in the 20th century and the methods of teaching (such as those related below) might appear to be a history of failure. Very few students in U.S. universities who major in a foreign language attain &quot;minimum professional proficiency.&quot; Even the &quot;reading knowledge&quot; required for a PhD degree is comparable only to what second-year language students read, and only very few researchers who are native English speakers can read and assess information written in languages other than English.

However, anecdotal evidence for successful second or foreign language learning is easy to find, leading to a discrepancy between these cases and the failure of many language education programs. This tends to make the research of second-language acquisition emotionally charged. Older methods and approaches such as the grammar translation method and the direct method may be dismissed and even ridiculed, as newer methods and approaches are invented and promoted as solutions to the problem of the high failure rates of foreign language students.

Some books on language teaching describe various methods that have been used in the past and end with the author&#x27;s new method. These methods may reflect the author&#x27;s views, and such presentations may de-emphasize relations between old and new methods. For example, descriptive linguists seem to claim that there were no scientifically-based language teaching methods before their work (which led to the audio-lingual method developed for the U.S. Army in World War II). However, there is significant evidence to the contrary.
Authors may also state that older methods were completely ineffective or have died out, though in reality, even the oldest methods are still in use (e.g., the Berlitz version of the direct method). Proponents of new methods have been so sure that their ideas are so new and so correct that they could not conceive that the older ones have enough validity to cause controversy. This was in turn caused by emphasis on new scientific advances, which has tended to blind researchers to precedents in older work.

There have been two major branches in the field of language learning, the empirical and the theoretical. These have critically separate histories, with each gaining prominence at one time or another. The rivalry between the two camps is intense, with little communication or cooperation between them.

Examples of scholars on the empiricist side include Jesperson, Palmer, and Leonard Bloomfield, who promoted mimicry and memorization with pattern drills. These methods follow from the basic empiricist position that language acquisition results from habits formed by conditioning and repetition. In its most extreme form, language learning is seen as like any learning in any species, human language being essentially the same as communication behaviors seen in other species. Examples of scholars on the theoretical side include Francois Gouin, M.D. Berlitz, and Emile B. De Sauzé, whose rationalist theories of language acquisition dovetail with linguistic work done by Noam Chomsky and others. These theories led to a wider variety of teaching methods, ranging from the grammar-translation method and Gouin&#x27;s &quot;series method&quot; to the direct methods of Berlitz and De Sauzé. Using these methods, students generate original and meaningful sentences to gain a functional knowledge of the rules of grammar. These methods follow from the rationalist position that man is born to think, that language use is a uniquely human characteristic, and that it reflects an innately specified universal grammar. An associated idea that relates to language education is the fact that human languages share many traits. Another is the fact that language learners can create sentences that they have not heard before, and that these &#x27;new&#x27; sentences can still be immediately understood by anyone who understands the specific language being produced. 

===21st century===
Over time, language education has developed in schools and has become a part of the education curriculum around the world. In some countries, such as the United States, language education (also referred to as World Languages) has become a core subject along with main subjects such as English, Maths and Science.

In some countries, such as Australia, it is so common nowadays for a foreign language to be taught in schools that the subject of language education is referred to as LOTE or Language Other Than English. In most English-speaking education centers, French, Spanish, and German are the most popular languages to study and learn. English as a Second Language (ESL) is also available for students whose first language is not English and they are unable to speak it to the required standard.

==Teaching foreign language in classrooms==

Language education may take place as a general school subject or in a specialized language school. There are many methods of teaching languages. Some have fallen into relative obscurity and others are widely used; still others have a small following, but offer useful insights.

While sometimes used interchangeably, the terms &quot;approach&quot;, &quot;method&quot; and &quot;technique&quot; are hierarchical concepts.

An approach is a set of assumptions about the nature of language and language learning. It does not involve procedure or provide any details about how such assumptions should be implemented in the classroom setting. Such can be related to second-language acquisition theory.

There are three principal approaches:
# The structural view emphasizes language as a system of configurationally related elements to code meaning (e.g., grammar).
# The functional view emphasizes language as a way to express or accomplish a certain goal, such as requesting something.
# The interactive view emphasizes language as a way of creating and maintaining social relations, focusing on patterns of moves, acts, negotiation, and interaction found in conversational exchanges. This approach has been fairly dominant since the 1980s.

A method is a plan for presenting the language material to be learned. It should be based on a selected approach. In order for an approach to be translated into a method, an instructional system must be designed considering the objectives of the teaching/learning situation, how the content is to be selected and organized, the types of tasks to be performed, the roles of students, and the roles of teachers.
# Examples of structural methods are grammar translation and the audio-lingual method.
# Examples of functional methods include the oral approach / situational language teaching.
# Examples of interactive methods include the direct method, the series method, communicative language teaching, language immersion, the Silent Way, suggestopedia, the natural approach, tandem language learning, total physical response, Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling and Dogme language teaching.

A technique (or strategy) is a very specific, concrete stratagem or mechanism designed to accomplish an immediate objective. Such are derived from the controlling method, and less directly, from the approach.

==Online and self-study courses==
Hundreds of languages are available for self-study, from scores of publishers, for a range of costs, using a variety of methods. The course itself acts as a teacher and has to choose a methodology, just as classroom teachers do.

===Audio recordings and books===
Audio recordings use native speakers, and one strength is helping learners improve their accent. Some recordings have pauses for the learner to speak. Others are continuous so the learner speaks along with the recorded voice, similar to learning a song.

Audio recordings for self-study use many of the methods used in classroom teaching, and have been produced on records, tapes, CDs, DVDs, and websites.

Most audio recordings teach content words in the target language by using explanations in the learner&#x27;s own language. An alternative is to use sound effects to show meaning of words in the target language. The only language in such recordings is the target language, and they are comprehensible regardless of the learner&#x27;s native language.

Language books have been published for centuries, teaching vocabulary and grammar and relevant cultural information. The simplest books are phrasebooks to give useful short phrases for travelers, cooks, receptionists, or others who need specific vocabulary. More complete books include more vocabulary, grammar, exercises, translation, and writing practice.

Also, various other &quot;language learning tools&quot; have entered the market in recent years.

===Internet and software===
Software can interact with learners in ways that books and audio cannot:

# Some software records the learner, analyzes the pronunciation, and gives feedback.
# Software can present additional exercises in areas where a learner has particular difficulty, until the concepts are mastered.
# Software can pronounce content words in the target language and show their meaning by using pictures instead of oral explanations. The only language in such software is the target language. It is comprehensible regardless of the learner&#x27;s native language.

Websites provide various services geared toward language education. Some sites are designed specifically for learning languages:

# Some software runs on the web itself, with the advantage of avoiding downloads, and the disadvantage of requiring an internet connection.
# Some publishers use the web to distribute audio, texts and software, for use offline. For example, various travel guides, for example Lonely Planet, offer software supporting language education.
# Some websites offer learning activities such as quizzes or puzzles to practice language concepts.
# Language exchange sites connect users with complementary language skills, such as a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn English with a native English speaker who wants to learn Spanish. Language exchange websites essentially treat &quot;knowledge of a language&quot; as a commodity, and provide a marketlike environment for the commodity to be exchanged. Users typically contact each other via chat, VoIP, or email. Language exchanges have also been viewed as a helpful tool to aid language learning at language schools. Language exchanges tend to benefit oral proficiency, fluency, colloquial vocabulary acquisition, and vernacular usage, rather than formal grammar or writing skills. Across Australasia, &#x27;Education Perfect&#x27; – an online learning site- is frequently used as it enables teachers to monitor students&#x27; progress as students gain a &quot;point&quot; for every new word remembered. There is an annual international Education Perfect languages contest held in May.

Many other websites are helpful for learning languages, even though they are designed, maintained, and marketed for other purposes:

# All countries have websites in their own languages, which learners elsewhere can use as primary material for study: news, fiction, videos, songs, etc. In a study done by the Center for Applied Linguistics, it was noted that the use of technology and media has begun to play a heavy role in facilitating language learning in the classroom. With the help of the internet, students are readily exposed to foreign media (music videos, television shows, films) and as a result, teachers are taking heed of the internet&#x27;s influence and are searching for ways to combine this exposure into their classroom teaching.
# Translation sites let learners find the meaning of foreign text or create foreign translations of text from their native language.
# Speech synthesis or text to speech (TTS) sites and software let learners hear pronunciation of arbitrary written text, with pronunciation similar to a native speaker.
# Course development and learning management systems such as Moodle are used by teachers, including language teachers.
# Web conferencing tools can bring remote learners together.
# Players of computer games can practice a target language when interacting in massively multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, commonly English. In 2005, the virtual world Second Life started to be used for foreign language tuition, sometimes with entire businesses being developed. In addition, Spain&#x27;s language and cultural institute Instituto Cervantes has an &quot;island&quot; on Second Life.
Some Internet content is free, often from government and nonprofit sites such as BBC Online, Book2, Foreign Service Institute, with no or minimal ads. Some are ad-supported, such as newspapers and YouTube. Some require a payment.

==Learning strategies for spoken languages==
Language learning strategies have attracted increasing focus as a way of understanding the process of language acquisition.

===Listening as a way to learn===
Clearly listening is used to learn, but not all language learners use it consciously. Listening to understand is one level of listening but focused listening is not something that most learners use as a strategy. Focused listening is a strategy in listening that helps students listen attentively with no distractions. Focused listening is very important when learning a foreign language as the slightest accent on a word can change the meaning completely.

===Reading as a way to learn===
Many people read to understand but the strategy of reading text to learn grammar and discourse styles can also be used. Parallel texts may be used to improve comprehension.

===Speaking as a way to learn===
Alongside listening and reading exercises, practicing conversation skills can also improve language acquisition. Learners can gain experience in speaking foreign languages through in-person language classes, language meet-ups, university language exchange programs, online language learning communities, and traveling to a country where the language is spoken.

===Learning vocabulary===
Translation and rote memorization have been the two strategies that have been used traditionally. There are other strategies that also can be used such as guessing, based on looking for contextual clues, spaced repetition with a use of various apps, games and tools (e.g. Duolingo and Anki). Knowledge about how the brain works can be utilized in creating strategies for how to remember words.

===Esperanto as a propaedeutic language===
Esperanto is a constructed language created in 1887 by L. L. Zamenhof, a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist who wanted to eliminate language barriers in international communication. Esperanto is based on Indo-European languages and has a highly regular grammar and writing system. It has been proposed that learning Esperanto can provide a propaedeutic effect for foreign language study. That is, studying Esperanto for one year and then studying another language afterward may result in greater proficiency in the long run than studying the target language only. However, some of the findings from these studies are compromised by unclear objectives, brief or anecdotal reporting, and a lack of methodological rigor.

==Teaching strategies for spoken languages==

===Blended learning===

Blended learning combines face-to-face teaching with distance education, frequently electronic, either computer-based or web-based. It has been a major growth point in the ELT (English Language Teaching) industry over the last ten years. 

Some people, though, use the phrase &#x27;Blended Learning&#x27; to refer to learning taking place while the focus is on other activities. For example, playing a card game that requires calling for cards may allow blended learning of numbers (1 to 10).

===Skill teaching===
The four basic language skills are listening, speaking, reading, and writing. However, other, more socially-based skills have been identified more recently. Examples include summarizing, describing, and narrating. In addition, more general learning skills such as study skills and knowing one&#x27;s own best learning style have been applied to language classrooms.

In the 1970s and 1980s, these four basic skills were generally taught in isolation in a very rigid order, such as listening before speaking. But since then, it has been recognized that people generally use more than one language skill at a time, leading to more integrated exercises. Speaking is a skill that often is underrepresented in the traditional classroom. This is due to the fact that it is considered harder to teach and test. There are numerous texts on teaching and testing writing but relatively few on speaking.

More recent textbooks stress the importance of students working with other students in pairs and groups, sometimes the entire class. Pair and group work give opportunities for more students to participate more actively. However, supervision of pairs and groups is important to make sure everyone participates as equally as possible. Such activities also provide opportunities for peer teaching, where weaker learners can find support from stronger classmates.

===Sandwich technique===

In foreign language teaching, the sandwich technique is the oral insertion of an idiomatic translation in the mother tongue between an unknown phrase in the learned language and its repetition, in order to convey meaning as rapidly and completely as possible. The mother tongue equivalent can be given almost as an aside, with a slight break in the flow of speech to mark it as an intruder.

When modeling a dialogue sentence for students to repeat, the teacher not only gives an oral mother tongue equivalent for unknown words or phrases, but repeats the foreign language phrase before students imitate it: L2 formula_1 L1 formula_1 L2. For example, a German teacher of English might engage in the following exchange with the students:

: Teacher: &quot;Let me try – lass mich versuchen – let me try.&quot;
: Students: &quot;Let me try.&quot;

===Mother tongue mirroring===

Mother tongue mirroring is the adaptation of the time-honored technique of literal translation or word-for-word translation for pedagogical purposes. The aim is to make foreign constructions salient and transparent to learners while avoiding the technical jargon of grammatical analysis. It differs from literal translation and interlinear text since it takes the progress that learners have made into account and only focuses on a specific structure at a time. As a didactic device, it can only be used to the extent that it remains intelligible to the learner, unless it is combined with a normal idiomatic translation. 

===Back-chaining===

Back-chaining is a technique used in teaching oral language skills, especially with polysyllabic or difficult words. The teacher pronounces the last syllable, the student repeats, and then the teacher continues, working backwards from the end of the word to the beginning.

For example, to teach the name Mussorgsky, a teacher will pronounce the last syllable: &quot;-sky,&quot; and have the student repeat it. Then the teacher will repeat it with &quot;-sorg-&quot; attached before: &quot;-sorg-sky,&quot; and all that remains is the first syllable: &quot;Mus-sorg-sky.&quot;

===Code switching===
Code switching occurs when a language user alternates two or more languages according to different time, places, contents, objects, and other factors. For example, code switching may occur in a multilingual family or in an immigrant family. That is to say, the capability of using code switching, relating to the transformation of phonetics, words, language structure, expression mode, thinking mode, cultural differences and so on, is needed to be guided and developed in the daily communication environment. Most people learn foreign languages in the circumstance filled with the using of their native language so that their ability of code switching cannot be stimulated, and thus the efficiency of foreign language acquisition would decrease. Therefore, as a teaching strategy, code switching is used to help students better gain conceptual competences and to provide rich semantic context for them to understand some specific vocabularies.

==By region==
Practices in language education may vary by region however the underlying understandings which drive it are fundamentally similar. Rote repetition, drilling, memorization and grammar conjugating are used the world over. Sometimes there are different preferences teaching methods by region. Language immersion is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the United States, in Asia or in Australia.

==By different life stage==

===Early childhood education===
Early childhood is a critical time for the mastery of language. Hearing infants know some phonological elements of the languages around them at birth. By six months, infants recognize concrete words for things like food and body parts. By two years, children produce sentences that are grammatically similar to those of adults, including in the types of errors that they make. While young children&#x27;s language is largely acquired naturally by living in a verbal communication environment, they can also benefit from more formal language education.

===Compulsory education===
For many people, compulsory education is when they have access to a second or foreign language for the first time. In this period, the most professional foreign language education and academic atmosphere are provided to the students. They can get help and motivation from teachers and be activated by their peers. One would be able to undergo a lot of specialized learning in order to truly master a great number of rules of vocabulary, grammar and verbal communication.

===Adult education===
Learning a foreign language during adulthood means one is pursuing a higher value of themself by obtaining a new skill. At this stage, individuals have already developed the ability to supervise themself learning a language. However, at the same time, the pressure is also an obstacle for adults.

===Elderly education===
Compared to other life stages, this period is the hardest to learn a new language due to gradual brain deterioration and memory loss. Notwithstanding its difficulty, language education for seniors can slow this brain degeneration and active ageing.

==Language study holidays==

An increasing number of people are now combining holidays with language study in the native country. This enables the student to experience the target culture by meeting local people. Such a holiday often combines formal lessons, cultural excursions, leisure activities, and a homestay, perhaps with time to travel in the country afterwards. Language study holidays are popular across Europe (Malta &amp; UK being the most popular) and Asia due to the ease of transportation and variety of nearby countries. These holidays have become increasingly more popular in Central and South America in such countries as Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru. As a consequence of this increasing popularity, several international language education agencies have flourished in recent years. Though education systems around the world invest enormous sums of money into language teaching the outcomes in terms of getting students to actually speak the language(s) they are learning outside the classroom are often unclear.

With the increasing prevalence of international business transactions, it is now important to have multiple languages at one&#x27;s disposal. This is also evident in businesses outsourcing their departments to Eastern Europe.

==Minority language education==

===Minority language education policy===
The principal policy arguments in favor of promoting minority language education are the need for multilingual workforces, intellectual and cultural benefits and greater inclusion in global information society. Access to education in a minority language is also seen as a human right as granted by the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the UN Human Rights Committee. Bilingual Education has been implemented in many countries including the United States, in order to promote both the use and appreciation of the minority language, as well as the majority language concerned.

===Materials and e-learning for minority language education===
Suitable resources for teaching and learning minority languages can be difficult to find and access, which has led to calls for the increased development of materials for minority language teaching. The internet offers opportunities to access a wider range of texts, audios and videos. Language learning 2.0 (the use of web 2.0 tools for language education) offers opportunities for material development for lesser-taught languages and to bring together geographically dispersed teachers and learners.

<text>The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), originally known as the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP and Explorer 80), was a NASA spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) – the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on 30 June 2001 from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorer program. In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), who had been a member of the mission&#x27;s science team. After nine years of operations, WMAP was switched off in 2010, following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by European Space Agency (ESA) in 2009.

WMAP&#x27;s measurements played a key role in establishing the current Standard Model of Cosmology: the Lambda-CDM model. The WMAP data are very well fit by a universe that is dominated by dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. Other cosmological data are also consistent, and together tightly constrain the Model. In the Lambda-CDM model of the universe, the age of the universe is billion years. The WMAP mission&#x27;s determination of the age of the universe is to better than 1% precision. The current expansion rate of the universe is (see Hubble constant) . The content of the universe currently consists of ordinary baryonic matter; cold dark matter (CDM) that neither emits nor absorbs light; and of dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant that accelerates the expansion of the universe. Less than 1% of the current content of the universe is in neutrinos, but WMAP&#x27;s measurements have found, for the first time in 2008, that the data prefer the existence of a cosmic neutrino background with an effective number of neutrino species of . The contents point to a Euclidean flat geometry, with curvature (formula_1) of . The WMAP measurements also support the cosmic inflation paradigm in several ways, including the flatness measurement.

The mission has won various awards: according to &quot;Science&quot; magazine, the WMAP was the &quot;Breakthrough of the Year for 2003&quot;. This mission&#x27;s results papers were first and second in the &quot;Super Hot Papers in Science Since 2003&quot; list. Of the all-time most referenced papers in physics and astronomy in the INSPIRE-HEP database, only three have been published since 2000, and all three are WMAP publications. Bennett, Lyman A. Page Jr., and David N. Spergel, the latter both of Princeton University, shared the 2010 Shaw Prize in astronomy for their work on WMAP. Bennett and the WMAP science team were awarded the 2012 Gruber Prize in cosmology. The 2018 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics was awarded to Bennett, Gary Hinshaw, Norman Jarosik, Page, Spergel, and the WMAP science team.

In October 2010, the WMAP spacecraft was derelict in a heliocentric graveyard orbit after completing nine years of operations. All WMAP data are released to the public and have been subject to careful scrutiny. The final official data release was the nine-year release in 2012.

Some aspects of the data are statistically unusual for the Standard Model of Cosmology. For example, the largest angular-scale measurement, the quadrupole moment, is somewhat smaller than the Model would predict, but this discrepancy is not highly significant. A large cold spot and other features of the data are more statistically significant, and research continues into these.

== Objectives ==

The WMAP objective was to measure the temperature differences in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The anisotropies then were used to measure the universe&#x27;s geometry, content, and evolution; and to test the Big Bang model, and the cosmic inflation theory. For that, the mission created a full-sky map of the CMB, with a 13 arcminutes resolution via multi-frequency observation. The map required the fewest systematic errors, no correlated pixel noise, and accurate calibration, to ensure angular-scale accuracy greater than its resolution. The map contains 3,145,728 pixels, and uses the HEALPix scheme to pixelize the sphere. The telescope also measured the CMB&#x27;s E-mode polarization, and foreground polarization. Its service life was 27 months; 3 to reach the position, and 2 years of observation.

== Development ==
The MAP mission was proposed to NASA in 1995, selected for definition study in 1996, and approved for development in 1997.

The WMAP was preceded by two missions to observe the CMB; (i) the Soviet RELIKT-1 that reported the upper-limit measurements of CMB anisotropies, and (ii) the U.S. COBE satellite that first reported large-scale CMB fluctuations. The WMAP was 45 times more sensitive, with 33 times the angular resolution of its COBE satellite predecessor. The successor European Planck mission (operational 2009–2013) had a higher resolution and higher sensitivity than WMAP and observed in 9 frequency bands rather than WMAP&#x27;s 5, allowing improved astrophysical foreground models.

== Spacecraft ==

The telescope&#x27;s primary reflecting mirrors are a pair of Gregorian dishes (facing opposite directions), that focus the signal onto a pair of secondary reflecting mirrors. They are shaped for optimal performance: a carbon fibre shell upon a Korex core, thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide. The secondary reflectors transmit the signals to the corrugated feedhorns that sit on a focal plane array box beneath the primary reflectors.

The receivers are polarization-sensitive differential radiometers measuring the difference between two telescope beams. The signal is amplified with High-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) low-noise amplifiers, built by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). There are 20 feeds, 10 in each direction, from which a radiometer collects a signal; the measure is the difference in the sky signal from opposite directions. The directional separation azimuth is 180°; the total angle is 141°. To improve subtraction of foreground signals from our Milky Way galaxy, the WMAP used five discrete radio frequency bands, from 23 GHz to 94 GHz.

The WMAP&#x27;s base is a -diameter solar panel array that keeps the instruments in shadow during CMB observations, (by keeping the craft constantly angled at 22°, relative to the Sun). Upon the array sit a bottom deck (supporting the warm components) and a top deck. The telescope&#x27;s cold components: the focal-plane array and the mirrors, are separated from the warm components with a cylindrical, -long thermal isolation shell atop the deck.

Passive thermal radiators cool the WMAP to approximately ; they are connected to the low-noise amplifiers. The telescope consumes 419 W of power. The available telescope heaters are emergency-survival heaters, and there is a transmitter heater, used to warm them when off. The WMAP spacecraft&#x27;s temperature is monitored with platinum resistance thermometers.

The WMAP&#x27;s calibration is effected with the CMB dipole and measurements of Jupiter; the beam patterns are measured against Jupiter. The telescope&#x27;s data are relayed daily via a 2-GHz transponder providing a 667 kbit/s downlink to a Deep Space Network station. The spacecraft has two transponders, one a redundant backup; they are minimally active – about 40 minutes daily – to minimize radio frequency interference. The telescope&#x27;s position is maintained, in its three axes, with three reaction wheels, gyroscopes, two star trackers and Sun sensors, and is steered with eight hydrazine thrusters.

== Launch, trajectory, and orbit ==
The WMAP spacecraft arrived at the Kennedy Space Center on 20 April 2001. After being tested for two months, it was launched via Delta II 7425 launch vehicle on 30 June 2001. It began operating on its internal power five minutes before its launching, and continued so operating until the solar panel array deployed. The WMAP was activated and monitored while it cooled. On 2 July 2001, it began working, first with in-flight testing (from launching until 17 August 2001), then began constant, formal work. Afterwards, it effected three Earth-Moon phase loops, measuring its sidelobes, then flew by the Moon on 30 July 2001, en route to the Sun-Earth Lagrange point, arriving there on 1 October 2001, becoming the first CMB observation mission posted there.

Locating the spacecraft at Lagrange 2, ( from Earth) thermally stabilizes it and minimizes the contaminating solar, terrestrial, and lunar emissions registered. To view the entire sky, without looking to the Sun, the WMAP traces a path around in a Lissajous orbit ca. 1.0° to 10°, with a 6-month period. The telescope rotates once every 2 minutes 9 seconds (0.464 rpm) and precesses at the rate of 1 revolution per hour. WMAP measured the entire sky every six months, and completed its first, full-sky observation in April 2002.

== Experiment ==
=== Pseudo-Correlation Radiometer ===
The WMAP instrument consists of pseudo-correlation differential radiometers fed by two back-to-back primary Gregorian reflectors. This instrument uses five frequency bands from 22 GHz to 90 GHz to facilitate rejection of foreground signals from our own Galaxy. The WMAP instrument has a 3.5° x 3.5° field of view (FoV).

== Foreground radiation subtraction ==
The WMAP observed in five frequencies, permitting the measurement and subtraction of foreground contamination (from the Milky Way and extra-galactic sources) of the CMB. The main emission mechanisms are synchrotron radiation and free-free emission (dominating the lower frequencies), and astrophysical dust emissions (dominating the higher frequencies). The spectral properties of these emissions contribute different amounts to the five frequencies, thus permitting their identification and subtraction.

Foreground contamination is removed in several ways. First, subtract extant emission maps from the WMAP&#x27;s measurements; second, use the components&#x27; known spectral values to identify them; third, simultaneously fit the position and spectra data of the foreground emission, using extra data sets. Foreground contamination was reduced by using only the full-sky map portions with the least foreground contamination, while masking the remaining map portions.

== Measurements and discoveries ==
=== One-year data release ===
On 11 February 2003, NASA published the first-year&#x27;s worth of WMAP data. The latest calculated age and composition of the early universe were presented. In addition, an image of the early universe, that &quot;contains such stunning detail, that it may be one of the most important scientific results of recent years&quot; was presented. The newly released data surpass previous CMB measurements.

Based upon the Lambda-CDM model, the WMAP team produced cosmological parameters from the WMAP&#x27;s first-year results. Three sets are given below; the first and second sets are WMAP data; the difference is the addition of spectral indices, predictions of some inflationary models. The third data set combines the WMAP constraints with those from other CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), and constraints from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and Lyman alpha forest measurements. There are degenerations among the parameters, the most significant is between formula_2 and formula_3; the errors given are at 68% confidence.

Using the best-fit data and theoretical models, the WMAP team determined the times of important universal events, including the redshift of reionization, ; the redshift of decoupling, (and the universe&#x27;s age at decoupling, ); and the redshift of matter/radiation equality, . They determined the thickness of the surface of last scattering to be in redshift, or . They determined the current density of baryons, , and the ratio of baryons to photons, . The WMAP&#x27;s detection of an early reionization excluded warm dark matter.

The team also examined Milky Way emissions at the WMAP frequencies, producing a 208-point source catalogue. 

=== Three-year data release ===
The three-year WMAP data were released on 17 March 2006. The data included temperature and polarization measurements of the CMB, which provided further confirmation of the standard flat Lambda-CDM model and new evidence in support of inflation.

The 3-year WMAP data alone shows that the universe must have dark matter. Results were computed both only using WMAP data, and also with a mix of parameter constraints from other instruments, including other CMB experiments (Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver (ACBAR), Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) and BOOMERANG), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Supernova Legacy Survey and constraints on the Hubble constant from the Hubble Space Telescope.

[a] Optical depth to reionization improved due to polarization measurements.&lt;br&gt;
[b] &lt;0.30 when combined with SDSS data. No indication of non-gaussianity.

=== Five-year data release ===
The five-year WMAP data were released on 28 February 2008. The data included new evidence for the cosmic neutrino background, evidence that it took over half billion years for the first stars to reionize the universe, and new constraints on cosmic inflation.

The improvement in the results came from both having an extra two years of measurements (the data set runs between midnight on 10 August 2001 to midnight of 9 August 2006), as well as using improved data processing techniques and a better characterization of the instrument, most notably of the beam shapes. They also make use of the 33-GHz observations for estimating cosmological parameters; previously only the 41-GHz and 61-GHz channels had been used.

Improved masks were used to remove foregrounds. Improvements to the spectra were in the 3rd acoustic peak, and the polarization spectra.

The measurements put constraints on the content of the universe at the time that the CMB was emitted; at the time 10% of the universe was made up of neutrinos, 12% of atoms, 15% of photons and 63% dark matter. The contribution of dark energy at the time was negligible. It also constrained the content of the present-day universe; 4.6% atoms, 23% dark matter and 72% dark energy.

The WMAP five-year data was combined with measurements from Type Ia supernova (SNe) and Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).

The elliptical shape of the WMAP skymap is the result of a Mollweide projection.

The data puts limits on the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r &lt;0.22 (95% certainty), which determines the level at which gravitational waves affect the polarization of the CMB, and also puts limits on the amount of primordial non-gaussianity. Improved constraints were put on the redshift of reionization, which is , the redshift of decoupling, (as well as age of universe at decoupling, ) and the redshift of matter/radiation equality, .

The extragalactic source catalogue was expanded to include 390 sources, and variability was detected in the emission from Mars and Saturn.

=== Seven-year data release ===
The seven-year WMAP data were released on 26 January 2010. As part of this release, claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated. Most were shown not to be statistically significant, and likely due to &quot;a posteriori&quot; selection (where one sees a weird deviation, but fails to consider properly how hard one has been looking; a deviation with 1:1000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times). For the deviations that do remain, there are no alternative cosmological ideas (for instance, there seem to be correlations with the ecliptic pole). It seems most likely these are due to other effects, with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues.

The other confirmation of major significance is of the total amount of matter/energy in the universe in the form of dark energy – 72.8% (within 1.6%) as non &#x27;particle&#x27; background, and dark matter – 22.7% (within 1.4%) of non baryonic (sub-atomic) &#x27;particle&#x27; energy. This leaves matter, or baryonic particles (atoms) at only 4.56% (within 0.16%).

=== Nine-year data release ===
On 29 December 2012, the nine-year WMAP data and related images were released. billion-year-old temperature fluctuations and a temperature range of ± 200 microkelvins are shown in the image. In addition, the study found that 95% of the early universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy, the curvature of space is less than 0.4% of &quot;flat&quot; and the universe emerged from the cosmic Dark Ages &quot;about 400 million years&quot; after the Big Bang.


== Main result ==
The main result of the mission is contained in the various oval maps of the CMB temperature differences. These oval images present the temperature distribution derived by the WMAP team from the observations by the telescope during the mission. Measured is the temperature obtained from a Planck&#x27;s law interpretation of the microwave background. The oval map covers the whole sky. The results are a snapshot of the universe around 375,000 years after the Big Bang, which happened about 13.8 billion years ago. The microwave background is very homogeneous in temperature (the relative variations from the mean, which presently is still 2.7 kelvins, are only of the order of ). The temperature variations corresponding to the local directions are presented through different colors (the &quot;red&quot; directions are hotter, the &quot;blue&quot; directions cooler than the average).

== Follow-on missions and future measurements ==
The original timeline for WMAP gave it two years of observations; these were completed by September 2003. Mission extensions were granted in 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008 giving the spacecraft a total of 9 observing years, which ended August 2010 and in October 2010 the spacecraft was moved to a heliocentric &quot;graveyard&quot; orbit.

The Planck spacecraft also measured the CMB from 2009 to 2013 and aims to refine the measurements made by WMAP, both in total intensity and polarization. Various ground- and balloon-based instruments have also made CMB contributions, and others are being constructed to do so. Many are aimed at searching for the B-mode polarization expected from the simplest models of inflation, including The E and B Experiment (EBEX), Spider, BICEP and Keck Array (BICEP2), Keck, QUIET, Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), South Pole Telescope (SPTpol) and others.

On 21 March 2013, the European-led research team behind the Planck spacecraft released the mission&#x27;s all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background. The map suggests the universe is slightly older than previously thought. According to the map, subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the deep sky when the cosmos was about 370,000 years old. The imprint reflects ripples that arose as early, in the existence of the universe, as the first nonillionth (10−30) of a second. Apparently, these ripples gave rise to the present vast cosmic web of galaxy clusters and dark matter. Based on the 2013 data, the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. On 5 February 2015, new data was released by the Planck mission, according to which the age of the universe is 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years and the Hubble constant is 67.74 ± 0.46 (km/s)/Mpc.

<text>In sociology, a friend of a friend is a human contact that exists because of a mutual friend. Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a friend of both A and C. Thus the human relation &quot;friend of a friend&quot; is a compound relation among friends, similar to the uncle and aunt relations of kinship. Though friendship is a reciprocal relation, the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.

==Balance theory==

The tendency of a friend of a friend to become a friend was noted by Fritz Heider, though he also considered the possibility that one of the friendships might breakdown, according to &quot;balance theory&quot;, which his view of human triangles is called. According to Heider, the friend of a friend contact could be stressful enough to undermine one or another of the friendships. Extending the study of social dynamics caused by such friend-of-a-friend tensions to social networks beyond triangles, Dorwin Cartwright and Frank Harary used signed graphs to indicate positive or negative sentiments between persons. In 1963 Anatol Rapoport summarized the theory: &quot;The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will change in such a way that one&#x27;s friends&#x27; friends will tend to become one&#x27;s friends, ...&quot; In September 1975 Dartmouth College offered a symposium on these dynamics.

Bo Anderson made an analysis of the friend-of-a-friend relationship in connection with his criticism of balance theory.
:We have all encountered cases in which somebody has said, &quot;You should meet so-and-so&quot;, only to find that we have little in common with that person, even though he or she was introduced to us by a mutual friend...In &quot;some&quot; friendships the persons value the exclusiveness of their relationship and are therefore not likely to let others into it. Friends differ from acquaintances in that they are not merely slots in a grid of social network relationships, but are valued for their personal, &quot;unique&quot; qualities. Hence, when I relate to a friend of a friend, I need to know something about the perceptions and exchanges that make up this friendship. My reaction to my friend&#x27;s friend (or spouse) may even be &quot;unfavorable&quot;, although I may &quot;also&quot; well understand and sympathize with my friend’s affection for her, given &quot;his&quot; needs, perceptions, interests and so on. 

Considering friendship between people to be a binary relation, the connection to a friend of a friend is a composition of the relationship with itself. Composed relations are used to describe kinship, so it may be natural to apply composition to friendship. One consequence is that frequently a person&#x27;s friends have more friends than him (the friendship paradox), which accents the reach of the compound connection. But the fact that friendship is not automatically a transitive relation produces some social dynamics.

==Other usage==
In some social sciences, the phrase is used as a half-joking shorthand for the fact that much of the information on which people act comes from distant sources (as in &quot;it happened to a friend of a friend of mine&quot;) and cannot be confirmed. It is probably best known from urban legend studies, where it was popularized by Jan Harold Brunvand.

The acronym &quot;FOAF&quot; was coined by Rodney Dale and used in his 1978 book &quot;The Tumour in the Whale: A Collection of Modern Myths&quot;.

==Web ontology language==

In information science, an ontology describes categories, properties and relations between concepts, data and entities. The phrase &quot;Friend Of A Friend&quot;, converted to the acronym FOAF, has been adopted in Web Ontology Language. It has been used in WebID for identifying correspondents, and to designate a secure authentication protocol.

<text>In mathematical logic, the arithmetical hierarchy, arithmetic hierarchy or Kleene–Mostowski hierarchy (after mathematicians Stephen Cole Kleene and Andrzej Mostowski) classifies certain sets based on the complexity of formulas that define them. Any set that receives a classification is called arithmetical. The arithmetical hierarchy was invented independently by Kleene (1943) and Mostowski (1946).

The arithmetical hierarchy is important in computability theory, effective descriptive set theory, and the study of formal theories such as Peano arithmetic.

The Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm provides an easy way to get an upper bound on the classifications assigned to a formula and the set it defines.

The hyperarithmetical hierarchy and the analytical hierarchy extend the arithmetical hierarchy to classify additional formulas and sets.

== The arithmetical hierarchy of formulas ==

The arithmetical hierarchy assigns classifications to the formulas in the language of first-order arithmetic. The classifications are denoted formula_1 and formula_2 for natural numbers &quot;n&quot; (including 0). The Greek letters here are lightface symbols, which indicates that the formulas do not contain 

If a formula formula_3 is logically equivalent to a formula having no unbounded quantifiers, i.e. in which all quantifiers are bounded quantifiers then formula_3 is assigned the classifications formula_5 and formula_6.

The classifications formula_1 and formula_2 are defined inductively for every natural number &quot;n&quot; using the following rules:
*If formula_3 is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula_10, where formula_11 is formula_2, then formula_3 is assigned the classification formula_14.
*If formula_3 is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula_16, where formula_11 is formula_1, then formula_3 is assigned the classification formula_20.

A formula_1 formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some existential quantifiers and alternates formula_22 times between series of existential and universal quantifiers; while a formula_2 formula is equivalent to a formula that begins with some universal quantifiers and alternates analogously.

Because every first-order formula has a prenex normal form, every formula is assigned at least one classification. Because redundant quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is assigned the classification formula_1 or formula_2 it will be assigned the classifications formula_26 and formula_27 for every &quot;m&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. The only relevant classification assigned to a formula is thus the one with the least &quot;n&quot;; all the other classifications can be determined from it.

== The arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers ==

A set &quot;X&quot; of natural numbers is defined by a formula &quot;φ&quot; in the language of Peano arithmetic (the first-order language with symbols &quot;0&quot; for zero, &quot;S&quot; for the successor function, &quot;+&quot; for addition, &quot;×&quot; for multiplication, and &quot;=&quot; for equality), if the elements of &quot;X&quot; are exactly the numbers that satisfy &quot;φ&quot;. That is, for all natural numbers &quot;n&quot;,
:formula_28
where formula_29 is the numeral in the language of arithmetic corresponding to formula_30. A set is definable in first-order arithmetic if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic.

Each set &quot;X&quot; of natural numbers that is definable in first-order arithmetic is assigned classifications of the form formula_1, formula_2, and formula_33, where formula_30 is a natural number, as follows. If &quot;X&quot; is definable by a formula_1 formula then &quot;X&quot; is assigned the classification formula_1. If &quot;X&quot; is definable by a formula_2 formula then &quot;X&quot; is assigned the classification formula_2. If &quot;X&quot; is both formula_1 and formula_2 then formula_41 is assigned the additional classification formula_33.

Note that it rarely makes sense to speak of formula_33 formulas; the first quantifier of a formula is either existential or universal. So a formula_33 set is not necessarily defined by a formula_33 formula in the sense of a formula that is both formula_1 and formula_2; rather, there are both formula_1 and formula_2 formulas that define the set. For example, the set of odd natural numbers formula_30 is definable by either formula_51 or formula_52.

A parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite Cartesian powers of the set of natural numbers. Instead of formulas with one free variable, formulas with &quot;k&quot; free first-order variables are used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on sets of &quot;k&quot;-tuples of natural numbers. These are in fact related by the use of a pairing function.

== Meaning of the notation==

The following meanings can be attached to the notation for the arithmetical hierarchy on formulas.

The subscript formula_30 in the symbols formula_1 and formula_2 indicates the number of alternations of blocks of universal and existential first-order quantifiers that are used in a formula. Moreover, the outermost block is existential in formula_1 formulas and universal in formula_2 formulas.

The superscript formula_58 in the symbols formula_1, formula_2, and formula_33 indicates the type of the objects being quantified over. Type 0 objects are natural numbers, and objects of type formula_62 are functions that map the set of objects of type formula_63 to the natural numbers. Quantification over higher type objects, such as functions from natural numbers to natural numbers, is described by a superscript greater than 0, as in the analytical hierarchy. The superscript 0 indicates quantifiers over numbers, the superscript 1 would indicate quantification over functions from numbers to numbers (type 1 objects), the superscript 2 would correspond to quantification over functions that take a type 1 object and return a number, and so on.

== Examples ==

* The formula_64 sets of numbers are those definable by a formula of the form formula_65 where formula_11 has only bounded quantifiers. These are exactly the recursively enumerable sets.
* The set of natural numbers that are indices for Turing machines that compute total functions is formula_67. Intuitively, an index formula_68 falls into this set if and only if for every formula_69 &quot;there is an formula_70 such that the Turing machine with index formula_68 halts on input formula_69 after formula_70 steps&quot;. A complete proof would show that the property displayed in quotes in the previous sentence is definable in the language of Peano arithmetic by a formula_64 formula.
* Every formula_64 subset of Baire space or Cantor space is an open set in the usual topology on the space. Moreover, for any such set there is a computable enumeration of Gödel numbers of basic open sets whose union is the original set. For this reason, formula_64 sets are sometimes called &quot;effectively open&quot;. Similarly, every formula_77 set is closed and the formula_77 sets are sometimes called &quot;effectively closed&quot;.
* Every arithmetical subset of Cantor space or Baire space is a Borel set. The lightface Borel hierarchy extends the arithmetical hierarchy to include additional Borel sets. For example, every formula_67 subset of Cantor or Baire space is a formula_80 set, that is, a set that equals the intersection of countably many open sets. Moreover, each of these open sets is formula_64 and the list of Gödel numbers of these open sets has a computable enumeration. If formula_82 is a formula_5 formula with a free set variable formula_41 and free number variables formula_85 then the formula_67 set formula_87 is the intersection of the formula_64 sets of the form formula_89 as formula_30 ranges over the set of natural numbers.
* The formula_91 formulas can be checked by going over all cases one by one, which is possible because all their quantifiers are bounded. The time for this is polynomial in their arguments (e.g. polynomial in formula_30 for formula_93); thus their corresponding decision problems are included in E (as formula_30 is exponential in its number of bits). This no longer holds under alternative definitions of formula_91 that allow the use of primitive recursive functions, as now the quantifiers may be bounded by any primitive recursive function of the arguments.
* The formula_91 formulas under an alternative definition, that allows the use of primitive recursive functions with bounded quantifiers, correspond to sets of natural numbers of the form formula_97 for a primitive recursive function formula_98. This is because allowing bounded quantifier adds nothing to the definition: for a primitive recursive formula_98, formula_100 is the same as formula_101, and formula_102 is the same as formula_103; with course-of-values recursion each of these can be defined by a single primitive recursive function.

== Relativized arithmetical hierarchies ==

Just as we can define what it means for a set &quot;X&quot; to be recursive relative to another set &quot;Y&quot; by allowing the computation defining &quot;X&quot; to consult &quot;Y&quot; as an oracle we can extend this notion to the whole arithmetic hierarchy and define what it means for &quot;X&quot; to be formula_1, formula_33 or formula_2 in &quot;Y&quot;, denoted respectively formula_107, formula_108 and formula_109. To do so, fix a set of natural numbers &quot;Y&quot; and add a predicate for membership of &quot;Y&quot; to the language of Peano arithmetic. We then say that &quot;X&quot; is in formula_107 if it is defined by a formula_1 formula in this expanded language. In other words, &quot;X&quot; is formula_107 if it is defined by a formula_113 formula allowed to ask questions about membership of &quot;Y&quot;. Alternatively one can view the formula_107 sets as those sets that can be built starting with sets recursive in &quot;Y&quot; and alternately taking unions and intersections of these sets up to &quot;n&quot; times.

For example, let &quot;Y&quot; be a set of natural numbers. Let &quot;X&quot; be the set of numbers divisible by an element of &quot;Y&quot;. Then &quot;X&quot; is defined by the formula formula_115 so &quot;X&quot; is in formula_116 (actually it is in formula_117 as well, since we could bound both quantifiers by &quot;n&quot;).

== Arithmetic reducibility and degrees ==

Arithmetical reducibility is an intermediate notion between Turing reducibility and hyperarithmetic reducibility.

A set is arithmetical (also arithmetic and arithmetically definable) if it is defined by some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic. Equivalently &quot;X&quot; is arithmetical if &quot;X&quot; is formula_1 or formula_2 for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. A set &quot;X&quot; is arithmetical in a set &quot;Y&quot;, denoted formula_120, if &quot;X&quot; is definable as some formula in the language of Peano arithmetic extended by a predicate for membership of &quot;Y&quot;. Equivalently, &quot;X&quot; is arithmetical in &quot;Y&quot; if &quot;X&quot; is in formula_107 or formula_109 for some natural number &quot;n&quot;. A synonym for formula_120 is: &quot;X&quot; is arithmetically reducible to &quot;Y&quot;.

The relation formula_120 is reflexive and transitive, and thus the relation formula_125 defined by the rule

:formula_126
is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes of this relation are called the arithmetic degrees; they are partially ordered under formula_127.

==The arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor and Baire space==

The Cantor space, denoted formula_128, is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; the Baire space, denoted formula_129 or formula_130, is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. Note that elements of the Cantor space can be identified with sets of natural numbers and elements of the Baire space with functions from natural numbers to natural numbers.

The ordinary axiomatization of second-order arithmetic uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space. A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification formula_1 if it is definable by a formula_1 formula. The set is assigned the classification formula_2 if it is definable by a formula_2 formula. If the set is both formula_1 and formula_2 then it is given the additional classification formula_33. For example, let formula_138 be the set of all infinite binary strings that aren&#x27;t all 0 (or equivalently the set of all non-empty sets of natural numbers). As formula_139 we see that formula_140 is defined by a formula_64 formula and hence is a formula_64 set.

Note that while both the elements of the Cantor space (regarded as sets of natural numbers) and subsets of the Cantor space are classified in arithmetic hierarchies, these are not the same hierarchy. In fact the relationship between the two hierarchies is interesting and non-trivial. For instance the formula_2 elements of the Cantor space are not (in general) the same as the elements formula_41 of the Cantor space so that formula_145 is a formula_2 subset of the Cantor space. However, many interesting results relate the two hierarchies.

There are two ways that a subset of Baire space can be classified in the arithmetical hierarchy.
*A subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from formula_147 to formula_147 to the characteristic function of its graph. A subset of Baire space is given the classification formula_1, formula_2, or formula_33 if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification.
*An equivalent definition of the arithmetical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the arithmetical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the arithmetical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space. This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.

A parallel definition is used to define the arithmetical hierarchy on finite Cartesian powers of Baire space or Cantor space, using formulas with several free variables. The arithmetical hierarchy can be defined on any effective Polish space; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor space and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic.

Note that we can also define the arithmetic hierarchy of subsets of the Cantor and Baire spaces relative to some set of natural numbers. In fact boldface formula_152 is just the union of formula_107 for all sets of natural numbers &quot;Y&quot;. Note that the boldface hierarchy is just the standard hierarchy of Borel sets.

== Extensions and variations==

It is possible to define the arithmetical hierarchy of formulas using a language extended with a function symbol for each primitive recursive function. This variation slightly changes the classification of formula_91, since using primitive recursive functions in first-order Peano arithmetic requires, in general, an unbounded existential quantifier, and thus some sets that are in formula_5 by this definition are strictly in formula_64 by the definition given in the beginning of this article. The class formula_64 and thus all higher classes in the hierarchy remain unaffected.

A more semantic variation of the hierarchy can be defined on all finitary relations on the natural numbers; the following definition is used. Every computable relation is defined to be formula_91. The classifications formula_1 and formula_2 are defined inductively with the following rules.
* If the relation formula_161 is formula_1 then the relation formula_163 is defined to be formula_20
* If the relation formula_161 is formula_2 then the relation formula_167 is defined to be formula_14
This variation slightly changes the classification of some sets. In particular, formula_91, as a class of sets (definable by the relations in the class), is identical to formula_170 as the latter was formerly defined. It can be extended to cover finitary relations on the natural numbers, Baire space, and Cantor space.

== Properties ==

The following properties hold for the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the arithmetical hierarchy of subsets of Cantor or Baire space.

* The collections formula_2 and formula_1 are closed under finite unions and finite intersections of their respective elements.
* A set is formula_1 if and only if its complement is formula_2. A set is formula_33 if and only if the set is both formula_1 and formula_2, in which case its complement will also be formula_33.
* The inclusions formula_179 and formula_180 hold for all formula_30. Thus the hierarchy does not collapse. This is a direct consequence of Post&#x27;s theorem.
* The inclusions formula_182, formula_183 and formula_184 hold for formula_185.
:*For example, for a universal Turing machine &quot;T&quot;, the set of pairs (&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) such that &quot;T&quot; halts on &quot;n&quot; but not on &quot;m&quot;, is in formula_186 (being computable with an oracle to the halting problem) but not in formula_187.
:*formula_188. The inclusion is strict by the definition given in this article, but an identity with formula_170 holds under one of the variations of the definition given above.

== Relation to Turing machines ==
===Computable sets===
If &quot;S&quot; is a Turing computable set, then both &quot;S&quot; and its complement are recursively enumerable (if &quot;T&quot; is a Turing machine giving 1 for inputs in &quot;S&quot; and 0 otherwise, we may build a Turing machine halting only on the former, and another halting only on the latter).

By Post&#x27;s theorem, both &quot;S&quot; and its complement are in formula_64. This means that &quot;S&quot; is both in formula_64 and in formula_77, and hence it is in formula_170.

Similarly, for every set &quot;S&quot; in formula_170, both &quot;S&quot; and its complement are in formula_64 and are therefore (by Post&#x27;s theorem) recursively enumerable by some Turing machines &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2, respectively. For every number &quot;n&quot;, exactly one of these halts. We may therefore construct a Turing machine &quot;T&quot; that alternates between &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2, halting and returning 1 when the former halts or halting and returning 0 when the latter halts. Thus &quot;T&quot; halts on every &quot;n&quot; and returns whether it is in &quot;S&quot;; so &quot;S&quot; is computable.

===Summary of main results===
The Turing computable sets of natural numbers are exactly the sets at level formula_170 of the arithmetical hierarchy. The recursively enumerable sets are exactly the sets at level formula_64.

No oracle machine is capable of solving its own halting problem (a variation of Turing&#x27;s proof applies). The halting problem for a formula_108 oracle in fact sits in formula_199.

Post&#x27;s theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and the Turing degrees. In particular, it establishes the following facts for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1:
* The set formula_200 (the &quot;n&quot;th Turing jump of the empty set) is many-one complete in formula_1.
* The set formula_202 is many-one complete in formula_2.
* The set formula_204 is Turing complete in formula_33.

The polynomial hierarchy is a &quot;feasible resource-bounded&quot; version of the arithmetical hierarchy in which polynomial length bounds are placed on the numbers involved (or, equivalently, polynomial time bounds are placed on the Turing machines involved). It gives a finer classification of some sets of natural numbers that are at level formula_170 of the arithmetical hierarchy.

<text>Roy Rogers (born Leonard Franklin Slye; November 5, 1911 – July 6, 1998), nicknamed the King of the Cowboys, was an American singer, actor, television host, Freemason and rodeo performer.

Following early work under his given name, first as a co-founder of the Sons of the Pioneers and then as an actor, the rebranded Rogers then became one of the most famous and popular Western stars of his era.

He appeared in almost 90 motion pictures, as well as numerous episodes of his self-titled radio program that lasted for nine years. Between 1951 and 1957, he hosted &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot; television series. In many of them, he appeared with his wife, Dale Evans; his Golden Palomino, Trigger; and his German Shepherd, Bullet. Rogers is also best remembered for his signature song &quot;Happy Trails&quot;.

His early roles were uncredited parts in films by fellow singing cowboy Gene Autry. His productions usually featured a sidekick, often either Pat Brady, Andy Devine, George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes, or Smiley Burnette.

Rogers was the only country singer to be inducted twice into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Alongside Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, and Tony Martin, he is the recipient of four stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; the last of which was honored with the band mentioned above.

In his later years, he lent his name to the franchise chain of Roy Rogers Restaurants.

==Early life==
Rogers was born Leonard Franklin Slye, the son of Mattie (née Womack) and Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Slye in Cincinnati, Ohio. The family lived in a tenement on 2nd Street, where Riverfront Stadium was later constructed. (Rogers later joked that he was born at second base.) Len had three sisters: Kathleen, Mary, and Cleda. Dissatisfied with his job and city life, Andy and his brother Will built a houseboat from salvage lumber, and in July 1912 the Slye family traveled up the Ohio River towards Portsmouth. Desiring a more stable existence in Portsmouth, they purchased land on which they planned to build a house, but instead the Great Flood of 1913 enabled them to move the houseboat onto their property and continue living in it on dry land.
In 1919, the Slye family purchased a farm in Duck Run, near Lucasville, Ohio, about north of Portsmouth, and built a six-room house. Andy soon realized that the farm alone would not provide sufficient income for his family, so he took a job at a Portsmouth shoe factory, living in Portsmouth during the week and returning home on weekends, bearing gifts following paydays. A notable gift was a horse on which young Len learned the basics of horsemanship. Living on the farm with no radio, the family made their own entertainment. On Saturday nights, they often invited neighbors over for square dances, during which Len would sing, play mandolin, and call the square dances. He also learned to yodel during this time, and with his mother they would use different yodels to communicate with each other across distances on the farm.

Len attended high school in McDermott, Ohio, but after he completed his second year there, his family returned to Cincinnati, where his father worked at another shoe factory. Realizing that his family needed his financial help, Len quit school and joined his father at the factory. He tried to attend night school, but after being ridiculed for falling asleep in class, he quit school and never returned.

By 1929, after his older sister Mary and her husband had moved to Lawndale, California, Len and his father quit their factory jobs, packed up their 1923 Dodge, and drove the family to California to visit Mary. They stayed for four months before returning to Ohio. Soon after returning, Len had the opportunity to travel again to California with Mary&#x27;s father-in-law, and the rest of the family followed in the spring of 1930. The Slye family rented a small house near Mary, and Len and his father found employment driving gravel trucks for a highway construction project.

In spring 1931, after the construction company went bankrupt, Len traveled to Tulare, California, where he found work picking peaches for Del Monte. During this time, he lived in a labor camp similar to those depicted in John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. The economic hardship of the Great Depression was just as severe in California as it was in Ohio.

==Career==
===Music career===
After 19-year-old Len&#x27;s return to Lawndale, his sister Mary suggested that he audition for the &quot;Midnight Frolic&quot; radio program, which was broadcast over KMCS in Inglewood. A few nights later, wearing a Western shirt that Mary had made for him, he overcame his shyness and appeared on the program playing guitar, singing, and yodeling. A few days later, he was asked to join a local country music group, the Rocky Mountaineers. He accepted the group&#x27;s offer and became a member in August 1931.

By September 1931, Len hired the Canadian-born Bob Nolan, who answered the group&#x27;s classified ad in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; that read, &quot;Yodeler for old-time act, to travel. Tenor preferred.&quot; Nolan stayed with the group only a short time, but Len and he stayed in touch. Nolan was replaced by Tim Spencer.

In the spring of 1932, Len, Spencer, and another singer, Slumber Nichols, left the Rocky Mountaineers to form a trio, which soon failed. Throughout that year, Len and Spencer moved through a series of short-lived groups, including the International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. When Spencer left the O-Bar-O Cowboys to take a break from music, Len joined Jack LeFevre and His Texas Outlaws, who were a popular act on a local Los Angeles radio station.

In early 1933, Len, Nolan, and Spencer formed the Pioneers Trio, with Slye on guitar, Nolan on string bass, and Spencer as lead vocalist. They rehearsed for weeks refining their vocal harmonies. During this time, Len continued to work with his radio singing group, while Spencer and Nolan began writing songs for the trio. In early 1934, the fiddle player Hugh Farr joined the group, adding a bass voice to their vocal arrangements. Later that year, the Pioneers Trio became the Sons of the Pioneers when a radio station announcer changed their name because he felt they were too young to be pioneers. The name was received well and fit the group, which was no longer a trio.

By summer 1934, the popularity and fame of the Sons of the Pioneers extended beyond the Los Angeles area and quickly spread across the country through short syndicated radio segments that were later rebroadcast across the United States. The Sons of the Pioneers signed a recording contract with the newly founded Decca label and made their first commercial recording on August 8, 1934. One of the first songs recorded during that first session was &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, written by Bob Nolan. Over the next two years, the Sons of the Pioneers recorded 32 songs for Decca, including the classic &quot;Cool Water&quot;.

===Film career===

From his first film appearance in 1935, Len worked steadily in Western films, including a large supporting role as a singing cowboy while still billed as Leonard Slye in a Gene Autry movie. In 1938, Autry demanded more money for his work, so there was a competition for a new singing cowboy (whom they could pay less). Many singers sought the job, including Willie Phelps of the Phelps brothers, who appeared in early Western movies. Len ended up winning the contest and was given the stage name Roy Rogers by Republic Pictures, suggesting the western-sounding name Roy and combining it with the surname of the popular western comic entertainer Will Rogers.

He was assigned the leading role in &quot;Under Western Stars&quot;. He became a matinee idol, a competitor with Autry as the nation&#x27;s favorite singing cowboy. In addition to his own movies, he played a supporting role in the John Wayne classic &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940), which also featured one of his future sidekicks, George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes. He became a major box-office attraction. Unlike other stars, the vast majority of his leading roles allowed him to play a character with his own name, in the manner of Autry.

In the &quot;Motion Picture Herald&quot; Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Rogers was listed for 16 consecutive years, from 1939 to 1954, holding first place from 1943 to 1954 until the poll ceased. He appeared in the similar &quot;BoxOffice&quot; poll from 1938 to 1955, holding first place from 1943 to 1952. In the final three years of that poll, he was second only to Randolph Scott. These two polls are only an indication of the popularity of series stars, but Rogers also appeared in the Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll of all films in 1945 and 1946.

Rogers was an idol for many children through his films and television shows. Most of his postwar films were in Trucolor during an era when almost all other B westerns were black and white. Some of his movies would segue into animal adventures, in which his horse, Trigger, would go off on his own for a while with the camera following him.

With money from Rogers&#x27;s films and from his public appearances going to Republic Pictures, he brought a clause into his 1940 contract with the studio where he would have the right to his likeness, voice, and name for merchandising. There were Roy Rogers action figures, cowboy adventure novels, and playsets, as well as a comic strip, a long-lived Dell Comics comic book series (&quot;Roy Rogers Comics&quot;) written by Gaylord Du Bois, and a variety of marketing successes. Rogers was second only to Walt Disney in the number of items featuring his name.

The Sons of the Pioneers continued their popularity and have not stopped performing from the time Rogers started the group, replacing members as they retired or died (all original members are dead). Although he was no longer an active member, they often appeared as his backup group in films, radio, and television, and he would occasionally appear with them in performances up until his death.

He met Dale Evans in 1944 when they were cast in a film together. They were well known as advocates for adoption and as founders and operators of children&#x27;s charities. They adopted several children. Both were outspoken Christians throughout their marriage. Beginning in 1949, they were part of the Hollywood Christian Group, founded by their friend, Louis Evans Jr., the organizing pastor of Bel Air Church. The group met in Henrietta Mears&#x27;s home and later in the home of Evans and Colleen Townsend, after their marriage. Billy Graham and Jane Russell were also part of this group. In 1956, the Hollywood Christian Group became Bel Air Church.

In Apple Valley, California, where they later made their home, streets, highways, and civic buildings have been named after them in recognition of their efforts on behalf of homeless and handicapped children. Rogers was also an active Freemason and a Shriner and was noted for his support of their charities.

Rogers and Evans&#x27; famous theme song, &quot;Happy Trails&quot;, was written by Evans; they sang it as a duet to sign off their television show. In fall 1962, they cohosted a comedy-Western-variety program, &quot;The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show&quot;, aired on ABC. It was cancelled after three months, losing in the ratings to &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; on CBS. Rogers also made numerous cameo appearances on other popular television shows, starring as himself or other cowboy-type characters, such as in an episode of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; called &quot;The Bushwackers&quot;.

Rogers owned a Hollywood production company, which produced his own series. It also filmed other undertakings, including the 1955–1956 CBS Western series &quot;Brave Eagle&quot;, starring Keith Larsen as a young, peaceful Cheyenne chief, Kim Winona as Morning Star, his romantic interest, and the Hopi Indian Anthony Numkena as Keena, Brave Eagle&#x27;s foster son.

In 1968, Rogers licensed his name to the Marriott Corporation, which converted its Hot Shoppes restaurants into Roy Rogers Restaurants, with which he otherwise had no involvement.

Rogers returned to Lubbock in 1970 to headline the Texas Tech University Intercollegiate Rodeo with Evans. In 1975, his last motion picture, &quot;Macintosh and T.J.&quot; was filmed at the 6666 Ranch in King County, 90 miles east of Lubbock and near the O-
Bar-O Ranch in Kent County.

==Personal life==

In 1932, a palomino colt foaled in California was named &quot;Golden Cloud&quot;; when Rogers acquired him, he renamed him Trigger. Rogers also owned a thoroughbred racehorse named Triggairo, that won 13 career races, including the 1975 El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita Park.

Rogers had been on tour with the O-Bar-O Cowboys in June 1933, and while they were performing in Roswell, New Mexico, a caller to a radio station, Grace Arline Wilkins, promised Rogers that she would bake him a pie if he sang &quot;The Swiss Yodel&quot;. They were married in Roswell on June 11, 1936, having corresponded since their first meeting. In 1941, the couple adopted a daughter, Cheryl Darlene. Two years later, Grace gave birth to daughter Linda Lou. A son, Roy Jr. (&quot;Dusty&quot;), was born in 1946; Grace died of complications from the birth a few days later, on November 3.

Rogers met Dale Evans in 1944, when they were cast in a film together. They fell in love soon after Grace&#x27;s death, and Rogers proposed to her during a rodeo at Chicago Stadium. They married on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1947 at the Flying L Ranch in Davis, Oklahoma, where they had filmed &quot;Home in Oklahoma&quot; a few months earlier. Together they had a child and adopted four more: Robin Elizabeth, who had Down syndrome and died of complications of mumps shortly before her second birthday; three adopted daughters, Mimi, Dodie, and Debbie; and one adopted son, Sandy. Evans wrote about the loss of their daughter Robin in her book &quot;Angel Unaware&quot;. Rogers and Evans remained married until his death.

In 1955, Rogers and Evans purchased a 168-acre (68 ha) ranch near Chatsworth, California, complete with a hilltop ranch house, expanding it to 300 acres (121 ha).

After their daughter Debbie was killed in a church bus accident in 1964, they moved to the 67-acre (27 ha) Double R Bar Ranch in Apple Valley, California.

Rogers was a Freemason and a member of Hollywood (California) Lodge No. 355, the Scottish Rite Valley of Los Angeles, and Al Malaikah Shrine Temple. He was awarded the honorary 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite in 1975.

He was also a pilot and the owner of a Cessna Bobcat.

Rogers supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

===Death===
Rogers died of congestive heart failure on July 6, 1998, aged 86, in Apple Valley, California. He was buried at Sunset Hills Memorial Park in Apple Valley, as was his wife Dale Evans three years later.

==Honors and awards==

On February 8, 1960, Rogers was honored with three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: for Motion Pictures at 1752 Vine Street, for Television at 1620 Vine Street, and for Radio at 1733 Vine Street. In 1983 he was awarded the Golden Boot Award,
and in 1996 he received the Golden Boot Founder&#x27;s Award.

In 1967, Rogers, with Choctaw blood on his mother&#x27;s side, was named &quot;outstanding Indian citizen of the year&quot; by a group of Western tribes.

In 1976, Rogers and Evans were inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and in 1995 he was inducted again as a founding member of the Sons of the Pioneers.

Rogers received recognition from the State of Arkansas, appointed by the governor of that state with an Arkansas Traveler certificate.

Rogers was also twice elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame, first as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers in 1980, and again as a soloist in 1988. In 2018, he was inducted to the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum. As of August 2022, he was the only person elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame twice. In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him and Dale Evans.

Rogers&#x27;s cultural influence is reflected in numerous songs, including &quot;If I Had a Boat&quot; by Lyle Lovett, &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; by Elton John on his 1973 album &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, and &quot;Should&#x27;ve Been a Cowboy&quot; by Toby Keith. Rogers himself makes an appearance in the music video for the song &quot;Heroes and Friends&quot; by Randy Travis. Rogers is referenced in numerous films, including &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988) in which the Bruce Willis character John McClane used the pseudonym &quot;Roy&quot; and remarks, &quot;I was always kinda partial to Roy Rogers actually.&quot; In the television series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, the character Roger uses &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; as a pseudonym in the episode &quot;Roy Rogers McFreely&quot;. In the movie &quot;City Slickers&quot;, the Jack Palance character Curly sings the song &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot; while the Billy Crystal character Mitch is playing the harmonica.

<doc id="186480" wikidata="Q684974" url="?curid=186480" title="Gilbert &amp; George">
<text>Gilbert Prousch, sometimes referred to as Gilbert Proesch (born 17 September 1943), and George Passmore (born 8 January 1942) are artists who work together as the collaborative art duo Gilbert &amp; George. They are known for their formal appearance and manner in performance art, and for their brightly coloured graphic-style photo-based artworks. In 2017 the pair celebrated their 50th anniversary as collaborators. In April 2023 Gilbert &amp; George opened the Gilbert &amp; George Centre in Heneage Street, London E1, to showcase their work in regular exhibitions.

==Early lives==
Gilbert Prousch was born in San Martin de Tor in Alto Adige South Tyrol, northern Italy, his native language being Ladin. He studied art at the Sëlva School of Art in Val Gardena and Hallein School of Art in Austria and the Akademie der Kunst, Munich, before moving to England.

George Passmore was born in Plymouth in the United Kingdom, to a single mother in a low-income household. He dropped out of regular school by the time he was fifteen years old and studied art at Dartington College of Arts and then Oxford School of Art.

The two first met on 25 September 1967 while studying sculpture at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art. The two claim they came together because George was the only person who could understand Gilbert&#x27;s rather poor English. In a 2002 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, they said of their meeting: &quot;it was love at first sight&quot;. They married in 2008. They are often seen together on walks through East London.

Since 1968, Gilbert &amp; George have been residents of Fournier Street, Spitalfields, East London. They live in an 18th-century house that has been restored to its original decor. Their entire body of work has been created in, and focused on, London&#x27;s East End, which they see as a microcosm. According to George, &quot;Nothing happens in the world that doesn&#x27;t happen in the East End.&quot;

==Work==
Gilbert and George claim that their approach to art has always been anti-elitist. Adopting the slogan &#x27;Art for All&#x27;, they aimed to be relevant beyond the narrow confines of the art world. Although they work in a variety of media, they have always referred to all of their works as &quot;sculpture&quot;.

Between 1970 and 1974 they made drawings (referred to as &#x27;Charcoal on Paper Sculptures&#x27;) and paintings to give a more tangible form to their identity as &#x27;living sculptures&#x27;.

One of their first notable works of art was a photographic self-portrait of them wearing their trademark suits. &quot;George the Cunt and Gilbert the Shit&quot; was so titled to forestall criticism.

===Singing and living sculptures===
Whilst still students, Gilbert &amp; George made &quot;The Singing Sculpture&quot;, which was performed at the National Jazz and Blues Festival in 1969 and at the Nigel Greenwood Gallery in 1970. For this performance they covered their heads and hands in multi-coloured metalised powders, stood on a table, and sang along and moved to a recording of Flanagan and Allen&#x27;s song &quot;Underneath the Arches&quot;, sometimes for a day at a time. The suits they wore for this became a uniform for them. They rarely appear in public without wearing them.

It is also unusual for one of the pair to be seen without the other. The pair regard themselves as &quot;living sculptures&quot;. They refuse to dissociate their art from their everyday lives, insisting that everything they do is art. They were listed as among the fifty best-dressed over-50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013.

===&quot;The Pictures&quot;===

The pair are known for their large scale photo works, known as &quot;The Pictures&quot;. The early work in this style is in black and white, later with hand-painted red and yellow touches. They proceeded to use a range of bolder colours, sometimes backlit, and overlaid with black grids. Their work has addressed a wide variety of subject matter including religion and patriotism. The two artists also often appear in their own &quot;pictures&quot;. They have described their &quot;pictures&quot; as a sort of &quot;visual love letter from us to the viewer&quot;.

In 1986, Gilbert &amp; George were criticised for a series of pictures seemingly glamourising &#x27;rough types&#x27; of London&#x27;s East End such as skinheads, while a picture of an Asian man bore the title &quot;Paki&quot;. Some of their work has attracted media attention because of the inclusion of (potentially) shocking imagery, such as nudity, depictions of sexual acts, and bodily fluids (faeces, urine and semen). The titles of these works, such as &quot;Naked Shit Pictures&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sonofagod Pictures&quot; (2005), also contributed to the attention.

The pair starred in a Documentary series in 1997 for LWT. It went on to win the BAFTA Award for the best documentary series. A book, &quot;The Complete Pictures, 1971–2005&quot;, published in 2007 by Tate Modern, includes over a thousand examples of their art.

In May 2007, Gilbert &amp; George were the subject of the BBC documentary &quot;Imagine&quot;, presented by Alan Yentob. At the end of the programme a picture entitled &#x27;Planed&#x27; was made available as a free file download from the BBC and &quot;The Guardian&quot; websites for 48 hours. People who downloaded the files could then print and assemble the piece, and thus own an original Gilbert and George picture for free.

===&quot;Jack Freak Pictures&quot;===
&quot;Jack Freak Pictures&quot; is, to date, the largest series of work created by Gilbert &amp; George. According to Michael Bracewell &quot;the &quot;Jack Freak Pictures&quot; are among the most iconic, philosophically astute and visually violent works that Gilbert &amp; George have ever created.&quot; The Union Jack and Gilbert &amp; George are the two dominant pictorial images – appearing contorted, abstracted, and sometimes complete. The entire series is set in the East End of London indicated by flags, maps, street signs, graffiti and other less obvious motifs such as brickwork and foliage that can be found there.

After showing at White Cube&#x27;s Hoxton and Mason Yard galleries in 2009 the exhibition travelled to the Croatian Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb; The Kröller-Müller Museum, the Netherlands; Centro de Arte Contemporaneo de Malaga, Spain; Arndt &amp; Partner gallery, Berlin; the Baronian Francey Gallery, Brussels; and the Bozar Center for Fine Arts, Brussels.

===Later work===
During lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilbert &amp; George started an online video diary, posting weekly updates on life in their newly limited circumstances. The bulletins, often short films, were a continuation of their usual creative habit of documenting social change.

==Awards and honours==
Gilbert &amp; George have received acclaim with extensive solo exhibitions in the UK, USA, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Russia and China; numerous Honorary Doctorates from academic institutions including Plymouth University; and awards such as the Special International Award, the South Bank Award and the Lorenzo il Magnifico Award. In 1986 they won the Turner Prize which is widely considered to be the UK&#x27;s most prestigious contemporary art award. In 2005 they represented the UK at the Venice Biennale.

In 2017, Gilbert &amp; George were elected to the Royal Academy of Arts; in 2020, however, they resigned from the academy in reaction to a decision not to go ahead with an exhibition they had been planning to stage in its galleries.

Notable honours include:
*1981 – won the &quot;Regione Lazio Award&quot; (Torino)
*1986 – won the &quot;Turner Prize&quot;
*1989 – won the &quot;Special International Award&quot; (Los Angeles)
*2005 – represented the UK at the Venice Biennale
*2007 – their retrospective at Tate Modern was the largest of any of the artists who have had retrospectives there
*2007 – won the &quot;South Bank Award&quot;, as well as the &quot;Lorenzo il Magnifico Award&quot; (Florence).
*December 2008 – awarded Honorary Doctorates by London Metropolitan University.
*October 2010 – awarded the honorary title &quot;Magister Artium Gandensis&quot; by University College Ghent
*November 2010 – conferred with Honorary Doctorates by the University of East London
*March 2012 – conferred with Honorary Doctorates by the Open University
*2013 – awarded Honorary Doctorates of Arts by Plymouth University
*2017 – elected as Royal Academicians by the Royal Academy of Arts in London, resigned in 2020

==Political stance==
Gilbert &amp; George claim to be an oddity in the artistic world because of their openly conservative political views and their praise for Margaret Thatcher. George claims never to have been anti-establishment: &quot;You&#x27;re not allowed to be Conservative in the art world, of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Left equals good. Art equals Left. Pop stars and artists are meant to be so original. So how come everyone has the same opinion? ... We admire Margaret Thatcher greatly. She did a lot for art. Socialism wants everyone to be equal. We want to be different.&quot; Both are supportive of Brexit and the Conservative Party. The duo are monarchists and have said of the King, at the time Prince of Wales: &quot;We&#x27;re also fond of the Prince of Wales: he&#x27;s a gentleman.&quot; In a &quot;Guardian&quot; interview, they said that they opposed the removal of statues after the George Floyd protests, saying that &quot;they&#x27;re part of the city&quot; and that their removal is &quot;shameful&quot;.

==Influence and legacy==
Gilbert &amp; George inspired two characters, Man Green and Man Yellow, Chief Constables of the Science Gestapo, in Grant Morrison&#x27;s comicbook series &quot;The Filth&quot;. The two characters appear in pastiches of Gilbert &amp; George&#x27;s artwork, with the separate sections of the imagery acting as individual comic book panels. The look that electronic music band Kraftwerk adopted between 1974 and 1978, with men in suits wearing ties, was partly inspired by Gilbert &amp; George: musicians Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter had seen an exhibition of the artists in Düsseldorf in 1970 and were inspired by the idea of &quot;bringing art into everyday life&quot;. Vic Reeves has explained to &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot; was initially thought of as &quot;performance art, like Gilbert and George&#x27;s singing sculpture&quot;. David Bowie was a collector of the artists&#x27; work.

On 1 April 2023, the Gilbert &amp; George Centre was inaugurated on Heneage Street (near Aldgate East station). It features 3 gallery spaces in a building redesigned in 2017 by SIRS Architects with sustainability in mind. When speaking to Tabish Khan, writing for Artsy, a spokesperson for the centre stated: “After the deaths of Gilbert &amp; George, it is intended that the properties in Fournier Street occupied by them, which contain their archives will become a place of scholarship and research into the art of Gilbert &amp; George&quot;.

<doc id="186485" wikidata="Q3078759" url="?curid=186485" title="Heterotrich">
<text>The heterotrichs are a class of ciliates. They typically have a prominent adoral zone of membranelles circling the mouth, used in locomotion and feeding, and shorter cilia on the rest of the body. Many species are highly contractile, and are typically compressed or conical in form. These include some of the largest protozoa, such as &quot;Stentor&quot; and &quot;Spirostomum&quot;, as well as many brightly pigmented forms, such as certain &quot;Blepharisma&quot;.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;heterotrich&quot; derives from the ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;another, different&quot;, and , (), meaning &#x27;hair&#x27;, because of the contrast between the regular somatic ciliation and that of the oral zone.

==Ultrastructure==
A number of ultrastructural details characterize the group. The cilia on the body are in dikinetids, in which either the anterior one or both kinetosomes may be ciliated, and which are associated with fibers composed of overlapping postciliary microtubules, called &quot;postciliodesmata&quot; and found only in this group and the closely related Karyorelictea. A series of oral polykinetids, each containing two or three rows of kinetosomes, support the membranelles. These run from the left to the anterior of the mouth, and often spiral out of the oral cavity. The macronucleus is divided by external microtubules, whereas in the Karyorelictea it forms by differentiation of micronuclei, and in all other ciliates it is divided by internal microtubules.

== Pigmentation ==
Many species are highly pigmented, e.g. the blue &quot;Stentor coeruleus&quot;. In &quot;Blepharisma&quot;, the red pigment is associated with light sensitivity. Species of blue-pigmented &quot;Eufolliculina&quot; form extensive mats in the deep sea that have been called &quot;blue mats&quot;.

==Systematics==

Early classification schemes by Otto Bütschli, Alfred Kahl, Emmanuel Fauré-Fremiet, and John O. Corliss classified the heterotrichs as a subgroup of spirotrichs. They included groups such as Armophorida, Odontostomatida, Licnophorida, Clevelandellida, and Plagiotomida within the Heterotrichea. However, more recent classification systems, which have incorporated information from molecular phylogenetics, place the above groups within the Intramacronucleata, because they are not closely related to the &quot;core&quot; heterotrichs at all. Almost all of the &quot;true&quot; heterotrichs belong to a single order, Heterotrichida.

In the classification scheme of Lynn (2008), the order Heterotrichida contains the following nine families:
* Blepharismidae Jankowski in Small &amp; Lynn, 1985
* Chattonidiidae Villeneuve-Brachon 1940
* Climacostomidae Repak, 1972
* Condylostomatidae Kahl in Doflein &amp; Reichenow, 1929
* Folliculinidae Dons, 1914
* Maristentoridae Miao, Simpson, Fu &amp; Lobban 2005
* Peritromidae Stein, 1867
* Spirostomidae Stein, 1867
* Stentoridae Carus, 1863
Two new families were established in 2014 on the basis of molecular phylogenies:
* Gruberiidae
* Fabreidae

<text>The plagiopylids are a small order of ciliates, including a few forms common in anaerobic habitats.

The body cilia are dense, and arise from monokinetids with an entirely unique ultrastructure; one or two rows of dikinetids run into the oral cavity, which takes the form of a groove, with a deep tube lined by oral cilia leading to the mouth. The order was introduced by Eugen Small and Denis Lynn in 1985, who treated it as a subclass of Oligohymenophorea. Since then they tend to be treated as an independent class, possibly affiliated with the Colpodea. Class Plagiopylea is divided into two clades: one contains members of the order Plagiopylida (like &quot;Plagiopyla frontata&quot; and &quot;Trimyema compressum&quot;) and the second clade contains plagiopylean ciliate associated with denitrifying obligate endosymbiont &quot;Candidatus&quot; Azoamicus ciliaticola.

<text>The Nassophorea are a class of ciliates. Members are free-living, usually in freshwater but also in marine and soil environments. The mouth is anterior ventral and leads to a curved cytopharynx supported by a prominent palisade of rods or &quot;nematodesmata&quot;, forming a structure called a &quot;cyrtos&quot; or &quot;nasse&quot;, typical of this and a few other classes. When present, extrusomes take the form of fibrous trichocysts. Cilia are usually monokinetids, but vary from order to order.

The Synhymeniida and Nassulida have mostly uniform cilia arising from monokinetids. Among the former, and a few members of the latter, there is a series of small polykinetids running from below the mouth to the left side of the body and sometimes almost circling the cell, called a &quot;frange&quot; or &quot;synhymenium&quot;. Other forms only have three oral membranelles, sometimes extending out of the oral cavity, with or without a paroral membrane. These are usually medium in size, sometimes larger, and cylinder shaped.

The Microthoracida typically have three or more oral membranelles, with at least a vestige of the paroral membrane occurring during cell division. The body cilia are sparse, and often arise from dikinetids, with cirrus-like polykinetids occurring in the marine genus &quot;Discotricha&quot;. These are usually small and ellipsoid or crescent shaped, with the right side of the body curved outward, and generally have a rigid pellicle.

As first defined by Eugene Small and Denis Lynn in 1981, the Nassophorea also included the peniculids and, in a separate subclass, the hypotrichs. More recent schemes restore these to their earlier positions, leaving this group a relatively small collection of less well-known forms.

<text>The Oligohymenophorea are a large class of ciliates. There is typically a ventral groove containing the mouth and distinct oral cilia, separate from those of the body. These include a paroral membrane to the right of the mouth and membranelles, usually three in number, to its left. The cytopharynx is inconspicuous and never forms the complex cyrtos found in similar classes. Body cilia generally arise from monokinetids, with dikinetids occurring in limited distribution over part of the body.

== Characteristics ==
In most groups the body cilia are uniform and often dense, while the oral cilia are inconspicuous and sometimes reduced, but among the peritrichs almost the opposite is the case. Members are widely distributed, and include many free-living (typically fresh-water, but many marine) and symbiotic forms. Most are microphagous, grazing on smaller organisms swept into the mouth by the cilia, but various other feeding habits occur. In one group, the astomes, the mouth and associated structures have been lost altogether.

The Oligohymenophorea were first proposed in 1974 as one of three classes of ciliates, together with the Polyhymenophorea or spirotrichs and the now abandoned Kinetofragmophora. Since then the apostomes have been added, but otherwise its composition has remained relatively constant, with the main variations being the positions of the peniculids and plagiopylids.

<text>A supply chain is a complex logistics system that consists of facilities that convert raw materials into finished products and distribute them to end consumers or end customers. Meanwhile, supply chain management deals with the flow of goods in distribution channels within the supply chain in the most efficient manner.

In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Suppliers in a supply chain are often ranked by &quot;tier&quot;, with first-tier suppliers supplying directly to the client, second-tier suppliers supplying to the first tier, and so on.

The phrase &quot;supply chain&quot; may have been first published in a 1905 article in &quot;The Independent&quot; which briefly mentions the difficulty of &quot;keeping a supply chain with India unbroken&quot; during the British expedition to Tibet.

==Overview==
A typical supply chain can be divided into two stages namely, production and distribution stages. In the production stage, components and semi-finished parts are produced in manufacturing centres. The components are then put together in an assembly plant. The distribution stage consists of central and regional distribution centres that transport products to end-consumers. Mentzer &quot;et al.&quot; suggest that at least three entities are required for there to be a &quot;supply chain&quot;.

At the end of the supply chain, materials and finished products only flow there because of the customer behaviour at the end of the chain; academics Alan Harrison and Janet Godsell argue that &quot;supply chain processes should be coordinated in order to focus on end customer buying behaviour&quot;, and look for &quot;customer responsiveness&quot; as an indicator confirming that materials are able to flow &quot;through a sequence of supply chain processes in order to meet end customer buying behaviour&quot;.

Many of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain take place between varied companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate in providing product and service offerings has been called the &quot;extended enterprise&quot;, and the use of the term &quot;chain&quot; and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticized as &quot;harder to relate to the way supply networks really operate. A chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network.

As part of their efforts to demonstrate ethical practices, many large companies and global brands are integrating codes of conduct and guidelines into their corporate cultures and management systems. Through these, corporations are making demands on their suppliers (facilities, farms, subcontracted services such as cleaning, canteen, security etc.) and verifying, through social audits, that they are complying with the required standard. A lack of transparency in the supply chain can bar consumers from knowledge of where their purchases originated and facilitate socially irresponsible practices. In 2018, the Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s Supply and Value Chain Center found in a survey that 53% of supply chain professionals considered ethics to be &quot;extremely&quot; important to their organization.

In some cases, the operation of multiple tiers within a supply chain may give rise to additional costs, due the &quot;profit layering&quot;, where each tier&#x27;s operators add a profit margin to their costs. For example, in 2015 the UK&#x27;s Ministry of Justice recognised that its lift maintenance and refurbishment contracts were let to a main contractor who then sub-contracted the work to a specialist lift contractor. The ministry avoided the cost impact of this arrangement by contracting for lift work directly with the specialist contractors.

==Typologies==
Marshall L. Fisher (1997) asks the question in a key article, &quot;Which is the right supply chain for your product?&quot; Fisher, and also Naylor, Naim and Berry (1999), identify two matching characteristics of supply chain strategy: a combination of &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot;, or a combination of &quot;responsive&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; (Harrison and Godsell).

Mentzer &quot;et al.&quot; distinguish between &quot;direct supply chains&quot;, &quot;extended supply chains&quot;, and &quot;ultimate supply chains&quot;; in their usage:
*a &quot;direct&quot; supply chain involves a company, a supplier and a customer
*an &quot;extended&quot; supply chain includes suppliers of the immediate supplier and customers of the immediate customer
*an &quot;ultimate&quot; supply chain includes all of the organizations involved in the supply of the product or service.
In each case, the flow of information and finances is part of the chain as well as the product or service. Fazel Zarandi &quot;et al.&quot; add &quot;buyer-seller relations&quot; (at each stage), in addition to the flow of information, as the third main component of a supply chain. Mentzer &quot;et al.&quot; remind readers also that the focus of a supply chain is on the product or service in its end state: they refer to &quot;the supply chain for candy&quot; and &quot;the supply chain for clothing&quot;. Individual supply chain actors may be positioned at different points in different supply chains: a bank, for example, may play a supporting role in certain supply chains, but acts as either the customer or the nearest supplier to the customer in the supply chain for security printing.

Brown &quot;et al.&quot; refer to supply chains as either &quot;loosely coupled&quot; or &quot;tightly coupled&quot;: These ideas refer to two polar models of collaboration: tightly coupled, or &quot;hard-wired&quot;, also known as &quot;linked&quot;, collaboration represents a close relationship between a buyer and supplier within the chain, whereas a loosely-coupled link relates to low interdependency between buyer and seller and therefore greater flexibility. The Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply&#x27;s professional guidance suggests that the aim of a tightly coupled relationship is to reduce inventory and avoid stock-outs.

==Modeling and mapping==
 There are a variety of supply-chain models, which address both the upstream and downstream elements of supply-chain management (SCM). The SCOR (Supply-Chain Operations Reference) model, developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit Supply Chain Council (now part of APICS) became the cross-industry &quot;de facto&quot; standard defining the scope of supply-chain management. SCOR measures total supply-chain performance. It is a process reference model for supply-chain management, extending &quot;from the supplier&#x27;s supplier to the customer&#x27;s customer&quot;. It includes delivery and order fulfillment performance, production flexibility, warranty and returns processing costs, inventory and asset turns, and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain.

A supply chain can often be split into different segments: the earlier stages of a supply chain, such as raw material processing and manufacturing, determine their break-even point by considering production costs relative to market price. The later stages of a supply chain, such as wholesale and retail determine their break-even point by considering transaction costs, relative to market price. Additionally, there are financial costs associated with all the stages of a supply chain model.

The Global Supply Chain Forum has introduced an alternative supply chain model. This framework is built on eight key business processes that are both cross-functional and cross-firm in nature. Each process is managed by a cross-functional team including representatives from logistics, production, purchasing, finance, marketing, and research and development. While each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers, the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain.

The American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC) Process Classification Framework (PCF) SM is a high-level, industry-neutral enterprise process model that allows organizations to see their business processes from a cross-industry viewpoint. The PCF was developed by APQC and its member organizations as an open standard to facilitate improvement through process management and benchmarking, regardless of industry, size, or geography. The PCF organizes operating and management processes into 12 enterprise-level categories, including process groups, and over 1,000 processes and associated activities.

In the developing country public health setting, John Snow, Inc. has developed the JSI Framework for Integrated Supply Chain Management in Public Health, which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains.

Similarly, supply chain mapping involves documenting information regarding all participants in an organization&#x27;s supply chain and assembling the information as a global map of the organization&#x27;s supply network.

==Management==
In the 1980s, the term supply-chain management (SCM) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes, from end user through original suppliers. Original suppliers are those that provide products, services, and information that add value for customers and other stakeholders. The basic idea behind SCM is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market demand, distribution capacity and production capabilities. Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, is credited with the term&#x27;s invention after using it in an interview for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 1982. The term was used earlier by Alizamir et al. in 1981, and Burns and Sivazlian in 1978.

If all relevant information is accessible to any relevant company, every company in the supply chain has the ability to help optimize the entire supply chain rather than to sub-optimize based on local optimization. This will lead to better-planned overall production and distribution, which can cut costs and give a more attractive final product, leading to better sales and better overall results for the companies involved. This is one form of vertical integration. Yet, it has been shown that the motives for and performance efficacy of vertical integration differ by global region.

Incorporating SCM successfully leads to a new kind of competition on the global market, where competition is no longer of the company-versus-company form but rather takes on a supply-chain-versus-supply-chain form.
The primary objective of SCM is to fulfill customer demands through the most efficient use of resources, including distribution capacity, inventory, and labor. In theory, a supply chain seeks to match demand with supply and do so with minimal inventory. Various aspects of optimizing the supply chain include liaising with suppliers to eliminate bottlenecks; sourcing strategically to strike a balance between lowest material cost and transportation, implementing just-in-time techniques to optimize manufacturing flow; maintaining the right mix and location of factories and warehouses to serve customer markets; and using location allocation, vehicle routing analysis, dynamic programming, and traditional logistics optimization to maximize the efficiency of distribution.

The term &quot;logistics&quot; applies to activities within one company or organization involving product distribution, whereas &quot;supply chain&quot; additionally encompasses manufacturing and procurement, and therefore has a much broader focus as it involves multiple enterprises (including suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers) working together to meet a customer need for a product or service. However, John Mills &quot;et al&quot;. note that &quot;early research&quot; on supply chains focused on internal supply relationships within a company.

Starting in the 1990s, several companies chose to outsource the logistics aspect of supply-chain management by partnering with a third-party logistics provider (3PL). Companies also outsource production to contract manufacturers. Technology companies have risen to meet the demand to help manage these complex systems. Cloud-based SCM technologies are at the forefront of next-generation supply chains due to their impact on optimization of time, resources, and inventory visibility. Cloud technologies facilitate work being processed offline from a mobile app which solves the common issue of inventory residing in areas with no online coverage or connectivity.
==Performance==
Supply chain managers are under constant scrutiny to secure the best pricing for their resources, which becomes a difficult task when faced with the inherent lack of transparency. Cost benchmarking helps to identify competitive pricing within the industry but benchmarking across a range of supply chain performance factors has been recommended as best practice. The SCOR model contains more than 150 key indicators which measure the performance of supply chain operations: see also Supply chain operations reference#Performance measurements. Debra Hofman has noted that &quot;measuring supply chain performance is not a new practice. Most companies today measure at least some aspect of their supply chain and understand the need for a more comprehensive measurement program.&quot; However, the abundance of options for potential performance metrics to use is seen as a challenge for supply chain managers. One approach is to relate multiple measures in a hierarchical structure so that interdependencies and the contribution of multiple indicators to the &quot;key&quot; or most significant metrics can be more easily seen. Hofman suggests that the three key indicators of a well-functioning supply chain are:
*Demand forecast accuracy: referring to the difference (if any) between forecasted demand and actual demand. The ability of a supply chain to respond to customer demand is the most significant factor and functions as a predictor of successful delivery throughout the chain
*Perfect order fulfillment: orders which are complete, accurate, on time and in perfect condition
*Supply chain cost, combining all sourcing, production, distribution and customer service costs.

A Cranfield University boardroom survey in 2010 found evidence that many organizations recognized the importance of the supply chain contribution to their business success, with a focus on cost, customer lead-time and customer quality being the primary performance indicators.

==Resilience==
Supply chain resilience is &quot;the capacity of a supply chain to persist, adapt, or transform in the face of change&quot;. For a long time, the interpretation of resilience in the sense of engineering resilience (or robustness) prevailed in supply chain management, leading to the notion of &quot;persistence&quot;. A popular implementation of this idea is given by measuring the &quot;time-to-survive&quot; and the &quot;time-to-recover&quot; of the supply chain, allowing identification of weak points in the system. More recently, the interpretations of resilience in the sense of ecological resilience and social–ecological resilience have led to the notions of &quot;adaptation&quot; and &quot;transformation&quot;, respectively. A supply chain is thus interpreted as a social-ecological system which – similar to an ecosystem (e.g. forest) – is able to constantly adapt to external environmental conditions and – through the presence of social actors and their ability to foresight – also to transform itself into a fundamentally new system. This leads to a panarchical interpretation of a supply chain, embedding it into a system of systems, allowing to analyze the interactions of the supply chain with systems that operate at other levels (e.g. society, political economy, planet Earth). For example, these three components of resilience can be identified in relation to the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction, when a ship blocked the canal for several days. Persistence means to &quot;bounce back&quot;; in our example it is about removing the ship as quickly as possible to allow &quot;normal&quot; operations. Adaptation means to accept that the system has reached a &quot;new normal&quot; state and to act accordingly; here, this can be implemented by redirecting ships around the African cape or use alternative modes of transport. Finally, transformation means to question the assumptions of globalization, outsourcing, and linear supply chains and to envision alternatives; in this example this could lead to local and circular supply chains.

Supply chain resilience has been identified as an important business issue. The United Kingdom&#x27;s Confederation of British Industry reported in 2014 that a significant number of businesses had reshored parts of their supply chain to European locations, with many identifying supply chain resilience as &quot;a key factor in their decision to do so&quot;.

==Social responsibility==
Incidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse with more than 1,100 victims have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers (those who supply the main customer directly). They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if the supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully manage social responsibility in supply chains. This incident also highlights the need to improve workers safety standards in organizations. Hoi and Lin (2012) note that corporate social responsibility can influence the enacting of policies that can improve occupational safety and health management in organizations. In fact, international organizations with presence in other nations have a responsibility to ensure that workers are well protected by policies in an organization to avoid safety related incidents.

==Specific industries==
===Food supply chains===

Many agribusinesses and food processors source raw materials from smallholder farmers. This is particularly true in certain sectors, such as coffee, cocoa and sugar. Over the past 20 years, there has been a shift towards more traceable supply chains. Rather than purchasing crops that have passed through several layers of collectors, firms are now sourcing directly from farmers or trusted aggregators. The drivers for this change include concerns about food safety, child labor and environmental sustainability as well as a desire to increase productivity and improve crop quality.

In October 2009, the European Commission issued a &quot;Communication&quot; concerning &quot;a better functioning food supply chain in Europe&quot;, addressing the three sectors of the European economy which comprise the food supply chain: agriculture, food processing industries, and the distribution sectors. An earlier interim report on food prices (published in December 2008) had already raised concerns about the food supply chain. Arising out of the two reports, the Commission established a &quot;European Food Prices Monitoring Tool&quot;, an initiative developed by Eurostat and intended to &quot;increase transparency in the food supply chain&quot;.

In March 2022 the Commission noted &quot;the need for EU agriculture and food supply chains to become more resilient and sustainable&quot;.

===Clothing products===

The supply chain in the fashion industries has some unique properties, as clothing fashion changes several times a year (often seasonally). The supply chain for clothing often requires constant analysis of new fashion trends to manage the quantity needed for various markets. 

==Regulation==
Supply chain security has become particularly important in recent years. As a result, supply chains are often subject to global and local regulations. In the United States, several major regulations emerged in 2010 that have had a lasting impact on how global supply chains operate. These new regulations include the Importer Security Filing (ISF) and additional provisions of the Certified Cargo Screening Program. EU&#x27;s draft supply chain law are due diligence requirements to protect human rights and the environment in the supply chain.
==Trends affecting supply chains==
With the increasing globalization and easier access to different kinds of alternative products in today&#x27;s markets, the contribution of product design to generating demand is more significant than ever. In addition, as supply, and therefore competition, among companies for the limited market demand increases and as pricing and other marketing elements become less distinguishing factors, product design likewise plays a different role by providing attractive features to generate demand. In this context, demand generation is used to define how attractive a product design is in terms of creating demand. In other words, it is the ability of a product&#x27;s design to generate demand by satisfying customer expectations. But product design affects not only demand generation but also manufacturing processes, cost, quality, and lead time. The product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly, including manufacturing, transportation, quality, quantity, production schedule, material selection, production technologies, production policies, regulations, and laws. Broadly, the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain, but the reverse is also true: the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it.

According to an industrial engineering study which looked at a process for &quot;Design for Supply Chain&quot; (DFSC), since the product design imposes multiple requirements on the supply chain, then once a product design is completed, it drives the structure of the supply chain, limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different (and potentially more cost-effective) supply-chain alternatives. Design for Supply Chain is described as

Supply chain consultant Anthony Tarantino has identified a number of best practices affecting the resilience and operation of supply chains, including the formation of multi-disciplinary centres of excellence, hybrid supply chain organizations which optimize the balance between centralization and de-centralization, and more extensive use of both structured and unstructured data.

Big data is increasingly being utilized in supply chain management, especially in the strategic purchasing and supply management sector.

Moore &quot;et al.&quot; note a trend towards strategic supply-base reduction as a mechanism for leading businesses to reduce costs and improve supplier-related performance, and similarly Ogden identifies a company&#x27;s decision-making on the number of suppliers it will engage with for each product or service as an important aspect of the design of a supply chain. Determining the number of suppliers logically precedes an RFP process for determining &quot;which&quot; suppliers will form part of the supply chain. Morgan refers to an &quot;n + 1 rule&quot; example in the business practice of IT component supplier Intel, whereby the maximum number of suppliers required to maintain production levels for each component is determined, and no more than one additional supplier is engaged with for each component.

With the increased complexity and b2b activity associated with economic growth, actors often seek to view supply chain collaboration as a part of the value adding activities in a value chain.

<text>Centipedes (from Neo-Latin , &quot;hundred&quot;, and Latin , &quot;foot&quot;) are predatory arthropods belonging to the class Chilopoda (Ancient Greek , &quot;kheilos&quot;, &quot;lip&quot;, and Neo-Latin suffix , &quot;foot&quot;, describing the forcipules) of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which includes millipedes and other multi-legged animals. Centipedes are elongated segmented (metameric) animals with one pair of legs per body segment. All centipedes are venomous and can inflict painful stings, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendages known as forcipules or toxicognaths, which are actually modified legs instead of fangs. Despite the name, no species of centipede has exactly 100 legs; the number of pairs of legs is an odd number that ranges from 15 pairs to 191 pairs.

Centipedes are predominantly generalist carnivorous, hunting for a variety of prey items that can be overpowered. They have a wide geographical range, which can be found in terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests to deserts. Within these habitats, centipedes require a moist microhabitat because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids, causing them to rapidly lose water. Accordingly, they avoid direct sunlight by staying under cover or by being active at night.

== Description ==

Centipedes have a rounded or flattened head, bearing a pair of antennae at the forward margin. They have a pair of elongated mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The first pair of maxillae form the lower lip, and bear short palps. The first pair of limbs stretch forward from the body over the mouth. These limbs, or forcipules, end in sharp claws and include venom glands that help the animal to kill or paralyze its prey.

Their size ranges from a few millimetres in the smaller lithobiomorphs and geophilomorphs to about in the largest scolopendromorphs.

=== Sensory organs ===

Many species of centipedes lack eyes, but some possess a variable number of ocelli, sometimes clustered together to form true compound eyes. However, these eyes are only capable of discerning light from dark, and provide no true vision. In some species, the first pair of legs can function as sensory organs, similar to antennae; unlike the antennae of most other invertebrates, these point backwards. An unusual clustering of sensory organs found in some centipedes is the organ of Tömösváry. The organs, at the base of the antennae, consist of a disc-like structure and a central pore, with an encircling of sensitive cells. They are likely used for sensing vibrations, and may provide a weak form of hearing.

=== Forcipules ===


Forcipules are unique to centipedes. The forcipules are modifications of the first pair of legs (the maxillipeds), forming a pincer-like appendage, just behind the head. Forcipules are not oral mouthparts, though they are used to subdue prey by injecting venom and gripping the prey animal. Venom glands run through a tube, from inside the head to the tip of each forcipule.

=== Body ===

Behind the head, the body consists of at least fifteen segments. Most of the segments bear a single pair of legs; the s project forward from the first body segment, while the final two segments are small and legless. Each pair of legs is slightly longer than the pair preceding them, ensuring that they do not overlap, which reduces the chance that they will collide and trip the animal. The last pair of legs may be as much as twice the length of the first pair. The final segment bears a telson, and includes the openings of the reproductive organs.

Centipedes mainly use their antennae to seek out their prey. The digestive tract forms a simple tube, with digestive glands attached to the mouthparts. Like insects, centipedes breathe through a tracheal system, typically with a single opening, or spiracle, on each body segment. They excrete waste through a single pair of malpighian tubules.

=== Ultimate legs ===


Just as the first pair of legs are modified into forcipules, the back legs are modified into &quot;ultimate legs&quot;, also called anal legs, caudal legs, and terminal legs. Their use varies between species, but does not include locomotion. The ultimate legs may be elongated and thin, thickened, or pincer-like. They are frequently sexually dimorphic, and may play a role in mating rituals. Because glandular pores occur more frequently on ultimate legs than on the &quot;walking&quot; legs, they may serve a sensory role. They are sometimes used in defensive postures, and some species use them to capture prey, defend themselves against predators, or suspend themselves from objects such as branches, using the legs as pincers. Several species use their ultimate legs upon encountering another centipede, trying to grab the body of the other centipede.

Members of the genus &quot;Alipes&quot; can stridulate their leaf-like ultimate legs to distract or threaten predators. &quot;Rhysida immarginata togoensis&quot; makes a faint creaking sound when it swings its ultimate legs.

=== Distinction from millipedes ===

There are many differences between millipedes and centipedes. Both groups of myriapods have long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, a single pair of antennae, and the presence of postantennal organs. Centipedes have one pair of legs per segment, while millipedes have two. Their heads differ in that millipedes have short, elbowed antennae, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large venom claws.

== Life cycle ==

=== Reproduction ===
Centipede reproduction does not involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take up. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer. A few parthenogenetic species are known. Females provide parental care, both by curling their bodies around eggs and young, and by grooming them, probably to remove fungi and bacteria.

Centipedes are longer-lived than insects; the European &quot;Lithobius forficatus&quot; may live for 5 to 6 years, and the wide-ranging &quot;Scolopendra subspinipes&quot; can live for over 10 years. The combination of a small number of eggs laid, long gestation period, and long time of development to reproduction has led authors to label lithobiomorph centipedes as K-selected.

=== Development ===
Centipedes grow their legs at different points in their development. In the primitive condition, seen in the orders Lithobiomorpha, Scutigeromorpha, and Craterostigmomorpha, development is anamorphic: more segments and pairs of legs are grown between moults. For example, &quot;Scutigera coleoptrata&quot;, the house centipede, hatches with only four pairs of legs and in successive moults has 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 15, 15 and 15 pairs respectively, before becoming a sexually mature adult. Life stages with fewer than 15 pairs of legs are called larval stadia (there are about five stages). After the full complement of legs is achieved, the now postlarval stadia (about five more stages) develop gonopods, sensory pores, more antennal segments, and more ocelli. All mature lithobiomorph centipedes have 15 leg-bearing segments. The Craterostigmomorpha only have one phase of anamorphosis, with embryos having 12 pairs, and adults 15.

The clade Epimorpha, consisting of the orders Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha, is epimorphic, meaning that all pairs of legs are developed in the embryonic stages, and offspring do not develop more legs between moults. This clade contains the longest centipedes. In the Geophilomorpha, the number of thoracic segments usually varies within species, often on a geographical basis, and in most cases, females bear more legs than males. The number of leg-bearing segments varies within each order (usually 21 or 23 in the Scolopendromorpha; from 27 to 191 in the Geophilomorpha), but the total number of pairs is always odd, so there are never exactly 100 legs or 100 pairs, despite the group&#x27;s common name.

Centipede segments are developed in two phases. Firstly, the head gives rise to a fixed but odd number of segments, driven by Hox genes as in all arthropods. Secondly, pairs of segments are added at the tail (posterior) end by the creation of a prepattern unit, a double segment, which is then always divided into two. The repeated creation of these prepattern units is driven by an oscillator clock, implemented with the Notch signalling pathway. The segments are homologous with the legs of other arthropods such as trilobites; it would be sufficient for the Notch clock to run faster, as it does in snakes, to create more legs.

== Ecology ==

=== Diet ===

Centipedes are predominantly generalist predators, which means they are adapted to eat a broad range of prey. Common prey items include lumbricid earthworms, dipteran fly larvae, collembolans, and other centipedes. They are carnivorous; study of gut contents suggests that plant material is an unimportant part of their diets, although they eat vegetable matter when starved during laboratory experiments.

Species of &quot;Scolopendromorph&quot;, noticeably members from the genera &quot;Scolopendra&quot; and &quot;Ethmostigmus&quot;, are able to hunt for substantial prey items, including large invertebrates and sizable vertebrates, which could be larger than the myriapod itself. For instance, &quot;Scolopendra gigantea&quot; (the Amazonian giant centipede) preys on tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, frogs, birds, mice, snakes, and even bats, catching them in midflight. Three species (&quot;Scolopendra cataracta&quot;, &quot;S. paradoxa&quot;, and &quot;S. alcyona&quot;) are amphibious, believed to hunt aquatic or amphibious invertebrates.

=== Predators ===

Many larger animals prey upon centipedes, such as mongooses, mice, salamanders, beetles and some specialist snake species. They form an important item of diet for many species and the staple diet of some such as the African ant &quot;Amblyopone pluto&quot;, which feeds solely on geophilomorph centipedes, and the South African Cape black-headed snake &quot;Aparallactus capensis&quot;.

=== Defences ===
Some Geophilomorph, Lithobiomorph, and Scolopendromorph centipedes produce sticky, toxic secretions to defend themselves. The various secretions ward off or entangle predators. Scolopendromorph secretions contain hydrogen cyanide.
Among Geophilomorphs, the secretions of &quot;Geophilus vittatus&quot; are sticky and odorous, and contain hydrogen cyanide.

The giant desert centipede of Arizona, &quot;Scolopendra polymorpha&quot;, has a black head and tail, and an orange body; this conspicuous pattern may be aposematic, an honest signal of the animal&#x27;s toxicity. Many species raise and splay their ultimate legs and display the spines found on the legs in a defensive threat posture.

=== Habitat and behaviour ===

Because centipedes lack the waxy water-resistant cuticle of other arthropods, they are more susceptible to water loss via evaporation. Thus, centipedes are most commonly found in high-humidity environments to avoid dehydration, and are mostly nocturnal.

Centipedes live in many different habitats including in soil and leaf litter; they are found in environments as varied as tropical rain forests, deserts, and caves. Some geophilomorphs are adapted to littoral habitats, where they feed on barnacles.

=== Threatened species ===
According to the IUCN Red List, there are one vulnerable, six endangered, and three critically endangered species of centipede. For example, the Serpent Island centipede (&quot;Scolopendra abnormis)&quot; is vulnerable, and Turk&#x27;s earth centipede &quot;(Nothogeophilus turki)&quot; and the Seychelles long-legged centipede (&quot;Seychellonema gerlachi)&quot; are both endangered.

==Evolution==

=== Fossil history ===


The fossil record of centipedes extends back to , during the Late Silurian (&quot;Crussolum&quot;), though they are rare throughout the Paleozoic. The Devonian Panther Mountain Formation contains two species of centipede. One is a species of the scutigeromorph &quot;Crussolum&quot;. The other is &quot;Devonobius&quot;, which is included in the extinct group Devonobiomorpha. Another Devonian site, the Rhynie chert, also bears &quot;Crussolum&quot; fossils, and possible scutigeromorph head material. &quot;Rhyniognatha&quot;, which was once thought to be the oldest insect fossil, is also found in the Rhynie Chert. Three species, one scutigeromorph (&quot;Latzelia&quot;) and two scolopendromorphs (&quot;Mazoscolopendra&quot; and the poorly known &quot;Palenarthrus&quot;), have been described from the Mazon Creek fossil beds, which are Carboniferous, 309–307 mya. More species appear in the Mesozoic, including scolopendromorphs and scutigeromorphs in the Cretaceous.

=== External phylogeny ===

The following cladogram shows the position of the Chilopoda within the arthropods as of 2019:

=== Internal phylogeny ===
Within the myriapods, centipedes are believed to be the first of the extant classes to branch from the last common ancestor. The five orders of centipedes are: Craterostigmomorpha, Geophilomorpha, Lithobiomorpha, Scolopendromorpha, and Scutigeromorpha. These orders are united into the clade Chilopoda by the following synapomorphies:

# The first postcephalic appendage is modified to venom claws.
# The embryonic cuticle on second maxilliped has an egg tooth.
# The trochanter–prefemur joint is fixed.
# A spiral ridge occurs on the nucleus of the spermatozoon.

The Chilopoda are then split into two clades: the Notostigmophora including the Scutigeromorpha and the Pleurostigmophora including the other four orders. The following physical and developmental traits can be used to separate members of the Pleurostigmomorpha from Notostigmomorpha:
* The spiracles are located on the sides of the centipede (in Notostigmomorphs, they are located dorsally).
* The spiracles are deep, more complex, and always present in pairs.
* The head is somewhat flatter.
* The centipedes can develop through either anamorphosis or epimorphosis.
It was previously believed that Chilopoda was split into Anamorpha (Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha) and Epimorpha (Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha), based on developmental modes, with the relationship of the Craterostigmomorpha being uncertain. Recent phylogenetic analyses using combined molecular and morphological characters supports the previous phylogeny. The Epimorpha still exist as a monophyletic group within the Pleurostigmophora, but the Anamorpha are paraphyletic, as shown in the cladogram:

=== Evolution of venoms ===

All centipedes are venomous. Over the first 50 million years of the clade&#x27;s evolutionary history, centipede venoms appear to have consisted of a simple cocktail of about four different components, and differentiation into specific venom types appears to have only occurred after the currently recognized five orders had developed. The evolution of the venom includes horizontal gene transfer, involving bacteria, fungi and oomycetes.

== Interaction with humans ==

=== As food ===
As a food item, certain large centipedes are consumed in China, usually skewered and grilled or deep fried. They are often seen in street vendors’ stalls in large cities, including Donghuamen and Wangfujing markets in Beijing.

Large centipedes are steeped in alcohol to make centipede vodka.

=== Hazard ===
Some species of centipedes can be hazardous to humans because of their bite. While a bite to an adult human is usually very painful and may cause severe swelling, chills, fever, and weakness, it is unlikely to be fatal. Bites can be dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger centipedes can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller centipedes are generally incapable of piercing human skin.

Even small centipedes that cannot pierce human skin are considered frightening by some humans due to their dozens of legs moving at the same time and their tendency to dart swiftly out of the darkness towards one&#x27;s feet. A 19th-century Tibetan poet warned his fellow Buddhists, &quot;if you enjoy frightening others, you will be reborn as a centipede.&quot;

<doc id="186497" wikidata="Q736270" url="?curid=186497" title="Mefloquine">
<text>Mefloquine, sold under the brand name Lariam among others, is a medication used to prevent or treat malaria. When used for prevention it is typically started before potential exposure and continued for several weeks after potential exposure. It can be used to treat mild or moderate malaria but is not recommended for severe malaria. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sleep disorders, and a rash. Serious side effects include potentially long-term mental health problems such as depression, hallucinations, and anxiety and neurological side effects such as poor balance, seizures, and ringing in the ears. It is therefore not recommended in people with a history of mental health problems or epilepsy. It appears to be safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
Mefloquine was developed by the United States Army in the 1970s and came into use in the mid-1980s. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==

Mefloquine is used to both prevent and treat certain forms of malaria.

===Malaria prevention===
Mefloquine is useful for the prevention of malaria in all areas except for those where parasites may have resistance to multiple medications, and is one of several anti-malarial medications recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for this purpose. It is also recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for malaria prophylaxis as a first or second-line agent, depending on resistance patterns in the malaria found in the geographic region visited. It is typically taken for one to two weeks before entering an area with malaria. Doxycycline and atovaquone/proguanil provide protection within one to two days and may be better tolerated. If a person becomes ill with malaria despite prophylaxis with mefloquine, the use of halofantrine and quinine for treatment may be ineffective.

===Malaria treatment===
Mefloquine is used as a treatment for chloroquine-sensitive or resistant &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; malaria, and is deemed a reasonable alternative for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; malaria. It is one of several drugs recommended by the United States&#x27; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It is not recommended for severe malaria infections, particularly infections from &quot;P. falciparum&quot;, which should be treated with intravenous antimalarials. Mefloquine does not eliminate parasites in the liver phase of the disease, and people with &quot;P. vivax&quot; malaria should be treated with a second drug that is effective for the liver phase, such as primaquine.

===Resistance to mefloquine===
Resistance to mefloquine is common around the west border in Cambodia and other parts of Southeast Asia. The mechanism of resistance is by increase in &quot;Pfmdr1&quot; copy number.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, and a rash. Severe side effects requiring hospitalization are rare, but include mental health problems such as depression, hallucinations, anxiety and neurological side effects such as poor balance, seizures, and ringing in the ears. Mefloquine is therefore not recommended in people with a history of psychiatric disorders or epilepsy.

===Neurologic and psychiatric===
In 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a boxed warning to the prescription label of mefloquine regarding the potential for neuropsychiatric side effects that may persist even after discontinuing administration of the medication. In 2013 the FDA stated &quot;Neurologic side effects can occur at any time during drug use, and can last for months to years after the drug is stopped or can be permanent.&quot; Neurologic effects include dizziness, loss of balance, seizures, and tinnitus. Psychiatric effects include nightmares, visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, anxiety, depression, unusual behavior, and suicidal ideations.

Central nervous system events requiring hospitalization occur in about one in 10,000 people taking mefloquine for malaria prevention, with milder events (e.g., dizziness, headache, insomnia, and vivid dreams) in up to 25%. When some measure of subjective severity is applied to the rating of adverse events, about 11–17% of travelers are incapacitated to some degree.

===Cardiac===
Mefloquine may cause abnormalities with heart rhythms that are visible on electrocardiograms. Combining mefloquine with other drugs that cause similar effects, such as quinine or quinidine, can increase these effects. Combining mefloquine with halofantrine can cause significant increases in QTc intervals.

==Contraindications==
Mefloquine is contraindicated in those with a previous history of seizures or a recent history of psychiatric disorders.

==Pregnancy and breastfeeding==
Available data suggests that mefloquine is safe and effective for use by pregnant women during all trimesters of pregnancy, and it is widely used for this indication. In pregnant women, mefloquine appears to pose minimal risk to the fetus, and is not associated with increased risk of birth defects or miscarriages. Compared to other malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens, however, mefloqinone may produce more side effects in non-pregnant travelers.

Mefloquine is also safe and effective for use during breastfeeding, though it appears in breast milk in low concentrations. The World Health Organization (WHO) gives approval for the use of mefloquine in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and use in the first trimester does not mandate termination of pregnancy.

==Pharmacology==
===Elimination===
Mefloquine is metabolized primarily through the liver. Its elimination in persons with impaired liver function may be prolonged, resulting in higher plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions. The mean elimination plasma half-life of mefloquine is between two and four weeks. Total clearance is through the liver, and the primary means of excretion is through the bile and feces, as opposed to only 4% to 9% excreted through the urine. During long-term use, the plasma half-life remains unchanged.

Liver function tests should be performed during long-term administration of mefloquine. Alcohol use should be avoided during treatment with mefloquine.

===Chemistry===
Specifically it is used as mefloquine hydrochloride.

Mefloquine is a chiral molecule with two asymmetric carbon centres, which means it has four different stereoisomers. The drug is currently manufactured and sold as a racemate of the (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;S&quot;)- and (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomers by Hoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical company. Essentially, it is two drugs in one. Plasma concentrations of the (–)-enantiomer are significantly higher than those for the (+)-enantiomer, and the pharmacokinetics between the two enantiomers are significantly different. The (+)-enantiomer has a shorter half-life than the (–)-enantiomer.

==History==
Mefloquine was formulated at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the 1970s shortly after the end of the Vietnam war. Mefloquine was number 142,490 of a total of 250,000 antimalarial compounds screened during the study.

Mefloquine was the first Public-Private Venture (PPV) between the US Department of Defense and a pharmaceutical company. WRAIR transferred all its phase I and phase II clinical trial data to Hoffman-LaRoche and Smith Kline. FDA approval as a treatment for malaria was swift. Most notably, phase III safety and tolerability trials were skipped.

The drug was first approved in Switzerland in 1984 by Hoffmann-LaRoche, who brought it to market with the name &quot;Lariam&quot;.

However, mefloquine was not approved by the FDA for prophylactic use until 1989. This approval was based primarily on compliance, while safety and tolerability were overlooked. Because of the drug&#x27;s very long half-life, the Centers for Disease Control originally recommended a mefloquine dosage of 250 mg every two weeks; however, this caused an unacceptably high malaria rate in the Peace Corps volunteers who participated in the approval study, so the drug regimen was switched to once a week.

By 1991, Hoffman was marketing the drug on a worldwide basis.

By the 1992 UNITAF, Canadian soldiers were being prescribed the drug &quot;en masse&quot;.

By 1994, medical professionals were noting &quot;severe psychiatric side effects observed during prophylaxis and treatment with mefloquine&quot;, and recommending that &quot;the absence of contraindications and minor side effects during an initial course of mefloquine should be confirmed before another course is prescribed.&quot; Other doctors at the University Hospital of Zurich noted in a case of &quot;a 47-year-old, previously healthy Japanese tourist&quot; who had severe neuropsychiatric side-effects from the drug that
The first randomized, controlled trial on a mixed population was performed in 2001. Prophylaxis with mefloquine was compared to prophylaxis with atovaquone-proguanil. Roughly 67% of participants in the mefloquine arm reported greater than or equal to one adverse event, versus 71% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm. In the mefloquine arm, 5% of the users reported severe events requiring medical attention, versus 1.2% in the atovaquone-proguanil arm.

In August 2009, Roche stopped marketing Lariam in the United States.

Retired soldier Johnny Mercer, who was later appointed Minister for Veterans Affairs by Boris Johnson, told in 2015 that he had received &quot;a letter about once or twice a week&quot; about ill-effects from the drug. In July 2016, Roche took this brand off the market in Ireland.

===Military===

In 2006, the Australian military deemed mefloquine &quot;a third-line drug&quot; alternative, and over the five years from 2011 only 25 soldiers had been prescribed the drug, and only in cases of their intolerance for other alternatives. Between 2001 and 2012, 16,000 Canadian soldiers sent to Afghanistan were given the drug as a preventative measure. In 2013, the US Army banned mefloquine from use by its special forces such as the Green Berets. In autumn 2016, the UK military followed suit with their Australian peers after a parliamentary inquiry into the matter revealed that it can cause permanent side effects and brain damage.

In early December 2016, the German defence ministry removed mefloquine from the list of medications it would provide to its soldiers.

In autumn 2016, Canadian Surgeon General Brigadier General Hugh Colin MacKay told a parliamentary committee that faulty science supported the assertion that the drug has indelible noxious side effects. An expert from Health Canada named Barbara Raymond told the same committee that the evidence she had read failed to support the conclusion of indelible side effects. Canadian soldiers who took mefloquine when deployed overseas have claimed they have been left with ongoing mental health problems.

In 2020 the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) admitted to a breach of duty regarding the use of Mefloquine. by acknowledging numerous instances of failure to assess the risks and warn of potential side effects of the drug.

==Research==
In June 2010, the first case report appeared of a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy being successfully treated with mefloquine. Mefloquine can also act against the JC virus. Administration of mefloquine seemed to eliminate the virus from the patient&#x27;s body and prevented further neurological deterioration.

Mefloquine alters cholinergic synaptic transmission through both postsynaptic and presynaptic actions. The postsynaptic action to inhibit acetylcholinesterase changes transmission across synapses in the brain.

<text>Revolution OS is a 2001 documentary film that traces the twenty-year history of GNU, Linux, open source, and the free software movement.

Directed by J. T. S. Moore, the film features interviews with prominent hackers and entrepreneurs including Richard Stallman, Michael Tiemann, Linus Torvalds, Larry Augustin, Eric S. Raymond, Bruce Perens, Frank Hecker and Brian Behlendorf.

== Synopsis ==
The film begins with glimpses of Raymond, a Linux IPO, Torvalds, the idea of Open Source, Perens, Stallman, then sets the historical stage in the early days of hackers and computer hobbyists when code was shared freely. It discusses how change came in 1978 as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, in his Open Letter to Hobbyists, pointedly prodded hobbyists to pay up. Stallman relates his struggles with proprietary software vendors at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, leading to his departure to focus on the development of free software, and the GNU Project.

Linus Torvalds Benedict realized in 1991 the Linux kernel, the GNU/linux is the operating system.

Raymond and Stallman clarify the philosophy of free software versus communism and capitalism, as well as the development stages of Linux.

Michael Tiemann discusses meeting Stallman in 1987, getting an early version of Stallman&#x27;s GCC, and founding Cygnus Solutions.

Larry Augustin describes combining GNU software with a normal PC to create a Unix-like workstation at one third the price and twice the power of a Sun workstation. He relates his early dealings with venture capitalists, the eventual capitalization and commodification of Linux for his own company, VA Linux, and its IPO.

Brian Behlendorf, one of the original developers of the Apache HTTP Server, explains that he started to exchange patches for the NCSA web server daemon HTTPd with other developers, which led to the release of &quot;a patchy&quot; web server, dubbed Apache.

Frank Hecker of Netscape discusses the events leading up to Netscape&#x27;s executives releasing the source code for Netscape&#x27;s browser, one of the signal events which made open source a force to be reckoned with by business executives, the mainstream media, and the public at large. This point was validated further after the film&#x27;s release as the Netscape source code eventually became the Firefox web browser, reclaiming a large percentage of market share from Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer.

The film also documents the scope of the first full-scale LinuxWorld Summit conference, with appearances by Linus Torvalds and Larry Augustin on the keynote stage.

Much of the footage for the film was shot in Silicon Valley.

== Screenings ==
The film appeared in several film festivals including South by Southwest, the Atlanta Film and Video Festival, Boston Film Festival, and Denver International Film Festival; it won Best Documentary at both the Savannah Film and Video Festival and the Kudzu Film Festival.

== Reception ==
Every review noted the historical significance of the information, and those that noticed found the production values high, but the presentation of history mainly too dry, even resembling a lecture. Ron Wells of &quot;Film Threat&quot; found the film important, worthwhile, and well thought out for explaining the principles of the free software and open source concepts. Noting its failure to represent on camera any debate with representatives of the proprietary software camp, Wells gave the film 4 of 5 stars. &quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film 3 of 4 stars: &quot;surprisingly exciting&quot;, &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;sharp looking&quot; with a good soundtrack.
&quot;Daily Variety&quot; saw the film as &quot;targeted equally at the techno-illiterate and the savvy-hacker crowd;&quot; educating and patting one group on the head, and canonizing the other, but strong enough for an &quot;enjoyable&quot; recommendation.

On the negative side, &quot;The New York Times&quot; faulted the film&#x27;s one-sidedness, found its reliance on jargon &quot;fairly dense going&quot;, and gave no recommendation. 
&quot;Internet Reviews&quot; found it &quot;a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy. Raging against Microsoft and Sun. . .&quot;, lacking follow-through on Red Hat and VALinux stock (in 2007, at 2% of peak value), with &quot;lots of talking heads&quot;. &quot;Toxicuniverse.com&quot; noted &quot;Revolution OS blatantly serves as infomercial and propaganda. Bearded throwback to the sixties, hacker Richard Stallman serves as the movement&#x27;s spiritual leader while Scandinavian Linus Torvalds acts as its mild mannered chief engineer (as developer of the Linux kernel).&quot;

To Tim Lord, reviewing for &quot;Slashdot&quot;, the film is interesting and worthy of viewing, with some misgivings: it is &quot;about the growth of the free software movement, and its eventual co-option by the open source movement. . . it was supposed to be about Linux and its battle about Microsoft, but the movie is quickly hijacked by its participants.&quot; The film &quot;lacks the staple of documentaries: scenes with multiple people that are later analyzed individually by each of the participants&quot; (or indeed, much back-and-forth at all). Linux itself and its benefits are notably missing, and, &quot;[w]e are never shown anyone using Linux, except for unhappy users at an Installfest.&quot; The debate over Linux VS Windows is missing, showing the origin of the OS only as a response to proprietary and expensive Sun and DEC software and hardware, and its growth solely due to the Apache web server. And Lord notes that the film shows, but does not challenge Torvalds or Stallman about their equally disingenuous remarks about the &quot;Linux&quot; vs &quot;GNU/Linux&quot; naming issue.

<doc id="186502" wikidata="Q300441" url="?curid=186502" title="A History of the English-Speaking Peoples">
<text>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples is a four-volume history of Britain and its former colonies and possessions throughout the world, written by Winston Churchill, covering the period from Caesar&#x27;s invasions of Britain (55 BC) to the end of the Second Boer War (1902). It was started in 1937 and finally published 1956–1958, delayed several times by war and his work on other texts. The volumes have been abridged into a single-volume, concise edition.

==Writing and publishing==
Churchill, who excelled in the study of history as a child and whose mother was an American, had a firm belief in a so-called &quot;special relationship&quot; between the people of Britain and its Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, etc.) united under the Crown, and the people of the United States who had broken with the Crown and gone their own way. His book thus dealt with the resulting two divisions of the &quot;English-speaking peoples&quot;.

At the independent suggestions of British publisher Newman Flower and American editor Maxwell Perkins, Churchill began the history in the 1930s, during the period that his official biographer Martin Gilbert termed the &quot;wilderness years&quot; when he was not in government. Work was interrupted in 1939 when the Second World War broke out and Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and became Prime Minister a year later. After the war ended in 1945, Churchill was busy, first writing his history of that conflict and then as Prime Minister again between 1951 and 1955, so it was not until the mid-1950s, when Churchill was in his early eighties, that he was able to finish his work.

One third of the last volume was devoted to the military minutiae of the American Civil War. Social history, the agricultural revolution, and the Industrial Revolution hardly get a mention. Political opponent Clement Attlee suggested the work should have been titled &quot;Things in history that interested me.&quot;

Despite these criticisms, the books were bestsellers and reviewed favourably on both sides of the Atlantic. In &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, J. H. Plumb wrote: &quot;This history will endure; not only because Sir Winston has written it, but also because of its own inherent virtues — its narrative power, its fine judgment of war and politics, of soldiers and statesmen, and even more because it reflects a tradition of what Englishmen in the hey-day of their empire thought and felt about their country&#x27;s past.&quot;

The four volumes are:

* &quot;The Birth of Britain&quot;
* &quot;The New World&quot;
* &quot;The Age of Revolution&quot;
* &quot;The Great Democracies&quot;

===Related works===
The BBC produced a series of twenty-six fifty-minute plays loosely based around Churchill&#x27;s work and entitled &quot;Churchill&#x27;s People&quot; which were broadcast in 1974 and 1975. However, the quality of the productions was judged to be poor and the series received low ratings.

A sequel to Churchill&#x27;s work, &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900&quot;, by Andrew Roberts, was published in 2006.

<text>The Station nightclub fire occurred on the evening of February 20, 2003, at The Station, a nightclub and hard rock music venue located at 211 Cowesett Avenue in West Warwick, Rhode Island, United States, killing 100 people and injuring 230. During a concert by the rock band Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White, an offshoot of the original Great White band, a pyrotechnic display ignited flammable acoustic foam in the walls and ceilings surrounding the stage. Within six minutes, the entire building was engulfed in flames. The fire remains the deadliest firework accident in U.S. history and the fourth-deadliest nightclub fire in U.S. history. It was also the second-deadliest nightclub fire in New England, behind the 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire.

After the fire, multiple civil and criminal cases were filed. Daniel Biechele, the tour manager for Great White who had ignited the pyrotechnics, pled guilty to 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter in 2006 and was sentenced to fifteen years in prison with four to serve. Biechele was released from prison in 2008 after some families of the victims expressed support for his parole. Jeffrey and Michael Derderian, the owners of the Station, pleaded no contest and avoided a trial: Michael received the same sentence as Biechele and was released from prison in 2009, while Jeffrey received a sentence of 500 hours of community service. Legal action against several parties, including Great White, was resolved with monetary settlements by 2008.

Station Fire Memorial Park, a permanent memorial to the fire victims, was opened in May 2017 at the site where the Station once stood.

==Background==
===The Station===
The Station was a nightclub that was located at 211 Cowesett Avenue at the corner of Kulas Road in West Warwick, Rhode Island. The building that would become The Station was built in 1946 and was originally used as a gin mill.

Before being converted into a nightclub and concert venue, the Station building had been used as a restaurant and tavern. A fire had previously occurred at the building in 1972 while it was used as a restaurant called Julio&#x27;s. No occupants were in the building during the 1972 fire, but the interior was significantly damaged. Another restaurant opened in the building in 1974. In 1985, it was converted to a pub, which closed sometime in the late 1980s, and a nightclub was opened in 1991. The nightclub was purchased by brothers Michael and Jeffrey Derderian in March 2000.

In the months before the fire, the building had been inspected twice by West Warwick fire marshal Denis Larocque. The club was cited for nine minor code violations during the first inspection in November 2002 but was not cited for the flammable polyurethane foam the venue used for soundproofing, which was against code. The follow-up inspection in December 2002 also did not cite the foam, and the inspector gave the building an &quot;All OK&quot; rating on his inspection form. Larocque later told the Rhode Island State Police that he had not spotted the polyurethane foam during the November 2002 inspection because he was upset after finding an illegal inward swinging door that he had previously asked to be removed from the building.

Before the fire, the Station often hosted concerts by 1980s hard rock groups and tribute bands. Local bands that had played at the Station before the fire had used pyrotechnics during their concerts without incident, including a Kiss tribute band that had set off fireballs during their show in August 2002.

===Great White===
For their 2003 tour, the official name of the headlining band of the February 20 concert was billed as Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White, which was an offshoot of the original band Great White and led by lead singer Jack Russell. The original band had risen to fame as part of the glam metal scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were best known for their 1989 cover of Ian Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot;, which reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. At the time of their performance at the Station, there were two of Great White&#x27;s original members in the lineup: lead singer Russell and guitarist Mark Kendall. Kendall, who had co-founded the band with Russell in 1977, had rejoined Russell&#x27;s version of the group in 2002. The rest of the lineup included guitarist Ty Longley, who died in the fire, bass guitarist David Filice, and drummer Eric Powers. Great White&#x27;s popularity had waned in the decade before the Station fire, and this iteration of the band had been performing on a touring circuit of small clubs with capacities of up to 500 people. Although the band was officially known as Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White at the time, and their tour was initially named after Russell&#x27;s 2002 solo album &quot;For You&quot;, they were billed by the Station as simply &quot;Great White&quot; in error.

In February 2003, Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White was on an eighteen-date concert tour. They had been using a pyrotechnic display during their performances, which some club owners had denied them permission to use, citing safety concerns. Dominic Santana, the owner of The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey, told reporters that the band had used pyrotechnics during their February 14, 2003 performance at the venue without his permission, and their contract and rider did not mention pyrotechnics displays. In the aftermath of the fire, the band and the owners of the Station disputed whether the band were allowed to use the pyrotechnic display during their concert.

Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White had two opening acts for the February 20 concert: Trip, a group from Vancouver, Washington, and Fathead, a local Rhode Island band. All the members of Trip escaped the Station without injury, but two members of Fathead, cousins Keith and Steven Mancini, along with Steven’s wife Andrea, died in the fire.

The concert was hosted by Michael Gonsalves, a disc jockey for Providence rock radio station WHJY who was also known as &quot;Doctor Metal&quot;. Gonsalves was the host of the WHJY program &quot;The Metal Zone&quot;, at the time the longest-running heavy metal radio program in the United States.

==Fire==
===Ignition===
Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White started their performance at 11:07 p.m. on February 20. A total of 462 people were in attendance, even though the club&#x27;s maximum licensed capacity was cited as 404.

The fire started shortly after the band began performing their opening song, &quot;Desert Moon&quot;. During the performance, pyrotechnics set off by tour manager Daniel Biechele ignited the flammable acoustic foam on both sides and the top center of the drummer&#x27;s alcove at the back of the stage. The pyrotechnics were gerbs, cylindrical devices that produce a controlled spray of sparks. Biechele used four gerbs that were set to spray sparks in the air for fifteen seconds. Two gerbs were at 45° angles, with the middle two pointing straight up. The flanking gerbs became the principal cause of the fire.

Sparks from the gerbs ignited the insulation foam, and flames were visible on the wall above the stage within nine seconds of their ignition. The flames were initially thought to be part of the act; only as the fire reached the ceiling and smoke began to bank down did people realize it was uncontrolled. Twenty seconds after the pyrotechnics ended, the band stopped playing, and lead singer Jack Russell calmly remarked into the microphone, &quot;Wow... that&#x27;s not good.&quot; Within 40 seconds of the ignition, Great White had stopped playing and left the stage and the venue&#x27;s fire alarm began to sound, but it was not connected to the local fire department. The Station had no sprinkler system installed. Thick smoke began to fill the Station one minute after the ignition, and the crowd began to escape the building. The fire spread throughout the building and completely engulfed it within six minutes of the pyrotechnic ignition.

===Response===
By this time, the nightclub&#x27;s fire alarm had activated, and although there were four possible exits, most people headed for the front door through which they had entered. The ensuing crowd crush in the narrow hallway led to that exit being blocked completely and resulted in numerous deaths and injuries among the patrons and staff. Multiple survivors claimed that two bouncers blocked the stage door as attendees attempted to escape the building, stating the door was only to be used by the band.

The fire was reported to the West Warwick Fire Department by cellular phone calls to 911 within sixty seconds of ignition. A West Warwick police officer who was already at the scene also reported the fire to police dispatch. The first West Warwick fire engine arrived at the scene at 11:13 p.m., followed by three other trucks shortly thereafter. Hundreds of firefighters responded to the fire, including every available West Warwick firefighter. Fire departments in Warwick, Coventry, and Cranston rendered mutual aid to the fire site. The Cowesett Inn restaurant across the street from the Station acted as an ad-hoc burn triage and command center for first responders. A portion of the nightclub roof collapsed at 11:57 p.m., and a second portion in the building&#x27;s sunroom collapsed at 12:07 a.m.. Individuals who needed medical treatment were transported to Kent Hospital, which was filled to maximum capacity due to the fire. By 1:30 a.m. on February 21, all the affected individuals had been transported and the street had been cleared.

===Aftermath and casualties===

Of the 462 people in the building for the concert, 100 were killed, 230 were injured, and 132 escaped uninjured. Ninety-six individuals died at the scene, and four more died in the hospital in the following weeks. Among those who died in the fire were Great White guitarist Ty Longley and the show&#x27;s master of ceremonies WHJY DJ Mike &quot;Dr Metal&quot; Gonsalves.

Four employees of the Station were killed in the fire. In April 2003, the Derderians were fined $1.07 million for failing to carry workers&#x27; compensation insurance for their employees. The fine was not resolved until 2013, ten years after the fire, when a judge upheld it. 

&quot;Providence Phoenix&quot; columnist Ian Donnis wrote of the effect that the fire had on the close-knit Rhode Island community, &quot;The loss of so much life would represent a tragedy anywhere, but it struck especially hard in Rhode Island, the nation&#x27;s smallest state, where no place is more than an hour away by car...&quot; Many of the survivors of the fire developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the event.

===Recording and account===
The fire, from its inception, was caught on videotape by cameraman Brian Butler for WPRI-TV of Providence, and the beginning of that tape was released to national news stations. Butler was there for a planned piece on nightclub safety being reported by Jeffrey A. Derderian, a WPRI news reporter who was also a part-owner of The Station. The report had been inspired by the E2 nightclub stampede in Chicago that killed 21 people three days earlier. Derderian had begun working for WPRI on February 17, three days before the fire. WPRI-TV and Derderian were criticized for the conflict of interest in having a reporter report on his own property. Derderian resigned from WPRI on June 30.

At the scene of the fire, Butler gave this account of the tragedy:

==Investigation==

===NIST report===
A National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation of the fire under the authority of the National Construction Safety Team Act, using computer simulations with FDS and a mockup of the stage area and dance floor, concluded that a fire sprinkler system would have contained the fire long enough to give everyone time to exit safely. The Station, which was built in 1946, was exempt from a sprinkler requirement in the state fire code through a grandfather clause, which stated that buildings constructed before 1976 were not required to have a sprinkler system. The NIST report was released on March 3, 2005, and was made available in two parts on June 30, 2005.

===Grand jury investigation===
An investigation of the fire by a Rhode Island state grand jury was started by then-Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick Lynch on February 26, 2003. On December 9, 2003, the grand jury announced indictments against Station owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian and Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White road manager Daniel M. Biechele. The three were each charged with 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter with criminal negligence and 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter in violation of a misdemeanor. West Warwick fire marshal Denis Larocque was not charged by the grand jury, as Lynch had cited a state law that prevented charges against fire marshals without proof of bad faith. The grand jury also did not return charges against the band&#x27;s lead singer, Jack Russell.

Lynch told &quot;48 Hours&quot; that his investigation found that the fire spread quickly due to the foam the Derderians had installed in the Station&#x27;s walls and ceilings as a response to noise complaints. The lack of usable exits was also a factor, as was the inward door Larocque had found and asked to be removed. Jeffrey Derderian said the door was also installed due to noise, and they had removed it as asked, but sometimes re-installed it if the venue was going to be loud that night, and the band used it to escape the building during the fire. Michael Derderian told &quot;48 Hours&quot; that it was &quot;Undisputable&quot; that the building&#x27;s use of flammable packing foam instead of flame retardant sound foam was the cause of the fire&#x27;s spread, but the brothers claimed that they had ordered sound foam and had received the packing foam instead.

===Other causes===
The foam was sold to the Derderians by American Foam. In 2005, the Rhode Island Attorney General office received a fax from Barry Warner, a former employee of American Foam who lived nearby the Station, who claimed the company had known about the dangers of polyurethane foam but did not warn their employees about it. Although Warner was called to testify to a grand jury, he was not asked about the fax. American Foam refuted the claims in Warner&#x27;s fax. In 2008, American Foam agreed to pay $6.3 million to the families of the victims of the fire.

Victims&#x27; families have also cited overcrowding in the venue as a cause for the casualties during the fire. Larocque had set various capacities for the Station in the years before the fire based on whether pool tables and other items could be moved. The capacity for the Station was either 258 or 404, depending on how the building was being used. The final tally by &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; of people inside the Station during the fire totaled 462.

==Criminal trials==

===Daniel Biechele===

The first criminal trial was against Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White&#x27;s tour manager, Daniel Michael Biechele, 26, from Orlando, Florida. This trial was scheduled to start May 1, 2006, but Biechele, against his lawyers&#x27; advice, pleaded guilty to 100 counts of involuntary manslaughter on February 7, 2006, in what he said was an effort to &quot;bring peace, I want this to be over with.&quot;

====Sentencing and statement====
On May 10, 2006, State Prosecutor Randall White asked that Biechele be sentenced to ten years in prison, the maximum allowed under the plea bargain, citing the massive loss of life in the fire and the need to send a message. Speaking to the public for the first time since the fire, Biechele stated:

Superior Court Judge Francis J. Darigan Jr. sentenced Biechele to fifteen years in prison, with four to serve and eleven years suspended, plus three years&#x27; probation, for his role in the fire. Darigan remarked, &quot;The greatest sentence that can be imposed on you has been imposed on you by yourself.&quot; Biechele was released in March 2008.

The sentence drew mixed reactions in the courtroom. Many families believed the punishment was just; others had hoped for a more severe sentence.

====Support for parole and aftermath====

On September 4, 2007, some families of the fire&#x27;s victims expressed their support for Biechele&#x27;s parole. Leland Hoisington, whose 28-year-old daughter, Abbie, was killed in the fire, told reporters, &quot;I think they should not even bother with a hearing—just let Biechele out... I just don&#x27;t find him as guilty of anything.&quot; The state parole board received approximately twenty letters, the majority of which expressed their sympathy and support for Biechele, some going as far as to describe him as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; with limited responsibility. Parole board chairwoman Lisa Holley told journalists of her surprise at the forgiving attitude of the families, saying, &quot;I think the most overwhelming part of it for me was the depth of forgiveness of many of these families that have sustained such a loss.&quot;

Dave Kane and Joanne O&#x27;Neill, parents of the youngest victim Nicholas O&#x27;Neill, released their letter to the board to reporters. &quot;In the period following this tragedy, it was Mr. Biechele, alone, who stood up and admitted responsibility for his part in this horrible event... He apologized to the families of the victims and made no attempt to mitigate his guilt,&quot; the letter said. Others pointed out that Biechele had sent handwritten letters to the families of each of the 100 victims and that he had a work release position in a local charity.

On September 19, 2007, the Rhode Island Parole Board announced that Biechele would be released in March 2008. Biechele was released from prison on March 19, 2008.

Biechele&#x27;s parole and probation expired in March 2011. , Biechele lived in Florida with his wife and two children.

===Michael and Jeffrey Derderian===
Following Biechele&#x27;s trial, The Station&#x27;s owners, Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, were scheduled to receive separate trials. However, on September 21, 2006, Judge Darigan announced that the brothers had changed their pleas from &quot;not guilty&quot; to &quot;no contest&quot;, thereby avoiding a trial. Michael Derderian received fifteen years in prison, with four to serve and eleven years suspended, plus three years&#x27; probation—the same sentence as Biechele. Jeffrey Derderian received 500 hours of community service.

In a letter to the victims&#x27; families, Judge Darigan wrote that he accepted the deal because he wanted to avoid &quot;Public exposition of the tragic, explicit and horrific events experienced by the victims of this fire, both living and dead.&quot; He added that the difference in the brothers&#x27; sentences reflected their respective involvement with the purchase and installation of the flammable foam. Rhode Island Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch objected strenuously to the plea bargain, saying that both brothers should have received jail time and that Michael Derderian should have received more time than Biechele.

In January 2008, the Parole Board decided to grant Michael Derderian an early release; he was scheduled to be released from prison in September 2009 but was granted his release in June 2009 for good behavior.

==Civil settlements==
As of September 2008, at least $115 million in settlement agreements had been paid, or offered, to the victims or their families by various defendants:
* In September 2008, The Jack Russell Tour Group Inc. offered $1 million in a settlement to survivors and victims&#x27; relatives, the maximum allowed under the band&#x27;s insurance plan.
* Club owners Jeffrey and Michael Derderian reached a settlement of $813,000 with survivors and victims&#x27; families in September 2008.
* The State of Rhode Island and the town of West Warwick agreed to pay $10 million as a settlement.
* Sealed Air Corporation agreed to pay $25 million as a settlement. Victims&#x27; lawyers said that Sealed Air made polyethylene foam that had been installed at the Station in 1996, which produced toxic gas when it burned during the fire.
* In February 2008, Providence television station WPRI-TV and their then-owners LIN TV made an out-of-court settlement of $30 million as a result of the claim that their video journalist Brian Butler was said to be obstructing escape and not sufficiently helping people exit.
* In March 2008, JBL Speakers settled out of court for $815,000. JBL was accused of using flammable foam inside their speakers. The company denied any wrongdoing.
* Anheuser-Busch has offered $5 million. McLaughlin &amp; Moran, Anheuser-Busch&#x27;s distributor, has offered $16 million.
* Home Depot and Polar Industries, Inc. (a Connecticut-based insulation company) made a settlement offer of $5 million.
* Providence radio station WHJY-FM promoted the show, which was emcee&#x27;d by its DJ, Mike &quot;The Doctor&quot; Gonsalves (who was one of the casualties that night). Clear Channel Broadcasting, WHJY&#x27;s parent company, paid a settlement of $22 million in February 2008.
* American Foam Corporation, who sold the insulation to The Station nightclub, agreed in 2008 to pay $6.3 million to settle lawsuits relating to the fire.

In 2021, &quot;48 Hours&quot; described the total civil payments to the victims and families as $176 million.

==Memorials and benefits==

Thousands of mourners attended an interfaith memorial service at St. Gregory the Great Church in Warwick on February 24, 2003, to remember those lost in the fire. Another memorial was later that night the West Warwick Civic Center.

A benefit memorial concert was held in February 2008 at the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center in Providence and featured performances by Tesla, Twisted Sister, Winger, Gretchen Wilson, and John Rich. The event raised at least $25,000 in donations for the Station Family Fund, and was broadcast in March by VH1 and VH1 Classic.

On the twentieth anniversary of the fire on February 20, 2023, Rhode Island governor Dan McKee ordered flags in Rhode Island lowered to half-staff for the day and the Rhode Island State House to be illuminated in memory of the 100 victims.

===Station Fire Memorial Park===
The site of the fire was cleared, and a multitude of crosses were placed as memorials left by loved ones of the deceased. On May 20, 2003, nondenominational services began to be held at the fire site for several months. Access remains open to the public, and memorial services are held each February 20.

A permanent memorial at the site of the fire has been erected and named the Station Fire Memorial Park. In August 2016, the site was reported to have been being used as a PokeStop in &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, to uproar from victims&#x27; families. The stop was removed from the game by developer Niantic later that month.

In June 2003, the Station Fire Memorial Foundation (SFMF) was formed to purchase the property to build and maintain a memorial. In September 2012, the owner of the land, Ray Villanova, donated the site to the SFMF. By April 2016, $1.65 million of the $2 million fundraising goal had been achieved and construction of the Station Fire Memorial Park had commenced. The memorial dedication ceremony took place on May 21, 2017.

==Aftermath==
===Great White, Jack Russell, and Mark Kendall===
Russell considered disbanding Great White after the fire but reconsidered when he decided to embark on a benefit tour. The tour started five months after the fire, and each concert began with a prayer for survivors and families. The band raised $185,000 for the Station Family Fund during the tour. The band initially retired &quot;Desert Moon&quot;, the song they were performing when the fire began, from their concert setlist. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could ever sing that song again,&quot; said Russell. Kendall said in 2005, &quot;We haven&#x27;t played that song. Things that bring back memories of that night we try to stay away from. And that song reminds us of that night. We haven&#x27;t played it since then and probably never will.&quot;

Two years to the day after the fire, band members Russell and Kendall, along with Great White&#x27;s attorney, Ed McPherson, appeared on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot; with three survivors of the fire and the father of Longley, to discuss how their lives had changed since the incident.

Russell left Great White in 2010. In the years following the fire, Great White split into two separate groups, one led by Russell and the other by Kendall. When Russell launched his version of the band in 2012, Kendall&#x27;s group responded that Russell had no right to use the name. After a 2013 legal settlement between the two parties, Kendall&#x27;s band retained the Great White name, while Russell&#x27;s band was allowed to use the name Jack Russell&#x27;s Great White. By 2013, Russell&#x27;s group had resumed playing &quot;Desert Moon&quot;.

Russell performed a benefit show in February 2013 in Hermosa Beach, California, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the fire. Russell planned to donate the proceeds to the Station Fire Memorial Foundation. However, the organization asked to be disassociated from the concert, citing the animosity that many survivors and surviving families still felt. Russell raised about $180 from the concert, but the Memorial Foundation refused the donation, a decision supported by Kendall. In 2013, Kendall told &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; that he maintained amicable contact with some survivors, victims&#x27; families, and the Station Fire Memorial Foundation. Russell&#x27;s relation with some survivors and families had been strained, although he remained close to Longley&#x27;s family.

Neither version of Great White performed in any of the six New England states for over a decade following the fire. Russell&#x27;s group made its first New England appearance in twelve years at a harvest festival in Mechanic Falls, Maine, in August 2015. Kendall&#x27;s version of Great White was to perform at the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, alongside Stryper and Steven Adler on March 25, 2023, but the venue indefinitely postponed the concert on March 2, citing its proximity to the twentieth anniversary of the fire.

Russell died on August 7, 2024.

===Others===
&quot;41&quot;, a documentary about Nicholas O&#x27;Neill, the youngest victim of the fire, was screened at Rhode Island theaters in 2008. &quot;41&quot; and a film based on O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;They Walk Among Us&quot; were aired by Rhode Island PBS in February 2013 in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the fire.

Gonsalves was inducted into the Rhode Island Radio and Television Hall of Fame in 2013.

The Derderian brothers conducted their first television interview about the fire in 2021 for &quot;48 Hours&quot;. Some victims&#x27; families criticized the &quot;48 Hours&quot; segment and the Derderians&#x27; involvement.

===Safety measures===
Following the tragedy, Governor Donald Carcieri declared a moratorium on pyrotechnic displays at venues that hold fewer than 300 people. The Rhode Island state fire code was changed after the fire to require every nightclub in the state with a capacity of more than 150 people to have a sprinkler system installed.

As numerous violations of existing codes contributed to the severity of the fire, there was an immediate effort to strengthen fire code protections. Within weeks, the National Fire Protection Association committee met to regulate code for &quot;assembly occupancies&quot;. Based upon its work, Tentative Interim Amendments (TIAs) were issued for the national standard &quot;Life Safety Code&quot; (NFPA 101) in July 2003. The TIAs required automatic fire sprinklers in all existing nightclubs and similar locations, accommodating more than 100 occupants and all new locations in the same categories. The TIAs also required additional crowd manager personnel, among other things. These TIAs were subsequently incorporated into the 2006 edition of NFPA 101, along with additional exit requirements for new nightclub occupancies. It is left for each state or local jurisdiction to legally enact and enforce the current code changes.

As a result of this and other similar incidents, fire chiefs, fire marshals, and inspectors require trained crowd managers to comply with the International Fire Code, NFPA-101 Life Safety Code, NFPA-1 Fire Code, and many local ordinances that address safety in public assembly occupancies. However, fire professionals have few choices about what training should be provided, and training programs are continually updated to incorporate new technologies and lessons learned from actual fire experiences.

===Legislation===
Inspired by the fire, the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act has been proposed United States Senate and House of Representatives since 2003. The legislation would create a tax incentive for property owners to install fire sprinkler systems. It was last introduced in the House in 2015 by then-U.S. Reps. James Langevin of Rhode Island and Tom Reed of New York.

<doc id="186508" wikidata="Q6501000" url="?curid=186508" title="Chang'an">
<text>Chang&#x27;an (; ) is the traditional name of Xi&#x27;an and was the capital of several Chinese dynasties, ranging from 202 BCE to 907 CE. The site has been inhabited since Neolithic times, during which the Yangshao culture was established in Banpo, in what is now the city&#x27;s suburbs. Furthermore, in the northern vicinity of modern Xi&#x27;an, Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty, China&#x27;s first emperor, held his imperial court and constructed his massive mausoleum guarded by the Terracotta Army.

From its capital at Xianyang, the Qin dynasty ruled a larger area than either of the preceding dynasties. The imperial city of Chang&#x27;an during the Han dynasty was located northwest of today&#x27;s Xi&#x27;an. During the Tang dynasty, the area that came to be known as Chang&#x27;an included the area inside the Ming Xi&#x27;an fortification, plus some small areas to its east and west, and a substantial part of its southern suburbs. Thus, Tang Chang&#x27;an was eight times the size of the Ming Xi&#x27;an, which was reconstructed upon the site of the former imperial quarters of the Sui and Tang city. During its heyday, Chang&#x27;an was one of the largest and most populous cities in the world. Around AD 750, Chang&#x27;an was called a &quot;million-man city&quot; in Chinese records, with modern estimates putting it at around 800,000–1,000,000 within city walls. According to the census in 742 recorded in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, 362,921 families with 1,960,188 persons were counted in Jingzhao Fu (), the metropolitan area including small cities in the vicinity.

==Han period==
The Han capital was located 3 km northwest of modern Xi&#x27;an. As the capital of the Western Han, it was the political, economic and cultural center of China. It was also the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, and a cosmopolitan metropolis. It was a consumer city, a city whose existence was not primarily predicated upon manufacturing and trade, but rather boasted such a large population because of its role as the political and military center of China. By 2 AD, the population was 246,200 in 80,000 households. This population consisted mostly of the scholar gentry class whose education was being sponsored by their wealthy aristocratic families. In addition to these civil servants there was a larger underclass to serve them.

Initially, Emperor Liu Bang decided to build his capital at the area south of Luo River, which according to Chinese geography was in modern Luoyang. This location was the site of the holy city Chengzhou, capital of Eastern Zhou. However, the strategic military value of a capital located in the Wei Valley became the deciding factor for locating the new capital. To this end, it is recorded c 200 BC he forcibly relocated thousands of clans in the military aristocracy to this region. The purpose was twofold. First, it kept all potential rivals close to the new Emperor, and second, it allowed him to redirect their energy toward defending the capital from invasion by the nearby Xiongnu. His adviser Liu Jing described this plan as weakening the root while strengthening the branch.

After the necessary political structure was set up, the area of the capital was divided into three prefectures and construction began. At its founding in 195 BC, the population of Changan was 146,000. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the diplomat Zhang Qian was dispatched westward into Central Asia. Subsequently, Chang&#x27;an city became the Asian gateway to Europe as the point of departure of the Silk Road. On 4 October 23 AD, Chang&#x27;an was captured and sacked during a peasant rebellion. The emperor, Wang Mang was killed and decapitated by the rebels two days later. After the Western Han period, the Eastern Han government settled on Luoyang as the new capital. Chang&#x27;an was therefore also sometimes referred to as the Western Capital or Xijing () in some Han dynasty texts. In 190 AD during late Eastern Han, the court was seized and relocated back to Chang&#x27;an by the notorious Prime Minister Dong Zhuo, as it was a strategically superior site against the mounting insurgency formed against him. After Dong&#x27;s death (192) the capital was moved back to Luoyang in August 196, and to Xuchang in autumn 196. By this time, Chang&#x27;an was already regarded as the symbolic site of supreme power and governance.

===City walls===
The 25.7 km long city wall was initially 3.5 m wide at the base tapering upward 8 m for a top width of 2 m. Beyond this wall, a 6.13 m wide moat with a depth of 4.62 m was spanned by 13.86 m long stone bridges. The wall was later expanded to 12–16 m at base and 12 m high. The moat was expanded to 8 m wide and 3 m deep. The expansion of the wall was likely a solution to flooding from the Wei River. The entire city was sited below the 400 m contour line which the Tang dynasty used to mark the edge of the floodplain.

Twelve gates with three gateways each, according with the ritual formulas of Zhou dynasty urban planning, pierced the wall. These gates were distributed three 
a side and from them eight 45 m wide main avenues extended into the city. These avenues were also divided into three lanes aligned with the three gateways of each gate. The lanes were separated by median strips planted with pine, elm, and scholar trees. Bachengmen Avenue was an exception with a width of 82 m and no medians. Four of the gates opened directly into the palaces.

===City structure===
The overall form of the city was an irregular rectangle. The ideal square of the city had been twisted into the form of the Big Dipper for astrological reasons, and also to follow the bank of the Wei River. The eight avenues divided the city into nine districts. These nine main districts were subdivided into 160 walled 1×1 &quot;li&quot; wards. About 50–100 families lived in each ward. Historically, Chang&#x27;an grew in four phases: the first from 200 to 195 BC when the palaces were built; the second 195–180 BC when the outer city walls were built; the third between 141 and 87 BC with a peak at 100 BC; and the fourth from 1 BC–24 AD when it was destroyed.

The Xuanpingmen gate was the main gate between the city and the suburbs. The district north of the Weiyang Palace was the most exclusive. The main market, called the Nine Markets, was the eastern economic terminus of the Silk Road. Access to the market was from the Northeast and Northwest gates, which were the most heavily used by the common people. The former connect with a bridge over the Wei River to the northern suburbs and the latter connected with the rest of China to the east. An intricate network of underground passages connected the imperial harem with other palaces and the city. These passages were controlled by underground gatehouses and their existence was unknown.

====First phase====
In 200 BC after marking the boundaries of the three prefectures, which comprised the metropolitan region of Xianyang, Liu Bang appointed Xiao He to design and build the new capital. He chose to site the city on ruins of the Qin dynasty Apex Temple (formerly, Xin Palace). This old Qin palace was meant to be the earthly mirror of Polaris, the apex star, where the heavenly emperor resided. This site thus represented the center of the earth lying under the center of heaven with an axis mundi running upward from the imperial throne to its heavenly counterpart. The ruins were greatly expanded to 7×7 &quot;li&quot; in size and renamed Changle Palace (; ). Two years later, a new palace called Weiyang Palace () was constructed 5×7 &quot;li&quot;. Prime minister Xiao He convinced Liu Bang that both the excessive size and multiplicity of palaces was necessary to secure his rule by creating a spectacle of power.

====Second phase====
In 195 BC, his son, Emperor Hui of Han began the construction of the walls of Chang&#x27;an and finished them in September 191 BC. The grid north of the palaces was built at this time with a 2° difference in alignment to the grid of the palaces. The city remained quite static after this expansion.

====Third phase====
Emperor Wu began a third phase of construction which peaked on 100 BC with the construction of many new palaces. He also added the nine temples complex south of the city, and built the park. In 120 BC, Shanglin Park, which had been used for agriculture by the common people since Liu Bang was sealed off, was turned into an imperial park again. In the center of the park was a recreation of the three fairy islands in Kunming Lake.

===Palaces===
*Changle Palace (; ) Also called the East Palace. It was built atop the ruins of Qin dynasty Apex Temple (). After Liu Bang it was used as the residence of the Empress Regent. The 10,000 m wall surrounded a square 6 km2 complex. Important halls of the palace included: Linhua Hall, Changxin Hall, Changqiu Hall, Yongshou Hall, Shenxian Hall, Yongchang Hall, and the Bell Room.
*Weiyang Palace (; Wèiyāng Gōng) Also known as the West Palace. The official center of government from Emperor Huidi onwards. The palace was a walled rectangle 2250×2150 m enclosing a 5 km2 building complex of 40 halls. There were four gates in the wall facing a cardinal direction. The east gate was used only by nobility and the north one only by commoners. The palace was sited along the highest portion of the ridgeline on which Chang&#x27;an was built. In, fact the Front Hall at the center of the palace was built atop the exact highest point of the ridge. The foundation terrace of this massive building is 350×200×15 m. Other important halls are: Xuanshi Hall, Wenshi Hall, Qingliang Hall, Qilin Hall, Jinhua Hall, and Chengming Hall. Used by seven dynasties this palace has become the most famous in Chinese history.
*Gui Palace () Built as an extension of the harem built in 100 BC
*North Palace () A ceremonial center built in 100 BC
*Mingguang Palace () Built as a guesthouse in 100 BC
*Epang Palace ()
*Jianzhang Palace () Built in 104 BC in Shanglin Park. It was a rectangle 20×30 &quot;li&quot; with a tower 46 m high. The name means palace of establishing eternal rules.
*Boliang Terrace

==Jin, Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern Dynasties period==
Chang&#x27;an was briefly the capital of the Western Jin dynasty from 312 to 316. It was also the capital of Former Zhao (318–329), Former Qin (351–385) and Later Qin (384–417). In 417, a century after the Western Jin lost Chang&#x27;an, the city was reconquered by Liu Yu of Eastern Jin, who founded the Liu Song dynasty in 420. The city was lost to Northern Wei by 439. When Northern Wei split in two, Chang&#x27;an became the capital of Western Wei (535–557), and also of its successor state Northern Zhou (557–581).

==Sui and Tang periods==
The Sui and Tang empires occupied the same location. In 582, Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty sited a new region southeast of the much ruined Han dynasty Chang&#x27;an to build his new capital, which he called Daxing (). Daxing was renamed Chang&#x27;an in the year 618 when the Duke of Tang, Li Yuan, proclaimed himself the Emperor Gaozu of Tang. Chang&#x27;an during the Tang dynasty (618–907) was, along with Constantinople (Istanbul) and Baghdad, one of the largest cities in the world. It was a cosmopolitan urban center with considerable foreign populations from other parts of Asia and beyond. This new Chang&#x27;an was laid out on a north–south axis in a grid pattern, dividing the enclosure into 108 wards and featuring two large marketplaces, in the east and west respectively. Every day, administrators of the two marketplaces would beat gongs three hundred times in the morning and evening to signify the start and stop of business. People who lived in the wards were not allowed to go outside after curfew. Officials with higher ranking had the privilege to live closer to the central avenue. Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s layout influenced the city planning of several other Asian capitals for many years to come. Chang&#x27;an&#x27;s walled and gated wards were much larger than conventional city blocks seen in modern cities, as the smallest ward had a surface area of 68 acres, and the largest ward had a surface area of . The height of the walls enclosing each ward were on average 9 to in height. The Japanese built their ancient capitals, Heijō-kyō (today&#x27;s Nara) and later Heian-kyō or Kyoto, modeled after Chang&#x27;an in a more modest scale, yet was never fortified. The modern Kyoto still retains some characteristics of Sui-Tang Chang&#x27;an. Similarly, the Korean Silla dynasty modeled their capital of Gyeongju after the Chinese capital. Sanggyeong, one of the five capitals of the state of Balhae, was also laid out like Chang&#x27;an.

===Layout of the city===

During Tang, the main exterior walls of Chang&#x27;an rose high, were by six miles in length, and formed a city in a rectangular shape, with an inner surface area of . The areas to the north that jutted out like appendages from the main wall were the West Park, the smaller East Park, and the Daming Palace, while the southeasternmost extremity of the main wall was built around the Serpentine River Park that jutted out as well. The West Park walled off and connected to the West Palace (guarded behind the main exterior wall) by three gates in the north, the walled-off enclosure of the Daming Palace connected by three gates in the northeast, the walled-off East Park led in by one gate in the northeast, and the Serpentine River Park in the southeast was simply walled off by the main exterior wall, and open without gated enclosures facing the southeasternmost city blocks. There was a Forbidden Park to the northwest outside of the city, where there was a cherry orchard, a Pear Garden, a vineyard, and fields for playing popular sports such as horse polo and &quot;cuju&quot; (ancient Chinese football). On the northwest section of the main outer wall there were three gates leading out to the Forbidden Park, three gates along the western section of the main outer wall, three gates along the southern section of the main outer wall, and three gates along the eastern section of the main outer wall.

Although the city had many different streets and roads passing between the wards, city blocks, and buildings, there were distinct major roads (lined up with the nine gates of the western, southern, and eastern walls of the city) that were much wider avenues than the others. There were six of these major roads that divided the city into nine distinct gridded sectors (listed below by cardinal direction). The narrowest of these streets were wide, those terminating at the gates of the outer walls being wide, and the largest of all, the Imperial Way that stretched from the central southern gate all the way to the Administrative City and West Palace in the north, was wide. Streets and roads of these widths allowed for efficient fire breaks in the city of Chang&#x27;an. For example, in 843, a large fire consumed 4,000 homes, warehouses, and other buildings in the East Market, yet the rest of the city was at a safe distance from the blaze (which was largely quarantined in East Central Chang&#x27;an). The citizens of Chang&#x27;an were also pleased with the government once the imperial court ordered the planting of fruit trees along all of the avenues of the city in 740.

===Pools, streams, and canals===

Within the West Park was a running stream and within the walled enclosure of the West Palace were two running streams, one connecting three ponds and another connecting two ponds. The small East Park had a pond the size of those in the West Palace. The Daming Palace and the Xingqing Palace (along the eastern wall of the city) had small lakes to boast. The Serpentine River Park had a large lake within its bounds that was bigger than the latter two lakes combined, connected at the southern end by a river that ran under the main walls and out of the city.

There were five transport and sanitation canals running throughout the city, which had several water sources, and delivered water to city parks, gardens of the rich, and the grounds of the imperial palaces. The sources of water came from a stream running through the Forbidden Park and under the northern city wall, two running streams from outside the city in the south, a stream that fed into the pond of the walled East Park, which in turn fed into a canal that led to the inner city. These canal waterways in turn streamed water into the ponds of the West Palace; the lake in the Xingqing Palace connected two canals running through the city. The canals were also used to transport crucial goods throughout the city, such as charcoal and firewood in the winter.

=== Peoples and Ethnicities ===
Two of the largest ethnic groups in Chang&#x27;an were Han Chinese and Sogdians (people from Sogdia). Their cultures and traditions at times overlapped and combined. For instance, there were tombs within the city in Chinese style, had Chinese writing, led to an underground compartment, and had descriptions of the deceased. They also had Sogdian elements such as a miniature stone house and a stone bedlike platform. Funeral beds tend to also depict a Sogdian swirl as well. There were also many motifs that involved things like bird priests, winged, crowned horsed, winged musicians, and crowned human figures with streamers behind them. These motifs are not fully known as not much is known of the Sogdian religion.

Ease of travel from the Yellow River and Yangtze River also made it easier for other travelers to go to Chang&#x27;an and sell goods to the people of the city. Some of these people even stayed and lived in the city as well. Chang&#x27;an would be an overlap for travelers going to other parts of the region. People from India, the Arabian Peninsula, Iranian plateau, and Eastern African Coast would have people traveling to there and people from there traveling and residing in Chang&#x27;an. 

Not every government official took a liking to foreigners coming and staying into Chang&#x27;an. For instance, Yuan Zhen wrote about how non-Chinese people were &quot;barbaric&quot; and how their cultures and practices would degrade the Chinese way of life.

=== Archaeological Finds ===
Two Sogdian tombs were discovered in the early 2000s near Chang&#x27;an (modern day Xi&#x27;an). They were the first Sogdian tombs discovered which had never been opened before their discovery by archaeologists, which meant that the artifacts inside the tombs were well preserved. The tombs are evidence of the cultural interconnections between immigrants and Chinese cultural practices which they adopted when they moved to large population centers like Chang&#x27;an.

==== An Jia Tomb ====
The tomb of An Jia was discovered in 2001 and had mixed elements of Chinese and Sogdian burial practices. An Jia&#x27;s remains were buried in an uncommon manner as his bones were discovered strewn throughout the tomb which was uncommon to both the Confucian and Zoroastrian customs at the time. Archaeologists also uncovered an epitaph to An Jia written in the Chinese language which retells his life, career, and achievements as a &quot;Sabao of the Tong Prefecture and Commander General of the Great Zhou Dynasty&quot;.

==== Shi Wirkak Tomb ====
The tomb of Shi Wirkak was discovered in 2003-2004 slightly over 1 mile East of An Jia&#x27;s tomb. Similarly to An Jia&#x27;s tomb it also had the mix of both the Chinese and Sogdian burial practices. However, unlike An Jia the there were two versions of Shi Wirkak epitaph in Chinese and Sogdian, though they were not the direct translations of each other which in quality of text could mean that the scribe who wrote the epitaphs had little understanding of either language.

=== Religious institutions ===
Immigrants brought the ideas of new religions into the capital. The hub-status of the city caused these religions to stick and grow over time. Evidence suggests at least five or six Zoroastrian temples existed inside of the city while four temples existed around the Western Market. Christianity was around at this time as well. It was brought by a man named Aluoben who was sent by a church official in Seleucia-Ctesiphon [Modern day Iran]. The Church of the East first settlement was in China circa 635. Several hundred stone tablets and an artifact related to the Church of the East were discovered, which pointed to the existence of an affiliated single Christian church. The Church of the East is a Christian organization which sponsored the creation of churches in multiple Chinese cities, like Chang’an. Members of the Church of the East had received support from the Tang dynasty and yet during this same dynasty, the emperor placed a ban on Buddhism and Christianity, and only Buddhism survived. In 843 the Tang emperor also banned the religion of Manichaeism. A few years later the emperor banned Zoroastrianism and reinstated the ban on Buddhism. This ban on Buddhism was lifted a short while later when the current emperor passed away.

====Citywide events====
Citywide events of Chang&#x27;an include:
*Festivals of traditional Chinese holidays celebrated throughout the city (and empire) included:
**New Year; the grandest of all festivals, and a seven-day holiday period for government officials. Civil officials, military officers, and foreign emissaries gathered first in the early hours of the morning to attend a levee, an occasion where omens, disasters, and blessings of the previous year would be reviewed, along with tribute of regional prefectures and foreign countries presented. It was also an opportunity for provincial governors to present their recommended candidates for the imperial examination. Although festival ceremonies in Chang&#x27;an were lavish, rural people in the countryside celebrated privately at home with their families in age old traditions, such as drinking a special wine, Killing Ghosts and Reviving Souls wine, that was believed to cure illnesses in the following year.
**Lantern Festival; a three-day festival held on the 14th, 15th, and 16th days of the first full moon. This was the only holiday where the government lifted its nightly curfew all across the city so that people could freely exit their wards and stroll about the main city streets to celebrate. Citizens attempted to outdo one another each year in the amount of lamps and the size of lamps they could erect in a grand display. By far the most prominent was the one in the year 713 erected at a gate in Chang&#x27;an by the recently abdicated Emperor Ruizong of Tang. His lantern wheel had a recorded height of , the frame of which was draped in brocades and silk gauze, adorned with gold and jade jewelry, and when it had its total of some 50,000 oil cups lit the radiance of it could be seen for miles.
**Lustration; this one-day festival took place on the third day of the third moon (dubbed the &quot;double-three&quot;), and traditionally was meant to dispel evil and wash away defilement in a river with scented aromatic orchis plants. By the Tang era it had become a time of bawdy celebration, feasting, wine drinking, and writing poetry. The Tang court annually served up a special batch of deep fried pastries as dessert for the occasion, most likely served in the Serpentine River Park.
**Cold Food Festival; this solar-based holiday on April 5 (concurrent with the Qingming Festival) was named so because no fires were allowed to be lit for three days, hence no warmed or hot food. It was a time to respect one&#x27;s ancestors by maintaining their tombs and offering sacrifices, while a picnic would be held later in the day. It was also a time for fun in outdoor activities, with amusement on swing sets, playing cuju football, horse polo, and tug of war. In the year 710, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang had his chief ministers, sons-in-law, and military officers engage in a game of tug of war, and purportedly laughed when the oldest ministers fell over. The imperial throne also presented porridge to officials, and even dyed chicken and duck eggs, similar to the practice on Easter in the Western world.
**Fifth Day of the Fifth Moon; this one-day holiday dubbed the Dragon Boat Festival was held in honor of an ancient Chinese statesman Qu Yuan (-278 BC) from the State of Chu. Ashamed that he could not save the dire affairs of his state or his king by offering good council, Qu Yuan leaped into a river and committed suicide; it was said that soon after many went out on the river in boats in a desperate attempt to rescue him if still alive. This act turned into a festive tradition of boarding a dragon boat to race against other oarsmen, and also to call out Qu&#x27;s name, still in search of him. The type of food commonly eaten during the Tang period for this festival was either glutinous millet or rice wrapped in leaves and boiled.
**Seventh Night of the Seventh Moon; this was a one-day festival that was held in honor of the celestial love affair with deities associated with the star Altair (the male cow-herd deity) in the constellation Aquila and the star Vega (the female weaver maid deity) in the constellation Lyra. For this holiday, women prayed for the enhancement of their skills at sewing and weaving. In the early eighth century Tang servitors had erected a tall hall by knotting brocades to a bamboo frame and laid out fruits, ale, and roasts as offerings to the two stellar lovers. It was during this holiday that the emperor&#x27;s concubines threaded polychrome thread into needles with nine eyes, while facing the Moon themselves (in a ritual called &quot;praying for skill [in sewing and weaving]&quot;).
**Fifteenth Day of the Seventh Moon; this holiday was called All Saints&#x27; Feast, developing from the legend Mulian Rescues His Mother. in which the bodhisattva savior Mulian who had discovered his mother paying for her sinful ways while in purgatory filled with hungry ghosts. According to the tale, she starved there because any food that she put into her mouth would turn into charcoal. Then it was said that she told the Buddha to make an offering with his clergy on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, a virtuous act that would free seven generations of people from being hungry ghosts in Hell as well as people reborn as lower animals. After Mulian was able to save his own mother by offerings, Mulian convinced the Buddha to make the day into a permanent holiday. This holiday was an opportunity of Buddhist monasteries to flaunt their collected wealth and attract donors, especially by methods of drawing crowds with dramatic spectacles and performances.
**Fifteenth Day of the Eighth Moon; this festival (today simply called the Moon Festival or Mid-Autumn Festival), took place in mid autumn, and was designated as a three-day vacation for government officials. Unlike the previous holiday&#x27;s association with Buddhism, this holiday was associated with Taoism, specifically Taoist alchemy. There was a tale about a hare on the moon who worked hard grinding ingredients for an elixir by using a mortar and pestle. In folklore, a magician escorted Emperor Illustrious August to the palace of the moon goddess across a silver bridge that was conjured up by him tossing his staff into the air. In the tale, on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, the emperor viewed the performance of &quot;Air of the Rainbow Robe and Feathered Skirt&quot; by immortal maids. He memorized the music, and on his return to earth taught it to his performers. For people in Chang&#x27;an (and elsewhere), this holiday was a means for many to simply feast and drink for the night.
**Ninth Day of the Ninth Moon; this was a three-day holiday associated with the promotion of longevity (with chrysanthemum as the main symbol). It was a holiday where many sought to have picnics out in the country, especially in higher elevated areas such as mountain sides. Without the ability to travel away to far off mountains, inhabitants of Chang&#x27;an simply held their feasts at the tops of pagodas or in the Serpentine River Park. Stems and leaves of chrysanthemum were added to fermented grains and were brewed for a year straight. On the same festival the following year, it was believed that drinking this ale would prolong one&#x27;s life.
**The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on this holiday ale and fruit were provided as offerings to the god of the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one&#x27;s own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to the stove god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god on a piece of paper above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk and far too inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.
*Grand Carnivals; carnivals during the Tang period were lively events, with great quantities of eating, drinking, street parades, and sideshow acts in tents. Carnivals had no fixed dates or customs, but were merely celebrations bestowed by the emperor in the case of his generosity or special circumstances such as great military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, sacrifices to gods, or the granting of grand amnesties. This type of carnival as a nationwide tradition was established long before the Tang by Qin Shihuang in the third century BC, upon his unification of China in 221. Between 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty nine different carnivals, seventeen of which were held under Empress Wu. These carnivals generally lasted 3 days, and sometimes five, seven, or nine days (using odd numbers due so that the number of days could correspond with beliefs in the cosmos). The carnival grounds were usually staged in the wide avenues of the city, and smaller parties in attendance in the open plazas of Buddhist monasteries. However, in 713, a carnival was held in the large avenue running east to west between the West Palace walls and the government compounds of the administrative city, an open space that was long and wide, and was more secure since the guard units of the city were placed nearby and could handle crowd control of trouble arose. Carnivals of the Tang dynasty featured large passing wagons with high poles were acrobats would climb and perform stunts for crowds. Large floats during the Tang, on great four-wheeled wagons, rose as high as five stories, called &#x27;mountain carts&#x27; or &#x27;drought boats&#x27;. These superstructure vehicles were draped in silken flags and cloths, with bamboo and other wooden type frames, foreign musicians dressed in rich fabrics sitting on the top playing music, and the whole cart drawn by oxen that were covered in tiger skins and outfitted to look like rhinoceroses and elephants. An official in charge of the Music Bureau in the early seventh century set to the task of composing the official music that was to be played in the grand carnival of the year. On some occasions the emperor granted prizes to those carnival performers he deemed to outshine the rest with their talents.
*In 682, a culmination of major droughts, floods, locust plagues, and epidemics, a widespread famine broke out in the dual Chinese capital cities of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang. The scarcity of food drove the price of grain to unprecedented heights of inflation, while a once prosperous era under emperors Taizong and Gaozong ended on a sad note.

==Decline==

Much of Chang&#x27;an was destroyed during its repeated sacking during the An Lushan Rebellion and several subsequent events. Chang&#x27;an was occupied by the forces of An Lushan and Shi Siming, in 756; then taken back by the Tang government and allied troops in 757. In 763, Chang&#x27;an, modern-day Xian, was briefly occupied by the Tibetan Empire. In 765, Chang&#x27;an was besieged by an alliance of the Tibetan Empire and the Uyghur Khaganate. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Han Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779, the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang&#x27;an, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from pretending to be Chinese. Between 783 and 784, Chang&#x27;an was again occupied by rebels during the Jingyuan Rebellion. 

In 881, Chang&#x27;an was occupied by the rebel Huang Chao, who made it the seat of his Qi Dynasty. In 882, the Tang dynasty briefly regained control of Chang&#x27;an. However, the Tang forces, although welcomed by the inhabitants, looted Chang&#x27;an before being driven back by the forces of Huang Chao. In revenge, Huang Chao conducted a systematic slaughter of the inhabitants after retaking the city. Chang&#x27;an was finally retaken by the Tang government in 883. In 904, the warlord Zhu Quanzhong ordered the city&#x27;s buildings demolished and the construction materials moved to Luoyang, which became the new capital. The residents, together with the emperor Zhaozong, were also forced to move to Luoyang. Chang&#x27;an never recovered after the apex of the Tang dynasty, but there are some monuments from the Tang era still standing.

After Zhu Quanzhong moved the capital to Luoyang, the Youguo Governorate () was established in Chang&#x27;an, with Han Jian being the jiedushi (). Han Jian rebuilt Chang&#x27;an on the basis of the old Imperial City. Much of Chang&#x27;an was abandoned and the rebuilt Chang&#x27;an, called &quot;Xincheng (lit. new city)&quot; by the contemporary people, was less than 1/16 of the old Chang&#x27;an in area. The rest of the city was overrun by nature and was used for agriculture. Then the northern and eastern city wall was expanded a little and the official name of the city was changed from Jingzhao, which means capital city, to Xi&#x27;an in Ming dynasty.

<text>The &quot;VA Kernel&quot; is a set of programs, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs of the United States Government, which provide an operating system and MUMPS implementation independent abstraction to the VistA Hospital Information System. These programs (called &#x27;routines&#x27; in MUMPS) are the only programs which are expected to not be written in ANSI Standard MUMPS.

The MUMPS language used in the kernel is amazingly simple, consisting of a single language (MUMPS), a single data type (string), a single data storage mechanism (global arrays stored on disk), 19 commands and 22 functions. MUMPS is a symbolic language with linguistic roots closer to LISP than Fortran or COBOL. Because of this simple software layer, the VistA software architecture has been able to adapt to changing hardware environments over the decades with only the minimum amount of software changes at higher levels of abstraction.

The CHCS system and the RPMS system have a Kernel as well, which provides a similar degree of support to those systems as the VA Kernel does to VistA.

The VA Kernel provides abstractions for:

* Menu Management (MenuMan)
* Electronic mail, group conferencing, transaction processing (MailMan)
* Login and Access Security
* Task scheduling and Batch processing
* Input/Output devices
* Protocol and Event processing
* Date processing and manipulation
* Mathematical and common library functions

<doc id="186526" wikidata="Q844993" url="?curid=186526" title="Doxology">
<text>A doxology (Ancient Greek: &quot;doxologia&quot;, from , &quot;doxa&quot; &#x27;glory&#x27; and -, -&quot;logia&quot; &#x27;saying&#x27;) is a short hymn of praises to God in various forms of Christian worship, often added to the end of canticles, psalms, and hymns. The tradition derives from a similar practice in the Jewish synagogue, where some version of the Kaddish serves to terminate each section of the service.

==Trinitarian doxology==

Among Christian traditions a doxology is typically an expression of praise sung to the Holy Trinity: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is common in high hymns for the final stanza to take the form of a doxology. Doxologies occur in the Eucharistic prayers, the Liturgy of the Hours, hymns, and various Catholic devotions such as novenas and the Rosary.

===&quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;===

The Gloria in excelsis Deo, also called the Greater Doxology, is a hymn beginning with the words that the angels sang when the birth of Christ was announced to shepherds in . Other verses were added forming a doxology.

===&quot;Gloria Patri&quot;===

The &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, so named for its Latin incipit, is commonly used as a doxology in many Christian traditions, including the Roman Catholics, Old Catholics, Independent Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, Anglicans, Presbyterians, Methodists, Disciples of Christ, Reformed Baptists and United Protestants. It is called the &quot;Lesser Doxology&quot;, thus distinguished from the &quot;Great Doxology&quot; (&quot;Gloria in Excelsis Deo&quot;), and is often called simply &quot;&quot;the&quot; doxology&quot;. As well as praising God, it was regarded as a short declaration of faith in the equality of the three Persons of the Holy Trinity.

The Greek text,
:

is rendered into Latin as,

which is literally translated

:&quot;Glory [be] to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.&quot;
:&quot;As it was in the beginning, and now, and always, and into the ages of ages. Amen.&quot;

&quot;In saecula saeculorum&quot;, here rendered &quot;ages of ages&quot;, is the calque of what was probably a Semitic idiom, via Koine Greek, meaning &quot;forever.&quot; It is also rendered &quot;world without end&quot; in English, an expression also used in James I&#x27;s Authorised Version of the Bible in Ephesians 3:21 and Isaiah 45:17. Similarly, &quot;et semper&quot; is often rendered &quot;and ever shall be&quot;, thus giving the more metrical English version,

:&quot;... As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.&quot;

A common version of the Liturgy of the Hours, as approved by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, uses a newer, different translation for the Latin:

:&quot;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.&quot;

The most commonly encountered Orthodox English version:

:&quot;Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now, and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen&quot;

The modern Anglican version found in &quot;Common Worship&quot; is slightly different, and is rooted in the aforementioned translations found in the Authorised Version:

:&quot;Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.&quot;

===&quot;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow&quot;===


Another doxology in widespread use in English, in some Protestant traditions commonly referred to simply as The Doxology or The Common Doxology, begins &quot;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow&quot;. The words are thus:

:&quot;Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;&quot;
:&quot;Praise Him, all creatures here below;&quot;
:&quot;Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;&quot;
:&quot;Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.&quot;

These words were written in 1674 by Thomas Ken as the final verse of two hymns, &quot;Awake, my soul, and with the sun&quot; and &quot;Glory to thee, my God, this night,&quot; intended for morning and evening worship at Winchester College. This final verse, separated from its proper hymns and sung to the tune &quot;Old 100th&quot;, &quot;Duke Street&quot;, &quot;Lasst uns erfreuen&quot;, &quot;The Eighth Tune&quot; by Thomas Tallis, among others, frequently marks the dedication of alms or offerings at Sunday worship. The popular Hawaiian version &quot;Hoʻonani i ka Makua mau&quot; was translated by Hiram Bingham I and is published in hymnals. Many Mennonite congregations sing a longer and more embellished setting of this text known as &quot;Dedication Anthem&quot; by Samuel Stanley. In Mennonite circles, this doxology is commonly known as &quot;606&quot; for its hymn number in &quot;The Mennonite Hymnal&quot; [1969], and colloquially known as the &quot;Mennonite National Anthem.&quot; The traditional version of the Doxology is recited in most congregations of the Methodist Churches, such as the Free Methodist Church and Global Methodist Church. Students at Goshen College stand and sing the doxology when 6:06 remains in a soccer game – as long as Goshen is winning the game.

Some progressive denominations have adopted altered versions of the Doxology in the interest of inclusive language or other considerations. For example, some Disciples of Christ congregations eliminate the masculine pronouns. Some denominations, such as the Anglican Church of Canada (&quot;Common Praise&quot;), the United Church of Canada (&quot;Voices United&quot;), and the United Church of Christ (&quot;New Century Hymnal&quot;), replace &quot;heavenly host&quot; with a reference to God&#x27;s love. The United Church of Christ version reads:

:&quot;Praise God from whom all blessings flow;&quot;
:&quot;Praise God, all creatures here below;&quot;
:&quot;Praise God for all that love has done;&quot;
:&quot;Creator, Christ, and Spirit, One.&quot;

The Presbyterian Church (USA) accepted this version of the Doxology in 2014 to accompany the Glory to God, the Presbyterian Hymnal. This version was written by the Rev. Neil Weatherhogg, pastor of both the First Presbyterian Church of Kerrville, Texas, and the Harvey Browne Presbyterian Church in Louisville, Kentucky. This version was published by Rev. Weatherhogg in 1990. This hymn maintains Gender neutrality as it does not refer to God in gender specific terminology. It goes:

:&quot;Praise God from whom all blessings flow;&quot;
:&quot;Praise God, all creatures here below;&quot;
:&quot;Praise God above ye heavenly host;&quot;
:&quot;Praise Triune God, whom we adore&quot;

Other versions of this doxology exist as well, with various lyrics, including in the United Methodist Hymnal (#621), (preserving the text change of thy creatures as opposed to the original these creature ) Be Present at Our Table, Lord,&quot; which is often sung as grace before meals using the tune &quot;Old 100th;&quot; hymn by John Cennick; tune from the Genevan Psalter, 1551; attributed to Louis Bourgeois:

:&quot;Be present at our table, Lord;&quot;
:&quot;be here and everywhere adored;&quot;
:&quot;thy creatures bless, and grant that we&quot;
:&quot;may feast in paradise with thee.&quot;

===Eucharistic doxology===

In the Catholic Mass a prose doxology concludes the eucharistic prayer, preceding the Our Father. It is typically sung by the presiding priest along with any concelebrating priests. The Latin text reads:

: (1. Through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours almighty Father, forever and ever Amen. and 2. Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. Amen.)

The equivalent passage in the Book of Common Prayer (1549) of the Church of England reads:

:By whom and with whom, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, all honour and glory be unto thee, O Father almighty, world without end. Amen.

===Lord&#x27;s Prayer doxology===

Another familiar doxology is the one often added at the end of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer: &quot;&quot;For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever, Amen&quot;.&quot; This is found in manuscripts representative of the Byzantine text of Matthew 6:13, but not in the manuscripts considered by Catholics to be the most reliable. According to Scrivener&#x27;s &quot;Supplement to the Authorized English version of New Testament&quot;, it is omitted by eight out of 500 or so manuscripts. Some scholars do not consider it part of the original text of Matthew, and modern translations do not include it, mentioning it only in footnotes. Since 1970, the doxology, in the form &quot;For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and for ever&quot;, is used in the Roman Rite of the Mass, after the Embolism. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1914) claims that this doxology &quot;appears in the Greek textus receptus and has been adopted in the later editions of the Book of Common Prayer, [and] is undoubtedly an interpolation.&quot; In fact, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer doxology is often left away by Catholics, such as in the Liturgy of the Hours, or when, which is quite often outside Mass, a Hail Mary follows immediately (e. g. in the Rosary where the Gloria Patri serves as doxology).

According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, this doxology takes up
==Other doxologies==
In the Epistle of Jude, the last two verses (24 and 25) are considered to be a doxology and are used by many Protestant Christians, especially in public worship settings:
:&quot;Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.&quot; (KJV)

At Matins, Orthodox worship specifies a Great Doxology for feast days and a Small Doxology for ordinary days. Both include the Gospel doxology of the angels at Christ&#x27;s birth (Luke 2:14: &quot;Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to men of good will&quot;). The lines of this doxology are the opening lines of the prayer &quot;Gloria in Excelsis&quot; recited during the Roman Catholic Mass.

=== Pentecostal ===
A popular doxology in African-American Pentecostal and Baptist churches is &quot;Praise Him, Praise Him&quot;, written in the 1980s by famed African American Gospel singer and minister Reverend Milton Biggham.

Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him! Jesus, blessed Savior, he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

From the rising of the sun until the going down of the same, he&#x27;s worthy, Jesus is worthy, 
he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

Glory! Glory! In all things give him glory. 
Jesus, blessed Savior, he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

For God is our rock, hope of salvation; a strong deliverer, in him I will always trust.

Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him! Jesus, blessed Savior, he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

From the rising of the sun until the going down of the same, he&#x27;s worthy, Jesus is worthy, he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him! Jesus, blessed Savior, he&#x27;s worthy to be praised.

=== Iglesia ni Cristo ===

In the Iglesia ni Cristo, the Doxology is sung before the Benediction and Concluding Rites during worship services. It reads:

=== Unitarian Universalism ===
In Unitarian Universalism, &quot;the Doxology&quot; typically refers to Curtis W. Reese&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;From all that dwell below the skies&quot;, an 18th-century paraphrase of Psalm 117 by Isaac Watts:
:&quot;From all that dwell below the skies
:let songs of hope and faith arise; (Or, alternatively, let faith and hope with love arise)
:let peace, goodwill on earth be sung (Or let beauty, truth and good be sung)
:through every land, by every tongue.&quot; (Or in every land, in every tongue.)
While many congregations who use a doxology use these words and sing them to the tune of Old 100th, there are nine different lyrics that congregations may choose to use, along with three tunes (Old 100th, Tallis&#x27; Canon, and Von Himmel Hoch) listed in the Unitarian Universalist hymnal &quot;Singing the Living Tradition&quot;.

These doxologies appear in Unitarian Universalist services as short songs of communal praise and connection, placed in the service much as Trinitarian doxologies are placed in a Protestant Christian service.

==Derivations==
Because some Christian worship services include a doxology, and these hymns therefore were familiar and well-practiced among church choirs, the English word &quot;sockdolager&quot; arose, a deformation of &quot;doxology&quot;, which came to mean a &quot;show-stopper&quot;, a production number. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; considers it a &quot;fanciful&quot; coinage, but an 1893 speculation reported in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as to the origin of the word as one of its early attestations:

:A writer in the March &quot;Atlantic&quot; gives this as the origin of the slang word &quot;socdollager&quot;, which was current some time ago. &quot;Socdollager&quot; was the uneducated man&#x27;s transposition of &quot;doxologer&quot;, which was the familiar New England rendering of &quot;doxology&quot;. This was the Puritan term for the verse ascription used at the conclusion of every hymn, like the &quot;Gloria&quot; at the end of a chanted psalm. On doctrinal grounds it was proper for the whole congregation to join in the singing, so that it became a triumphant winding up of the whole act of worship. Thus is happened that &quot;socdollager&quot; became the term for anything which left nothing else to follow; a decisive, overwhelming finish, to which no reply was possible.

<doc id="186529" wikidata="Q22665" url="?curid=186529" title="Futabatei Shimei">
<text>was a Japanese writer, translator, and literary critic. His writings are in the realist style popular in the mid to late 19th century. His work &quot;The Drifting Cloud&quot; (&quot;Ukigumo&quot;, 1887) is widely regarded as Japan&#x27;s first modern novel.

==Biography==
Futabatei was born Hasegawa Tatsunosuke in Edo (now Tokyo). After quitting his studies at the Russian language department at the Tokyo Foreign Language School in protest over administrative restructuring, Futabatei published the literary criticism &quot;Shōsetsu Sōron&quot; at the encouragement of the critic and author Tsubouchi Shōyō in 1886. Futabatei&#x27;s first novel &quot;Ukigumo&quot; is often said to be unfinished, but its realist style strongly influenced fellow authors in his day. Futabatei was accomplished in Russian and translated the work of Ivan Turgenev and other Russian realists into Japanese.

In 1902, he learned Esperanto in Russia. Returning to Japan in 1906, he published the first Japanese-Esperanto instruction book &quot;Sekaigo&quot;.

Futabatei died of tuberculosis on the Bay of Bengal while returning from Russia as a special correspondent for the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; newspaper. He was cremated and buried in Singapore.

The origin of Futabatei&#x27;s pen name (a reference to &quot;kutabatte shimae&quot;, lit. &quot;drop dead&quot;) has been the repeated subject of speculation (including the allegation that these had been his father&#x27;s words when he learned of his son&#x27;s plans to study literature). Futabatei claimed that these were the words of his inner voice while in conflict between his artistic ideals and monetary aspirations.

<doc id="186531" wikidata="Q2278889" url="?curid=186531" title="Kensaku Shimaki">
<text>was the pen-name of , a Japanese author active during the Shōwa period in Japan. He had an interest in leftist ideology and was arrested in 1928 due to his ties to the Japanese Communist Party. Throughout his literary career, Shimaki wrote multiple novels and stories with a common theme being proletariat life. Some of his works were published by magazines and journals. He associated with Nobel laureate Kawabata Yasunari.

==Early life==
Shimaki was born in Sapporo, Hokkaidō in 1903. His father died when he was two years old, and he was raised by his mother. He was forced to drop out of elementary school in order to work to support his mother, and managed to continue his education by obtaining odd jobs at a local middle school and library.

==Life as a political radical==
Shimaki entered Tohoku Imperial University in Sendai in 1925, but due to extreme poverty was barely able to support himself, and he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. It was during this time that he was attracted to the radical labor movement. He left the university and joined a leftist agrarian movement in Shikoku. In 1927, this flirtation with socialism turned more radical when he signed on as active member of the Japan Communist Party.

When the communist movement was outlawed and forced underground, Shimaki was arrested in a nationwide round-up of communists (the March 15 incident of 1928), and was forced to renounce his communist beliefs in order to be released from prison. However, it appears that his political renunciation was not sincere, since he was again arrested in 1929, this time under the auspices of the Peace Preservation Law. Shimaki remained imprisoned until March 1932, when his tuberculosis worsened, and he was paroled for health reasons. He stayed for a while in the Hongō neighborhood of Tokyo with his brother (who ran a used bookstore) and he attempted to study English.

==Literary career==
Although in his youth, Shimaki published a short-lived literary magazine called &quot;Kunugi no Mi&quot; (&quot;Acorn&quot;, 1918), containing &quot;tanka&quot; poems and essays which he wrote under the pen-name of “Asakura Tengai”, his literary career did not begin in earnest until after he was released from prison the second time.

In 1934, Shimaki published his first work &quot;Rai&quot; (&quot;Leprosy&quot;), a serialized novel which appeared in the magazine &quot;Bungaku Hyōron&quot; (Literary Review). It was based on his experiences while in prison, and was critically well received. Shimaki followed this work with &quot;Mōmoku&quot; (&quot;Blindness&quot;) in the literary journal &quot;Chūōkōron&quot;, which further established his position as a writer.

Shimaki lived in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture from 1937, and was part of a social and literary circle which included Kawabata Yasunari, Kobayashi Hideo and Takami Jun. However, his first novel, &quot;Saiken&quot; (&quot;Reconstruction&quot;, 1937) was banned by government censors as it sympathetically depicted a man convicted for his left-wing convictions. Shimaki had intended to write a sequel, in which the man rejected Marxism, but never had the chance. Instead, he produced &quot;Seikatsu no tankyū&quot; (&quot;Quest for Life&quot;, 1937), which was well received by the authorities, as it depicted people having a productive life despite difficult conditions during a national emergency.

He traveled to Manchukuo in 1939, and published a well-balanced travel story &quot;Manshū Kiko&quot; (&quot;Manchurian Travelogue&quot;, 1939) of his visit, and somewhat surprisingly government censors did not react to his criticism of government policies in Manchukuo which adversely affected the lives of the Japanese colonists. 
Shimaki died of tuberculosis in 1945, only a couple of days after the surrender of Japan at the relatively young age of 41. Yasunari Kawabata read a eulogy at his funeral. His grave is at the temple of Jōchi-ji in Kamakura.

<text>was a Japanese poet active in the late Taishō period and for the first few years of the Shōwa period, who focused on modern religious themes.

==Biography==
Born in what is now part of the city of Machida near Tokyo, Yagi attended the Kanagawa Prefectural Normal School, then located in Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture. There he converted to Methodism and became attracted to the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore. In 1919, Yagi was baptized at the Komagome Christian Church in Tokyo. He remained a devout Protestant all his short life, but later moved to the Non-Church Christianity (&quot;Mukyōkai&quot;) as advocated by Uchimura Kanzō.

After graduation, Yagi taught at the Mikage Normal School in Hyōgo Prefecture, and began to write verse as an expression of his faith. He was very much inspired by the poems of John Keats, to whom he dedicated a number of his poems. Yagi published his first collection, &quot;Aki no Hitome&quot; (Autumn Eye) in 1925. Although he contributed several pieces to poetry magazines, he remained shy of literary circles.

Hospitalized with tuberculosis in Chigasaki, Kanagawa in 1926, he died on 26 October 1927. Only after his death and the publication of &quot;Mazushiki Shinto&quot; (Humble Believer), &quot;Yagi Jukichi Shishu&quot; (Yagi Jukichi Anthology), and &quot;Kami O Yobu&quot; (Talk to God) did he gain widespread recognition.

<doc id="186538" wikidata="Q186326" url="?curid=186538" title="Ryūnosuke Akutagawa">
<text>, art name , was a Japanese writer active in the Taishō period in Japan. He is regarded as the &quot;father of the Japanese short story&quot;, and Japan&#x27;s premier literary award, the Akutagawa Prize, is named after him. He took his own life at the age of 35 through an overdose of barbital.

== Early life ==
Ryūnosuke Akutagawa was born in Irifune, Kyōbashi, Tokyo City (present-day Akashi, Chūō, Tokyo), the eldest son of businessman Toshizō Niihara and his wife Fuku. His family owned a milk production business. His mother experienced mental illness shortly after his birth, so he was adopted and raised by his maternal uncle, Michiaki Akutagawa, from whom he received the Akutagawa family name. He was interested in classical Chinese literature from an early age, as well as in the works of Mori Ōgai and Natsume Sōseki.

He entered the First High School in 1910 and developed relationships with classmates such as Kan Kikuchi, Kume Masao, Yūzō Yamamoto, and , all of whom would later become authors. He began writing after entering Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo) in 1913, where he studied English literature. While still a student, he proposed marriage to a childhood friend, Yayoi Yoshida, but his adoptive family did not approve the union. In 1916 he became engaged to , whom he married in 1918. They had three children: Hiroshi Akutagawa (1920–1981) was an actor, Takashi Akutagawa (1922–1945) was killed as a student draftee in Burma, and Yasushi Akutagawa (1925–1989) was a composer.

Following graduation, Akutagawa taught briefly at the Naval Engineering School in Yokosuka, Kanagawa as an English language instructor, before deciding to devote his efforts to writing fulltime.

== Literary career ==
In 1914, Akutagawa and his former high school friends revived the literary journal &quot;Shinshichō&quot; (&quot;New Currents of Thought&quot;), where they published translations of William Butler Yeats and Anatole France along with works they had written themselves. Akutagawa published his second short story &quot;Rashōmon&quot; the following year in the literary magazine &quot;Teikoku Bungaku&quot; (&quot;Imperial Literature&quot;), while still a student. The story, based on a twelfth-century tale, was not well received by Akutagawa&#x27;s friends, who greatly criticized it. Nonetheless, Akutagawa gathered up the courage to visit his idol, Natsume Sōseki, in December 1915 for Sōseki&#x27;s weekly literary circles. In November, he published the work in the literary magazine &quot;Teikoku Mongaku&quot;. In early 1916 he published &quot;Hana&quot; (&quot;The Nose&quot;, 1916), which received a letter of praise from Sōseki and secured Akutagawa his first taste of fame.

It was also at this time that Akutagawa started writing haiku under the &quot;haigo&quot; (pen name) &quot;Gaki&quot;. Akutagawa followed with a series of short stories set in Heian period, Edo period or early Meiji period Japan. These stories reinterpreted classical works and historical incidents. Examples of these stories include: &quot;Gesaku zanmai&quot; (&quot;Absorbed in Letters&quot;, 1917) and &quot;Kareno-shō&quot; (&quot;Gleanings from a Withered Field&quot;, 1918), &quot;Jigoku hen&quot; (&quot;Hell Screen&quot;, 1918); &quot;Hōkyōnin no shi&quot; (&quot;The Death of a Christian&quot;, 1918), and &quot;Butōkai&quot; (&quot;The Ball&quot;, 1920). Akutagawa was a strong opponent of naturalism. He published &quot;Mikan&quot; (&quot;Mandarin Oranges&quot;, 1919) and &quot;Aki&quot; (&quot;Autumn&quot;, 1920) which have more modern settings.

In 1921, Akutagawa interrupted his writing career to spend four months in China, as a reporter for the &quot;Osaka Mainichi Shinbun&quot;. The trip was stressful and he suffered from various illnesses, from which his health would never recover. Shortly after his return he published &quot;Yabu no naka&quot; (&quot;In a Grove&quot;, 1922). During the trip, Akutagawa visited numerous cities of southeastern China including Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Suzhou. Before his travel, he wrote a short story &quot;&quot;; concerning the Chinese Christian community; according to his own imaginative vision of Nanjing, as influenced by classical Chinese literature.

===Influences===

Akutagawa&#x27;s stories were influenced by his belief that the practice of literature should be universal and could bring together Western and Japanese cultures. The idea can be seen in the way that Akutagawa used existing works from a variety of cultures and time periods and either rewrites the story with modern sensibilities or creates new stories using ideas from multiple sources. Culture and the formation of a cultural identity is also a major theme in several of his works. In these stories, he explores the formation of cultural identity during periods in history where Japan was most open to outside influences. An example of this is his story &quot;Hōkyōnin no Shi&quot; (&quot;The Martyr&quot;, 1918) which is set in the early missionary period.

The portrayal of women in Akutagawa&#x27;s stories was mainly shaped by the influence of three women who acted as his mother figures. Most significant was his biological mother Fuku, from whom he worried about inheriting her madness. Although Akutagawa was removed from Fuku eight months after his birth, he identified strongly with her and believed that, if at any moment he might go mad, life was meaningless. His aunt Fuki played the most prominent role in his upbringing, controlling much of Akutagawa&#x27;s life as well as demanding much of his attention, especially as she grew older. The women who appear in Akutagawa&#x27;s stories, much like his mother figures, were for the most part written as dominating, aggressive, deceitful, and selfish. Conversely, men were often represented as the victims of such women.

== Later life ==

The final phase of Akutagawa&#x27;s literary career was marked by deteriorating physical and mental health. Much of his work during this period is distinctly autobiographical, some with text taken directly from his diaries. His works during this period include &quot;Daidōji Shinsuke no hansei&quot; (&quot;The Early Life of Daidōji Shinsuke&quot;, 1925) and &quot;Tenkibo&quot; (&quot;Death Register&quot;, 1926).

At this time, Akutagawa had a highly publicized dispute with Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki over the importance of structure versus lyricism in stories. Akutagawa argued that structure (how the story was told) was more important than the content or plot of the story, whereas Tanizaki argued the opposite.

Akutagawa&#x27;s final works include &quot;Kappa&quot; (1927), a satire based on the eponymous creature from Japanese folklore, &quot;Haguruma&quot; (&quot;Spinning Gears&quot; or &quot;Cogwheels&quot;, 1927), &quot;Aru ahō no isshō&quot; (&quot;A Fool&#x27;s Life&quot; or &quot;The Life of a Stupid Man&quot;), and &quot;Bungeiteki na, amari ni bungeiteki na&quot; (&quot;Literary, All Too Literary&quot;, 1927).

Towards the end of his life, Akutagawa suffered from visual hallucinations and anxiety over the fear that he had inherited his mother&#x27;s mental disorder. In 1927, he survived a suicide attempt, together with a friend of his wife. He later died of suicide after taking an overdose of Veronal, which had been given to him by Mokichi Saitō on 24 July of the same year. In his will he wrote that he felt a about the future. He was 35 years old.

== Legacy and adaptations ==
During the course of his short life, Akutagawa wrote 150 short stories. A number of these have been adapted into other media. Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s famous 1950 film &quot;Rashōmon&quot; retells Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;In a Grove&quot;, with the title and the frame scenes set in the Rashomon Gate taken from Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashōmon&quot;. Ukrainian composer Victoria Poleva wrote the ballet &quot;Gagaku&quot; (1994), based on Akutagawa&#x27;s &quot;Hell Screen&quot;. Japanese composer Mayako Kubo wrote an opera entitled &quot;Rashomon&quot;, based on Akutagawa&#x27;s story. The German version premiered in Graz, Austria in 1996, and the Japanese version in Tokyo in 2002. The central conceit of the story (i.e. conflicting accounts of the same events from different points of view, with none &quot;definitive&quot;) has entered into storytelling as an accepted trope.

In 1930, Tatsuo Hori, a writer, who saw himself as a disciple of Akutagawa, published his short story &quot;Sei kazoku&quot; (literally &quot;The Holy Family&quot;), which was written under the impression of Akutagawa&#x27;s death and even paid reference to the dead mentor in the shape of the deceased character Kuki. In 1935, Akutagawa&#x27;s lifelong friend Kan Kikuchi established the literary award for promising new writers, the Akutagawa Prize, in his honor.

In 2020 NHK produced and aired the film &quot;A Stranger in Shanghai&quot;. It depicts Akutagawa&#x27;s time as a reporter in the city and stars Ryuhei Matsuda.

<doc id="186539" wikidata="Q2712289" url="?curid=186539" title="Chiaki J. Konaka">
<text>is a Japanese writer and novelist. He was the head writer of anime series such as &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; (1998), &quot;The Big O&quot; (1999-2003), &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; (2001-02), &quot;Hellsing&quot; (2001-02), and &quot;Texhnolyze&quot; (2003), as well as the television drama &quot;Ultraman Tiga&quot; (1996-97).

==Personal life==
Konaka was born in Tokyo, Japan on 4 April 1961. His interest in filmmaking began at the age of 10, influenced by his parents&#x27; love for movies and the wide range of film genres he experienced as a child. 

Konaka gave himself the middle initial &quot;J&quot;, evoking the Christian name &quot;John&quot;, due to him being born to parents who were members of the Anglican Church, but he does not identify as Christian. He began using the middle initial at the age of 12, when he started making 8 mm films, patterning the style after Western names such as Charles M. Schulz. Following this, he received a camera of his own, and by middle school finished a film called &quot;Invader&quot;.

Upon entering , Konaka joined the school&#x27;s film club where he met Makoto Tezuka who was his senior. His films during this period adopted largely science-fiction themes, and it wasn&#x27;t until watching &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Hell House&quot; that he began to garner an interest in horror.

While working in special effects after graduating college, Konaka was offered his first scriptwriting job on Teruyoshi Ishii&#x27;s 1988 Japanese horror film &quot;&quot;. This served as a starting point for working on future projects.

He has previously worked as a screenwriting instructor at .

==Artistry and themes==

Konaka&#x27;s serious works generally have a dark, psychological tone. As a Cthulhu Mythos writer, he tends to add Lovecraftian elements to his works. He has cited &quot;Ghost Hound&quot; as his favorite screenwriting project.

The story-line of the early episodes of &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; was based on one of the original scripts by Chiaki and Kazuya Konaka for &quot;&quot; in 1995 before the final draft by Kazunori Itō. Konaka brothers&#x27; plot was later used for &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot; and &quot;Gamera the Brave&quot; in 2006.

===Controversy===

In 2021, Konaka wrote a stage drama for &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot;&#x27; 20th anniversary that was performed at DigiFes 2021, an official &quot;Digimon&quot; event held annually on August 1. The drama featured the cast of the show being confronted by a physical manifestation of &quot;political correctness&quot; that uses &quot;cancel culture&quot; as an attack. This brought attention to his blog meant for retrospective commentary on &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot;, in which he also discussed conspiracy theories, and sparked international controversy among Internet Digimon circles. In response, Konaka posted a statement in English addressed to his overseas fans on August 8, 2021, to explain his circumstances and to apologize for triggering a divide among the fandom.

<doc id="186540" wikidata="Q7091197" url="?curid=186540" title="On Watanabe">
<text>was a Japanese mystery writer and fantasy novelist. Despite his early death aged 27, he was an inspiration for later Japanese authors.

==Biography==
Watanabe was born in Yakomura, Kamiiso District, Hokkaido (now Hokuto City). His real name was Yutaka Watanabe. He was the third son of Itaro Watanabe and Tsune Watanabe, and the younger brother of detective writer Keisuke Watanabe. In February 1905, the family moved to Fukagawa, Tokyo, and he spent his childhood in company housing in a slum area. In August 1912, he moved to Takasuzu Village, Taga District in Ibaraki Prefecture (now Hitachi City). In 1920, he graduated from Mito Junior High School and entered Keio University&#x27;s Literature Preparatory Course, but dropped out in April 1921. In April 1922, he entered Keio High School. Around this time, he started living with his brother Keisuke and the writer Kōtarō Fukuda.

In 1924, he submitted &quot;Shadows&quot; to a competition for film drafts held by the Plato Publishing magazines &quot;Josei&quot; and &quot;Kuraku&quot; and won the first prize. The judges on this occasion were Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki and Kaoru Osanai. Around this time, he became acquainted with Michiko Oikawa, an actress at the Tsukiji Shōgekijō (Tsukiji Little Theatre), and started a romantic relationship, but because Oikawa was sickly the people around him opposed marriage and he gave up on it.

In March 1926, he graduated from Keio University. In January 1927 he was recruited by Masashi Yokomizo, who had been appointed as the second editor-in-chief of &quot;Shin Seinen&quot; (“New Youth”) magazine, and joined publisher Hakubunkan as an editorial assistant. He is said to have worn morning dress and a top hat when going to Hakubunkan’s offices, at that time a clear exhibition of his commitment to modernism.

In July 1928, he left Hakubunkan to concentrate on his own creative activities. In April 1929, together with Keisuke, he translated work by Edogawa Ranpo for the publication of &quot;The Poe, Hoffmann Collection&quot; (part of &quot;The Kozeisha Complete Works of World Popular Literature, Volume 30&quot;; both of them were in charge of Edgar Allan Poe). In addition, he recommended that Keisuke write a detective novel as potential material for the silent film star Tokihiko Okada, and this resulted in Keisuke&#x27;s maiden work, &quot;Madonna with False Eyes&quot; (&quot;Shin Seinen&quot;, June issue). In November, he returned to work at the &quot;Shin Seinen&quot; editorial department.

On 9 February 1930, with translator Shigeji Narahara (Shūji Hasegawa), he visited Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, who was living in Okamoto near Kobe (now Higashinada Ward, Kobe City), to persuade him to write an essay for &quot;Shin Seinen&quot;. That night (around 1:50 a.m. on the following day, the 10th), a freight train collided with his taxi at a railroad crossing in Shukugawa. He was taken to Nishinomiya Regeneration Hospital, but died of cerebral contusion. Narahara, who was in the taxi with him, was also injured but survived.

Tanizaki published his eulogy for Watanabe entitled &quot;Shunkan&quot; in the April 1930 issue of &quot;Shin Seinen&quot;. The incident was the motivation for Tanizaki to write &quot;The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi&quot;, and it was serialized in the same magazine from 1931 onwards.

<text>was a Japanese writer.

==Life==
Tokuda was born in Kanazawa in Ishikawa Prefecture. Coming from a family of the former feudal nobility, Tokuda began his literary life as a follower of the writer Ozaki Kōyō, who was four years his senior and had already established himself as a literary man in the late 1880s. Their relationship wasn&#x27;t to last long, though, with Kōyō dying in 1903, after which Tokuda began to move from Kōyō&#x27;s style of romanticism into a mixture of naturalism and the confessional known as &quot;Shizen-shugi&quot;, an example of which is his 1908 novel &quot;Arajotai&quot; (新世帯), which dealt with the frustrations of a young working-class couple.

After the publication of &quot;Ashiato&quot; (足迹) in 1910, Tokuda would release his most autobiographical work, &quot;Kabi&quot; (黴), in 1911, a classic example of the Japanese genre known as the &quot;I-novel&quot;. He followed with the novel &quot;Rough Living&quot; (&quot;Arakure&quot;, あらくれ) in 1915.

After the death of his wife in 1926, Tokuda began a series of relationships with younger women, which would inspire his later works, especially his best-known, &quot;Kasō jinbutsu&quot; (仮装人物), released from 1935 to 1938, as well as the unfinished &quot;Shukuzu&quot; (縮図) from 1941.

==Legacy==
A number of Tokuda&#x27;s works were adapted into films in Japan. A monument honoring Tokuda was erected near the summit of Mount Utatsu in 1947. The monument features writing authored by poet Murō Saisei and was designed by architect Yoshirō Taniguchi.

<doc id="186544" wikidata="Q7496814" url="?curid=186544" title="Shimada Ichirō">
<text>was a Japanese samurai who lived during the transition from the Edo period to the Meiji era. He is best known for his role in the assassination of Ōkubo Toshimichi.

==Background==
Shimada Ichirō was born to an ashigaru in the Kaga Domain (modern city of Kanazawa), which was later merged to the Ishikawa Prefecture by the Meiji government.

Following the death of Saigō Takamori during the Satsuma Rebellion, a group of samurai among his sympathizers formed an antigovernment faction called &quot;Sankō-ji&quot;, led by Shimada. The faction began plotting the assassination of Kido Takayoshi and Ōkubo Toshimichi to avenge Saigō. However, the passing of Kido on May 26, 1877 shifted the focus solely on Ōkubo.

Shimada along with Chō Tsurahide disappeared from Kanazawa in March 1878, keeping the central government on high alert. Shimada left his family with poetry, setting his motives and coming to terms with his demise.

On May 14, 1878 in Tokyo, Shimada along with six other men, dragged Ōkubo out of a carriage and cut his throat and left the body with their weapons and an explanatory note. Immediately after, they turned themselves in to a nearby palace. All were executed in July of the same year.

<doc id="186545" wikidata="Q577180" url="?curid=186545" title="Takeo Arishima">
<text>was a Japanese novelist, short-story writer and essayist during the late Meiji and Taishō periods. His two younger brothers, and , were also authors. His son was the internationally known film and stage actor, Masayuki Mori.

==Early life==
Arishima was born in Tokyo, Japan into a wealthy family as the son of an ex-samurai official in the Ministry of Finance. He was first sent to a mission school in Yokohama, where he was taught English, after which he entered preparatory school of the prestigious Gakushuin peer&#x27;s school, when he was 10 years old.

After he graduated from the Gakushuin at age 19, he entered the Sapporo Agricultural College (the present-day Faculty of Agriculture at Hokkaido University). During his studies at the university, he attempted suicide with . Arishima subsequently became influenced by Uchimura Kanzō and became a Christian in 1901. Morimoto later went on to establish several women&#x27;s schools around Japan.

After graduation and a mandatory short stint in the Imperial Japanese Army, Arishima took English lessons from Mary Elkinton Nitobe, Inazo Nitobe&#x27;s wife, and in July 1903, he obtained a position as a foreign correspondent in the United States for the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;. In the United States he enrolled at Haverford College (a Quaker institution outside of Philadelphia) and later Harvard University. After graduation, he briefly worked in an insane asylum operated by the Quaker sect. He recorded his experiences from his journey to America in his diary.

During his time in America, he became critical towards Christianity, attracted to socialism, and influenced by the works of writers such as Walt Whitman, Henrik Ibsen, and Peter Kropotkin. His time and experiences in America and subsequent year in Europe also profoundly influenced his writing style and his outlook on the world, resulting in feelings of alienation from Japanese society.

After he returned to Japan in 1907, he re-entered the army briefly before becoming an English and ethics teacher in 1909 at his alma mater.

==Literary career==
Through his brother Arishima Ikuma, he also became acquainted with authors who graduated from the Gakushuin, including Naoya Shiga and Saneatsu Mushanokōji. Arishima and these writers formed a group, which was named after their literary magazine &quot;, which was first published in 1911. He wrote novels and literary criticisms and was known as one of the central figures in the &quot;Shirakaba&quot; group.

Arishima first achieved fame in 1917 with , which depicts God’s curse on both man and nature through the eyes of a self-destructive tenant farmer. In 1919 he published his best-known work: , a moral and psychological melodrama about a strong-willed woman struggling against a hypocritical male-dominated society. While critically acclaimed for his style, the themes and characters of Arishima’s works did not appeal to many contemporary Japanese readers.

==Later life==
In 1922, Arishima implemented the socialist philosophy he had been developing by renunciation of the ownership of a large tenant farm in Hokkaidō, which he had inherited from his father, publicly stating that he wanted to distance himself from the petit bourgeois in the coming revolution.

Arishima married in 1910, but his wife died in 1916 of tuberculosis leaving him three children. In 1922, Arishima met Akiko Hatano, a married woman and an editor working for the &quot;Fujin Koron&quot;, a famous women&#x27;s magazine. Their relationship quickly developed into an extramarital affair, which came to be known by Hatano&#x27;s husband. This led to Arishima and Hatano committing suicide in Karuizawa by hanging themselves. Due to the isolated location, their bodies were not discovered for over a month, and were identified largely by the suicide note left behind. Arishima&#x27;s grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.

==Legacy==
After his death, Arishima became known for his detailed diaries, covering more than twenty volumes, with an intimate record of his life, fears and hopes. His contemporaries regarded Arishima as a philosopher and social critic as much as a novelist. His writing was critical of Christianity and strongly influenced by socialism; emotionally intense, humanistic, and employed ideas from the Bible, Tolstoy, and anarchic socialism.

<doc id="186546" wikidata="Q278215" url="?curid=186546" title="Chūya Nakahara">
<text>, born , was a Japanese poet active during the early Shōwa period. Originally shaped by Dada and other forms of European (mainly French) experimental poetry, he was one of the leading renovators of Japanese poetry. Although he died at the young age of 30, he wrote more than 350 poems throughout his life. Many called him the &quot;Japanese Rimbaud&quot; for his affinities with the French poet whose poems he translated in 1934.

==Early life==
Chūya Nakahara was born in Yamaguchi, where his father, Kensuke Kashimura, was a highly decorated army doctor. Kensuke married Fuku Nakahara and was adopted by the Nakahara family shortly after the birth of their son, officially changing their last name to Nakahara. In Nakahara&#x27;s earliest years, his father was sent to Hiroshima and Kanazawa where the family followed, only returning to Yamaguchi in 1914. In 1917, Kensuke established his own clinic in the location where nowadays stands the Nakahara Chūya Memorial Hall.

Since his parents had not been blessed with children for six years after their marriage, and because they had no children in the Nakahara family&#x27;s hometown, they were delighted with the birth of their first son and celebrated it for three days.

==Education and literary beginnings==
As the eldest son of a prominent doctor, Nakahara was expected to become one himself. Due to the high expectations of his father, Nakahara was given a very strict education, which also prevented him from enjoying an ordinary childhood. Worried about the public morals of the town, Kensuke forbid his son from playing outside with children from a different class to their own. Another example of these restrictions is that, unlike his younger brothers, he was not allowed to bathe in the river for fear that he would drown. As he grew up, severe punishments were inflicted upon him; a common one was being made to stand upright facing the wall. Any sudden move would cause to receive a burn on the heel with a cigarette ember. However, the biggest punishment was being confined to sleep in the barn, which Chūya received dozens of times compared to his brothers. This was intended to prepare him to follow Kensuke&#x27;s footsteps and to become the head of the family.

As a middle schooler, Nakahara had excellent grades and was called a prodigy child. It was the death of his younger brother Tsugurō in 1915 when he was 8 years old, which awakened him to literature. Grief-driven, he turned to compose poetry. He submitted his first three verses to a women&#x27;s magazine and local newspaper in 1920 when he was still in elementary school. In the same year, he passed the entrance examination to Yamaguchi Junior High School with brilliant results. It was from this point onwards that he started to rebel against his father&#x27;s strictness. He no longer studied and his grades began to drop as he became increasingly absorbed by literature. Kensuke was extremely afraid of the influence of literature on his son. Once, having found a work of fiction Nakahara had hidden, he severely scolded him and, once again, confined him in the barn. It was around this time when Nakahara also began to drink and smoke, making his grades go even lower.

In 1923, he failed his third-year examination. It is said that Nakahara invited a friend to his study room, broke the answer sheet, and chanted &quot;hurrah&quot;. The failure seems to have been deliberate. For as long as he did not fail, he was bound to remain under his strict parents&#x27; surveillance. On the other hand, Kensuke received the news with utter shock at what meant to him a deep humiliation. He resorted once more to striking his son and keeping him in the barn on the cold night of March. Regardless of this, Nakahara insisted on not going back to this school. This culminated in his father&#x27;s defeat, ultimately leading to an apology for his “educational policy”. In light of these events, he was transferred to the Ritsumeikan Middle School in Kyoto, where Nakahara begin to live alone but still, and until the end of his days, at the expense of his family.

In Kyoto he found many of the influences that would ultimately shape him as a poet. He read Shinkichi Takahashi&#x27;s Dadaist poetry, which shocked him into starting to write again. This artistic movement became a part of his poetic lifestyle and later earned him the nickname “Dada-san”. In winter he met the actress Yasuko Hasegawa, three years his senior, and in April 1924 they began living together. It is also in this very year that Chūya became friends with fellow poet Tominaga Tarō. After completing Junior High School, Chūya and Yasuko decided to follow Tominaga to Tokyo, on the basis of attending university there. As he was unable to take the exam due to a lack of documents or being late, he was sent out by his family on the condition that he would go to a preparatory school instead.

After dropping the preparatory course in 1926, of which his parents were not informed, he started studying French at the Athénée Français.

==Literary career==
His verse has been considered somewhat obscure, and confessional and gives a general impression of pain and melancholy, emotions which were a constant throughout the poet&#x27;s life.&lt;br&gt;
Initially, Nakahara favored poetry in the Japanese traditional tanka format, but he was later (in his teens) attracted to the modern free verse styles advocated by the Dadaist poet Takahashi Shinkichi and by Tominaga Tarō. After he moved to Tokyo, he met Kawakami Tetsutaro and Shōhei Ōoka, with whom he began publishing a poetry journal, Hakuchigun (Group of Idiots). He was befriended by the influential literary critic Kobayashi Hideo, who introduced him to the French symbolist poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, whose poems he translated into Japanese. The influence of Rimbaud went beyond just his poetry, and Nakahara came to be known for his &quot;bohemian&quot; lifestyle.

Nakahara adapted the traditional counts of five and seven used in Japanese haiku and tanka, but frequently tripped these counts with variations, in order to obtain a rhythmical, musical effect. Several of his poems were used as lyrics in songs, so this musical effect may have been carefully calculated from the start. Nakahara displayed different emotions in his poems, which according to Rachel Dumas was often “confusion, ennui, anger, gloom, and apathy”. In some of his poems he talks about being alone and how life is filled with darkness. He often expressed a childlike wonder about humans and how they connect with the world that lays outside of our minds. Nakahara, having been raised in a prefecture that was predominately Christian, often questioned faith in his poems. In his poems, he posed questions about the spiritual world and that of the other, a world that humans can’t attain. Chūya&#x27;s works were rejected by many publishers, and he found acceptance primarily with the smaller literary magazines, including Yamamayu, which he launched together with Hideo Kobayashi, (although on occasion Shiki and Bungakukai would condescend to publish one of his works). He remained close friends with Kobayashi all of his life, despite the fact that in November 1925 Yasuko Hasegawa left Nakahara and began living with Kobayashi Hideo instead. This event took place right after the loss of his friend Tominaga. In December 1927, he met composer Saburō Moroi, who later adapted a number of his verses to music, such as &quot;Asa no Uta&quot; (, &quot;Morning Song&quot;) and &quot;Rinjū&quot; (, &quot;Deathbed&quot;). In April 1931, Chūya was admitted to the Tokyo Foreign Language College in Kanda to study the French language, where he remained until March 1933.

Nakahara married Takako Ueno (a distant relative) in December 1933, and his first son, Fumiya, was born in October 1934. However, the death of his son in November 1936, due to tuberculosis, sent him into a nervous breakdown. Nakahara never fully recovered from this, despite the birth of his second son in December. Many of his later poems seem like remembrances and attempts to mitigate this enormous pain.

Nakahara was hospitalized in Chiba sanatorium in January 1937. In February, he was released and moved back to Kamakura, as he could not stand to continue living in the house which contained the memories of Fumiya. He left a number of his works with Kobayashi and was making plans to return to his hometown of Yamaguchi when he died in October 1937, at the age of 30, of tubercular meningitis. Shortly after, his second son died of the same illness.
His grave is in his hometown of Yamaguchi. This is the very family grave that appears in his uncollected poem &quot;Cicadas&quot; (, &quot;Semi&quot;).

==Legacy==
Only one of his poetry anthologies, &quot;Yagi no Uta&quot; (, &quot;Goat Songs&quot;, 1934) was published while he was alive (in a self-financed edition of two hundred copies). He edited a second collection, &quot;Arishi Hi no Uta&quot; (, &quot;Songs of Bygone Days&quot;, 1938) just before his death. During his lifetime, Nakahara was not counted among the mainstream poets. However, the emotional and lyrical nature of his verses has a wide and increasing following even to this day, especially among young people. Nakahara is now a subject of classroom study in Japanese schools, and his portrait in a hat with a vacant stare is well known. Kobayashi Hideo, to whom Nakahara entrusted the manuscript for &quot;Arishi Hi no Uta&quot; on his deathbed, was responsible for the posthumous promotion of his works. So was Ooka Shohei for collecting and editing &quot;The Complete Works of Nakahara Chūya&quot;, a collection containing the poet&#x27;s uncollected poems, his journals, and many letters.
* The Nakahara Chūya Prize was established in 1996 by Yamaguchi city (with the support of publishers Seidosha and Kadokawa Shoten) in Chūya&#x27;s memory. The award is presented annually to an outstanding collection of contemporary poetry characterized by a &quot;fresh sensibility&quot; (). The winner receives a cash award of 1 million yen, and for several years, the winning collection was also published in an English language translation, but in recent years, the administrations of the award have stopped translating the winner.
* The acid-folk singer Kazuki Tomokawa recorded two albums entitled &quot;Ore no Uchide Nariymanai Uta&quot; and &quot;Nakahara Chuya Sakuhinnshu&quot;, using Nakahara&#x27;s poems as lyrics.

<doc id="186552" wikidata="Q485247" url="?curid=186552" title="Uchimura Kanzō">
<text>was a Japanese author, Christian evangelist, and the founder of the Nonchurch Movement (Mukyōkai) of Christianity during the Meiji and Taishō periods in Japan. He is often considered to be the most well-known Japanese pre-World War II pacifist.

==Early life==
Uchimura was born in Edo, and exhibited a talent for languages from a very early age; he started to study the English language at the age of 11. At age 13 he entered a foreign language school to continue to study English, and planned to pursue a government job. In 1877, he gained admission to the Sapporo Agricultural College (present-day Hokkaido University), where English was the main language of instruction.

Prior to Uchimura&#x27;s arrival, William S. Clark, a graduate as well as the president of Amherst College, had spent the year assisting the Japanese government in establishing the college. While his primary role was to teach agricultural technology, Clark was a committed lay Christian missionary who introduced his students to the Christian faith through Bible classes. All of his students converted and signed the &quot;Covenant of Believers in Jesus&quot;, committing themselves to continue studying the Bible and to do their best to live moral lives. Clark returned to the United States after one year, but Uchimura felt his influence through the small Covenant group that was left behind. Under considerable pressure from his &quot;senpai&quot; (先輩, a term for strongly-influential senior peers), Uchimura signed the Covenant during his first year at the College at the age of 16 and went on to receive baptism from a Methodist missionary in 1878.

Dissatisfaction with the mission church, however, led Uchimura and his Japanese supporters to establish an independent church in Sapporo. This experiment turned out to be a precursor to what is now called the Nonchurch Movement. Through Clark&#x27;s teaching and example, this small group believed that they could practice and live an authentic life of faith without depending on a religious institution or a professional clergy.

He was a close friend of P. Y. Saeki, an Anglican, but their relationship turned sour later.

== Overseas career ==

Uchimura departed for the United States following a brief and unhappy first marriage in 1884. He was first befriended by Wister Morris and his wife, a Quaker couple, who helped him find employment at Elwyn Institutes as a caregiver shortly after his arrival in Pennsylvania. The Quaker faith and pacifism made a lasting impression upon Uchimura. He and his Sapporo friend Nitobe Inazō were influential in the establishment of the Friends School in Tokyo as a result of his sojourning in the Philadelphia area.

Following eight months of stressful work in Elwyn, Uchimura resigned and traveled through New England, entering Amherst College in September 1885. Julius Hawley Seelye, the president of Amherst College, became his spiritual mentor, and encouraged him to attend the Hartford Theological Seminary. After completing his second bachelor&#x27;s degree (B.Sc.) in general science at Amherst, he enrolled in Hartford Seminary, but quit after only one semester, disappointed by theological education. He returned to Japan in 1888.

== Japanese religious leader ==

After his return to Japan, Uchimura worked as a teacher, but was fired or forced to resign in several instances over his uncompromising position toward authorities or foreign missionary bodies that controlled the schools. The most famous such incident was his refusal to bow deeply to the portrait of Emperor Meiji and the Imperial Rescript on Education in the formal ceremony held at the First Higher School (then preparatory division to the Tokyo Imperial University). Realizing that his religious beliefs were incompatible with a teaching career, he turned to writing, becoming senior columnist for the popular newspaper, &quot;Yorozu Chōhō&quot;. Uchimura&#x27;s fame as a popular writer became solid as he launched a series of sharp criticism against industrialist Ichibei Furukawa over one of modern Japan&#x27;s first industrial pollution cases involving Furukawa&#x27;s Ashio Copper Mine.

Uchimura&#x27;s career as a journalist was cut short as well, largely due to his pacifist views and vocal opposition against the Russo-Japanese War in his newspaper columns, which came into conflict with the paper&#x27;s official editorial views. He started publishing and selling his own monthly magazine, &quot;Tokyo Zasshi&quot; (Tokyo Journal) and later &quot;Seisho no Kenkyu&quot; (Biblical Study), and supported himself by addressing weekly audiences of 500–1000 people in downtown Tokyo in lectures on the Bible. His followers came to share Uchimura&#x27;s attitude that an organized church was actually a hindrance to the Christian faith, and Christian sacraments, such as baptism and communion, are not essential to salvation. Uchimura named his Christian position as &quot;Mukyōkai&quot; or Nonchurch Movement. Uchimura&#x27;s movement attracted many students in Tokyo who later became influential figures in academia, industry, and literature. His &quot;prophetic&quot; views on religion, science, politics, and social issues became influential beyond his small group of followers.

His writings in English include: &quot;Japan and the Japanese&quot; (1894) and &quot;How I became a Christian&quot; (1895), and reflect his struggle to develop a Japanese form of Christianity. In his lifetime, Uchimura became famous overseas. His major English-language works were translated into numerous languages. After his death, however, Uchimura&#x27;s reputation grew more, as his followers produced an enormous amount of literature.

<text>, known by his pen name , was a Japanese novelist and author. A number of his most popular works, such as &quot;The Setting Sun&quot; (斜陽, &quot;Shayō&quot;) and &quot;No Longer Human&quot; (人間失格, &quot;Ningen Shikkaku&quot;), are considered modern classics.

His influences include Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, Murasaki Shikibu and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. His last book, &quot;No Longer Human&quot;, is his most popular work outside of Japan.

Another pseudonym he used was Shunpei Kuroki (黒木 舜平), for the book &quot;Illusion of the Cliffs&quot; (断崖の錯覚, &quot;Dangai no Sakkaku&quot;).

==Early life==

Shūji Tsushima was born on June 19, 1909, the eighth surviving child of a wealthy landowner and politician in Kanagi, located at the northern tip of the Tōhoku Region, in Aomori Prefecture. He was the tenth of the eleven children born to his parents. At the time of his birth, the huge, newly completed Tsushima mansion, where he spent his early years, was home to some thirty family members. The Tsushima family was of obscure peasant origins. Dazai&#x27;s great-grandfather built up the family&#x27;s wealth as a moneylender, and his son increased it further. They quickly rose in power and, after some time, became highly respected across the region.

Dazai&#x27;s father, Gen&#x27;emon, was a younger son of the Matsuki family, which, due to &quot;its exceedingly &#x27;feudal&#x27; tradition,&quot; had no use for sons other than the eldest son and heir. As a result, Gen&#x27;emon was adopted into the Tsushima family to marry the eldest daughter, Tane. He became involved in politics due to his position as one of the four wealthiest landowners in the prefecture, and was offered membership of the House of Peers. This caused Dazai&#x27;s father to be absent during much of his early childhood. As his mother, Tane, was ill, Dazai was brought up mostly by the family&#x27;s servants and his aunt Kiye.

==Education and literary beginnings==
In 1916, Dazai began his education at Kanagi Elementary. On March 4, 1923, his father Gen&#x27;emon died from lung cancer. A month later, in April, Dazai moved to Aomori Junior High School, followed in 1927 by Hirosaki Higher School, a university preparatory school. He developed an interest in Edo culture and began studying gidayū, a form of chanted narration used in &quot;bunraku&quot;. Around 1928, Dazai edited a series of student publications and contributed some of his own works. He also published a magazine called &quot;Saibō Bungei&quot; (&quot;Cell Literature&quot;) with his friends, and subsequently became a staff member of the college&#x27;s newspaper.

Dazai&#x27;s success in writing was brought to a halt when his idol, the writer Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, committed suicide in 1927 at 35 years old. Dazai started to neglect his studies, and spent the majority of his allowance on clothes, alcohol, and prostitutes. He also dabbled in Marxism, which at the time was heavily suppressed by the government. 

On the night of December 10, 1929, Dazai made his first suicide attempt, but survived and was able to graduate the following year. In 1930, he enrolled in the French Literature Department of Tokyo Imperial University, but promptly stopped studying again. In October, he ran away with a geisha named and was formally disowned by his family.

Nine days after he was expelled from Tokyo Imperial University, Dazai attempted suicide by drowning off a beach in Kamakura with another woman, a 19-year-old bar hostess named . Tanabe died, but Dazai lived. He was rescued by the crew of a fishing boat, and was charged as an accomplice in Tanabe&#x27;s death. Shocked by the events, Dazai&#x27;s family intervened to stop the police investigation. His allowance was reinstated, and he was released without any charges. In December, he recovered at Ikarigaseki and married Hatsuyo there.

==Leftist movement==
In 1929, when the principal of Hirosaki High School was found to have misappropriated public funds, the students, under the leadership of Ueda Shigehiko (Ishigami Genichiro), leader of the Social Science Study Group, staged a five-day strike, which resulted in the principal&#x27;s resignation and no disciplinary action against the students. Dazai hardly participated in the strike, but in imitation of the proletarian literature in vogue at the time, he summarized the incident in a novel called &quot;Student Group&quot; and read it to Ueda. The Tsushima family was wary of Dazai&#x27;s leftist activities. On January 16 of the following year, the Special High Police arrested Ueda and nine other students of the Hiroko Institute of Social Studies, who were working as activists for Seigen Tanaka&#x27;s Communist Party.

In college, Dazai met activist Eizo Kudo, and made a monthly financial contribution of ten yen to the Japanese Communist Party. He was expelled from his family after his marriage to Hatsuyo Oyama in order to prevent any association of his illegal activities with his brother Bunji, who was a politician. After his marriage, Dazai was ordered to hide his sympathies and moved repeatedly. In July 1932, Bunji tracked him down, and had him turn himself in at the Aomori Police Station. In December, Dazai signed and sealed a pledge at the Aomori Prosecutor&#x27;s Office to completely withdraw from leftist activities.

==Early literary career==

Dazai kept his promise and settled down. He managed to obtain the assistance of Masuji Ibuse, an established writer whose connections helped him get his works published and establish his reputation. The next few years were productive for Dazai. He wrote at a feverish pace and used the pen name &quot;Osamu Dazai&quot; for the first time in a short story called &quot;Ressha&quot; (&quot;列車&quot;, &quot;Train&quot;), published in 1933. This story was his first experiment with the I-novel form that later became his trademark.

In 1935 it started to become clear to Dazai that he would not graduate. He also failed to obtain a job at a Tokyo newspaper. He finished &quot;The Final Years&quot; (&quot;Bannen&quot;), which was intended to be his farewell to the world, and tried to hang himself on March 19, 1935, failing yet again. Less than three weeks later, he developed acute appendicitis and was hospitalized. In the hospital, he became addicted to Pavinal, a morphine-based painkiller. After fighting the addiction for a year, in October 1936 he was taken to a mental institution, locked in a room and forced to quit cold turkey. 
The treatment lasted over a month. 

During this time Dazai&#x27;s wife Hatsuyo committed adultery with his best friend Zenshirō Kodate. This eventually came to light, and Dazai attempted to commit &quot;shinjū&quot; (joint suicide) with his wife. They both took sleeping pills, but neither died. Soon after, Dazai divorced Hatsuyo. He quickly remarried, this time to a middle school teacher named Michiko Ishihara (石原美知子). Their first daughter, Sonoko (), was born in June 1941.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Dazai wrote a number of novels and short stories that are autobiographical in nature. His first story, &quot;Gyofukuki&quot; (魚服記, &quot;Transformation&quot;, 1933), is a grim fantasy involving suicide. Other stories written during this period include &quot;Dōke no hana&quot; (道化の花, &quot;Flowers of Buffoonery&quot;, 1935), &quot;Gyakkō&quot; (逆行, &quot;Losing Ground&quot;, 1935), &quot;Kyōgen no kami&quot; (狂言の神, &quot;The God of Farce&quot;, 1936), an epistolary novel called &quot;Kyokō no Haru&quot; (虚構の春, &quot;False Spring&quot;, 1936) and the stories in the collection &quot;Bannen&quot; (1936; &quot;Declining Years&quot; or &quot;The Final Years&quot;), which describe his sense of personal isolation and his debauchery.

==Wartime years==
Japan widened the Pacific War by attacking the United States in December 1941, but Dazai was excused from the draft because of his chronic chest problems, as he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. The censors became more reluctant to accept his work, but he managed to publish anyway. A number of the stories that he published during the war are retellings of stories by Ihara Saikaku (1642–1693). Dazai&#x27;s wartime works include &quot;Udaijin Sanetomo&quot; (右大臣実朝, &quot;Minister of the Right Sanetomo&quot;, 1943), &quot;Tsugaru&quot; (1944), &quot;Pandora no Hako&quot; (パンドラの匣, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, 1945–46), and &quot;Otogizōshi&quot; (お伽草紙, &quot;Fairy Tales&quot;, 1945) in which he retells a number of Japanese fairy tales.

Dazai&#x27;s house was burned down twice in the American bombing of Tokyo, but his family escaped unscathed and gained a son, Masaki (正樹), who was born in 1944. His third child, his daughter Satoko (里子), who later became a writer under the pseudonym Yūko Tsushima, was born in May 1947.

==Postwar career==
In the immediate postwar period, Dazai reached the height of his popularity. He depicted a dissolute life in postwar Tokyo in &quot;Viyon no Tsuma&quot; (ヴィヨンの妻, &quot;Villon&#x27;s Wife&quot;, 1947), depicting the wife of a poet who had abandoned her and her continuing will to live through hardships.

In 1946, Dazai published a controversial memoir, &quot;Kuno no Nenkan&quot; (Almanac of Pain), in which he describes the immediate aftermath of Japan&#x27;s defeat and seeks to encapsulate how the Japanese felt at the time. Dazai reaffirmed his loyalty to the Japanese Emperor, Emperor Hirohito and his son Akihito. However, Dazai also expressed his Communist beliefs in this memoir. Dazai also wrote &quot;Jugonenkan&quot; (&quot;For Fifteen Years&quot;), another autobiographical piece.

On December 14, 1946, a group of writers that included Dazai was joined by Yukio Mishima for dinner at a restaurant. The latter recalled that on that occasion, he gave vent to his dislike of Dazai. According to a later statement by Mishima:

The disgust in which I hold Dazai&#x27;s literature is in some way ferocious. First, I dislike his face. Second, I dislike his rustic preference for urban sophistication. Third, I dislike the fact that he played roles that were not appropriate for him.

Other participants at the dinner could not remember if events occurred as Mishima described. They did report that he did not enjoy Dazai&#x27;s &quot;clowning&quot; and that he and Dazai had a dispute about Ōgai Mori, a writer whom Mishima admired.

In July 1947, Dazai&#x27;s novel &quot;Shayo&quot; (&quot;The Setting Sun&quot;, translated 1956) was published. It depicts the decline of the Japanese nobility after the war. It was partly based on the diary of Shizuko Ōta (太田静子), an admirer of Dazai&#x27;s work who first met him in 1941. The pair had a daughter, Haruko, () in 1947.

A heavy drinker, Dazai became an alcoholic and his health deteriorated rapidly. At this time he met Tomie Yamazaki (山崎富栄), a beautician whose husband had been killed in the war after just ten days of marriage. Dazai abandoned his wife and children and moved in with Tomie.

Dazai began writing his novel &quot;No Longer Human&quot; (人間失格 &quot;Ningen Shikkaku&quot;, 1948) at the hot-spring resort in Atami. He then moved to Ōmiya with Tomie and stayed there until mid-May 1948, finishing his novel. A quasi-autobiography, it depicts a self-destructive young man who believes that he is disqualified from being human. The book has been translated into several foreign languages.

In the spring of 1948, Dazai worked on &quot;Goodbye&quot;, a novella scheduled to be serialized in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;. It was never finished.

==Death==

On June 13, 1948, Dazai and Tomie drowned themselves in the rain-swollen Tamagawa Canal, near his house. Their bodies were not discovered until six days later, on June 19, which would have been his 39th birthday. His grave is at the temple of Zenrin-ji, in Mitaka, Tokyo.

At the time, there was a lot of speculation about the incident. Keikichi Nakahata, a kimono merchant who frequented the young Tsushima family, was shown the scene of the suicide by a detective from Mitaka police station. He speculated that &quot;Dazai was asked to die, and he simply agreed, but just before his death, he suddenly felt an obsession with life.&quot;

<doc id="186554" wikidata="Q376499" url="?curid=186554" title="Denji Kuroshima">
<text>was a Japanese author.

==Personal life==
A largely self-taught writer of humble social origins, Kuroshima was born on Shōdoshima in the Inland Sea and went to Tokyo to work and study. Conscripted into the army in 1919, he was sent to fight in a doomed war against the USSR waged at the time by Japan and its allies, including the US and Britain. Upon his return, Kuroshima joined a flourishing proletarian literature movement and published his narratives in a variety of journals. His passionately anti-imperialist novel was researched in China. As his health began to fail in the early 1930s, Kuroshima returned to his native island where he lived with his wife and three children.

==Works==
One of modern Japan&#x27;s most dedicated antimilitarist intellectuals, Kuroshima Denji is best known for his Siberian stories of the late 1920svivid descriptions of agonies suffered by Japanese soldiers and Russian civilians during Japan&#x27;s invasion of the newly emerged Soviet Union. Kuroshima also wrote powerful narratives dealing with the hardships, struggles, and rare triumphs of Japanese peasants. His only full-length novel, &quot;Militarized Streets&quot;, a shocking description of economic and military aggression against China, was censored not only by Japan&#x27;s imperial government, but by the US occupation authorities as well.

==Literary style==
Kuroshima&#x27;s narratives—like those of Anton Chekhov, whom Kuroshima greatly admired—are unadorned in style, straightforward in storytelling, and attentive to detail. Their content conveys a sense of authenticity, grief over the unnecessary suffering, and above all the urgent need for change. Despite occasional flashes of humor and lyricism, the tone is seldom cheerful and happy endings are rare: Kuroshima refrains from accomplishing in fiction what is much harder to attain in actuality. Devoid of easy optimism, his stories are open-ended chronicles of abuse and resistance.

Ultimately, Kuroshima is convinced, only a vast international movement based on grassroots solidarity stands a chance of replacing a heartless status quo with a sane, livable world of justice and generosity. Meanwhile, faced with the daily tragedies of an irrationally structured world, radical artists everywhere are bound to persevere in their oppositional work. In his 1929 essay &#x27;On Antiwar Literature,&#x27; Kuroshima writes: &quot;So long as the capitalist system exists, proletarian antiwar literature must also exist, and fight against it.&quot;

<doc id="186555" wikidata="Q374817" url="?curid=186555" title="Doppo Kunikida">
<text>was a Japanese author of novels and romantic poetry during the Meiji period, noted as one of the inventors of Japanese naturalism.

==Early life and education==
Doppo Kunikida was born in Chōshi, Chiba as Tetsuo Kunikida. While some doubt exists as to his biological father, Doppo was raised by his mother and her samurai-class husband. The family moved to Tokyo in 1874, but relocated to Yamaguchi prefecture and Doppo grew up in Iwakuni. The rural area of Chōshū left Doppo with a love of nature and influenced the naturalism which later appeared in his literature. Doppo quit school in order to help support his family in 1888, but left for school in Tokyo in 1889.

He studied at the English department of Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō (now Waseda University). Interested in western democracy, he developed a defiant attitude to the school&#x27;s administration and was expelled from the school in 1891. When he was 21 years old, he was baptized by Uemura Masahisa and became a Christian. His religion and the poetry of William Wordsworth influenced his later writing style.

== Career and personal life ==

Kunikida founded a literary magazine &quot;Seinen bungaku&quot; (青年文學 &quot;Literature for Youth&quot;) in 1892 and began his private diary &quot;Azamukazaru no ki&quot; (欺かざるの記 &quot;An Honest Record&quot;, published after his death) in 1893, the same year he began teaching English, mathematics, and history in Saiki, another rural area of Japan.

In 1894, he joined the news staff of the &quot;&quot; newspaper as a war correspondent. His reports from the front during the First Sino-Japanese War, which were collected and re-published after his death as &quot;Aitei Tsushin&quot;, (愛弟通信 &quot;Communiques to a Dear Brother&quot;) found high favor among the readers.
The following year, Kunikida settled with his parents in Tokyo, where he edited the magazine &quot;Kokumin no Tomo&quot; (國民の友 &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Friend&quot;) and met his future wife, Nobuko Sasaki, on whom Takeo Arishima is thought to have based his famous novel &quot;A Certain Woman&quot;. Against her parents&#x27; wishes (Nobuko&#x27;s mother encouraged her to commit suicide rather than marry Doppo), the couple was married in November 1895. Kunikida&#x27;s ensuing financial difficulties caused the pregnant Nobuko to divorce him after only five months. The failed marriage had a traumatic effect on Doppo, and his depression and mental anguish over the separation can be seen in &quot;Azamukazaru no Ki&quot;, published from 1908 to 1909.

Shortly after his divorce, Kunikida turned to the genre of romantic poetry when co-authored an anthology, &quot;Jojoshi&quot; (抒情詩 &quot;Lyric Poems&quot;), in 1897 with Katai Tayama and Kunio Matsuoka (a.k.a. Kunio Yanagita). Around this time, Kunikida published several poems that would eventually be collected in &quot;Doppo gin&quot; as well as the short story, &quot;Gen Oji&quot; (源叔父 &quot;Uncle Gen&quot;). Through his poetic style, Kunikida introduced a fresh current into romantic lyrical literature.

Kunikida remarried in 1898, to Haruko Enomoto, and published his first short-story collection, &quot;Musashino&quot; (武蔵野 &quot;The Musashi Plain&quot;) in 1901, which portrayed people who fall behind the times.

However, Kunikida&#x27;s style began to change. Although &quot;Haru no Tori&quot; (春の鳥 &quot;Spring Birds&quot;), written in 1904, reportedly reached the highest level of romanticism in his era, his later works, such as &quot;Kyushi&quot; (窮死 &quot;A Poor Man&#x27;s Death&quot;) and &quot;Take no Kido&quot; (竹の木戸 &quot;The Bamboo Gate&quot;), Kunikida indicated that he was turning more towards naturalism over romanticism.

Following the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Kunikida started a publishing business that went bankrupt two years later. The same year he founded a magazine, &quot;Fujin Gahō&quot;.

==Death==
Kunikida contracted tuberculosis in 1907 and moved to a sanatorium in Chigasaki in early 1908. He died from the disease in 1908 at the age of 36. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

==Trivia==
* Kunikida is a protagonist in the anime Bungo Stray Dogs, which features major Japanese literary figures, their biographies, and their own works to create fictional characters. Kunikida&#x27;s abilities in the series pay homage to his works as a poet. In the series, he works with the Armed Detective Agency and has an ability called &#x27;Matchless Poet.&#x27; He is friends with the character named after Katai Tayama and the writer&#x27;s short-lived relationship with Sasaki Nobuko also returns in the series.
* Kunikida also appears in Bungo and Alchemist, a web-based browser game produced by EXNOA and published by DMM.com

<doc id="186556" wikidata="Q2856394" url="?curid=186556" title="Sakunosuke Oda">
<text>was a Japanese writer. He is often grouped with Osamu Dazai and Ango Sakaguchi as the &quot;Buraiha.&quot; Literally meaning ruffian or hoodlum faction, this label was not a matter of a stylistic school but one bestowed upon them by conservative critics disparaging the authors&#x27; attitudes and subject matter.

==Life and Writings==
Oda&#x27;s writing career spans both prewar and postwar Japan. A native of Osaka, he wrote about most of life in that city and the customs and manners of the common people there. In 1939, his story &quot;Zokushu&quot; (, Vulgarity) was a candidate for the Akutagawa Prize. The following year, Oda published &quot;Meoto Zenzai&quot; (). Named after an Osaka sweet shop, it follows the life of a couple whose relationship survives despite the persistent wastefulness, debauchery, and unkept promises of the erring man.

Oda&#x27;s characters usually did not fit into what was traditionally considered appropriate forms, either in their frank humanness or in their stubborn individuality, as in &quot;Roppakukinsei&quot; (, Six Platinum Stars/Six White Venus, 1946), or out of the cruel necessity of survival. In the story &quot;Sesō&quot; (世相, The State of the Times, 1946), Oda describes the first months of the occupation period following Japan&#x27;s surrender at the end of World War II, which were marked by food shortages so severe that government rations were not enough even to sustain life and people turned to the black market to procure the food they needed for their survival. 
During Oda&#x27;s lifetime, several of his works were banned.

Oda also wrote radio drama scenarios and submitted a script to a magazine that was later made into the film &quot;Kaette kita otoko&quot; (還って来た男, &quot;The Returnee&quot;, 1944), by Kawashima Yūzō (it was the director&#x27;s commercial debut).

In addition to his fiction, Oda wrote many critical essays, most notably &quot;Kanōsei no bungaku&quot; (可能性の文学, &quot;The Literature of Possibility&quot;, 1946).

In 1947, after suffering from a lung hemorrhage, Oda died in Tokyo Hospital. After the funeral, his friend and fellow writer Osamu Dazai published an emotional eulogy blaming the critics for Oda&#x27;s sudden death. More likely, it was from a recurrent bout of tuberculosis. Oda is buried in Osaka.

In 1963, a monument was erected by Oda&#x27;s friends and colleagues near Hozenji Temple in Osaka. Hozenji Yokochō and its surrounding alleys are one of the main settings in &quot;Meoto Zenzai&quot;.

In 1983, under the sponsorship of the Osaka Bungaku Shinkōkai, a literary prize was established in Oda&#x27;s name to commemorate the 70th anniversary of his birth and to carry on the long tradition of Kansai literature. It is awarded annually to an outstanding work of fiction by a new author.

An autographed photograph of Oda hangs in the Osaka restaurant Jiyūken (). Jiyūken opened as a coffee and snack shop in 1910, and has become known for its style of &quot;curry rice&quot;. It is mentioned in Oda&#x27;s writings. The inscription says that Oda has died, but has left us some of the good flavors of curry rice in his writing. The photograph shows Oda writing while seated at a table in Jiyūken.

==Adaptations and Translations==

Several of Oda&#x27;s stories have been made into movies, including (2008) and, most notably, &quot;Meoto zenzai,&quot; which has been adapted four times, including an award-winning film, released in 1955, which was directed by Toyoda Shirō, and starred Morishige Hisaya and Awashima Chikage.

&quot;Meoto zenzai, Roppakukinsei,&quot; and &quot;Sesō&quot;, along with another story, &quot;Ki no Miyako&quot; (木の都, &quot;City of Trees&quot;, 1943–44), have been translated by Burton Watson and published together as &quot;Stories of Osaka Life&quot; (Columbia University Press, 1990; paperback, Weatherhill, 1994).

<doc id="186559" wikidata="Q895919" url="?curid=186559" title="Torahiko Terada">
<text>was a Japanese physicist and author who was born in Tokyo. He was a professor at Tokyo Imperial University, a researcher at RIKEN, and worked on a wide range of topics in physics. He was also a professor at the Earthquake Research Institute.

As an author, he studied under Natsume Sōseki, who was a teacher at his high school in Kumamoto. His pseudonym for his literature-related work was Fuyuhiko Yoshimura.

He is best known for his numerous essays on a wide variety of topics ranging from science to manga.

==Biography==

Torahiko Terada was born in 1878 in the Tokyo Kojimachi District. He was named &quot;Torahiko&quot; because he was born under the Year of the Tiger. While in high school in Kumamoto, the young Torahiko studied under Natsume Sōseki and science teacher Takuro Tamaru. It was the influence of both men whom Terada attributed his inspiration to seriously pursue studies of science and literature during the course of his life.

In 1897, Terada met and courted student Natsuko Sakai, who was to become his first wife. He continued his studies and in 1899, earned his PhD at the Tokyo Imperial University. His thesis concerned the acoustics of the Shakuhachi bamboo flute. His adviser during this period was Hantaro Nagaoka and Aikitsu Tanakadate.

In 1902, Natsuko Sakai died, prompting Terada to move on. In 1903, he graduated from the Experimental Physics Department of Tokyo Imperial University with chief honors. During this period, he courted Hiroko Hamaguchi, who was to become his second wife.

Finally in 1908, Terada obtained his Doctor of Science Degree and was elected to the position of an associate professor at Tokyo Imperial University. From there, he went to study abroad at the University of Berlin. While studying in Stockholm, he corresponded with Swedish physicist Svante Arrhenius. In 1911, Terada made the trek back home to Japan by way of Paris, the UK and the United States.

When he returned to Japan, he was assigned to oceanography studies by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. His results were published in the book &quot;Umi no Butsurigaku&quot;, published in 1913. Around this same period, Terada became heavily involved in studies of x-ray diffraction. Inspired by the work of Max von Laue, Terada devised a technique for greatly accelerating the photography process used for data gathering in these studies. However, Terada failed to get his results sent to &quot;Nature&quot; in time due to the distance of Japan from the publisher&#x27;s location. Consequently, the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, who had come to the same discoveries through their research. Terada turned away from X-ray diffraction studies and did not encourage his students to pursue the course. Despite this setback, Terada was still awarded the 7th Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy for his work in 1917. It was at about this same time that his second wife, Hiroko, died. After recovering, he courted Shin Sakai in 1918, who was to be his third and final spouse.

In 1922, Terada attended the welcome party for Albert Einstein during the physicist&#x27;s visit to Japan.

In 1923, the Great Kantō earthquake struck, prompting Terada to seriously begin investigations of the causes of the phenomenon. This led to the development of a new field of earthquake studies. In 1924, Terada was elected to the position of senior researcher at RIKEN Institute. In 1926, he founded the Earthquake Research Institute at the Tokyo Imperial University and served as one of the senior professors there. His research continued to develop and gain attention, and in 1928 he was elected as one of senior staff of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Academy.

In 1935, Terada began suffering from a bone tumor. He died on December 31, at the age of 57. His ashes were buried in a cemetery next to his childhood home in Kochi. The house has since been transformed into Torahiko Terada Memorial Museum.

==Legacy==
The small planet 6514 Torahiko is named in honor of him.

===In fiction===
*The character of the scientist Kangetsu Mizushima, from Natsume Sōseki&#x27;s novel &quot;I Am A Cat&quot;, is believed to have been modeled off Torahiko Terada.
*Torahiko Terada, along with many other historical figures from the Meiji Restoration, is a central character in the award-winning 1985 historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; by Hiroshi Aramata.
*The comedic play &quot;Fuyuhiko and the Good Luck Cat&quot; (1987) by Makino Nozomi is based on the life of Torahiko Terada (the title being derived from Terada&#x27;s pseudonym Fuyuhiko Yoshimura). The play is a dramatization of Terada&#x27;s life after the loss of his second wife, and his stress in holding his family together in the face of his third marriage. The production won the Yomiuri Theater Award in 1998.

<text>, , was a Japanese feminist activist. She was educated at a young age and pursued socialist and feminist goals for most of her adult life. She was a participant in the Osaka Incident of 1885, where approximately 130 liberal activists were arrested on their way to attempt to incite revolution and liberate Korea. The group had planned to provide guns, bombs, and manpower to support reformist movements in Korea before the police intercepted them. After being freed, Fukuda continued to pursue social and gender reforms in Japan, playing an active role in the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement which pushed for democratic changes to the government. She eventually established the magazine &quot;Sekai Fujin&quot; (Women of the World), which aimed at empowering women in Japan and getting them involved in international affairs. Throughout her life, Fukuda was involved in Japanese reform movements as they transitioned from aiming on increasing citizen&#x27;s political rights to the more socialist-focused waves which attempted to exact nationwide social and economic revisions.

Fukuda Hideko, born Kageyama Hideko, was the child of samurai Kageyama Katashi and his wife Umeko. Her mother was a teacher and often brought Fukuda along with her to school. Like some other prominent women in the reform movement, Fukuda&#x27;s family found her resistant to conforming to &quot;proper&quot; feminine behavior. Fukuda even described herself as a tomboy during her childhood. By fifteen, the bright Fukuda was exposed to Japanese, Chinese, and Western thought. Fukuda first began her political activities after encouragement from her friend and future fiancé Kobayashi Kusuo. It was Kobayashi who loaned her a translated biography of Joan of Arc, who Fukuda then aspired to emulate. In 1882 she was inspired by a speech from Toshiko Kishida, a prominent women&#x27;s right activist at the time, to join the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. The People&#x27;s Rights Movement was a group quickly garnering support that pushed for democracy and more egalitarian laws in the country. One year later, Fukuda and her mother founded an all-girls private school, at which they both taught. The school was founded on the ideals of the popular rights movement, and aimed at teaching children of working mothers. However, the school was shut down in 1884 on order of the government, which was worried about the spreading popularity of the People&#x27;s Rights Movement and the growing political ambitions of women. Angry and wishing to provide more significant support, Fukuda moved to Tokyo.

== The Osaka Incident ==

===Incident===
Soon after arriving in Tokyo she met Oi Kentaro, the leader of a radical wing of the Liberal Party. The group was an offshoot of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement that was sweeping across the nation. Fukuda joined the group in attempting to transport weapons and money to Korea. Their goal was to create a disturbance large enough to undo the Sino-Japanese accord signed in 1885. Both Fukuda and Kentaro were angered at the government&#x27;s perceived lack of action in Korea. They hoped that inciting reform movements there would either push the Japanese government into following suit or initiate a war, giving the liberals an opportunity to make domestic reforms. Fukuda helped raise funds for the Korean Revolutionary Movement, but she was frustrated by the lack of discipline and habit of many of the male members to go visit brothels, which delayed the group&#x27;s acquisition of supplies. However, eventually they succeeded in raising enough money and gathering weaponry, including guns and bombs. The party then traveled to Nagasaki on November 20, 1885, from where they planned to depart for Korea. However, the police had already been investigating the large number of robberies in the Osaka area caused by the group, and before the party could travel to Seoul, on November 23, 1885, the roughly 130 members were arrested and charged with the illegal possession of weapons and encouraging riots. Fukuda, the only female included in the trial, was given a sentence of eighteen months, but was released after ten months.

===Aftermath===
Although Fukuda wrote that she regretted her involvement in the incident, her trial was widely publicized and served to bring her national attention. The media popularized her as &quot;Japan&#x27;s Joan of Arc&quot;, and she was met with enthusiasm after her release. Afterwards, she and Oi Kentaro became involved in a relationship that produced one son. The partnership was short-lived, and within a year Oi had left her for another woman. Fukuda&#x27;s family came to Tokyo to support her, and together they opened a women&#x27;s vocational school. Shortly afterwards, however, her father, aunt, and brother died and Fukuda was unable to maintain running the school. In 1892 Fukuda married Fukuda Yusaku, another liberal intellectual, with whom she had three sons. Yusaku had studied in America and was influenced by the labor movement there. He became ill and died in 1900, leaving Fukuda the single mother to four children.

== Heiminsha ==
Fukuda went on to establish a women&#x27;s technological school one year later, relying on philanthropist support to teach impoverished women trade skills. Here she met Ishikawa Sanshiro, a reformist collaborator and eventual lover. She was introduced to socialism via her neighbor, Sakai Toshihiko. This was at the same time as Japan&#x27;s first socialist party-the Social Democratic party- was being created. Sakai was anti-war and promoted equal rights between men and women. In 1903 he and a group of collaborators called the Heiminsha started the Heimin Shimbun, a newspaper dedicated to spreading the socialist message. The paper, focusing on both domestic and foreign affairs, attracted worldwide attention and achieved wide circulation. Fukuda often socialized with members of the Heiminsha and attended their meetings. It was around this time that she published her autobiography &quot;Half my Life&quot;, which proved to be highly successful. &quot;Half my Life&quot; was the first autobiography written by a woman in Japan, and included references to the works of Benjamin Franklin, Joan of Arc, and Russian nihilists, among others. With the introduction of socialist thought, Fukuda&#x27;s views on reform began to solidify. She disagreed with Japan&#x27;s imperialist policies and the excesses of the upper class, but also found issue with the Liberal Party&#x27;s &quot;insincerity&quot; and disreputable behavior, which had led her to break off with the group responsible for the Osaka incident. The government eventually suppressed the Heimin Shimbun in 1905 due to the articles protesting the Russo-Japanese War.

== Later life and &quot;Sekai Fujin&quot; ==
===&quot;Sekai Fujin&quot;===
On January 1, 1907, the first issue of &quot;Sekai Fujin&quot; (Women of the World) was published. It was the first Japanese socialist women&#x27;s newspaper. Established by Fukuda, who was also its chief editor, and Ishikawa Sanshiro, the newspaper focused on women and reform interests. Fukuda declared the intention of the newspaper to be to “find women’s talent and vocation and to inspire women to join a reform movement based on their natural talent.&quot; While it included articles about domestic women&#x27;s interest, such as sewing or poetry, Sekai Fujin had an international emphasis and attempted to bring global ideas to women in Japan. Aside from extended discussion of socialist figures such as Karl Marx and Peter Kropotkin, Sekai Fujin also published translations of foreign fiction, such as Maxim Gorky&#x27;s Chelkash (as ) and Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s &quot;Le Diable&quot; (as ). Fukuda hoped the newspaper would advance the cause of women&#x27;s emancipation. Two major campaigns supported by the newspaper were the repeal of a law banning women from being a part of political meetings and the Yanaka Village Relief Campaign. The law, Article Five of the Police Security Regulations, specifically forbade women from joining political parties or taking a public role in policy or debates. Fukuda organized petitions to the Senate and helped the bill reach the House of Representatives, where it passed, but it repeatedly failed in the House of Peers.

===Yanaka Village===
Yanaka village was a small town near Tokyo that was the proposed site of a reservoir for the Watarase River. When some families refused to leave their homes, government officials began a series of attempts to force them off the land. Sekai Fujin backed the efforts of local villagers who refused to move out. Fukuda and her supporters provided funds and aid after the government officials destroyed the villagers houses and left the dike protecting the village from flood unrepaired. Following the end of the post-war economic boom, the government began to go after socialist groups with increased vigor. The Heimin Shimbun was shut down, labor revolts were violently repressed, the socialist party was banned, and Sakai Toshihiko was imprisoned. The government began a process of heavy suppression against Sekai Fujin, usually through heavy fines and censorship. The newspaper was eventually banned from discussing current events, and co-founder Ishikawa Sanshiro was arrested. This eventually forced Sekai Fujin to close down in 1909.

===Seito article===
Fukuda&#x27;s last years were spent in poverty and hardship. Ishikawa moved to Belgium and shortly afterwards Fukuda contracted beriberi. Nevertheless, she continued writing and had her article &quot;The Solution to the Woman Question&quot; printed in &quot;Seito&quot;, a popular women&#x27;s rights magazine. Inclusion of Fukuda&#x27;s article caused the entire issue to be banned. The government was especially sensitive to Fukuda&#x27;s article because it not only focused on women, but brought in issues of class. Fukuda saw the difficulties faced by women as intrinsically tied to the exploitative capitalist system in place, and yearned for a return to an agrarian-modeled society. The article also spurred intense debate within the Seito group, composed primarily of educated young women. Fukuda moved beyond the goals of many other prominent feminists by discussing the plight of the labor class and impoverished in Japan. Fukuda saw the issue of gender inequality as intrinsically tied in with class inequality, saying &quot;along with the liberation of women, the liberation of men, too, must be accomplished.&quot; Fukuda&#x27;s article pushed for an encompassing discussion of equality as a societal issue over the more personal approach taken by other leading feminists of the day. She was one of the pioneers of reform movements in Japan, and pursued reforms in the Meiji period longer than any other woman.

===Death===
Fukuda died on May 2, 1927, aged 61. While her role in helping trail blaze the feminist movement in Japan was not fully acknowledged until after her death, a group of activists celebrated her achievements 100 years after her birth by erecting a memorial in her honor in Okayama. The memorial includes a quotation from her autobiography: “My life has been one adversity upon another. But I always fought back. Not once, not even once, did I flinch from adversity.”

<doc id="186570" wikidata="Q176579" url="?curid=186570" title="Itō Sachio">
<text>was the pen-name of , a Japanese &quot;tanka&quot; poet and novelist active during the Meiji period of Japan.

==Biography==
Itō was born in what is now Sanmu city, Chiba prefecture, as the younger son to a farming family. He attended the &quot;Meiji Hōritsu gakko&quot; (the predecessor of Meiji University), but left without graduating.

His interest in poetry led him to visit the famous author Masaoka Shiki, who accepted him as a student. Itō established the literary magazine &quot;Araragi&quot; in 1903, and served as its editor until 1908. During this time, he published his poems, literary criticism and studies on the &quot;Man&#x27;yōshū.&quot; He published a sentimental love story, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Wild Daisy&quot;, 1906) in the literary magazine &quot;Hototogisu.&quot; The story became a popular classic, and was made into movies in 1955, 1966 and in 1981.

Itō came to be regarded as Masaoka Shiki&#x27;s closest disciple with the posthumous publication of his &quot;tanka&quot; anthology &quot;Sachio kashu&quot; in 1920. His own disciples included Saitō Mokichi and .

In addition to his literary career, Itō was also an amateur master of the Japanese tea ceremony. He died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

<text>was a Japanese linguist, born in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, Japan.

==Biography==
Hashimoto is especially noted for the discovery of Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai, which makes it clear that Old Japanese made more syllabic distinctions than later periods of the language. This discovery led him to hypothesize that Old Japanese had eight vowels, while modern Japanese has only five. His systematic description of the Japanese grammar also laid the foundations of language education for Japanese children.

<doc id="186576" wikidata="Q237948" url="?curid=186576" title="Ichiyō Higuchi">
<text>, known by her pen name , was a Japanese writer during the Meiji era. She was Japan&#x27;s first professional woman writer of modern literature, specializing in short stories and poetry, and was also an extensive diarist. Her portrait appears on the 5000 yen banknote in Japan.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Higuchi was born in Tokyo on 2 May 1872 as the fourth child and second daughter of Noriyoshi Higuchi, a samurai, and Ayame &quot;Taki&quot; Furuya. Official documentation states her name as Natsuko Higuchi, though she would often refer to herself as . Her parents were from a peasant community in nearby Yamanashi Prefecture, but her father had managed to procure samurai status in 1867. Despite only enjoying the position for a short time before the samurai caste was abolished with the Meiji Restoration, growing up in a samurai household was a formative experience for her.

In 1886, she began studying waka poetry at the Haginoya, a private school run by Utako Nakajima. There, she received weekly poetry lessons and lectures on Japanese literature. There were also monthly poetry competitions in which all students, previous and current, were invited to participate. Poetry taught at this school was that of the conservative court poets of the Heian period. She felt inferior and unprepossessing among the other students, the great majority of whom came from the upper-class.

Her compulsion to write became evident by 1891 when she began to keep a diary in earnest. It would become hundreds of pages long, covering five years left of her life. With her feelings of social inferiority, her timidity, and the increasing poverty of her family, her diary was the place where she could assert herself. Her diaries were also a place for her to assert objectivity and included her views on literary art as well as others&#x27; views on her work.

===Efforts to become a writer===
In 1889, two years after her oldest brother&#x27;s death, her father died. Following a failed business investment by her father, finances were very tight. Her fiancé (who later became a prosecutor, a judge, and the governor of Akita Prefecture) soon broke off their engagement. At the proposal of her teacher, she moved into the Haginoya as an apprentice, but left after a few months due to being unhappy with what she saw as an inordinate amount of household duties. Together with her mother and younger sister Kuniko, she moved to Hongō district, where the women earned their income by sewing and laundry work. Seeing the success of a classmate, Kaho Miyake, who had written a novel, &quot;Yabu no uguisu&quot; (lit. &quot;Bush warbler in the grove&quot;, 1888) and received abundant royalties, Higuchi decided to become a novelist to support her family.

Her initial efforts at writing fiction were in the form of a short story. In 1891, she met her future advisor, Tōsui Nakarai, who she assumed would help connect her with editors. She fell in love with him without knowing that, at 31, he had a reputation as a womanizer, nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature. Her mentor did not return her love, and instead treated her as a younger sister. This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi&#x27;s fiction.

In March 1892, she gave her literary debut with the story &quot;Yamizakura&quot; (&quot;Flowers at Dusk&quot;), published in the first issue of the magazine &quot;Musashino&quot;, under her pen name Higuchi Ichiyō. The stories from this first period (1892–1894) suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry. Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training. The plots were thin, there was little development of character, and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment, especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary. However, her style developed rapidly. Several of her trademark themes appear: for example, the triangular relationship among a lonely, beautiful, young woman who has lost her parents, a handsome man who has abandoned her (and remains in the background), and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin who falls in love with her. Another theme Higuchi repeated was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class.

The story &quot;Umoregi&quot; (lit. &quot;In Obscurity&quot;) signaled Higuchi&#x27;s arrival as a professional writer. It was published in the prestigious journal &quot;Miyako no hana&quot; in November and December 1892, only nine months after she had started writing in earnest. Her work was noticed, and she was recognized as a promising new author.

===Last years===

In 1893, Higuchi, her mother, and her sister abandoned their middle-class house and moved to a poor neighborhood where they opened a stationery store that failed. Their new dwelling was a five-minute walk from Tokyo&#x27;s red-light district Yoshiwara. Her experience living in this neighborhood would provide material for several of her later stories, especially &quot;Takekurabe&quot;, (lit. &quot;Comparing heights&quot;; &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; in the Robert Lyons Danly translation, &quot;Growing Up&quot; in the Edward Seidensticker translation).

The stories of her mature period (1894–1896) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women, but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku, a 17th-century writer, whose stories she had recently discovered. His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low-life characters as worthwhile literary subjects. What Higuchi added was a special awareness of suffering and sensitivity. To this period belong &quot;Ōtsugomori&quot; (&quot;On the Last Day of the Year&quot;), &quot;Nigorie&quot; (&quot;Troubled Waters&quot;), &quot;Jūsan&#x27;ya&quot; (&quot;The Thirteenth Night&quot;), &quot;Takekurabe,&quot; and &quot;Wakaremichi&quot; (&quot;Separate Ways&quot;).

With these last stories, her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment. She was commended for her traditional style and was called &quot;the last woman of the old Meiji&quot; in reflection of her evocation of the past. In her modest home, she was visited by other writers, students of poetry, admirers, critics, and editors requesting her collaboration. Due to constant interruptions and frequent headaches, Higuchi stopped writing. As her father and her oldest brother had before her, she contracted tuberculosis. She died on 23 November 1896 at the age of 24. She was buried in Tsukiji Hongan-ji Wadabori Cemetery in Suginami, Tokyo.

==Selected works==
At the time of her death, Higuchi left behind 21 short stories, nearly 4,000 poems (which are regarded being of lesser quality than her prose), numerous essays and a multivolume diary. The year refers to the date of first publication.

==Translations==
Higuchi&#x27;s stories have been translated into a variety of languages. The first English translation dates back as early as 1903 (&quot;Ōtsugomori&quot;, as &quot;The Last Day of the Year&quot;, by Tei Fujio). In 1981, a selection of nine of her stories appeared with new translations provided by Robert Lyons Danly.

Some stories have also been translated from classical Japanese language, in which all of Higuchi&#x27;s works are written, into modern Japanese, like Hiromi Itō&#x27;s translation of &quot;Nigorie&quot; or Fumiko Enchi&#x27;s translation of &quot;Takekurabe&quot;.

==Legacy==
Higuchi&#x27;s portrait adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004, becoming the third woman to appear on a Japanese banknote, after Empress Jingū in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000. 

Her stories &quot;Ōtsugomori&quot;, &quot;Nigorie&quot;, &quot;Jūsan&#x27;ya&quot; and &quot;Takekurabe&quot; have been repeatedly adapted for film and television, notably &quot;An Inlet of Muddy Water&quot; (1953, dir. Tadashi Imai) and &quot;Takekurabe&quot; (1955, dir. Heinosuke Gosho).

A film based on Higuchi&#x27;s life, &quot;Higuchi Ichiyō&quot;, was released in 1939, starring Isuzu Yamada and directed by Kyotaro Namiki. Higuchi was also the protagonist of a theatre play by Hisashi Inoue, &quot;Zutsuu katakori Higuchi Ichiyō&quot;, which was first performed in 1984.

<doc id="186577" wikidata="Q617645" url="?curid=186577" title="Shūzō Kuki">
<text>was a Japanese art critic, philosopher, and poet.

==Early life==
Kuki was the fourth child of Baron Kuki Ryūichi (九鬼 隆一) a high bureaucrat in the Meiji Ministry for Culture and Education (Monbushō). Since it appears that Kuki&#x27;s mother, Hatsu, was already pregnant when she fell in love with Okakura Kakuzō (岡倉 覚三), otherwise known as Okakura Tenshin (岡倉 天心), a protégé of her husband&#x27;s (a notable patron of the arts), the rumour that Okakura was Kuki&#x27;s father would appear to be groundless. It is true, however, that Shūzō as a child, after his mother had separated and then divorced his father, thought of Okakura, who often visited, as his real father, and later certainly hailed him as his spiritual father. From Okakura, he gained much of his fascination for aesthetics and perhaps foreign languages, as indeed his fascination with the peculiar cultural codes of the pleasure quarters of Japan owes something to the fact that his mother had once been a geisha.

At age 23 in 1911 (Meiji 44), Kuki converted to Catholicism; and he was baptized in Tokyo as Franciscus Assisiensis Kuki Shūzō. The idealism and introspection implied by this decision were early evidence of issues which would have resonance in the characteristic mindset of the mature man.

A graduate in philosophy of Tokyo Imperial University, Kuki spent eight years in Europe to polish his knowledge of languages and deepen his already significant studies of contemporary Western thought. At the University of Heidelberg, he studied under the neo-Kantian Heinrich Rickert, and he engaged Eugen Herrigel as a tutor. At the University of Paris, he was impressed by the work of Henri Bergson, whom he came to know personally; and he engaged the young Jean-Paul Sartre as a French tutor. It is little known outside Japan that Kuki influenced Jean-Paul Sartre to develop an interest in Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy.

At the University of Freiburg, Kuki studied phenomenology under Edmund Husserl; and he first met Martin Heidegger in Husserl&#x27;s home. He moved to the University of Marburg for Heidegger&#x27;s 1927/1928 winter semester lectures on the phenomenological interpretation of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; (published as volume 25 in the Heidegger Gesamtausgabe), and for Heidegger&#x27;s seminar &quot;Schelling&#x27;s Essay on the Essence of Human Freedom.&quot; The following semester (Summer, 1928) he attended Heidegger&#x27;s lecture on logic in the light of Leibniz (&quot;HGA&quot; 26) and his seminar on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;. Fellow students during these years in Europe were Tetsurō Watsuji and Kiyoshi Miki.

==Career==
Shortly after Kuki&#x27;s return to Japan, he wrote and published his masterpiece, &quot;The Structure of &quot;Iki&quot;&quot; (1930). In this work he undertakes to make a phenomenological analysis of &quot;iki&quot;, a variety of chic culture current among the fashionable set in Edo in the Tokugawa period, and asserted that it constituted one of the essential values of Japanese culture.

Kuki took up a teaching post at Kyoto University, then a prominent center for conservative cultural values and thinking. His early lectures focused on Descartes and Bergson. In the context of a faculty with a primarily Germanic philosophical background, his lectures offered a somewhat different perspective based on the work of French philosophers.

He became an Associate Professor in 1933 (&quot;Shōwa&quot; 8); and in that same year, he published the first book length study of Martin Heidegger to appear in Japanese. In this context, it is noteworthy that the German philosopher explicitly referenced a conversation &quot;between a Japanese and an inquirer&quot; in &quot;On the Way to Language&quot; (&quot;Aus einem Gespräch von der Sprache&quot;). Also, Heidegger expressed a desire to have written the preface to the German translation of &quot;The Structure of &quot;Iki&quot;.&quot;

At the University of Kyoto, Kuki was elevated to Professor of Philosophy in March 1934 (&quot;Shōwa&quot; 10). The next year, he published &quot;The Problem of Contingency&quot;, also known as &quot;The Problem of the Accidental.&quot; This work was developed from his personal experiences in Europe and the influences of Heidegger. As a single Japanese man within an encompassing &quot;white&quot; or non-Japanese society, he considered the extent to which he became a being who lacked necessity. His Kyoto University lectures on Heidegger, &quot;Man and Existence&quot;, were published in 1939.

From the mid-thirties, while Japan drifted towards totalitarianism and the war in China dragged on, Kuki seemed not to be much disturbed by the growth of fascism.

In 1941, at the age of 53, Kuki died following an attack of peritonitis. His manuscripts are now kept in the Konan University Library.

<doc id="186585" wikidata="Q1396664" url="?curid=186585" title="Kanoko Okamoto">
<text>, born , was the pen-name of a Japanese author, tanka poet, and Buddhist scholar active during the Taishō and early Shōwa periods of Japan.

==Early life==
Kanoko&#x27;s maiden name was Ōnuki Kano. She was born in Aoyama, Akasaka-ku (present day Minato, Tokyo), to an extremely wealthy family. Her father suffered from lung disease, and Kanoko was sent to the Ōnuki family estate in Futako Tamagawa, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, where she was raised by a governess. Her tutor encouraged her affinity for music, calligraphy and traditional dance, and introduced her to Japanese classical literature, especially the &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; and .

==Literary career==
Okamoto was influenced greatly by her older brother, Shosen, and his classmate Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki who studied at the First Higher School and Tokyo Imperial University. While still a student at the Atami Gakuen girls&#x27; high school, Kanoko called on the poet, Yosano Akiko, and this encounter prompted her to start contributing to the poetry magazine (&quot;Bright Star&quot;). Along with Yosano, she joined Hiratsuka Raichō, Tamura Toshiko, and others, to be one of the initial contributors to the influential &quot;Bluestocking&quot; () journal, helping to set the course for women writers and feminist ideas, in 1911. Later, she played an active part as a key contributor to another journal, (&quot;Pleiades&quot;). She published , the first of her five anthologies, in 1912.

Okamoto Kanoko is an authority on Buddhism, after she plunged into Buddhist practice and research during her marriage to the famous cartoonist Okamoto Ippei. 

In 1908, she met cartoonist Okamoto Ippei while on a holiday in Karuizawa, Nagano, together with her father. However, her family was extremely opposed to the relationship, and she created a scandal by moving in together with him in 1910 without marrying. Their eldest son, the &quot;avant-garde&quot; painter Tarō Okamoto, was born the next year. However, Kanoko&#x27;s family life was filled with tragedy. Soon after she moved in with Ippei, her brother and then her mother died. Her eldest daughter was born with mental health problems, and soon died. Her common-law husband was opposed to her independence, jealous of her artistic successes and was unfaithful. Her younger son was also born with weak health, and died in infancy.

These problems led Okamoto to turn to religion. She was first interested in Protestant Christianity, but did not find it to her liking. She then turned to the Jodo Shinshu sect of Buddhism, as expounded by Shinran, which was the start of her work as a researcher of Buddhism, about which she wrote numerous essays. 

After releasing her fourth &quot;tanka&quot; anthology (&quot;My Last Anthology&quot;) in 1929, she decided to become a novelist. She took her whole family to Europe to complete her literary studies. They traveled to Paris, London, Berlin, and (leaving their son behind) toured around the United States, returning to Japan in 1932.

After returning home, Okamoto continued her researches into Buddhism, but also found time to a novelette called (&quot;The Dying Crane&quot;), describing the last days of writer Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, while staying at an inn near Kamakura Station in the summer of 1923. Published in the magazine in 1936, it marked the start of her activity with prose fiction.

After that, she published many more works in quick succession, including (&quot;The Relationship between Mother and Child&quot;), (&quot;A Riot of Goldfish&quot;), and (&quot;Portrait of an Old Geisha&quot;). A recurring theme in her work is the effect of a person&#x27;s familial ancestral karma on their present-day lives. While praising the richness of her use of language, some critics have felt that she tended towards excessive passion and unnecessary literary flourishes.

She died of a brain hemorrhage in 1939. She was 49 years old. Her grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, Tokyo.

Because she did not begin writing actively until her later years, most of her works were published posthumously.

Kanoko Okamoto has always wanted to become a novelist, but only began publishing ‘secular’ fiction until the end of her life. Her reputation as a fiction writer was assured with the publication of her novella Boshi Jojo (A Mother’s Love.) Boshi Jojo is published in 1937, and is a daring look at the erotic side of maternal feeling.

Okamoto Kanoko dedicated herself to presenting straightforward images of strong, mysterious, even shamanic female characters. The combination of power and female beauty is represented in many of her works including ‘A Mother’s Love,’ ‘A Riot of Goldfish,’ and ‘The Record of Old Geisha.’ Her works like ‘Kakoze’ also explore themes like homoerotic aestheticism and the female gaze.

<doc id="186586" wikidata="Q7505122" url="?curid=186586" title="Shunrō Oshikawa">
<text>was a Japanese author, journalist and editor, best known as a pioneer of science fiction.

==Education and early career==
While studying law at Tōkyō Senmon Gakkō (present day Waseda University) at the turn of the century, Oshikawa published &quot;Kaitō Bōken Kidan: Kaitei Gunkan&quot; (海島冒険奇譚 海底軍艦 lit. &quot;Undersea Warship: A Fantastic Tale of Island Adventure&quot;), the story of an armoured, ram-armed submarine in a future history of war between Japan and Russia.

The novel reflects the tensions existing between Japan and Russia at the time, and foreshadowed the Russo-Japanese War that followed in 1904.

Oshikawa&#x27;s father was Masayoshi Oshikawa, evangelist, political activist and founder and first president of Tohoku Gakuin University and his brother was Kiyoshi Oshikawa, founder of the first professional baseball team in Japan. While at Waseda, Oshikawa played on the baseball team under Abe Isoo, along with his brother. He wrote a prologue for a baseball technique book that came from this trip, discussing how baseball should be considered the same as bushidō in spirit. He was a member of the Waseda team that in 1905 traveled to the U.S. to play American teams, the first time for Japanese baseball.

==Influences and later works==
Like other early science fiction writers of the period, he was influenced by the stories of Jules Verne, whose technological adventure novels had become popular in translation in the rapidly modernising Meiji era Japan. Specifically, the above-mentioned speculative conception of submarine warfare, based on ramming and making no mention of torpedoes, is shared with Verne (see &quot;Facing the Flag&quot;, &quot;HMS Sword&quot;).

Later, &quot;Kaitei gunkan&quot; became the first in a wildly successful, six-volume series set in the Pacific and Indian Oceans: &quot;Bukyō no Nippon&quot; (武侠の日本 lit. Heroic Japan, 1902), &quot;Shinzō Gunkan&quot; (新造軍艦 lit. The Newly Built Battleship, 1904), &quot;Bukyō Kantai&quot; (武侠艦隊 lit. Heroic Armada, 1904), &quot;Shin Nippontō&quot; (新日本島 lit. New Japan Isle, 1906), and &quot;Tōyō Bukyō Dan&quot; (東洋武侠団 lit. East Asian Heroic Troupe, 1907). The books remained in print for many years and later got much additional attention through a successful film adaptation.

Oshikawa was enthusiastic about sports, especially baseball, and famously clashed with Inazō Nitobe (one of the main proponents of the &quot;baseball considered harmful&quot; or &quot;野球害毒論&quot; argument).

He has also contributed to the development of the Japanese detective fiction. Some of his stories incorporated elements of ratiocination, sleuthing, mystery and crime within stories of adventure, intrigue, the bizarre and the grotesque – though in his time this did not yet become a distinct genre on its own.

In the detailed list compiled by &quot;The Victorian Bookshelf&quot; project of &quot;Confluence 2000,&quot; tracing the early development of &quot;The Scientific Romance and other Related Works&quot;, Oshikawa Shunrō is the only non-Western author mentioned for the pre-1900 period. 
However, all the above is inextricably mixed with Oshikawa&#x27;s share in and responsibility for helping to perpetuate in Japanese popular culture – especially through works greatly influencing children and youths which remained in print for many decades after his own time – themes of Japanese nationalism and patriotism, some which can be considered to promote militarism and imperialism as well.

As noted by Jeffrey M. Angles in his 2003 Ohio State University dissertation on Japanese popular authors in the early Twentieth Century, Shunro is best remembered in Japan for his important role in developing adventure tales into an independent genre of children&#x27;s fiction. 

Oshikawa entered the publishing company Hakubunkan at the introduction of the author Iwaya Sazanami (1870–1933) and served as a lead reporter for &quot;Shaijitsu Gahō&quot; (写実画報 lit. Graphic Pictorial), a magazine that featured stories and photos about the Russo-Japanese War of 1904. This magazine ceased publication in 1907, but Oshikawa became co-editor of another Hakubunkan magazine, &quot;Bōken sekai&quot; (冒険世界 lit. World of Adventure).

During and following the war with Russia there was a strong patriotic wave in Japan, and – though their country had won a decisive victory over the Russians and capitalized upon it to annex Korea – some Japanese were left feeling dissatisfied with the war&#x27;s achievements. An earlier magazine – &quot;Tanken Sekai&quot; (探検世界 lit. World of Exploration), published by Hakubunkan&#x27;s competitor Seikōzasshisha (成功雑誌社) – catered to those wishing to read tales of Japanese adventure and exploration abroad and fantasies of imperialistic superiority and Japanese valor, in which fiction was mixed with more or less factual accounts of exploration, record-breaking achievements and &quot;unusual customs&quot; from around the world.

Hakubunkan&#x27;s &quot;Bōken sekai&quot; (冒険世界), which Oshikawa co-edited, was – as clearly shown by researcher Kawataro Nakajima – designed to appeal to the same kind of public, which had shown itself attracted to tales of military adventure and heroism. &quot;Bōken Sekai&quot; often contained allegedly true stories of adventure, exploration, military prowess and accounts of &quot;primitive&quot; lands, all of which reflected Japanese nationalism and imperial ambitions. At the same time, however, it also published mysteries, including translations of Western Detective Stories, as well as ghost stories. Virtually every issue of the magazine included a story or article by Oshikawa himself.

After a dispute with his publisher, Oshikawa left Hakubunkan. In October 1911 he founded the magazine &quot;Bukyō Sekai&quot; (武侠世界 lit. World of Heroism) with the capital of an entrepreneur named Yanaginuma Kensuke, whose publishing house (Bukyō Sekaisha, later Bukyōsha) concentrated at the time on books of adventure, sports and physical activity for young people. Oshikawa&#x27;s new monthly magazine, which he edited until his death, strongly resembled his earlier one, and it too carried tales of exploration, non-fictional adventure stories, editorials, sports-related tales, and translations of mysteries. 

On August 6, 1914, Oshikawa was accompanied by several of the magazine&#x27;s editors, contributors, illustrators and fans on an outing to a lakeshore in the northern part of the Kantō region. Possibly because of his death shortly afterwards, that outing seemed to be long remembered by and influence the later work of participants such as the artist Kosugi Misei who had illustrated many of Oshikawa&#x27;s stories and followed him from his earlier magazine to the later one. 

Oshikawa&#x27;s works were never translated in any significant way to Western languages, leaving his literary influence limited mainly to Japan itself. However, the many loose film adaptations of his books, starting in the 1960s, did gain a considerable audience in America and Europe, such as &quot;Kaitei Gunkan&quot; (1963, released in the US as &quot;Atragon&quot;) – an adaptation which came to be considered &quot;a Classic of Science Fiction Films&quot; – and &quot;Shin Kaitei Gunkan&quot; (1996 and 1998, released in the US as &quot;Super Atragon&quot;). 

The film versions were considerably different from the original, both due to the addition of Science Fiction and Fantasy elements such as a kaiju and because the handling of Oshikawa&#x27;s nationalist themes was influenced by Japan&#x27;s American-enforced transformation into a secular and pacifistic culture after the Surrender of Japan.

The &quot;Bukyō Sekai&quot; magazine survived its founder and continued publication after Oshikawa&#x27;s death, until 1923.

The book &quot;&quot;, by Jun&#x27;ya Yokota and Shingo Aizu, won the Nihon SF Taisho Award for 1988.

<doc id="186588" wikidata="Q767226" url="?curid=186588" title="Hiraide Shū">
<text>was a novelist, poet, and lawyer in late Meiji period Japan. As a lawyer, he was noted for his involvement in the defense of the accused in the High Treason Incident.

== Biography ==
Born the eighth son of a relatively prosperous farming family in rural Niigata prefecture, Hiraide graduated from the &quot;Meiji Hōritsu Gakkō&quot; (the predecessor to the legal school of Meiji University) in 1903. He opened his own legal office in the Jimbocho area of Kanda, Tokyo in 1904. This district was (and still is) noted for the large number of publishers and book dealers based in the area.

Hiraide was one of the founding members of the literary journal &quot;Subaru&quot;. As a lawyer, Hiraide received widespread fame (or notoriety, depending on political viewpoint) for his defense of anarchist author Ōsugi Sakae, the defendants in the High Treason Incident, and for his defense of feminist poet Yosano Akiko over government criticism of her anti-war poetry.

<doc id="186589" wikidata="Q55993" url="?curid=186589" title="Kenji Miyazawa">
<text>was a Japanese novelist, poet, and children&#x27;s literature writer from Hanamaki, Iwate, in the late Taishō and early Shōwa periods. He was also known as an agricultural science teacher, vegetarian, cellist, devout Buddhist, and utopian social activist.

Some of his major works include &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;, &quot;Kaze no Matasaburō&quot;, &quot;Gauche the Cellist&quot;, and &quot;The Night of Taneyamagahara&quot;. Miyazawa converted to Nichiren Buddhism after reading the Lotus Sutra, and joined the Kokuchūkai, a Nichiren Buddhist organization. His religious and social beliefs created a rift between him and his wealthy family, especially his father, though after his death his family eventually followed him in converting to Nichiren Buddhism. Miyazawa founded the Rasu Farmers Association to improve the lives of peasants in Iwate Prefecture. He was also interested in Esperanto and translated some of his poems into that language.

He died of pneumonia in 1933. Almost totally unknown as a poet in his lifetime, Miyazawa&#x27;s work gained its reputation posthumously, and enjoyed a boom by the mid-1990s on his centenary. A museum dedicated to his life and works was opened in 1982 in his hometown. Many of his children&#x27;s stories have been adapted as anime, most notably &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;. Many of his tanka and free verse poetry, translated into many languages, are still popular today.

==Biography==
Miyazawa was born in the town of Hanamaki, Iwate, the eldest son of a wealthy pawnbroking couple, Masajirō and his wife Ichi. The family were also pious followers of the Pure Land Sect, as were generally the farmers in that district. His father, from 1898 onwards, organized regular meetings in the district where monks and Buddhist thinkers gave lectures and Miyazawa, together with his younger sister, took part in these meetings from an early age. The area was an impoverished rice-growing region, and he grew to be troubled by his family&#x27;s interest in money-making and social status. Miyazawa was a keen student of natural history from an early age, and also developed an interest as a teenager in poetry, coming under the influence of a local poet, Takuboku Ishikawa. After graduating from middle school, he helped out in his father&#x27;s pawnshop. By 1918, he was writing in the tanka genre, and had already composed two tales for children. In high school he converted to the &quot;Hokke&quot; sect after reading the Lotus Sutra, a move which was to bring him into conflict with his father.
In 1918, he graduated from . He embraced vegetarianism in the same year. A bright student, he was then given a position as a special research student in geology, developing an interest in soil science and in fertilizers. Later in 1918, he and his mother went to Tokyo to look after his younger sister , who had fallen ill while studying in Japan Women&#x27;s University He returned home after his sister had recovered early the following year.

As a result of differences with his father over religion, his repugnance for commerce, and the family pawnshop business in particular (he yielded his inheritance to his younger brother Seiroku), he left Hanamaki for Tokyo in January 1921. There, he joined Tanaka Chigaku&#x27;s Kokuchūkai, and spent several months in dire poverty preaching Nichiren Buddhism in the streets. After eight months in Tokyo, he took once more to writing children&#x27;s stories, this time prolifically, under the influence of another Nichiren priest, Takachiyo Chiyō, who dissuaded him from the priesthood by convincing him that Nichiren believers best served their faith by striving to embody it in their profession. He returned to Hanamaki due to the renewed illness of his beloved younger sister. At this time he became a teacher at the Agricultural School in Hanamaki. On November 27, 1922, Toshi finally succumbed to her illness and died at age 24. This was a traumatic shock for Miyazawa, from which he never recovered. He composed three poems on the day of her death, collectively entitled .

He found employment as a teacher in agricultural science at Hanamaki Agricultural High School (花巻農学校). He managed to put out a collection of poetry, in April 1924, thanks to some borrowings and a major grant from a producer of nattō. His collection of children&#x27;s stories and fairy tales, &quot;Chūmon no Ōi Ryōriten&quot; (注文の多い料理店, &quot;The Restaurant of Many Orders&quot;), also self-published, came out in December of the same year. Although neither were commercial successes — they were largely ignored — his work did come to the attention of the poets Kōtarō Takamura and Shinpei Kusano, who admired his writing greatly and introduced it to the literary world.

Kenji resigned his post as a teacher in 1926 to become a farmer and help improve the lot of the other farmers in the impoverished north-eastern region of Japan by sharing his theoretical knowledge of agricultural science, by imparting to them improved, modern techniques of cultivation. He also taught his fellow farmers more general topics of cultural value, such as music, poetry, and whatever else he thought might improve their lives. He introduced them to classical music by playing to audiences compositions from Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner and Debussy on his gramophone. In August 1926 he established the . When asked what &quot;Rasuchijin&quot; meant, he said it meant nothing in particular, but he was probably thinking of and . He introduced new agricultural techniques and more resistant strains of rice. At the detached house of his family, where he was staying at the time, he gathered a group of youths from nearby farming families and lectured on agronomy. The Rasuchijin Society also engaged in literary readings, plays, music and other cultural activities. It was disbanded after two years as Japan was being swept up by a militarist turn, in 1928, when the authorities closed it down.

Not all of the local farmers were grateful for his efforts, with some sneering at the idea of a city-slicker playing farmer, and others expressing disappointment that the fertilizers Kenji introduced were not having the desired effects. He advocated natural fertilizers, while many preferred a Western chemical &#x27;fix&#x27;, which, when it failed, did not stop many from blaming Kenji. Their reservations may have also persisted as he had not wholly broken from economic dependence on his father, to whom farmers were often indebted when their crops failed, in addition to his defection to the Lotus Sect soured their view, as farmers in his area were, like his own father, adherents of the Pure Land Sect. Kenji in turn did not hold an ideal view of the farmers; in one of his poems he describes how a farmer bluntly tells him that all his efforts have done no good for anyone.

According to Sibayama Zyun&#x27;iti, he started learning Esperanto in 1926, but never reached a high level in the language. He also studied English and German. At some point he translated some of his poems into Esperanto; the translated pieces were published in 1953, long after his death. According to Jouko Lindstedt, Kenji was made interested in Esperanto by the Finnish scientist and Esperantist Gustaf John Ramstedt, who was working as a diplomat for Finland in Japan.

Kenji&#x27;s writings from this period show sensitivity for the land and for the people who work in it. He was a prolific writer of children&#x27;s stories, many of which appear superficially light or humorous but include messages intended for the moral education of the reader. He wrote some works in prose and some stage plays for his students and left behind a large amount of &quot;tanka&quot; and free verse, most of which was discovered and published posthumously. His poetry, which has been translated into numerous languages, has a considerable following to this day. A number of his children&#x27;s works have been made into animated movies, anime, in Japan.

He showed little interest in romantic love or sex, both in his private life and in his literary work. Kenji&#x27;s close friend wrote that he died a virgin.

===Illness and death===
Kenji fell ill in summer 1928, and by the end of that year this had developed into acute pneumonia. He once wept on learning that he had been tricked into eating carp liver. He struggled with pleurisy for many years and was sometimes incapacitated for months at a time. His health improved nonetheless sufficiently for him to take on consultancy work with a rock-crushing company in 1931. The respite was brief; by September of that year, on a visit to Tokyo, he caught pneumonia and had to return to his hometown. In the autumn of 1933, his health seemed to have improved enough for him to watch a local Shinto procession from his doorway; a group of local farmers approached him and engaged him in conversation about fertilizer for about an hour. He died the following day, having been exhausted by the length of his discussion with the farmers. On his deathbed he asked his father to print 1,000 copies of the Lotus Sutra for distribution. His family initially had him buried in the family Pure Land temple Anjōji , but when they converted to Nichiren Buddhism in 1951, he was moved to the Nichiren temple Shinshōji. After his death, he became known in his district as Kenji-bosatsu (賢治菩薩).

Miyazawa left his manuscripts to his younger brother Seiroku, who kept them through the Pacific War and eventually had them published.

==Early writings==
Kenji started writing poetry as a schoolboy, and composed over a thousand &quot;tanka&quot; beginning at roughly age 15, in January 1911, a few weeks after the publication of Takuboku&#x27;s &quot;A Handful of Sand&quot;. He favoured this form until the age of 24. Keene said of these early poems that they &quot;were crude in execution, [but] they already prefigure the fantasy and intensity of emotion that would later be revealed in his mature work&quot;.

Kenji was removed physically from the poetry circles of his day. He was an avid reader of modern Japanese poets such as Hakushū Kitahara and Sakutarō Hagiwara, and their influence can be traced on his poetry, but his life among farmers has been said to have influenced his poetry more than these literary interests. When he first started writing modern poetry, he was influenced by Kitahara, as well as his fellow Iwatean Takuboku Ishikawa

Kenji&#x27;s works were influenced by contemporary trends of romanticism and the proletarian literature movement. His readings in Buddhist literature, particularly the Lotus Sutra, to which he became devoted, also came to have an influence on his writings.

In 1919, his sister prepared a collection of 662 of his &quot;tanka&quot; for publication. Kenji edited a volume of extracts from Nichiren’s writings, the year before he join the Kokuchūkai (see below).

He largely abandoned tanka by 1921, and turned his hand instead to the composition of free verse, involving an extension of the conventions governing tanka verse forms. He is said also to have written three thousand pages a month worth of children&#x27;s stories during this period, thanks to the advice of a priest in the Nichiren order, Takachiyo Chiyō. At the end of the year he managed to sell one of these stories for five yen, which was the only payment he received for his writings during his own lifetime.

==Later poetry==
The &quot;charms of Kenji&#x27;s poetry&quot;, critic Makota Ueda writes, include &quot;his high idealism, his intensely ethical life, his unique cosmic vision, his agrarianism, his religious faith, and his rich and colorful vocabulary.&quot; Ultimately, Ueda writes, &quot;they are all based in a dedicated effort to unify the heterogeneous elements of modern life into a single, coherent whole.&quot;

It was in 1922 that Kenji began composing the poetry that would make up his first collection, &quot;Haru to Shura&quot;. The day his sister died, November 27, 1922, he composed three long poems commemorating her, which Keene states to be among the best of his work. Keene also remarks that the speed at which Kenji composed these poems was characteristic of the poet, as a few months prior he had composed three long poems, one more than 900 lines long, in three days. The first of these poems on the death of his sister was , which was the longest. Keene calls it the most affecting of the three. It is written in the form of a &quot;dialogue&quot; between Kenji and Toshi (or Toshiko, as he often calls her). Several lines uttered by his sister are written in a regional dialect so unlike Standard Japanese that Kenji provided translations at the end of the poem. The poem lacks any kind of regular meter, but draws its appeal from the raw emotion it expresses; Keene suggests that Kenji learned this poetic technique from Sakutarō Hagiwara.

Kenji could write a huge volume of poetry in a short time, based mostly on impulse, seemingly with no preconceived plan of how long the poem would be and without considering future revisions.

Donald Keene has speculated that his love of music affected the poetry he was writing in 1922, as this was when he started collecting records of western music, particularly Bach and Beethoven. Much of his poetic tone derives from synesthesia involving music becoming color, especially after the period 1921 and 1926 when he started listening to music of Debussy, Wagner and Strauss.

He was associated with the poetry magazine .

Only the first part in four of &quot;Haru to Shura&quot; was published during Kenji&#x27;s lifetime. It appeared in an edition of one thousand copies, but only one hundred sold. For most of his literary career his poems saw publication only in local papers and magazines, but by the time of his death major literary publications had been made aware of him; he died just as his fame was beginning to spread.

With the exception of a few poems in classical Japanese written near the end of his life, virtually all Myazawa&#x27;a modern poetry was in colloquial Japanese, occasionally even in dialect. The poems included in &quot;Haru to Shura&quot; include a liberal sprinkling of scientific vocabulary, Sanskrit phrases, Sino-Japanese compounds and even some Esperanto words. After starting out with traditional &quot;tanka&quot;, he developed a preference for long, free verse, but continued to occasionally compose &quot;tanka&quot; even as late as 1921.

Kenji wrote his most famous poem, &quot;Ame ni mo makezu&quot;, in his notebook on November 3, 1931. Keene was dismissive of the poetic value of the poem, stating that it is &quot;by no means one of Miyazawa&#x27;s best poems&quot; and that it is &quot;ironic that [it] should be the one poem for which he is universally known&quot;, but that the image of a sickly and dying Kenji writing such a poem of resolute self-encouragement is striking.

==Later fiction==
Kenji wrote rapidly and tirelessly. He wrote a great number of children&#x27;s stories, many of them intended to assist in moral education.

His best-known stories include , , , , , , and 

==Other writings==
In 1919, Kenji edited a volume of extracts from the writings of Nichiren, and in December 1925 a in the &quot;Iwate Nippo&quot; under a pseudonym.

==Religious beliefs==
Kenji was born into a family of Pure Land Buddhists, but in 1915 converted to Nichiren Buddhism upon reading the Lotus Sutra and being captivated by it. His conversion created a rift with his relatives, but he nevertheless became active in trying to spread the faith of the Lotus Sutra, walking the streets crying &quot;Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō&quot;. In January 1921 he made several unsuccessful attempts to convert his family to Nichiren Buddhism.

From January to September 1921, he lived in Tokyo working as a street proselytizer for the Kokuchūkai, a Buddhist-nationalist organization that had initially turned down his service. The general consensus among modern Kenji scholars is that he became estranged from the group and rejected their nationalist agenda, but a few scholars such as Akira Ueda, Gerald Iguchi and Jon Holt argue otherwise. The Kokuchūkai&#x27;s official website continues to claim him as a member, also claiming that the influence of Nichirenism (the group&#x27;s religio-political philosophy) can be seen in Kenji&#x27;s later works such as &quot;Ame ni mo Makezu&quot;, while acknowledging that others have expressed the view that Kenji became estranged from the group after returning to Hanamaki.

Kenji remained a devotee of the Lotus Sutra until his death. He made a deathbed request to his father to print one thousand copies of the sutra in Japanese translation and distribute them to friends and associates.

Kenji incorporated a relatively large amount of Buddhist vocabulary in his poems and children&#x27;s stories. He drew inspiration from mystic visions in which he saw the bodhisattva Kannon, the Buddha himself and fierce demons.

In 1925 Kenji pseudonymously published a in Hanamaki, which led to the construction of the present Shinshōji, but on his death his family, who were followers of Pure Land Buddhism, had him interred at a Pure Land temple. His family converted to Nichiren Buddhism in 1951 and moved his grave to Shinshōji, where it is located today.

Donald Keene suggests that while explicitly Buddhist themes are rare in his writings, he incorporated a relatively large amount of Buddhist vocabulary in his poems and children&#x27;s stories, and has been noted as taking a far greater interest in Buddhism than other Japanese poets of the twentieth century. Keene also contrasted Kenji&#x27;s piety to the &quot;relative indifference to Buddhism&quot; on the part of most modern Japanese poets.

== Themes ==
He loved his native province, and the mythical landscape of his fiction, known by the generic neologism, coined in a poem in 1923, as &quot;Īhatōbu&quot; (&quot;Ihatov&quot;) is often thought to allude to &quot;Iwate&quot; (&quot;Ihate&quot; in the older spelling). Several theories exist as to the possible derivations of this fantastic toponym: one theory breaks it down into a composite of &quot;I&quot; for &#x27;Iwate&#x27;; &quot;hāto&quot; (English &#x27;heart&#x27;) and &quot;obu&quot; (English &#x27;of&#x27;), yielding &#x27;the heart or core of Iwate&#x27;. Others cite Esperanto and German forms as keys to the word&#x27;s structure, and derive meanings varying from &#x27;I don&#x27;t know where&#x27; to &#x27;Paradise&#x27;. Among the variation of names, there is &quot;Ihatovo&quot;, and the addition of final &quot;o&quot; is supposed to be the noun ending of Esperanto, whose idea of common international language interested him.

==Reception==
Kenji&#x27;s poetry managed to attract some attention during his lifetime. According to Hiroaki Sato, &quot;Haru to Shura&quot;, which appeared in April 1924, &quot;electrified several of the poets who read it.&quot; These included the first reviewer, Dadaist Tsuji Jun, who wrote that he chose the book for his summer reading in the Japan Alps, and anarchist , who called the book shocking and inspirational, and Satō Sōnosuke, who wrote in a review for a poetry magazine that it &quot;astonished [him] the most&quot; out of all the books of poems he had received. However, such occasional murmurs of interest were a far cry from the chorus of praise later directed toward his poetry.

In February 1934, some time after his memorial service, his literary friends held an event where they organized his unpublished manuscripts. These were slowly published over the following decade, and his fame increased in the postwar period.

The poet Gary Snyder is credited as introducing Kenji&#x27;s poetry to English readers. &quot;In the 1960s, Snyder, then living in Kyoto and pursuing Buddhism, was offered a grant to translate Japanese literature. He sought Burton Watson’s opinion, and Watson, a scholar of Chinese classics trained at the University of Kyoto, recommended Kenji.&quot; Some years earlier Jane Imamura at the Buddhist Study Center in Berkeley had shown him a Kenji translation which had impressed him. Snyder&#x27;s translations of eighteen poems by Kenji appeared in his collection, &quot;The Back Country&quot; (1967).

The Miyazawa Kenji Museum was opened in 1982 in his native Hanamaki, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his death. It displays the few manuscripts and artifacts from Kenji&#x27;s life that escaped the destruction of Hanamaki in World War II.

In 1982, Oh! Production finished an animated feature film adaptation of Miyazawa&#x27;s Gauche the Cellist, with Studio Ghibli and Buena Vista Home Entertainment re-releasing the film as a double-disc commemoration of Miyazawa&#x27;s 110th birthday along with an English-subtitle version.

Manga artist Hiroshi Masumura has adapted many of Miyazawa&#x27;s stories as manga since the 1980s, often using anthropomorphic cats as protagonists. The 1985 anime adaptation of &quot;Ginga tetsudō no yoru&quot; (&quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;), in which all signs in Giovanni and Campanella&#x27;s world are written in Esperanto, is based on Masumura&#x27;s manga. In 1996, to mark the 100th anniversary of Kenji&#x27;s birth, the anime &quot; Īhatōbu Gensō: Kenji no Haru&quot; (&quot;Ihatov Fantasy: Kenji&#x27;s Spring&quot;; North American title: &quot;Spring and Chaos&quot;) was released as a depiction of Kenji&#x27;s life. As in the &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot; anime, the main characters are depicted as cats.

The Japanese culture and lifestyle television show &quot;Begin Japanology&quot; aired on NHK World featured a full episode on Miyazawa Kenji in 2008.

The JR train was restored with inspiration from and named in honor of his work in 2013.

The 2012 manga &quot;Bungou Stray Dogs&quot; and its anime adaptation feature a character named after and inspired by Miyazawa. His power, supernatural strength and endurance which increases with his hunger, is inspired by and named after &quot;Ame ni mo makezu&quot;.

The 2015 anime &quot;Punch Line&quot; and its video game adaptation feature a self-styled hero who calls himself Kenji Miyazawa and has a habit of quoting his poetry when arriving on scene. When other characters wonder who he is after his sudden initial appearance, they point out that he cannot be the &quot;poet who wrote books for kids&quot; because he died in 1933.

<text>was a Japanese author and playwright. His real name was . His best known work is the Shin Kabuki play &quot;Bancho Sarayashiki&quot;.

Kido was born in the district of Shiba Takanawa, a neighbourhood in Minato Ward, Tokyo.

==Family==
Kido&#x27;s father, , later , was a samurai who, after the Meiji Restoration, left the service of the Tokugawa Shōgunate and went to work for the British Legation as an interpreter. He was good friends with , , and , who together formed the to promote the modernisation of Kabuki based on the doctrine of the . He was also friends with , the owner-manager of the Shintomiza Theatre, and an employee of the British Legation; avid Kabuki fan Thomas Russell Hillier McClatchie; and Austro-Hungarian diplomat Heinrich von Siebold.

==Life==
With the relocation of the British Legation to Kōjimachi District in 1873, Kido&#x27;s father moved there with his wife and daughter. Kido was born at , , Kōjimachi. Later they moved , also in Kōjimachi. Kido learnt from the daughter of a local hairdresser and by listening to his older sister&#x27;s lessons. Early on, when he was too young to go the Kabuki, he was left at home in the care of two maids and would listen to the gossip of his mother and older sister about the performances when they returned home. As he got older, he went to the Kabuki with his family when the family would socialise at the tea house in the Shintomiza Theatre&#x27;s enclosure. During his early attendances at the Kabuki, he took a dislike to Danjūrō IX after witnessing what he described as childish behaviour during an incident backstage. Later, however, Kido became an ardent fan.

He would listen to foreign ghost stories told to him by his uncle who brought them back from his overseas travels. He was especially enamoured by &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; by William Harrison Ainsworth, which he mistook for Hamlet. At the age of 16 he knew William George Aston, the Secretary of the British Legation, whose children he babysat and from whom he was taught about Shakespeare, a process which Kido said taught him some of the techniques of playwriting. Much to Kido&#x27;s delight Aston later helped him find the scripts for Kawatake Mokuami&#x27;s plays &quot;Nakamitsu&quot;, &quot;Shisenryō Koban Umenoha&quot;, and &quot;Kagatobi&quot;, which had been published by the Ginza-based Kabuki Shinpō (Kabuki News) Company. He learnt Chinese poetry from his father, and English from his uncle and students at the British Legation. He attended and graduated from Tokyo First Junior High School afterwards attempting to become a playwright but when that failed from 1890 he wrote stage reviews for the newspaper , now the Mainichi Shimbun, when he used the pseudonym Kyokido, which he later changed to Kido. He went to work for Chūō Shimbun, spending 24 years as a newspaper reporter, including a period in Manchuria. He bought the contract of and married a Yoshiwara Geisha from the Uwajima feudal domain called .

Success eluded him until in 1911, his popular play premiered at the Meijiza. In 1916 his Shin (new) Kabuki play was staged at the . Between 1917 and 1937 was serialised. His series on the theatre of the Meiji period, a valuable resource, the first half of which was serialised in the Monthly Kabuki Review Magazine in the late 1920s, early 1930s as , then again as a series in 1935 and finally in full as by Iwanami Shoten in 1993.

In 1918 he visited the US and Europe. His home and library in Kōjimachi were destroyed in the Great Earthquake of 1923. He was taken in by his disciple , from where he moved to Azabu, Minato. The following year he moved to , a street in north Shinjuku. From 1935 his articles were occasionally published in . His last novel was the controversial , published in 1937, about two brothers running a freak show which is in trouble who hit the jackpot when they get a Tiger cub. He continued to publish plays in the magazine from 1930 until 1938. In 1939 he died of pneumonia and is buried with his wife in Aoyama cemetery in Minami-Aoyama, Tokyo.

After his death one of his students and adoptive heir, his son , founded the Okamoto Kido Journal which printed much of Kido&#x27;s work. Kido&#x27;s grandson is the current president. The Okamoto Kido Literary Prize, was established but was only awarded twice between 1943 and 1944 during the period leading up to the end of the Second World War.

<doc id="186591" wikidata="Q647687" url="?curid=186591" title="Kan Kikuchi">
<text>, also known as Kan Kikuchi (which uses the same kanji as his real name), was a Japanese author and publisher. He established the publishing company Bungeishunjū, the monthly magazine of the same name, the Japan Writer&#x27;s Association and both the Akutagawa and Naoki Prize for popular literature. He came to prominence for the plays &quot;Madame Pearl&quot; and &quot;Father Returns&quot;, but his ample support for the Imperial Japanese war effort led to his marginalization in the postwar period. He was also the head of Daiei Motion Picture Company (currently Kadokawa Pictures). He was known to have been an avid player of mahjong.

==Early life and career==
Kikuchi was born on December 26, 1888, in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan.
In 1904–1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, literature in Japan grew more modern. French Realism was one of the first influences that immersed into Japan&#x27;s literature. Building from the famous and classic works from the West, which include diaries and autobiographies, Japanese writers formulated a style of fictional writing that is eventually called &quot;shinkyo-shosetsu&quot;. Other major influences from Western countries in Europe in addition to works from India and China contributed to the creation of modern literature in Japan. In comparison to literature in European countries, new Japanese literature did not achieve as much popularity; few works of Japanese playwrights were translated into European languages. Kikuchi Kan saw the language barrier and inaccuracy of translation as part of the central cause for this.

===Irish Influences===
In 1924, shortly after Kaoru Osanai opened Tsukiji Little Theatre, Kikuchi Kan was the most celebrated playwright in Japan. Kan was widely claimed as &quot;a playwright who transformed Irish plays into a Japanese context,&quot; including John Millington Synge&#x27;s &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot;. When studying at the University of Kyoto, Kikuchi Kan had a great interest in modern drama, particularly Irish modern drama. Dramatists Kan studied included J.M. Synge and Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany. 

After graduating from the University of Kyoto, Kan wrote detailed articles on Synge and Irish plays for and &quot;New Current of Thought&quot;. In 1925, Kan also published a book with Shuji Yamamoto, &quot;Eikoku Airan Kindaigeki Seizui&quot; (Quintessence of Modern Plays in England and Ireland). Kan&#x27;s interests in Irish drama and J.S. Synge were also inspirations to his future works. In his , Kan writes about his great interest in Irish drama.

===Writing Style===
Though Kikuchi Kan recognized distinct characteristics between Western and Japanese cultures, he used his Japanese roots as the foundation of many of his works. This, in turn, resulted in Kikuchi Kan creating his style of writing in Japanese drama. One of his early works, , represents one of Kikuchi Kan&#x27;s portrayal of societal issues during his time, which increased his popularity in modern Japanese literature. Other themes of his dramas include issues of morality, money, class, and gender. Kikuchi Kan believes the nature of modern theatre is to shed light upon the wrongs of modern society and liberate Japan from those customs. The heavy influence of common issues in Kikuchi Kan&#x27;s works gained accolades from critics and dramatists.

Elements of drama Kikuchi Kan considered to be the most effective are the one-act play and the use of a minimal number of characters. &quot;The one-act play&quot; he wrote, &quot;is different from long plays – three-acts or five-acts. It should extract the most dramatic elements from all and has to effectively treat it within a limited time.&quot; With this short amount of time, Kikuchi Kan&#x27;s portrays his message in a core event with meticulous use of exposition. One important element in his perspective is knowing the difference between writing stories as opposed to writing plays. In that limited time, the play must have the power to &quot;physically bind the audience to the theatre seat,&quot; as opposed to stories that &quot;the reader can put into his pocket.&quot; From 1914 to 1924, Kan wrote one-act plays for the leading coterie magazine at that time, New Tides of Thought (Shinshichō). New Tides of Thought magazine also contributed to the popularity of Taishō drama. In Kan&#x27;s one-act plays, he focused on a single dramatic event and had the characters&#x27; actions revolve around that event to produce the most tension and most &quot;dramatic force,&quot; for one-act plays &quot;should extract the most dramatic elements...within a limited time.&quot;

===Father Returns===

One of his most famous works, &quot;Chichi Kaeru&quot; (Father Returns), is a one-act play that mainly portrays the struggles of a father-son relationship. Father Returns opened in 1920, after being published in the journal &quot;New Tides of Thought&quot; in 1917. The story revolves around a conflict between a father and son. The eldest son, Ken&#x27;ichirō, despises his father, Sōtarō, for his cruel treatment of the family and for deserting them. As the play progresses, the audience learns that Ken&#x27;ichirō&#x27;s hatred towards his father fueled his determination of surpassing his father by providing better support for his family in his absence. After Sōtarō returns one night, the family welcomes him but Ken&#x27;ichirō&#x27;s confrontation with him ultimately drives Sōtarō to leave. The play concludes with Ken&#x27;ichirō&#x27;s sudden change of heart towards Sōtarō and accepting him into the family. After Shinjirō, a younger brother, goes to bring Sōtarō back, the curtain closes before Sōtarō is found. The ending drove Takeda and Ennosuke to alter it to avoid ambiguity, but was changed back to the original to preserve the main message of the play.

===Madame Pearl===
 brought Kikuchi Kan to fame. This drama takes place in Japan and focuses on the theme of gender in society. The main character, a woman named Karasawa Ruriko 唐沢瑠璃子 is a baron&#x27;s daughter who is forced into an arranged marriage with the rich Shōda Katsuhei 荘田勝平 to save the family from bankruptcy. Before and after Ruriko&#x27;s arranged marriage to Katsuhei, she remained faithful to her feelings for Sugino Naoya 杉野直也, her first love, and decided to preserve her virginity. Due to Ruriko&#x27;s choosing to be sexually pure, Katsuhei attempted to rape Ruriko but died from a sudden heart attack. From then on, she wanted to overcome the male dominance in the society she lived in. For a period of time Ruriko tricked men and played with their emotions, which lead many of them to violent deaths. However, Ruriko eventually was killed by one of her suitors. The name &quot;Shinju fujin&quot; symbolizes Ruriko&#x27;s purity and preservation of chastity throughout her encounters with different men. She remained pure in body, mind, and soul like a pearl while she gradually rose in power over men. As the story unravels, it encourages the audience to think about Ruriko&#x27;s motivation to carry out her actions and find the &quot;truth&quot; behind her thinking. According to Michiko Suzuki, this play became popular among female audiences because it gave them strength and the opportunity fulfill &quot;the fantasy of female liberation&quot;.

Suzuki further argues that many audience members believed that Ruriko was inspired by Yanagihara Byakuren 柳原白蓮, who was widely known for her beauty, her talent in poetry, her relation to the emperor, and her marriage to coalmine magnate Itō Den&#x27;emon 伊藤傳右衞門. According to Suzuki, Byakuren herself asked Kikuchi Kan whether she played a role in creating Ruriko in &quot;Shinju fujin&quot; and Kikuchi confirmed that there was a connection. Suzuki also connects Ruriko to Nemesis, the goddess of revenge. Suzuki argues that, like the goddess of revenge, Ruriko wanted to avenge the women who have fallen victim to the &quot;violence and self-centered desires of men.&quot;

==Naoki and Akutagawa Prizes==

Kikuchi Kan dedicated the Akutagawa Prize to Ryūnosuke Akutagawa (芥川 龍之介) after his death in 1927. The Akutagawa Prize Committee was composed of the close friends of Bungei Shunjusha. The Akutagawa Prize was given every six months to rising authors of original literature (Sōsaku) that were published in any newspaper or magazine. The Akutagawa Prizes were published in Bungeishunjū issues. The prize included both a watch and a cash award of five hundred Japanese yen (¥). 

The Naoki Prize was created by Kikuchi Kan as tribute to literary author Sanjugo Naoki (直木 三十五) after his death in February 1934. The Naoki Prize was given to rising authors of popular literature. The Naoki prizes were published in issues.

The process of choosing recipients of the two prizes is for the committees to select already published manuscripts in Coterie and commercial magazines and newspapers. After producing the two prizes, Kikuchi Kan initially decided on having the prizes reflect the Kenshō shōsetsu type of award, in which submitted and unpublished manuscripts were selected by a committee. In brief, the Kenshō shōsetsu, the &quot;prize-winning novels&quot; are selected pieces of fiction novels published in newspapers and magazines that received considerable amounts of praise. The Akutagawa Prize committee in 1934 consisted of the members: Bungei Shunjusha, Yamamoto Yuzu, Haruo Satō, Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki, Murō Saisei, Kōsaku Takii, Riichi Yokomitsu and Yasunari Kawabata. Kikuchi Kan, Masao Kume and Masajirō Kojima were in both Akutagawa and Naoki Prize Committees.

==Kikuchi Kan Prize==
In 1938, the Kikuchi Kan Prize (菊池寛賞 Kikuchi Kan Shō) was created by Kikuchi Kan himself that recognizes authors&#x27; achievements. However, unlike the Naoki and Akutagawa Prizes, the Kikuchi Kan Prize is given to senior authors over age 45. The prize includes an award of one million yen and a table clock. This award was sponsored by the Association for the Promotion of Japanese Literature for six years before the cancellation of the prize. After Kikuchi Kan&#x27;s death, the prize was brought back and is currently open to art, literature, film, and other genres. Recipients of this prize include Hakuchō Masamune and Yasushi Inoue.

==Later years==
In 1938, Kikuchi joined the Pen butai (lit. &quot;Pen corps&quot;), a government organisation which consisted of authors who travelled the front during the Second Sino-Japanese War to write favourably of Japan&#x27;s war efforts in China, and became head of the group&#x27;s navy branch. He was later affiliated with the Nihon bungaku hōkokukai (&quot;Patriotic Association for Japanese Literature&quot;), a subordinate of the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau. After the war, he was purged from public service positions as a wartime collaborator.

==Selected work==
Kan Kikuchi&#x27;s published writings encompass 512 works in 683 publications in 7 languages and 2,341 library holdings.

<text>was a Japanese author, intellectual and political philosopher who was active in early Shōwa period Japan. Drawing from an eclectic range of influences, Kita was a self-described socialist who has also been described by some as the &quot;ideological father of Japanese fascism&quot;, though this has been highly contested, as his writings touched equally upon pan-Asianism, Nichiren Buddhism, fundamental human rights and egalitarianism and he was involved with Chinese revolutionary circles. While his publications were invariably censored and he ceased writing after 1923, Kita was an inspiration for elements on the far-right of Japanese politics into the 1930s, particularly his advocacy for territorial expansion and a military coup. The government saw Kita&#x27;s ideas as disruptive and dangerous; in 1936 he was arrested for allegedly joining the failed coup attempt of 26 February 1936 and executed in 1937.

==Background==
Kita was born on Sado Island, Niigata Prefecture, where his father was a sake merchant and the first mayor of the local town. Sado island, which used to be used for penal transportation, had a reputation for being rebellious, and Kita took some pride in this. He studied Chinese classics in his youth and became interested in socialism at the age of 14. In 1900 he began publishing articles in a local newspaper criticizing the Kokutai (&quot;Structure of State&quot;) theory. This led to a police investigation which was later dropped. In 1904 he moved to Tokyo, where he audited lectures at Waseda University, but never earned a university degree. He met many influential figures in the early socialist movement in Japan but quickly became disillusioned; the movement was, according to him, full of &quot;opportunists&quot;.

==Ideology==

At age 23, Kita published his first book in 1906 after one year of research – a massive 1,000-page political treatise titled . In it, he criticized the government ideology of Kokutai and warned that socialism in Japan was in danger of degenerating into a watered down, simplified form of itself because socialists were too keen on compromising.

===Theories of Japanese Politics===

Kita first outlined his philosophy of nationalistic socialism in his book , published in 1906, where he criticized Marxism and class conflict-oriented socialism as outdated. He instead emphasized an exposition of the evolutionary theory in understanding the basic guidelines of societies and nations. In this book Kita explicitly promotes the platonic state of authoritarianism, emphasizing the close relationship between Confucianism and the &quot;from above&quot; concept of national socialism stating that Mencius is the Plato of the East and that Plato&#x27;s concept of organizing a society is far preferable to Marx&#x27;s.

===Engagement with the Chinese Revolution===

Kita&#x27;s second book is titled &quot;An Informal History of the Chinese Revolution&quot; (支那革命外史 &quot;Shina Kakumei Gaishi&quot;) and is a critical analysis of the Chinese Revolution of 1911. 

Attracted to the cause of the Chinese Revolution of 1911, Kita became a member of the Tongmenghui (United League) led by Song Jiaoren. He traveled to China to assist in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. 

However, Kita was also interested in the far-right. The right-wing, ultranationalist Kokuryūkai (Amur River Association/Black Dragon Society), was founded in 1901. Kita—who held views on Russia and Korea remarkably similar to those espoused by the Kokuryukai—was sent by that organization as a special member, who would write for them from China and send reports on the ongoing situation at the time of the 1911 Xinhai revolution.

By the time Kita returned to Japan in January 1920, he had become very disillusioned with the Chinese Revolution, and the strategies offered by it for the changes he envisioned. He joined Ōkawa Shūmei and others to form the Yuzonsha (Society of Those Who Yet Remain), an ultranationalist and Pan-Asianist organization, and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He gradually became a leading theorist and philosopher of the right-wing movement in pre-World War II Japan.

===Toward the Reorganization of Japan===

His last major book on politics was . First written in Shanghai but banned in 1919, the book was published by Kaizōsha, which was the publisher of the magazine Kaizō, in 1923, which was censored by the Government. The common theme to his first and last political works is the notion of a national policy (&quot;Kokutai&quot;), through which Japan would overcome a coming national crisis of economics or international relations, lead a united and free Asia and unify culture of the world through Japanized and universalized Asian thoughts in order to be prepared for the appearance of the sole superpower which would be inevitable for the future world peace. It thus contained aspects associated with the doctrine of pan-Asianism. 

According to his political program, a coup d&#x27;état would be necessary as to impose a more-or-less state of emergency regime based on a direct rule by a powerful leader. Due to the respect that the Emperor enjoyed in the Japanese society, Kita identified the sovereign as the ideal person to suspend the Constitution, organize a council created by the Emperor and radically reorganize the Cabinet and the Diet, whose members would be elected by the people, to be free of any &quot;malign influence&quot;, which would make the true meaning of the Meiji Restoration clear. The new &quot;National Reorganization Diet&quot; would amend the Constitution according to the draft proposed by the Emperor, impose limits on individual wealth, private property, and assets of companies, and establish national entities directly and unitedly operated by the Government like the Japanese Government Railways. Land reform would be enacted; all urban land would be changed to municipal property. The new state would abolish the kazoku peerage system, the House of Peers and all but fundamental taxes, guaranteeing male suffrage, freedom, the right to property, the right to education, labor rights and human rights. While maintaining the Emperor as the representative of the people, privileged elites would be displaced and the military further empowered so as to strengthen Japan and enable it to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. 

Kita asserted Japan&#x27;s right as an &quot;international Proletariat&quot; to conquer Siberia of Far East and Australia, whose peoples would be granted the same rights as Japanese would, because social issues in Japan would never be solved if problems of international distribution were not decided. This was termed the Shōwa Restoration.

In its historical prospect Kita&#x27;s political program was for creating a state socialism in a fascistic oriented &quot;socialism from above&quot;, as a tool to unite and strengthen Japanese society. Japan&#x27;s overseas actions were meant to focus on achieving the independence of India and the maintenance of the Republic of China to stop the partition of China like Africa, in the name of Asian unity. Another goal of his program was to build the great Empire which included Korea, Taiwan, Sakhalin, Manchuria, the Russian Far East and Australia.

=== On foreign policy ===
He wrote a “petition” on foreign policy after the Mukden Incident. He strongly opposed a war against America, which was a popular opinion at that time, because the British Empire would join the war and the Japanese navy would not defeat them. He also thought China and the Soviet Union would join the war on the side of America. His proposal was that Japan should form an alliance with France and combat the Soviet Union. He thought that an alliance with France would contain the British Empire, and that Japan and France shared Anti-Russian sentiment because the Russian Empire had not paid massive debt to France.

===Critical reception===
Walter Skya notes that in &quot;On the Kokutai and Pure Socialism&quot;, Kita rejected the Shintoist view of far-right nationalists such as Hozumi Yatsuka that Japan was an ethnically homogeneous &quot;family state&quot; descended through the Imperial line from the goddess Amaterasu Omikami, emphasizing the presence of non-Japanese in Japan since ancient times. He argued that along with the incorporation of Chinese, Koreans, and Russians as Japanese citizens during the Meiji period, any person should be able to naturalize as a citizen of the empire irrespective of race, with the same rights and obligations as ethnic Japanese. According to Kita, the Japanese empire couldn&#x27;t otherwise expand into areas populated by non-Japanese people without having to &quot;exempt them from their obligations or ... expel them from the empire.&quot; One of his religious inspirations was the Japanized Lotus Sutra.

His younger brother Reikichi Kita, political philosopher who studied for five years in the US and Europe and was a member of the House of Representatives, later wrote that Kita had been familiar with Kiichiro Hiranuma, then Chief of the Supreme Court of Justice, and in his paper in 1922 he had fiercely condemned Adolph Joffe, then Soviet Russian diplomat to Japan.

This eclectic blend of imperialism, socialism and spiritual principles is one of the reasons why Kita&#x27;s ideas have been difficult to understand in the specific historical circumstances of Japan between the two world wars. Some have argued that this is also one of the reasons why it is hard for the historians to agree on Kita’s political stance, though Nik Howard takes the view that Kita&#x27;s ideas were actually highly consistent ideologically throughout his career, with relatively small shifts in response to the changing reality he faced at any given time.

== Esperanto proposal ==
In 1919 Kita advocated that the Empire of Japan should adopt Esperanto. He foresaw that 100 years after its adoption the language would be the only tongue spoken in Japan proper and the vast territory conquered by it according to the natural selection theory, making Japanese the Sanskrit or Latin equivalent of the Empire. He thought that the writing system of Japanese is too complicated to impose on other peoples, that romanization would not work and that English, which was taught in the Japanese education system at that time, was not mastered by Japanese at all. He also asserted that English is poison to Japanese minds as opium destroyed Chinese people, that the only reason it did not destroy Japanese yet was that German had more influence than English and that English should be excluded from the country. Kita was inspired by several Chinese anarchists he befriended who had called for the substitution of Chinese for Esperanto at the beginning of the twentieth century.

== Arrest and execution ==

Kita&#x27;s &quot;Outline Plan&quot;, his last book, exerted a major influence on a part of the Japanese military—especially in the Imperial Japanese Army factions who participated in the failed coup of 1936. After the coup attempt, Kita was arrested by the Kempeitai for complicity, tried by a closed military court, and executed.

==In fiction==
*Ikki Kita is a major character in the historical fantasy novel &quot;Teito Monogatari&quot; by Hiroshi Aramata. In the novel, he is also a Buddhist shaman who is deeply devoted to the Kegon Sutras.
*Kita appears in manga artist Motoka Murakami&#x27;s Shōwa-era epic &quot;Ron&quot;.
*Kita is a secondary character in Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Ikki Mandara&quot;.
*Kita (portrayed by Hiroshi Midorigawa) figures in the plot of Seijun Suzuki&#x27;s 1966 film &quot;Fighting Elegy&quot;.
*Yoshida Yoshishige&#x27;s film Coup d&#x27;État (1973) of Japanese New Wave cinema depicts Kita&#x27;s life during the 1920s up to his death.
*In Yukio Mishima’s novel &quot;Spring Snow&quot;, Kita’s writings figure in the reading of the most intellectual of the main characters, Honda.
&lt;br&gt;
::As for Honda, he could never be quite at ease unless there were books within easy reach. Among those now at hand was a book he had been lent in secret by one of the student houseboys, a book proscribed by the government. Titled &quot;Nationalism and Authentic Socialism&quot;, it had been written by a young man named Terujiro Kita, who at twenty-three was looked upon as the Japanese Otto Weininger. However, it was rather too colorful in its presentation of an extremist position, and this aroused caution in Honda’s calm and reasonable mind. It was not that he had any particular dislike of radical political thought. But never having been really angry himself, he tended to view violent anger in others as some terrible, infectious disease. To encounter it in their books was intellectually stimulating, but this kind of pleasure gave him a guilty conscience.
