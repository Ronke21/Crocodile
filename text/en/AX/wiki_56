<text>Woodlawn Memorial Park is one of the largest cemeteries in Nashville, known as a site where many prominent country music personalities are buried including Porter Wagoner, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, and Eddy Arnold. It is located 660 Thompson Lane, a site rich in history. The land was originally a Revolutionary War land grant of 968 acres given to John Topp in 1788, eight years before Tennessee became a US state. In 1836 it became known as &quot;Melrose&quot; when US Senator Alexander Barrow purchased it and built a fine mansion with that name. The property served as a field hospital in 1865 during American Civil War Battle of Nashville. The site was established as a cemetery in the 1930s, and in 1993 the property, then reduced to 205 acres, was acquired by Roesch-Patton Corporation. 

Among those interred or entombed in the cemetery, there are many prominent members of Nashville&#x27;s country music industry. In June 2018, Woodlawn installed the &quot;Lynn Anderson Rose Garden&quot;, consisting of 200 Lynn Anderson Hybrid Rose Bushes (named for the singer by the National Rose Society of America), as a place of reflection and meditation in honor of the star&#x27;s signature song.

<doc id="181471" wikidata="Q940321" url="?curid=181471" title="Lady Jane (1986 film)">
<text>Lady Jane is a 1986 British costume-historical drama romance film, directed by Trevor Nunn, written by David Edgar, and starring Helena Bonham Carter as the title character. It tells the story of Lady Jane Grey, her marriage to Lord Guildford Dudley, and her reign as the &quot;Nine Days&#x27; Queen&quot; following the death of Edward VI of England.

The story had previously been turned into a 1936 film, &quot;Tudor Rose&quot;, and a 1923 silent film, &quot;Lady Jane Grey; Or, The Court of Intrigue&quot;.

== Plot ==
The death of Henry VIII of England throws his kingdom into chaos as his successor, Edward VI of England, is both under-age and in poor health. Anticipating the young king&#x27;s imminent death from tuberculosis and anxious to keep England true to the Protestant Reformation by keeping the Catholic Princess Mary from the throne, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, Lord President of the Council and second only to the king in power, hatches a plan to marry his second son, Lord Guildford, to Lady Jane Grey, and have the royal physician keep the young king Edward VI alive—albeit in excruciating pain—long enough to get him to name Jane his heir.

Jane is unhappy with the proposed marriage, and is forced into it through corporal punishment by her parents. At first, Jane and Guildford treat their union as a marriage of convenience, but later fall deeply in love.

After King Edward VI dies, Jane is placed on the throne. She is troubled by the questionable legality of her accession, but after consulting with Guildford, turns the tables on John Dudley and the others who thought to use her as a puppet.

After only nine days, however, Queen Jane&#x27;s council abandon her because of her designs for reforming the country. The council then supports Mary, who at first imprisons Jane and Guildford.

Consumed with guilt, Jane&#x27;s father, the Duke of Suffolk, raises a rebellion to restore her to the throne, presumably in concert with Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s rebellion. When the rebellion fails, Queen Mary I offers to spare Jane&#x27;s life if she renounces her Protestant faith. When she refuses, Jane, her father and Guildford are executed.

<doc id="181485" wikidata="Q504548" url="?curid=181485" title="Gummo Marx">
<text>Milton &quot;Gummo&quot; Marx (October 23, 1892 – April 21, 1977) was an American vaudevillian performer, actor, comedian, and theatrical agent. He was the second youngest of the five Marx Brothers. Born in Manhattan, he worked with his brothers on the vaudeville circuit, leaving the act when he was drafted into the US Army in 1918 during World War I and replaced by his brother Zeppo. He had no taste for the theatre and became a successful businessman.

== Early life ==
Marx was born in Manhattan, New York City, on October 23, 1892. His parents were Sam Marx (called &quot;Frenchie&quot; throughout his life), and Minnie Schoenberg Marx. Marx&#x27;s family was Jewish. His mother was from Dornum in East Frisia, and his father was a native of Alsace and worked as a tailor.

== Career==

Gummo was the first of his brothers to make his debut on stage, pretending to be a dummy in an act with his uncle Henry Shean (né Heinemann Schoenberg), the brother of Al Shean, in 1899. Milton was put into a costume with a papier-mâché head and pretended to be a dummy while Henry pretended to work him. The act may have only been performed once and was not helped by Shean&#x27;s deafness or Milton&#x27;s stammer.

Gummo, who in an interview said he never liked being on stage, left the group and joined the military during World War I. He was not sent overseas because the armistice was signed shortly afterward. Gummo&#x27;s younger brother Zeppo took his place in the group. After his Army career, Gummo went into the raincoat business. He later joined with Zeppo and operated a theatrical agency. After that collaboration ended, Gummo represented his brother Groucho and worked on the television show &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, which he helped develop.

Gummo represented other on-screen talent and a number of writers, and was well-respected as a businessman. He rarely required contracts, believing that if the people he represented liked his work, they would stay with him. Around the time he left his brothers&#x27; Vaudeville act, Marx applied for a patent for a clothes-packing rack. On October 28, 1919, Marx was granted patent US1320335A.

Gummo may have received his nickname because he had a tendency to sneak around backstage, creeping up on others like a &quot;gumshoe&quot; private detective. Another explanation cited by biographers and family members is that Milton, the sickliest of the brothers, often wore rubber overshoes, also called &quot;gumshoes&quot;, to protect himself in inclement weather. According to Zeppo in a much later BBC TV interview, Gummo may have received his nickname because he was usually chewing gum.

== Personal life and death ==
Marx married Helen von Tilzer née Theaman (who had a two-year-old daughter, Karlyn &quot;Kay&quot; von Tilzer, from her previous marriage), on May 3, 1929.; they remained married until her death in January 1976. Their son, Robert Stuart, was born on August 19, 1930. Gummo&#x27;s grandson Gregg Marx is an actor.
Gummo died on April 21, 1977, at his home in Palm Springs, California, aged 84, from a cerebral hemorrhage. His death was never reported to Groucho, who by that time had become so ill and weak that it was thought the news would be a further detriment to his health. Groucho died four months later on August 19, at age 86.

Gummo and his wife Helen are interred next to each other in the Freedom Mausoleum at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Gummo&#x27;s brother Chico is in a crypt across the hall from them. Gummo&#x27;s only biological child, Robert, served in the United States Coast Guard for two years and later worked as an architect. He died on May 21, 2023, aged 92.

<text>Tecklenburg () is a town in the district of Steinfurt, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its name comes from the ruined castle around which it was built. The town is situated on the Hermannsweg hiking trail.

The coat of arms shows an anchor and three seeblatts.

==Geography==
It is located in the foothills of the Teutoburg Forest, southwest of Osnabrück.

===Division of the town===
Tecklenburg consists of 4 districts (with farming communities):
===Neighbouring municipalities===
* Ibbenbüren
* Westerkappeln
* Lotte
* Hagen
* Lengerich
* Ladbergen
* Saerbeck

==History==
In the 12th century the county of Tecklenburg emerged in the region that is now called the &quot;Tecklenburger Land&quot; in the western foothills of the Teutoburg Forest. From 1263, when the county of Tecklenburg was merged with the neighbouring county of Bentheim, Tecklenburg was ruled by the counts of Bentheim-Tecklenburg. In 1701, Tecklenburg was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently incorporated.

==Sights==

Today, the town of Tecklenburg is a tourist destination, because of its largely intact medieval townscape. Main sites include the ruined castle (now serving as open-air theatre during the summer) and the &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (the main, old church) including tombs of the counts and princes of Tecklenburg-Bentheim, as well as others prominent in the history of the county and city.

== Tecklenburg Castle ==
Tecklenburg Castle is a ruined fortification in Tecklenburg, used today as an outdoor theatre.

The castle was built around 1250. Anna of Tecklenburg-Schwerin made a lot of structural changes. Around 1700, the castle was dilapidated and its brick and stone was used for other buildings in Tecklenburg, leaving nothing but a ruin.

==International relations==
Tecklenburg is twinned with:
* Chalonnes-sur-Loire (France) since 1982

==Notable people==

* Adolf von Tecklenburg (c. 1185–1224), Bishop of Osnabrück
* Friedrich Adolf Krummacher (1767–1845), theologian
* Friedrich von Bodelschwingh, Senior (1831–1910), theologian
* Hermann Beitzke (1875–1953), physician and tuberculosis researcher
* Erwin Vierow (1890–1982), General of the Infantry

<doc id="181498" wikidata="Q1751432" url="?curid=181498" title="Plautdietsch">
<text>Plautdietsch () or Mennonite Low German is a Low Prussian dialect of East Low German with Dutch influence that developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Vistula delta area of Royal Prussia. The word &quot;Plautdietsch&quot; translates to &quot;flat (or low) German&quot; (referring to the plains of northern Germany or the simplicity of the language). In other Low German dialects, the word for Low German is usually realised as &quot;Plattdütsch/Plattdüütsch&quot; or &quot;Plattdüütsk&quot; , but the spelling &quot;Plautdietsch&quot; is used to refer specifically to the Vistula variant of the language.

Plautdietsch was a Low German dialect like others until it was taken by Mennonite settlers to the southwest of the Russian Empire starting in 1789. From there it evolved and subsequent waves of migration brought it to North America, starting in 1873. In Latin America the first settlement occurred in Argentina in 1877 coming from Russia.

Plautdietsch is spoken by about 400,000 Russian Mennonites, most notably in the Latin American countries of Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Belize, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay, along with the United States (notably Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas) and Canada (notably Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario).

Today, Plautdietsch is spoken in two major dialects that trace their division to what is now Ukraine. These two dialects are split between Chortitza Colony and Molotschna. Today, many younger Russian Mennonites in Canada and the United States speak only English. For example, Homer Groening—the father of Matt Groening (creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;)—spoke Plautdietsch as a child in a Mennonite community in Saskatchewan in the 1920s, but Matt never learned the language.

In 2007, Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas directed the film &quot;Stellet Licht&quot; (&quot;Silent Light&quot;), set in a Mennonite community in Chihuahua, Mexico. Most of the film&#x27;s dialogue is in Plautdietsch, which some of the actors had to learn phonetically. Other parts were played by people of the local community.

==Migration history==
Plautdietsch speakers today are mostly the descendants of Mennonites who fled in the 16th century to escape persecution and resettled in the Vistula delta. These refugees were Frisians and Saxons from East Frisia, people from Flanders (now part of Belgium) and central Europeans. They settled in West Prussia mostly in the three local areas of &quot;Nehrung&quot; (on the Baltic Sea), &quot;Werder&quot; (islands in the Vistula delta) and &quot;Niederung&quot; (south of the Werder), where they adopted the respective local Low German dialect as their everyday language.
As Mennonites they kept their own (primarily Dutch and Low German) identity, using Standard Dutch as the language of the church well into the 18th century. As a written language, they took up High German.
At the time of their migration to the Russian Empire, their spoken language resembled the dialects of the region with only some few Dutch elements.
Their East Low German dialect is still classified as Low Prussian.
Russian Mennonites trace their genealogical roots mostly to the Low Countries.
Beginning in the late 18th century, the expanding Russian Empire invited Germans and many from the Kingdom of Prussia, including many Mennonites, to create new colonies north of the Black Sea in an area that Russia had recently acquired in one of the Russo-Turkish Wars. This is now part of Ukraine as well as other countries. Beginning in 1873, many Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites migrated from the Russian Empire to the United States and Canada.

In 1922, Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada started to settle in Mexico, and in 1927 in Paraguay. In the 1930s, Mennonites emigrated mainly from Soviet Ukraine directly to Brazil. The first Mennonite settlement in Bolivia was founded in 1957 by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Paraguay. Soon, conservative Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from Canada, Mexico, and Belize also relocated to Bolivia, settling together. In 1986/7, a settlement was founded in Argentina by Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites from other Latin American countries. Plautdietsch-speaking Mennonites have also recently begun colonies in the jungle of Peru.

==Speaker population and language maintenance==

Plautdietsch-speaking communities in Latin America have mostly maintained their language, while also learning Standard German and local languages. In North America, many Mennonites have adopted English as their common language. In Germany, many Mennonites have shifted to Standard German, with only the most conservative fraction maintaining use of the Plautdietsch dialect.

==Status==
Plautdietsch is primarily a spoken language, and does not have an official orthography. However, there have been attempts to create a written form of the language. One of the main issues facing the development of an official orthography is the variation in pronunciation among various speech communities. Another hindrance to the unification of the language is the fact that most Plautdietsch speaking people are not found in one geographical region, being spread across North America (Canada, the United States, Mexico), Central America and South America. Noteworthy attempts at an orthography include those done by Fast (1982), Reimer (1982), Reimer et al. (1983), Epp (1996), Loewen (1996, 1998), and Heinrichs et al. (2001). Despite the absence of an official orthography, there are quite a few written texts in the Plautdietsch language. A significant example is the Bible, whose New Testament was published in 1987 and the complete version subsequently published in 2005. It shares grammatical and lexical similarities with other varieties of Low German, and in general it is intelligible to other Low German speakers after some acquaintance. On the other hand, it has several developments and sound shifts not found in any other Low German dialect.

==Varieties==
Regional differences of the language have developed. This is common in spoken languages that have historically lacked a consistent writing system, and have been carried to territories where other languages prevail. Major differences seem to have originated in the beginning of the 19th century in the two major Mennonite settlements in Ekaterinoslav, also known as Novorossiya, or New Russia, which lies in modern-day Ukraine. The colonies were Chortitza (Old Colony) and Molotschna (New Colony), as noted above.

There was a third variety spoken by Groningen Old Flemish Mennonites in Waldheim, , and Alexanderwohl, which traced its origin from Przechovka. From Przechovka some moved to Brenkenhoffswalde and Franztal, in what is today Poland, where they used to live until 1945. Alexanderwohl Mennonite Church is a Low German Mennonite Church, in Goessel, Kansas, US.

Some of the major differences between the two (major) varieties are:

A few other differences sometimes related to this issue are the exact pronunciation of the IPA c sound and words as jenau/jeneiw. According to some studies, those might be due to the level of education of the speaker, as well as the influence of Russian and standard German.

The distinctive features of Chortitza-Plautdietsch as opposed to Molotschna-Plautdietsch include:
Some Plautdietsch speakers might speak a mixture of both dialects. For instance, those who trace their origin to the Bergthal Colony in New Russia—a daughter colony of the Old Colony—show all the phonetic distinction of the Old Colony version, but drop the final -n as the Molotschna speakers do.

==Comparison with related languages==
Plautdietsch has a Low German base, and as such, it does not show the effects of the High German consonant shift. This distinguished the High German dialects from the Low German dialects and all other Germanic languages. The basic distinctions between High German and Low German are:

===Effects of the High German consonant shift===

Like Dutch, Frisian and Low German, Plautdietsch only shows the mutation of into .

===Vowel shifts in various Germanic languages===

As shown, while Dutch, English and German have experienced similar vowel shifts, Plautdietsch has only merged the old Germanic sound with , while long is retained in the Molotschna dialect. The Old Colony variety has fronted it to the now vacant .

===Unique developments===
Not only has Plautdietsch undergone vowel shift, various dialects of Plautdietsch have also had their own shifts.

====Vowel lowering====
# This shift is still active, as some speakers {including a few from Hague} still retain the older pronunciation.

====Vowel unrounding====
====Diphthongization before g, k, ch [IPA x] and r, with possible loss of r====

The deletion of r has been completed in most final positions, after front vowels and before alveolar consonants, but is still retained in the infinitive of verbs, after short vowels, and sometimes after back vowels as seen in the example Huarn, Hieena.

====Various other vowel equivalences====
# shifted to before voiced consonants.

====Palatalization====
All words with a or preceding or following a front vowel ( or , not counting schwa) have been shifted to and (the latter has been written as kj or tj), even if there is another consonant between the vowel and the consonant. An intervocalic is palatalized as the voiced palatal stop , written gj or dj. (A similar event occurred with English, but not as generalized). Where an or has been sunken to , the palatalized sound is retained. Also where German has a palatalization (of the shifted consonant), Plautdietsch retains the palatalization (of ) even after lowering a front vowel.
==Influences and borrowings==
===German===
Most Anabaptists that settled in the Vistula Delta were of Dutch or northern German origins, and were joined by refugees from different parts of Germany and Switzerland, who influenced their developing language. After almost two centuries in West Prussia, German replaced Dutch as church, school and written language and has become a source from where words are borrowed extensively, especially for religious terms. Many of these words show the effects of the High German consonant shift, even though they are otherwise adapted into Plautdietsch phonetics. Compare:

This is the case particularly on nouns made out of verbs. The verb normally shows the unshifted consonant, whereas the noun has a shifted Germanized consonant: schluten, Schluss; bräakjen, Bruch (to close, closure; to break, a break)

===Dutch===
The first half of the 16th century was the onset of the rule of terror by the Duke of Alba in the Spanish Low Countries during the Dutch Revolt (a.k.a. Eighty Years&#x27; War), that was centered on religious freedom for the Protestants. As a result, many Mennonites and Reformed left the country. This continued in the 17th century, when the Dutch Reformed Church became the official religion, being less than indulgent to other types of Protestantism, let alone the types perceived as radical (non-violent, no bearing of arms, no recognition of worldly authorities). In Low German area, they left their language traces in particular at the lower Vistula, around Danzig and Elbing, and up the river towards Toruń.

===Old Prussian and Baltic languages===
===Russian or Ukrainian===
Wherever Mennonites settled, they found new foods and other items with which they were not familiar with. When that happened, they took the name that local people used for those items. The following words are of Russian or Ukrainian origin:

===English===
As Mennonites came into contact with new technology, they often adopted and adapted the names for those technologies. For Mennonites who had settled in North America in the 1870s, all new words were borrowed from English. Even though many of those settlers left for South America only 50 years after their arrival, they kept and sometimes adapted these words into the Mennonite Low German Phonetics:

In particular, words for auto parts are taken from English: &quot;hood&quot;, &quot;fender&quot;, &quot;brakes&quot; (along with the more Low German form &quot;Brams&quot;), spark plugs (pluralized &quot;Ploggen&quot;), but also words like &quot;peanuts&quot;, &quot;belt&quot;, &quot;tax&quot;.

===Spanish===
Plautdietsch speakers living in Spanish-speaking countries use many Spanish words in daily speech, especially in business and communication (telephone, for instance) vocabulary. Two examples of words that are completely adapted into Mennonite Low German are &quot;Burra&quot; (Mexican Spanish &quot;burro&quot;, donkey) and &quot;Wratsch&quot; (Mexican Spanish &quot;huarache&quot;, sandal). Both have a Low German plural: &quot;Burrasch&quot;, &quot;Wratschen&quot;. The pure Low German words &quot;Äsel&quot; and &quot;Schlorr&quot; are seldom used in Mexico.

==Spelling==
The spelling of Plautdietsch has also been controversial. The main criteria for spelling systems have been:
# Spelling should be as phonetic as possible.
# German spelling rules should be applied whenever possible.

One problem has been what letters to use for sounds that do not exist in German, such as the palatal and sounds, which are both pronounced and spelled differently in various dialects of Plautdietsch. Old Colony speakers pronounce these sounds by striking the middle of the tongue against the palate. Others, especially speakers of the Molotschna dialect, instead strike the tongue against the alveolar ridge and spell them and . Most Plautdietsch speakers&#x27; ears are not accustomed to realize these subtle, if not trivial, differences, and will often confuse one with the other.

Other problematic areas: use or non-use of for some words with sound, use or non-use of Dehnungs-h, when to double consonants and when not to.

When comparing different writers, one must take into account the dialect of that writer. The most famous Plautdietsch writer, Arnold Dyck, wrote in the Molotschna dialect, though his origins were from the Old Colony. During his life, he made many changes in his spelling system. His developments are a basis for the various spellings used today. In the following table, only his final system is taken into account, as used in his famous Koop enn Bua series, along with Herman Rempel (&quot;Kjenn Jie noch Plautdietsch?&quot;), Reuben Epp (&quot;Plautdietsche Schreftsteckja&quot;), Jack Thiessen (&quot;Mennonite Low German Dictionary&quot;), J. J. Neufeld (&quot;Daut niehe Tastament&quot;) and Ed Zacharias (&quot;De Bibel&quot;). The latter two claim to write in the Old Colony dialect, as seen in their verb endings, while the other three use the Plautdietsch as spoken by the descendants of the Bergthal Colony, i. e. the Old Colony dialect with a loss of -n endings.

==Phonetics==
Mennonite Low German has many sounds, including a few not found in other varieties of Low German.

===Consonants===
Where symbols for consonants occur in pairs, the left represents the voiceless consonant and the right represents the voiced consonant. Observations: According to the spelling system of De Bibel these sounds are spelled as follows:
# – as in &quot;Kjinja&quot; (&quot;children&quot;)
# – as in &quot;Hunga&quot; (&quot;hunger&quot;)
# – and as in &quot;Kjoakj&quot; (&quot;church&quot;) and &quot;Brigj&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot;)
# – no letter, but has to be used if a word that begins with a vowel or a prefix is added to a word which by itself starts with a vowel: ve&#x27;achten (to despise)
# – can be written as or : &quot;Fada&quot; (&quot;male cousin&quot;), &quot;Voda&quot; (&quot;father&quot;). The only criterion is the spelling of these words in German. is spelled as in German: &quot;Wota&quot; (&quot;water&quot;)
# – at the beginning of a word and between vowels is written : &quot;sajen&quot; (&quot;to say&quot;), &quot;läsen&quot; (&quot;to read&quot;). The sound is written at the beginning of a word (where some speakers pronounce it ), between vowels and final after a short vowel: &quot;Zocka&quot; (&quot;sugar&quot;), &quot;waussen&quot; (&quot;to grow&quot;), &quot;Oss&quot; (&quot;ox&quot;). At the end of a word after a long vowel or consonant both are written , the reader has to know the word to pronounce the correct sound: &quot;Hos&quot; (&quot;rabbit&quot;), &quot;Os&quot; (&quot;carrion&quot;).
# – and as in &quot;School&quot; (&quot;school&quot;) and &quot;ruzhen&quot; (&quot;rush&quot;). and represent and at the beginning of a word and if a prefix is attached to a word starting with or : &quot;spälen&quot; (&quot;to play&quot;) &quot;bestalen&quot; (&quot;to order&quot;).
# – as in &quot;Joa&quot; (&quot;year&quot;). The sound is written after consonants, , and : &quot;Erfolch&quot; (&quot;success&quot;), &quot;Jesecht&quot; (&quot;face&quot;), &quot;Jewicht&quot; (&quot;weight&quot;), &quot;läach&quot; (&quot;low&quot;). After , it is written to differentiate it from : &quot;rajcht&quot; (&quot;right&quot;)
# – is written , only occurs after back vowels: &quot;Dach&quot; (&quot;day&quot;), &quot;Loch&quot; (&quot;hole&quot;). (an allophone of ) is rendered between vowels and final: &quot;froagen&quot; (&quot;to ask&quot;), &quot;vondoag&quot; (&quot;today&quot;). At the beginning of a word and before consonants, g has the sound.
# – is a flap (like the Spanish r), or depending on the person, even a trill (like Spanish ), before vowels: &quot;root&quot; (&quot;red&quot;), &quot;groot&quot; (&quot;big&quot;), &quot;Liera&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot;); pronounced as an approximant (English r) before a consonant, at the end and in the -ren endings of Old Colony speakers: &quot;kort&quot; (&quot;short&quot;), &quot;ar&quot; (&quot;her&quot;), &quot;hieren&quot; (&quot;to hear&quot;). The uvular German r is not heard in Plautdietsch.
# – is an allophone of that occurs after vowels in words like &quot;Baul&quot; and &quot;well&quot;.

===Vowels===
The vowel inventory of Plautdietsch is large, with 13 simple vowels, 10 diphthongs and one triphthong.

* is rounded and is heard only in the Old Colony and Bergthal groups.
* This table gives only a very general idea of Plautdietsch vowels, as their exact phonetic realizations vary considerably from dialect to dialect, although these differences are poorly documented. For instance, in the Canadian Old Colony dialect, are strongly lowered to , is mid-centralized to , whereas there is hardly any difference between and (there is no in that variety), with both being pronounced or , although they are probably still distinguished by length and F3 values. Traditionally, Plautdietsch has been said to not have phonemic vowel length.

The sound has been shifted to in the Old Colony dialect, leaving the sound only as part of the ua diphthong. However, in certain areas and age groups, there is a heavy tendency to shift sound up to .

Pronunciation of certain vowels and diphthongs varies from some speakers to others; the diphthong represented by ee for instances is pronounced or even by some. Likewise the long vowels represented by au and ei might have a diphthong glide into and , respectively.
* English sound equivalents are approximate. Long vowels ä and o do not have a diphthong glide.

==Grammar==
Low German grammar resembles High German, as the syntax and morphology is nearly the same as High German&#x27;s. Over the years, Plautdietsch has lost some inflection. It is, however, still moderately inflectional, having two numbers, three genders, two cases, two tenses, three persons, two moods, two voices, and two degrees of comparison.

===Articles===
Even though Plautdietsch has three genders, in the nominative case it has only two definite articles (like Dutch and Low German); masculine and feminine articles are homophonous. However, masculine and feminine indefinite articles are still different (like German) and thus, the three genders can still be perfectly established. In the oblique case, the masculine has a special definite article, making it once more different from the feminine, which, like the neuter, does not change. In the plural number, all gender identification is lost (as in German, Dutch and Low German); all plural determiners and adjective endings are homophonous with the feminine singular.
* In colloquial speech the indefinite article is reduced practically to a &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;ne&quot; if feminine. If used so, there is no case distinction. However, when used as a numeral, meaning &quot;one&quot;, the diphthong &quot;ee&quot; is heavily stressed and the oblique form of the masculine gender is used. There is no indefinite plural article; een has no plural.

Some Plautdietsch writers try to use a three case system with the definite articles, without much consistency. The system looks somewhat like this, some might use the dative neuter articles, others might not:

====Determiners====
All possessives (see under pronouns) are declined like in this way. With the form äa (her/their) an r has to be reinserted before adding endings (äaren, äare).

===Nouns===
Mennonite Low German nouns inflect into two numbers: singular and plural, three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter, but only two cases, nominative and oblique. The historical dative and accusative have merged, even though some writers try to maintain a three cases distinction, which has been lost for most speakers, perhaps centuries ago. The oblique case is distinct from the nominative only in 1) personal pronouns: ekj froag am, hee auntwuat mie (I ask him, he answers me) 2) articles and demonstrative and possessive adjectives in the singular masculine gender: de Voda halpt dän Sän (the father helps the son) (observe: nouns are not inflected themselves) and 3) proper names, i. e. traditional Mennonite names: Peeta frajcht Marie-en, Marie auntwuat Peetren (Peter asks Mary, Mary answers Peter)

====Plurals====
Plural formation is comparatively complex. Three major procedures can be established: 1) through an ending, -a, -en, -s, -sch or none at all; 2) voicing the final devoiced consonant and 3) fronting (and maybe lowering) a back vowel, which might require palatalization of a velar consonant. A given word could have one or two, all or none of these characteristics.

=====Examples=====
No ending, no voicing, no vowel fronting: de Fesch de Fesch, daut Schop, de Schop, daut Been, de Been (fish, fishes; sheep, sheep; leg, legs)

Voicing, no ending, no vowel fronting: Frint, Friend; Boajch, Boaj (friend/s, mountain/s)

No ending, no voicing, vowel fronting: Foot, Feet (foot, feet)

Voicing and vowel fronting, no ending: Hoot, Heed (hat/s)

-a ending:

only: Licht, Lichta (light/s)

with voicing: (picture/s)

with vowel fronting: Maun, Mana (man, men)

with voicing, vowel fronting and palatalization: Kaulf, Kjalwa (calf, calves)

-en ending (the -en, -s and -sch endings have no vowel fronting)

only: Näs Näsen, (nose/s)

with voicing: de Tiet, de Tieden, de Erfoarunk, de Erfoarungen (time/s, experience/s)

Words where a historical r is dropped require it to be reinserted: Däa, Däaren (door/s)
Polysyllabic words with a vocalized r drop the final a: Sesta, Sestren (sister/s)

An unstressed schwa also is dropped: Gaufel, Gauflen (fork/s)

-s ending

This class consists mainly of 1) short masculine and neuter nouns: Baul -s, Oarm -s (ball/s, arm/s)

2) words related with family members: Sän -s, Fru -es, (son/s, woman, women)

and 3) masculine and neuter nouns ending in -el and -en (the latter may drop the n): Läpel, Läpels; Goaden, Goades (spoon/s; garden/s)

-sch ending

This class consists of masculine and neuter polysyllabic nouns ending with -a: de Voda, de Vodasch; daut Massa, de Massasch (father/s, knife, knives)

For someone knowing (High) German, pluralizing is a fairly predictable process, with some exceptions: the -en ending covers pretty much the same words in both languages; the -a ending is the equivalent for the German -er plural, where German has Umlaut, Plautdietsch will have vowel fronting in most cases. The -s and -sch groups are made almost entirely of polysyllabic nouns which in German have no plural ending.

The most problematic words are those with an -e plural ending in German. Although the entire class with no ending is made out of them, many other words are treated differently. For example, the plurals for Stool and Stock (chair and stick) are Steela and Stakja (compare German Stuhl, Stühle; Stock, Stöcke). Since they have their vowels fronted there seems to be no reason for the -a ending. Many others have been moved into the -en class: Jeboot, Jebooten (commandment/s, German: Gebot, Gebote). With some not so common words, there is no certainty about the correct plural, different speakers create them in different ways: the plural of Jesaz (law) could be Jesaza or Jesazen (German: Gesetz, Gesetze).

====Possession====
The classical genitive is no longer used except in a few relic expressions. Instead, possession is expressed as in many German dialects with the his genitive, i.e. naming the possessor in the oblique case with the possessive adjective and the possessed object: Dän Maun sien Hus (the man&#x27;s house). With proper nouns, and when the possessor is determined by a possessive adjective, the possessor is in the nominative case instead: Peeta sien Hus (Peter&#x27;s house); mien Voda sien Hus (my father&#x27;s house). Very long possessive clauses can be created: Mien Voda seine Mutta äare Mutta es miene Uagrootmutta (my father&#x27;s mother&#x27;s mother is my great grandmother).

For inanimate or generalized constructions, the preposition &quot;von&quot; or a composition are used instead: De Lichta von de Staut/ de Stautslichta (the lights of the city).

====Diminutive====
The diminutive is formed adding by -kje to the noun: de Jung, daut Jungkje; de Mejal, daut Mejalkje (the boy, the little boy; the girl, the little girl). All diminutive nouns take the neuter gender, with two exceptions: de Oomkje, de Mumkje, two forms used very commonly for mister/man/husband and mistress/woman/wife. These seem to have been created originally as diminutive forms of, respectively, Oom and Mumm (uncle and aunt; cf. German: Oheim/Ohm, Öhmchen/Öhmlein and Muhme, Mühmchen/Mühmlein). Today, they are no longer seen as diminutives and therefore retain their respective masculine and feminine genders.

With nouns ending in t or k, only -je is added; a few nouns ending in kj, an additional s is inserted: de Staut, daut Stautje, daut Buak, daut Buakje; daut Stekj, daut Stekjsje (the (little) city, the (little) book, the (little) piece).

Plural diminished nouns take -s ending: Jungkjes, Mejalkjes; however, if the original plural requires fronting of a back vowel or has an -a ending, these features are retained before adding the diminutive suffix: de Stool, de Steela → daut Stoolkje, de Steelakjes (chair/s, little chair/s)

===Adjectives===
Mennonite Low German also shows a rich inflectional system in its adjectives. Although once even richer, simplification has done its work here too, leaving Mennonite Low German with three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter, and two comparison degrees: Comparative and Superlative.

The plural of all genders is identical to the feminine singular.

Strong and weak neuter declension: after the definite article daut or the demonstratives daut and dit (neuter form of that, this) the t is dropped and a form identical to the feminine and plural is used. In other situations, as with indefinite articles, possessive adjectives or without article, the strong form is used.

The oblique is used only in the masculine singular. However, if a preposition-article compound is used with a neuter noun, then the oblique would be used. Example: em grooten Hus, but: en daut groote Hus, en een grootet Hus.

There is no predicate form for the superlative, a preposition-article compound with the oblique or weak neuter is used: aum woamsten, or: oppet woamste, or newly just the neuter form without preposition: daut woamste: Zemorjes es et woam, opp Meddach woat et woama, no Meddach es et aum woamsten/ oppet woamste/ daut woamste (in the morning it is warm, at noon it is getting warmer, after noon it is the warmest).

The predicate form is used in predicate sentences for all genders: De Maun es oolt, de Fru es oolt, daut Hus es oolt (the man is old, the woman is old, the house is old).

===Numerals===

Observation: the numeral eent (one) is declined like the indefinite article (masculine &quot;een&quot; [oblique &quot;eenen&quot;], feminine &quot;eene&quot;, neuter &quot;een&quot;) or a demonstrative or possessive pronoun (&quot;eena&quot; [oblique &quot;eenen&quot;], &quot;eene&quot;, &quot;eent&quot; for the respective genders); when counting, the neuter form &quot;eent&quot; is used.

The ordinal for 11th and 12th are: &quot;alfta, twalfta&quot;; from 13 to 19 use the ordinal + da: &quot;drettieenda&quot; (13th) ; from 20 to 99 use the ordinal + &quot;sta&quot;: &quot;fiew un twintichsta&quot; (25th). All ordinal numbers are declined like an adjective, the forms given here are masculine nominative.

The partitive numbers for 1/10, 1/11, 1/12 are &quot;een Tieedel, een Alftel, een Twalftel,&quot; for 13–19 add &quot;-del&quot; to the ordinal number, for 20–99 add &quot;-stel&quot;.

===Pronouns===
====Personal pronouns====

Some pronouns have two forms, different persons may use one or other form, or even alternate between them. Daut is used at the beginning of a sentence, but may be replaced by et in other positions.

Possessive adjectives are of the masculine (nominative case) or neuter gender. Otherwise, they are declined like the indefinite article and determiners (see under article section).

====Demonstrative pronouns====

Demonstrative pronouns are frequently used instead of the personal pronouns. When used so, some people use special oblique forms for feminine and plural. When used strictly demonstrative, only the singular masculine has a special oblique form.

===Verbs===
Mennonite Low German verbs have six tenses. The present and first past tenses are inflected, while the second and third past and both future tenses are different words marked by auxiliary verbs. Verbs can have two moods: Declarative and Imperative, two voices: active and passive, and three persons:1st pers. sing., 2nd pers. sing., 3rd pers. sing., and plural.

====Weak verbs====
The basic conjugation pattern is as follows:
To determine the stem, take the infinitive and drop the -en ending. There are a few modifications to this basic pattern: 1) If the stem ends with a plosive or fricative voiced consonant (d, g, j, soft s, w, zh), that consonant is devoiced in the 2nd and 3d persons of the present, since voiceless t and st automatically force the preceding consonant (compare the sound of the letter d in English lived and liked). 2) If the stem ends with a voiceless consonant (ch, f, jch, k, kj, p, hard s, sch, t) that consonant devoices the d, sd, d, den endings of the past tense (into t, st, t, ten) for the same reason. 3) If the stem ends with two consonants, the second one being a nasal or lateral, a schwa e is inserted to ease pronunciation. 4) Verbs with a diphthong and r have a special treatment; the r is dropped before endings are attached, and the st/sd of the second person is replaced by scht/zhd.

Examples of a regular verbs: spälen (to play), lachen (to laugh), läwen (to live), odmen (to breathe) and roaren (to cry). The first one follows strictly the basic pattern, the others show the various adjustments needed as described above.

If the inverted word order is used, the -en ending of the plural wie, jie (but not see) form is dropped, and a root-only form, identical to the 1st person singular, is used.

====Strong verbs====
As in English and Dutch, some verbs have a vowel change in past tense and past participle. As in German, some verbs might have a vowel change in second and third person of the singular in present tense as well. A few verbs that are strong in German are weak in Plautdietsch, but many German weak verbs are strong in Plautdietsch. However, when compared with Dutch and English, those are strong, too.
GENERALITIES: Vowel changes in present tense are somewhat predictable: long ie and u change into short i; long ä/o change into e or a; diphthongs äa and oa are simplified to a.

The first and third person of the past tense are identical (as in weak verbs).

With only a few exceptions (like the verb sajen), all voiced consonants are devoiced in the three persons of the singular past, the nasal ng and nj are retained in second person, but devoiced in first and third person.

The past tense has the same vowel through all persons.

If there is a vowel change from ä to e or a in the present tense, that feature is retained in the singular imperative.

The plural form for wie/jie in the inverted word order keep the final consonant voiced.

====Auxiliary, modal and anomalous verbs====
A small groups of verbs are more irregular: the auxiliaries sennen and haben, the modal verbs, and a few verbs that originally were monosyllabic and with time have evolved a -nen ending:
====Participles====
The present participle, formed of the infinitive plus a -t ending, is not often used. It appears in idiomatic expressions like aunhoolent bliewen (to persist), and in a few adjective forms, which have to be inflected for number, gender and case, the -t is voiced into -d: koaken, koakendet Wota (to boil, boiling water).

The past participle of weak verbs is formed with je- plus the stem of the verb plus -t. A voiced consonant is devoiced to go along with t, the inserted e between double consonant is retained, the r after a long vowel is dropped. For the weak verbs given above the past participles are: jespält, jelacht, jejäft, jeodemt, jeroat.

The past participle for strong and anomalous verbs is hard to predict, they could be formed in five or six different ways:
# some are like the weak verbs: jejäft, jesajcht (given, said);
# others are formed of je- plus infinitive: jestonen (stood);
# some, including modal verbs, of je- plus first person past tense: jehaut; jesocht, jekunt (had, sought, been able);
# others of je- plus plural past: jefungen (found);
# Those with an ee or oo in past tense are simplified to ä/o: jeschräwen, jedonen (written, done)
# the past participle of sennen is jewast (been)

Adjectives are frequently made from the past participle by attaching an adjective inflection ending and voicing the final t; if the preceding consonant is voiced, with -en participles the e is dropped:

 (to draw, drawn, a drawn picture)

koaken, jekoakt, eene jekoakte Ieedschock (to boil, boiled, a boiled potato)

stälen, jestolen, een jestolna Hunt (to steal, stolen, a stolen dog)

====Compound tenses====
Except for the present and simple past, all other tenses are constructed with the aid of the auxiliary verbs sennen, haben, woaren:
Some intransitive verbs take sennen instead of haben as auxiliary verbs if they: 1) indicate a motion from one place to another, or 2) indicate a change of condition, or 3) the verbs sennen (to be) and bliewen (to keep being, to remain). Example: ekj sie jekomen, ekj sie oolt jeworden, ekj sie jewast (I have come, I have become old, I was).

===Expressions relating to future plans===
In some communities of Plautdietsch speakers, the religious prohibition of James 4:13-14 is interpreted to proscribe the simple use of the first person in talking about future plans or efforts. In such communities it is considered proper to use a softening introductory phrase such as &quot;Ekj proove,&quot; (I try, or will try, or alternately I will want to) to avoid giving offense.

===Prepositions===
Plautdietsch preposition inventory is rich. Some of the most common:
* aun, on, in: de Klock henjt aun de Waunt (the clock is hanging on the wall)
* äwa, over, about
* besied, beside, next to
* bie, by, at
* bowa, over
* buta, except, besides
* derch, through
* en, in
* fa, for
* hinja, behind
* hinjaraun, following something else
* jäajen, against
* mank, among
* met, with
* no, to, after
* onen, without
* opp, on
* to, to
* tweschen, between (twixt)
* unja, under
* ver, in front of
* von, of (relative to)

===Syntax===
Mennonite Low German shows similarity with High German in the word order. The basic word order is subject–verb–object as in English. Indirect objects precede direct objects as in English John gives Mary a present, but that is where similarities end. A dependent verb, &quot;i.e.&quot; an infinitive or past participle, comes at the end of the sentence where in English it would be placed immediately after the main verb, as shown in the following examples:

Mennonite Low German word order: Jehaun haft dän Desch jemoakt (John has the table made).
English word order: John has made the table.

Mennonite Low German, like High German, has been referred to as verb-second (V2) word order. In embedded clauses, words relating to time or space can be placed at the beginning of the sentence, but then the subject has to move after the main verb to keep that verb in second position. This pattern is demonstrated here:

Mennonite Low German word order: Nu sie ekj schaftich. More Examples: Dan jeef de Kjennich seine Deena eenen Befäl. (Then the king gave his servants an order)

Also, effects tend to be placed last in the sentence. Example: En daut Kuffel wia soo väl Wota, daut et äwarand (In the cup, there was so much water, that it overflowed).

Mennonite Low German has syntactic patterns not found in High German, or at least not as often, such as the repetition of a subject, by a pronoun.
Example: Mien Hoot dee haft dree Akjen. My hat it has three corners.

Questions, orders and exclamations have a verb first word order: Hast du daut oole Hus aun de fefte Gauss jeseenen? (Have you seen the old house on fifth street?). All questions are arranged like this. There is no auxiliary verb to form questions. If there is a question word, that word precedes the verb: Wua es dien Voda jebuaren (Where is your father born?). As in English, when using verbs in the imperative mood, it is not necessary to specify the person addressed, but it can be added for emphasis: Brinj (du) mie emol dän Homa (Please, (you,) bring the hammer to me). The word emol is frequently asked to soften the order as a word for please. Example of an exclamation: Es daut vondoag oba kolt! (Is it cold today!).

;Dependent clauses
As in High German, in dependent clauses, the verb goes at the end:

Ekj well morjen miene Mutta besieekjen, wan ekj Tiet hab. (I want to visit my mother tomorrow if I have time). Observe the construction of: if I have time.

However, when a dependent clause has an infinitive or past participle, this rule is no longer strictly applied; there is a strong tendency to move the finite (main) verb before the infinitive or participle, the direct object (or even a long circumstantial complement):

Example: German word order requires a sentence structure like: Hee fruach mie, auf ekj miene Mutta jistren daut Jelt jejäft haud. (Translation: He asked me if I had given the money yesterday to my mother.) Even though this sounds right and perfectly understandable, most speakers would rearrange these same words as follows: Hee fruach mie, auf ekj miene Mutta jistren haud daut Jelt jejäft. Another example: Hee sajcht, daut sien Brooda jrod no de Staut jefoaren es/ Hee sajcht, daut sien Brooda jrod es no de Staut jefoaren (He says that his brother has just gone to the city). Observe: the verb precedes a prepositional phrase, but an adverb is still placed before it.

<doc id="181503" wikidata="Q611114" url="?curid=181503" title="Culmination">
<text>In observational astronomy, culmination is the passage of a celestial object (such as the Sun, the Moon, a planet, a star, constellation or a deep-sky object) across the observer&#x27;s local meridian. These events are also known as meridian transits, used in timekeeping and navigation, and measured precisely using a transit telescope.

During each day, every celestial object appears to move along a circular path on the celestial sphere due to the Earth&#x27;s rotation creating two moments when it crosses the meridian. Except at the geographic poles, any celestial object passing through the meridian has an upper culmination, when it reaches its highest point (the moment when it is nearest to the zenith), and nearly twelve hours later, is followed by a lower culmination, when it reaches its lowest point (nearest to the nadir). The time of &quot;culmination&quot; (when the object culminates) is often used to mean upper culmination.

An object&#x27;s altitude (&quot;A&quot;) in degrees at its upper culmination is equal to 90 minus the observer&#x27;s latitude (&quot;L&quot;) plus the object&#x27;s declination (&quot;δ&quot;): 
This equation is the basis for the meridian altitude method for latitude determination.

==Cases==
Three cases are dependent on the observer&#x27;s latitude (&quot;L&quot;) and the declination (&quot;δ&quot;) of the celestial object:
*The object is above the horizon even at its lower culmination; i.e. if (i.e. if in absolute value the declination is more than the colatitude, in the corresponding hemisphere)
*The object is below the horizon even at its upper culmination; i.e. if (i.e. if in absolute value the declination is more than the colatitude, in the opposite hemisphere)
*The upper culmination is above and the lower below the horizon, so the body is observed to rise and set daily; in the other cases (i.e. if in absolute value the declination is less than the colatitude)

The third case applies for objects in a part of the full sky equal to the cosine of the latitude (at the equator it applies for all objects, because the sky turns around the horizontal north–south line; at the poles it applies for none, because the sky turns around the vertical line). The first and second case each apply for half of the remaining sky.

==Period of time==

The period between a culmination and the next is a sidereal day, which is exactly 24 sidereal hours and 4 minutes less than 24 common solar hours, while the period between an upper culmination and a lower one is 12 sidereal hours. The period between successive day to day (rotational) culminations is effected mainly by Earth&#x27;s orbital proper motion, which produces the different lengths between the solar day (the interval between culminations of the Sun) and the sidereal day (the interval between culminations of any reference star) or the slightly more precise, precession unaffected, stellar day. This results in culminations occurring every solar day at different times, taking a sidereal year (366.3 days), a year that is one day longer than the solar year, for a culmination to reoccur. Therefore, only once every 366.3 solar days the culmination reoccurs at the same time of a solar day, while reoccurring every sidereal day. The remaining small changes in the culmination period time from sidereal year to sidereal year is on the other hand mainly caused by nutation (with a 18.6 years cycle), resulting in the longer time scale axial precession of Earth (with a 26,000 years cycle), while apsidal precession and other mechanics have a much smaller impact on sidereal observation, impacting Earth&#x27;s climate through the Milankovitch cycles significantly more. Though at such timescales stars themself change position, particularly those stars which have, as viewed from the Solar System, a high proper motion.

Stellar parallax appears to be a similar motion like all these apparent movements, but has only from non-averaged sidereal day to sidereal day a slight effect, returning to its original apparent position, completing a cycle every orbit, with a slight additional lasting change to the position due to the precessions. This phenomenon results from Earth changing position on its orbital path.

==The Sun==
From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight). When viewed from the region within either polar circle around the winter solstice of that hemisphere (the December solstice in the Arctic and the June solstice in the Antarctic), the Sun is below the horizon at both of its culminations.

Earth&#x27;s subsolar point occurs at the point where the upper culmination of the Sun reaches the point&#x27;s zenith. At this point, which moves around the tropics throughout the year, the Sun is perceived to be directly overhead.

We apply the previous equation, , in the following examples. 

Supposing that the declination of the Sun is +20° when it crosses the local meridian, then the complementary angle of 70° (from the Sun to the pole) is added to and subtracted from the observer&#x27;s latitude to find the solar altitudes at upper and lower culminations, respectively.
*From 52° north, the upper culmination is at 58° above the horizon due south, while the lower is at 18° below the horizon due north. This is calculated as 52° + 70° = 122° (the supplementary angle being 58°) for the upper, and 52° − 70° = −18° for the lower.
*From 80° north, the upper culmination is at 30° above the horizon due south, while the lower is at 10° above the horizon (midnight sun) due north.

==Circumpolar stars==

From most of the Northern Hemisphere, Polaris (the North Star) and the other stars of the constellation Ursa Minor circles counterclockwise around the north celestial pole and remain visible at both culminations (as long as the sky is clear and dark enough). In the Southern Hemisphere there is no bright pole star, but the constellation Octans circles clockwise around the south celestial pole and remains visible at both culminations.

Any astronomical objects that always remain above the local horizon, as viewed from the observer&#x27;s latitude, are described as circumpolar.

<text>The Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections previously called the Oriental and India Office Collections (OIOC) form a significant part of the holdings of the British Library in London, England.

==India Office collection==

The collections include the documents from the India Office Library and Records, relating to the entire history of British involvement in India and other parts of the eastern world, as well as materials in the languages of Asia-Pacific and of north and north-east Africa. It was located at Orbit House, 197 Blackfriars Road, London. Also, until 1998, The Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books was located at 14, Store Street, off Tottenham Court Road, London. Orbit House was demolished in 2004. 

The collections also include transcriptions of baptism, marriage, and burial records of Christians of European descent, sent to Britain from India during the period of British rule, which are a vital resource in researching the genealogy of Anglo-Indians or domiciled Europeans who lived there.

<text>2121 Avenue of the Stars, formerly known as Fox Plaza, is a 34-story, skyscraper in Century City, Los Angeles, California. It is owned by the Orange County–based Irvine Company.

== History ==

Fox Plaza was developed by billionaire Marvin Davis, on land he had retained after selling the adjacent 20th Century Fox Studio to Rupert Murdoch in 1985. The tower was completed in 1987. Its principal design architect was Scott Johnson, Founding Design Partner of Johnson Fain.

Former President Ronald Reagan had his offices on the 34th floor of the building for several years after leaving public office.

In 1988, Davis sold his 50% stake in Fox Plaza to 20th Century Fox, which was one of the building&#x27;s primary occupants. It resold it that same year to La Salle Partners for $320 million.

In 1997, Davis bought the building back from La Salle, for $253 million.

In 2000, Davis sold the building again, to billionaire Donald Bren&#x27;s Irvine Company, for $350 million.

As of 2019, the 34th floor was occupied by 20th Century Studios.

In 2024, Chicago-based law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP moved into two floors on the property.

== Design ==
The outer exterior of the building contains rust-red granite and glass panels.

Fox Plaza features a unique HVAC system where a large vertical air shaft is located in the core of the building. The air shaft begins below the building as an outdoor, cooler air intake pushing air to each floor&#x27;s fan room, and on the roof is located an exhaust for stale air. Such system design utilizes stack effect.

== Filming location ==
In a 2018 tour for &quot;Variety&quot;, the chief engineer of the building noted how the Fox Plaza has a large number of redundancies in its design, and he speculates that it&#x27;s because it was intended to be used as a filming location.

The building has been featured in at least four major motion pictures released by Fox. Its most famous appearance was in the 1988 action film &quot;Die Hard&quot;, where, while still under construction, it portrayed the fictional Nakatomi Plaza (also known as Nakatomi Tower), a building owned by a fictional Japanese conglomerate. The damaged version of the tower was made via a scale model special effect. In 2018, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a screening was held outside with the building in the background.

The plaza and a neighboring building are the main setting for the 1994 comedy &quot;Airheads&quot; where fictional radio station KPPX is located. Fox Plaza was also one of the buildings brought down at the end of &quot;Fight Club&quot;. The building plays an important role in the &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; episode &quot;99&quot;, in which detective Jake Peralta insists on visiting the building due to its role in &quot;Die Hard&quot; and causes his squad to miss their return flight to New York City.

The building can also be seen from the InterContinental hotel pool across the street in the &quot;Sunblock 5000&quot; TV ad in &quot;Robocop 2&quot; (1990).

The building as the Nakatomi Plaza from &quot;Die Hard&quot; appears in the 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, where it was pruned and sent to the Void by the Time Variance Authority and can be seen during the battle between Deadpool and Wolverine.

<doc id="181508" wikidata="Q1188571" url="?curid=181508" title="Intestacy">
<text>Intestacy is the condition of the estate of a person who dies without a legally valid will, resulting in the distribution of their estate under statutory intestacy laws rather than by their expressed wishes. Alternatively this may also apply where a will or declaration has been made, but only applies to part of the estate; the remaining estate forms the &quot;intestate estate&quot;. Intestacy law, also referred to as the law of descent and distribution, which vary by jurisdiction, refers to the body of law (statutory and case law), establish a hierarchy for inheritance, typically prioritizing close relatives such as spouses, children, and then extended family members and determines who is entitled to the property from the estate under the rules of inheritance.

==History and the common law==
Intestacy has a limited application in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or Roman law because the concept of a will is itself less important; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person&#x27;s next-of-kin title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate&#x27;s property by operation of law, beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by testamentary gift. A forced share (or legitime) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the forced heir. In matters of cross-border inheritance, the &quot;laws of succession&quot; is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and Sharia law jurisdictions.
After the Statute of Wills 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and real property by a &quot;will&quot;. Their personal property could formerly be disposed of by a &quot;testament&quot;, hence the hallowed legal merism &quot;last will and testament&quot;.

Common law sharply distinguished between real property and chattels. Real property for which no disposition had been made by will passed by the law of kinship and descent; chattel property for which no disposition had been made by testament was escheat to the Crown, or given to the Church for charitable purposes. This law became obsolete as England moved from being a feudal to a mercantile society, and chattels more valuable than land were being accumulated by townspeople.

==Rules==
Where a person dies without leaving a will, the rules of succession of the person&#x27;s place of habitual residence or of their domicile often apply, but it is also common for the jurisdiction where the property is located to govern its disposal, regardless of the decedent&#x27;s residence or domicile. In certain jurisdictions such as France, Switzerland, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and much of the Islamic world, entitlements arise whether or not there was a will. These are known as &quot;forced heirship&quot; rights and are not typically found in common law jurisdictions, where the rules of succession without a will (intestate succession) play a back-up role where an individual has not (or has not fully) exercised their right to dispose of property in a will.

==Current law==
In most contemporary common-law jurisdictions, the law of intestacy is patterned after the common law of descent. Property goes first or in major part to a spouse, then to children and their descendants; if there are no descendants, the line of inheritance goes back up the family tree to the parents, the siblings, the siblings&#x27; descendants, the grandparents, the parents&#x27; siblings, and the parents&#x27; siblings&#x27; descendants, and usually so on further to the more remote degrees of kinship. The operation of these laws varies from one jurisdiction to another.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====

The rules of succession are the Intestacy Rules set out in the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 23) and associated legislation. 

For deaths after 1 October 2014, the rules where someone dies intestate leaving a spouse or civil partner are as follows:
* if there are no issue (i.e. children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren etc.) then the spouse or civil partner inherits the entire estate; or
* if there are issue, the spouse or civil partner receives the personal chattels and the first £322,000, then half of everything else passing under the intestacy rules. The other half passes to the issue on the statutory trusts (see below).

Where there is no spouse or civil partner, the assets pass in the following order of priority, such that no-one is entitled in any lower category if there is a living person entitled in a higher one: 
* issue, on the statutory trusts (see below);
* parents;
* full-blood brothers and sisters, on the statutory trusts;
* half-blood brothers and sisters, on the statutory trusts;
* grandparents;
* full-blood uncles and aunts, or any living descendants of deceased aunts or uncles (such as cousins), on the statutory trusts; or
* half-blood uncles and aunts, or any living descendants of deceased half-aunts or half-uncles (such as half-cousins), on the statutory trusts.

In the above &quot;the statutory trusts&quot; mean:
* that a person who would be entitled if they were adult does not become entitled until they attain 18; and
* where a person who would have been entitled has predeceased the intestate, but has left issue, those issue who survive the intestate share, &quot;per stirpes&quot;, their ancestor&#x27;s share.

Where no beneficiaries on the above list exist, the person&#x27;s estate generally escheats (i.e. is legally assigned) to the Crown (via the Bona vacantia division of the Treasury Solicitor) or to the Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster when the deceased was a resident of either. In limited cases a discretionary distribution might be made by one of these bodies to persons who would otherwise be without entitlement under strict application of the rules of inheritance.

These rules have been supplemented by the discretionary power of the court contained in the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 so that fair provision can be made for a dependent spouse or other relative where the strict divisions set down in the intestacy rules would produce an unfair result, for example by providing additional support for a dependent minor or disabled child vis-a-vis an adult child who has a career and no longer depends on their parent.

====Scotland====
The law on intestacy in Scotland broadly follows that of England and Wales with some variations. A notable difference is that all possible (blood) relatives can qualify for benefit (i.e. they are not limited to grandparents or their descendants). Once a class is &#x27;exhausted&#x27;, succession continues to the next line of ascendants, followed by siblings, and so on. In a complete absence of relatives of the whole or half-blood, the estate passes to the Crown (as &quot;ultimus haeres&quot;). The Crown has a discretion to benefit people unrelated to the intestate, e.g. those with moral claims on the estate.

===Canada===
In Canada the laws vary from province to province. As in England, most jurisdictions apply rules of intestate succession to determine next of kin who become legal heirs to the estate. Also, as in England, if no identifiable heirs are discovered, the property may escheat to the government.

===United States===
In the United States intestacy laws vary from state to state. Each of the separate states uses its own intestacy laws to determine the ownership of residents&#x27; intestate property.

Attempts in the United States to make probate and intestate succession uniform from state to state, through efforts such as the Uniform Probate Code, have been met with limited success.

The distribution of the property of an intestate decedent is the responsibility of the &quot;administrator&quot; (or &quot;personal representative&quot;) of the estate: typically the administrator is chosen by the court having jurisdiction over the decedent&#x27;s property, and is frequently (but not always) a person nominated by a majority of the decedent&#x27;s heirs.

Federal law controls intestacy of Native Americans.

Many states have adopted all or part of the Uniform Probate Code, but often with local variations, In Ohio, the law of intestate succession has been modified significantly from the common law, and has been essentially codified. The state of Washington also has codified its intestacy law. New York has perhaps the most complicated law of descent of distribution. Maryland&#x27;s intestacy laws specify not only the distribution, but also the order of the distribution among family members. Florida&#x27;s intestacy statute permits the heirs of a deceased spouse of the decedent to inherit, if the decedent has no other heirs.

<text>Andrew Jackson Young Jr. (born March 12, 1932) is an American politician, diplomat, and activist. Beginning his career as a pastor, Young was an early leader in the civil rights movement, serving as executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and a close confidant to Martin Luther King Jr. Young later became active in politics, serving as a U.S. Congressman from Georgia, United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the Carter Administration, and 55th Mayor of Atlanta. He was the first African American elected to Congress from Georgia since Reconstruction, as well as one of the first two African Americans elected to Congress from the former Confederacy since Reconstruction, alongside Barbara Jordan of Texas. Since leaving office, Young has founded or served in many organizations working on issues of public policy and political lobbying.

==Early life==
Andrew Young was born on March 12, 1932, in New Orleans, to Daisy Young, a schoolteacher, and Andrew Jackson Young, a dentist. Young&#x27;s father hired a professional boxer to teach Andrew and his brother to defend themselves. In a 1964 interview with author Robert Penn Warren for his book, &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?,&quot; Young recalls the tensions of segregation in New Orleans, especially growing up in a fairly well-to-do household. He recalls his parents trying to &quot;compensate for segregation&quot; by providing for their children but were reluctant to help less wealthy black communities in the area.

Young attended Dillard University for one year before graduating from Howard University. He then earned a divinity degree from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1955. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

==Early career==

Young was appointed to serve as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama. It was there in Marion that he met Jean Childs, who later became his wife. Young became interested in Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s concept of nonviolent resistance as a tactic for social change. He encouraged African Americans to register to vote in Alabama, and sometimes faced death threats while doing so. It was at this time that he became a friend and ally of Martin Luther King Jr.

In 1955 he accepted a pastorate at Bethany Congregational Church in Thomasville, Georgia.

In 1957, Young and Jean moved to New York City when he accepted a job with the Youth Division of the National Council of Churches. While in New York City, Young regularly appeared on &quot;Look Up and Live&quot;, a weekly Sunday morning television program on CBS, produced by the National Council of Churches in an effort to reach out to secular youth.

Young served as a pastor of the Evergreen Congregational Church in Beachton, Georgia, from 1957 to 1959.

In 1960, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. No longer satisfied with his work in New York City, Young moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1961 upon the invitation of Bernard Lafayette and worked to register black voters. Young played a key role in the 1963 events in Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a mediator between the white and black communities as they negotiated against a background of protests.

In 1964, Young was named executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. As a colleague and friend of Martin Luther King Jr., he was a strategist and negotiator during the Civil Rights Campaigns in Birmingham (1963), St. Augustine (1964), Selma (1965), and Atlanta (1966). He was jailed for his participation in civil rights demonstrations, both in Selma, Alabama, and in St. Augustine, Florida. The movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Young was with King in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated in 1968.

==Congress==

In 1970, Andrew Young ran as a Democrat for the 5th District seat in the US House of Representatives, from Georgia, but was unsuccessful. After his defeat, Rev. Fred C. Bennette Jr. introduced him to Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, who served as his campaign finance chairman. Young ran again in 1972 and won. He later was re-elected in 1974 and in 1976. During his four-plus years in Congress, he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and was involved in several debates regarding foreign relations, including the decision to stop supporting the Portuguese attempts to hold on to their colonies in southern Africa. Young also sat on the powerful Rules Committee and the Banking and Urban Development Committee. Young opposed the Vietnam War, helped enact legislation that established the U.S. Institute for Peace, established the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area and negotiated federal funds for MARTA and the Atlanta Highways.

==American Ambassador to the United Nations==
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Young was the first African American to hold the position. Atlanta city councilman Wyche Fowler won the special election to fill Young&#x27;s seat in Congress.

Although the US and the UN enacted an arms embargo against South Africa, as President Carter&#x27;s UN ambassador, Young vetoed economic sanctions.

Young caused controversy when, during a July 1978 interview with French newspaper &quot;Le Matin de Paris&quot; while discussing the Soviet Union and its treatment of political dissidents, he said, &quot;We still have hundreds of people that I would categorize as political prisoners in our prisons&quot;, in reference to jailed civil-rights and anti-war protestors. In response, US Representative Larry McDonald (D-GA) sponsored a resolution to impeach Young, but the measure failed 293 to 82. Carter referred to it in a press conference as an &quot;unfortunate statement.&quot;

In 1979, Young played a leading role in advancing a settlement in Rhodesia with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, who had been two of the rebel leaders in the Rhodesian Bush War, which had ended in 1979. The settlement paved the way for Mugabe to take power as Prime Minister of the newly formed Republic of Zimbabwe. There had been a general election in 1979, bringing Bishop Abel Muzorewa to power as leader of the United African National Council leading to the short-lived country of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Though majority rule had been implemented, many in the international community felt that the reforms were not wide-ranging enough. Young refused to accept the election results and described the election as &quot;neofascist,&quot; a sentiment echoed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 445 and 448. The situation was resolved the next year with the Lancaster House Agreement and the establishment of Zimbabwe.

Young&#x27;s favoring of Mugabe and Nkomo over Muzorewa and his predecessor and ally, Ian Smith, has been controversial. Many African-American activists, including Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King, supported the anticolonialism represented by Mugabe and Nkomo. However, it was opposed by others, including civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin, who argued that the 1979 election had been &quot;free and fair&quot;, as well as Senators Harry F. Byrd Jr. (I-VA) and Jesse Helms (R-NC). It was later criticized in 2005 by Gabriel Shumba, executive director of the anti-Mugabe Zimbabwe Exiles Forum.

In July 1979, Young discovered that an upcoming report by the United Nations Division for Palestinian Rights called for the creation of a Palestinian State. Young wanted to delay the report because the Carter Administration was dealing with too many other issues at the time. He met with the UN representatives of several Arab countries to try to convince them the report should be delayed; they agreed in principle but insisted that the Palestine Liberation Organization also had to agree. As a result, on July 20, Young met with Zuhdi Labib Terzi, the UN representative of the PLO, at the apartment of the UN Ambassador from Kuwait. On August 10, news of the meeting became public when the Mossad leaked its illegally-acquired transcript of the meeting first to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and then through his office to &quot;Newsweek&quot;. The meeting was highly controversial since the United States had already promised Israel that it would not meet directly with the PLO until it recognized Israel&#x27;s right to exist.

During the controversy, Young took a break and was invited by John F. Kennedy Jr. to speak about apartheid in South Africa at Brown University.

Young&#x27;s UN ambassadorship ended on August 14. Carter denied any complicity in what was called the &quot;Andy Young Affair&quot; and asked Young to resign. Asked about the incident by &quot;Time&quot; soon afterward, Young stated, &quot;It is very difficult to do the things that I think are in the interest of the country and maintain the standards of protocol and diplomacy... I really don&#x27;t feel a bit sorry for anything that I have done.&quot; Soon afterward, on the television show &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, he stated that Israel was &quot;stubborn and intransigent.&quot;

After his ambassadorship ended, Young became a guest lecturer at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan.

==Atlanta mayor==
In 1981, after being urged by a number of people, including Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Young ran for mayor of Atlanta. He was elected later that year with 55% of the vote, succeeding Maynard Jackson. As mayor of Atlanta, he brought in $70 billion of new private investment. He continued and expanded Jackson&#x27;s programs for including minority and female-owned businesses in all city contracts. The Mayor&#x27;s Task Force on Education established the Dream Jamboree College Fair that tripled the college scholarships given to Atlanta public school graduates. In 1985, he was involved in renovating the Atlanta Zoo, which was renamed Zoo Atlanta. Young was re-elected as mayor in 1985 with more than 80% of the vote. Atlanta hosted the 1988 Democratic National Convention during Young&#x27;s tenure. He was prohibited by term limits from running for a third term. During his tenure, he talked about how he was &quot;glad to be mayor of this city, where once the mayor had me thrown in jail.&quot;

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago saw Young ranked as the fifteenth-best American big-city mayor to serve between the years 1820 and 1993. The survey also saw Young ranked the fifth-best big-city mayor to serve in office post-1960.

== 1990 Georgia gubernatorial election ==

After leaving the mayor&#x27;s office in early 1990, Young launched a bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1990. He ran in a primary that included three former or future governors of Georgia: then lieutenant governor Zell Miller, then-state senator Roy Barnes, and former governor Lester Maddox. The field also contained then state representative Lauren &quot;Bubba&quot; McDonald. The first poll put Young at 38 percent to Miller&#x27;s 30 percent, 15 percent for Maddox and 10 percent for Barnes with McDonald trailing at 7 percent. Young campaigned hard but by the primary, with no central message, his campaign ran into trouble against the well-heeled and prepared lieutenant governor. Miller led the primary with 40 percent to Young&#x27;s 29 percent and 21 percent for Barnes, Maddox got 7 percent and McDonald rounded out at 3 percent. Future U.S. senator Johnny Isakson won the Republican nomination. After Miller&#x27;s stunning and broad-based primary win, Young&#x27;s campaign floundered. Many think he failed in his effort by trying to garner support amongst rural, conservative white voters, rather than turning out his urban and African-American base. Also, Young never found an issue that roused supporters, unlike Miller, who won voters by championing a state lottery. Miller won the runoff, 2 to 1 and ended Young&#x27;s gubernatorial aspirations for good.

==Post-mayoral career==

Young has been a director of the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy, and is also the chairman of the board for the Global Initiative for the Advancement of Nutritional Therapy.

In 1990, Young was a member of the Atlanta Olympic bid committee. He served as co-chair of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games.

From 2000 to 2001, Young served as president of the National Council of Churches.

In 2003, Young founded the Andrew Young Foundation, an organization meant to support and promote education, health, leadership and human rights in the United States, Africa and the Caribbean.

From February to August 2006, Young served as the public spokesman for Working Families for Walmart, an advocacy group for the retail chain Walmart. Young resigned from the position soon after a controversial interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Sentinel&quot;, in which, when asked about Walmart hurting independent businesses, he replied, &quot;You see those are the people who have been overcharging us, and they sold out and moved to Florida. I think they&#x27;ve ripped off our communities enough. First it was Jews, then it was Koreans and now it&#x27;s Arabs.&quot;

In 2007, GoodWorks Productions released the documentary film &quot;Rwanda Rising&quot;, about Rwanda&#x27;s progress since the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Young also served as the film&#x27;s narrator. &quot;Rwanda Rising&quot; premiered as the opening night selection at the Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles in 2007.

An edited version of &quot;Rwanda Rising&quot; served as the pilot episode of &quot;Andrew Young Presents&quot;, a series of quarterly, hour-long specials airing on nationally syndicated television.

On January 22, 2008, Young appeared as a guest on the television show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. Host Stephen Colbert invited Young to appear during the writers&#x27; strike, because, in 1969, Young and Colbert&#x27;s father had worked together to mediate a hospital workers&#x27; strike. Young made another appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on November 5, 2008, to talk about the election of Barack Obama to the presidency.

On January 19, 2015, Young gave the keynote address at Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration Day. The theme was &quot;Dismantling Segregation: Race, Poverty, and Privilege&quot;, and Young spoke about his experiences in Selma, stories of traveling with King, and his advice to the next generation of leaders.

On May 13, 2019, Young gave the keynote address at Emory University&#x27;s spring commencement ceremony.

On May 29, 2020, Young remarked on the protests in Atlanta in reaction to the murder of George Floyd. He stated that riots, violence, and looting &quot;hurt the cause instead of helping it&quot;.

Young is co-chairman of Rodney Cook Sr. Park along with National Monuments Foundation president Rodney Mims Cook Jr. This peace park is located in the Vine City neighborhood on Atlanta&#x27;s westside and has a strong civil rights focus.

In 2023, Young launched the &quot;Andrew Young HBCU Scholarship Program&quot; funded by McGraw Hill Education in partnership with the Institute of World Politics Chair of Law and Human Rights, Matthew Daniels and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The scholarship is awarded to students who &quot;demonstrate the vision and leadership potential to be an ambassador for the unifying, non-violent principles of Dr. King and Ambassador Young, rooted in respect for the fundamental dignity, rights, and equality of all human beings.&quot; Young also endorsed a companion bible study for those seeking to apply Dr. King&#x27;s teachings to improving their communities.

<doc id="181511" wikidata="Q2470060" url="?curid=181511" title="Black Swan Records">
<text>Black Swan Records was an American jazz and blues record label founded in 1921 in Harlem, New York. It was the first widely distributed label to be owned, operated, and marketed to African Americans. Founded by Harry Pace with W.C. Handy, Black Swan Records was established to give African Americans more creative liberties. Black Swan was revived in the 1990s for CD reissues of its historic jazz and blues recordings.

==History==
Black Swan&#x27;s parent company, Pace Phonograph Corporation, was founded in March 1921 by Harry Pace and was based in Harlem. The new production company was formed after Pace&#x27;s music publishing partnership with W. C. Handy, Pace &amp; Handy, had dissolved. Black Swan, which sought to specialize in classical recordings, served as an investment opportunity for the Talented Tenth. As recognized by Thomas Brothers, &quot;luminaries like Jack Nail and James Weldon Johnson served on the Black Swan board of directors&quot;, and &quot;The Crisis&quot;, the journal then edited by W.E.B. Du Bois, and published by the NAACP, invested its profits in the company.

Bert Williams was an early investor in Pace Phonograph. Williams also promised to record for the company once his exclusive contract with Columbia Records ended, but he died before that could occur.

Pace Phonograph Corporation was renamed Black Swan Phonograph Company in the fall of 1922. Both the record label and production company were named after 19th century opera star Elizabeth Greenfield, who was known as the Black Swan.
Former employees of Pace &amp; Handy staffed the new company: Fletcher Henderson, who functioned as the recording manager, provided piano accompaniment for singers and led a small band for recording sessions. William Grant Still was named arranger and later musical director. Ads for Black Swan often ran in &quot;The Crisis&quot;.

Black Swan proved moderately successful. It recorded African American musicians, but as the label grew in popularity, Pace believed competing white-owned labels such as Columbia Records sought to &quot;obstruct the progress and curtail the popularity of Black Swan Records&quot;. Although advertising for Black Swan Records claimed all its musicians and employees were African American, it sometimes used white musicians to back some of its singers.

The production company declared bankruptcy in December 1923, and in March 1924 Paramount Records bought the Black Swan label. &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; reported the event by detailing important accomplishments of Black Swan in a short career span, including: pointed out—to the major, all white-owned, record companies—the significant market demand for black artists; prompted several major companies to begin publishing music by these performers. In addition, the Defender credited Pace with showing the majors how to target black audiences and to advertise in black newspapers. Paramount discontinued the Black Swan label a short time later.

The Black Swan label was revived in the 1990s for a series of CD reissues of historic jazz and blues recordings originally issued on Black Swan and Paramount. These CDs were issued by George H. Buck Jr&#x27;s Jazzology and GHB labels under the control of the George H. Buck Jr. Jazz Foundation, which gained rights to the Paramount back-catalogue but not the Paramount name. Rights to the name &quot;Black Swan Records&quot; were also transferred to GHB.

<text>Porta Westfalica () is a town in the district of Minden-Lübbecke, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

The name &quot;Porta Westfalica&quot; is Latin and means &quot;gate to Westphalia&quot;. Coming from the north, the gorge is the entry to the region of Westphalia. The name was coined by scholars of the 19th century.

==History==

The town Porta Westfalica was established in 1973 by merging fifteen villages surrounding the gorge. The centre of the modern town is the former village of Hausberge, which was first mentioned in 1096.

The Emperor William Monument was erected near the town by the then Prussian Province of Westphalia between 1892 and 1896 The monument, which is around 88 metres high, is classified as one of Germany&#x27;s national monuments.

From 18 March 1944 until 1 April 1945 a concentration camp was established in the Barkhausen quarter. From 1 February 1945 until 1 April 1945 a camp was used in the Hausberge quarter. In the Lerbeck quarter also was a concentration camp in use from 1 October 1944 until 1 April 1945. In the Neesen quarter was a location for the forced labour for some of the inmates. All of these camps were subcamps of the Neuengamme concentration camp.

On 10 January 2015, Belgian footballer Junior Malanda died in a car accident near the town, aged 20.

==Geography==
Porta Westfalica is situated on the right bank of the Weser (except for the Barkhausen quarter), near the Porta Westfalica gorge, where the river runs through the passage between the mountain chains of the Wiehen Hills in the west and the Weser Uplands in the east. The gorge appears like a gate to the region Westphalia, which lies to the south of it. It is overlooked by the Jakobsberg and Wittekindsberg hills.

<doc id="181516" wikidata="Q994175" url="?curid=181516" title="Brunswick Records">
<text>Brunswick Records is an American record label founded in 1916.

==History==

===1916–1929===
Records under the Brunswick label were first produced by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, a company based in Dubuque, Iowa which had been manufacturing products ranging from pianos to sporting equipment since 1845. The company first began producing phonographs in 1916, then began marketing their own line of records as an afterthought. These first Brunswick records used the vertical cut system like Edison Disc Records, and were not sold in large numbers. They were recorded in the United States but sold only in Canada.
In January 1920, a new line of Brunswick Records was introduced in the U.S. and Canada that employed the lateral cut system which was becoming the default cut for 78 discs. Brunswick started its standard popular series at 2000 and ended up in 1940 at 8517. However, when the series reached 4999, they skipped over the previous allocated 5000s and continued at 6000. When they reached 6999, they continued at 7301 (because the early 7000s had been previously allocated as their Race series). The parent company marketed them extensively, and within a few years Brunswick became a competitor to America&#x27;s &quot;big three&quot; record companies, Edison Records, Victor, and Columbia Records.

The Brunswick line of home phonographs were commercially successful. Brunswick had a hit with their Ultona phonograph capable of playing Edison Disc Records, Pathé disc records, and standard lateral 78s. In late 1924, Brunswick acquired the Vocalion Records label.

Audio fidelity of early-1920s, acoustically-recorded Brunswick discs is above average for the era. They were pressed into good quality shellac, although not as durable as that used by Victor. General music director Walter B. Rogers and his colleague Gus Haenschen lured significant classical and popular soloists into Brunswick&#x27;s roster, including Sigrid Onegin, Marie Tiffany, Michael Bohnen, Mario Chamlee, Richard Bonelli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, and popular singers Al Bernard, Ernest Hare, and light-voiced Nick Lucas. Significant Brunswick instrumentalists included pianists Leopold Godowsky and Josef Hofmann, and violinists Bronislaw Huberman and Max Rosen.

In the spring of 1925 Brunswick introduced its own version of electrical recording derived from the Pallophotophone system, developed by Charles A. Hoxie (and licensed from General Electric) using photoelectric cells, which Brunswick called the &quot;Light-Ray&quot; process. These early electric discs have a harsh equalization which does not compare well to early electric Columbias and Victors, and the company&#x27;s logbooks from 1925–27 show many recordings that were unissued for technical reasons having to do with the GE system&#x27;s electronic and sonic inconsistencies. (Only Brunswick and Vocalion records pressed at their West Coast plant bore the name &quot;Light-Ray Process&quot; on the labels.)
Once Brunswick&#x27;s engineers had tentative control of their new equipment, the company expanded its popular music recording activities, exploiting its roster of stars: the dance bands of Bob Haring, Isham Jones, Ben Bernie, Abe Lyman, Earl Burtnett, and banjoist Harry Reser and his various ensembles (especially the Six Jumping Jacks), and Al Jolson (whose record labels proclaimed him &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Entertainer With Orchestra&quot;).

Then based in Chicago (although they maintained an office and studio in New York), many of the city&#x27;s best orchestras and performers recorded for Brunswick. The label&#x27;s jazz roster included Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington (usually as the Jungle Band), King Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Andy Kirk, Roger Wolfe Kahn, and Red Nichols. Brunswick initiated a 7000 race series (with the distinctive &#x27;lightning bolt&#x27; label design, also used for their popular 100 hillbilly series) as well as the Vocalion 1000 race series. These race records series recorded hot jazz, urban and rural blues, and gospel. Brunswick also had a very successful business supplying radio with sponsored transcriptions of popular music, comedy and personalities.

In the early 1920s Brunswick also embarked on an ambitious domestic classical instrumental recording program which carried over into the electrical era, recording violinist Bronislaw Huberman, pianists Josef Hofmann and Leopold Godowsky (both of whom made the majority of their American recordings for Brunswick), and the New York String Quartet. They moved into orchestral recording in 1922 with the renowned &quot;Capitol Grand Orchestra&quot; under Erno Rapee from the Capitol Theatre in New York (at a time when Eugene Ormandy was the orchestra&#x27;s concertmaster), then contracting with the Minneapolis Symphony under Henri Verbrugghen and the Cleveland Orchestra under Nikolai Sokoloff in 1924, the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street) under Gennaro Papi, and in a tremendous steal from Victor, they put the New York Philharmonic with conductors Willem Mengelberg and Arturo Toscanini on their artists roster - but only briefly. The popular records, which used small performing groups, were difficult enough to make with the photoelectric cell process; symphony orchestra recording, however, further exacerbated the problems of the &quot;Light-Ray&quot; system. Few orchestral records were approved for issue and those that did appear on the market often combined excellent performances with execrable sound, which particularly displeased Toscanini (only two sides he conducted were ever released). Brunswick found it expedient and ultimately cheaper to contract with European companies (whose electrical recording systems surpassed Brunswick&#x27;s). Among the recordings Brunswick imported and issued under their own label (through an agreement reached with Polydor, Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s export branch) were historic performances conducted by Hans Pfitzner and Richard Strauss—the latter conducting critically acclaimed performances of his symphonic poems &quot;Don Juan&quot; and &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&#x27;s Merry Pranks&quot;, recorded in Berlin in 1929–30. Some of these recordings have been reissued on CD.

Brunswick itself switched to a conventional condenser microphone recording process (licensed through Western Electric) in 1927, with better results. Prior to this, however, they had introduced the Brunswick Panatrope all-electric phonograph with electric amplification. This phonograph met with critical acclaim, and composer Ottorino Respighi selected the Brunswick Panatrope to play a recording of bird songs in his composition &quot;The Pines of Rome&quot;. Jack Kapp became the record company executive of Brunswick in 1930.

=== 1930–1944 ===
In April 1930, Brunswick-Balke-Collender sold Brunswick Records to Warner Bros., and the company&#x27;s headquarters moved to New York. Warner Bros. hoped to make their own soundtrack recordings for their sound-on-disc Vitaphone system. A number of interesting recordings were made by actors during this period, featuring songs from musical films. Actors who made recordings included Noah Beery, Charles King, and J. Harold Murray. During this Warner Brothers period Brunswick signed Bing Crosby, who was to become their biggest recording star, as well as the Mills Brothers, Adelaide Hall, the Boswell Sisters, Cab Calloway, the Casa Loma Orchestra and Ozzie Nelson.

In November 1930, the new budget-line, Melotone, debuted, entering a field of lower-priced electrical records, including Columbia&#x27;s Clarion, Velvet Tone, Harmony and the labels of the Plaza Music Company, such as Perfect, Banner, and Romeo. Melotone releases before the ARC takeover of December 1931 are not duplicated on these labels. When Vitaphone was abandoned in favor of sound-on-film systems—and record industry sales plummeted due to the Great Depression—Warner Bros. leased the Brunswick record operation to Consolidated Film Industries, the parent company of the American Record Corporation (ARC), in December 1931. In 1932, the UK branch of Brunswick was acquired by British Decca.

Between early 1932 and 1939, Brunswick was ARC&#x27;s flagship label, selling for 75 cents, while all of the other ARC labels were selling for 35 cents. Best selling artists during that time were Bing Crosby, the Boswell Sisters, the Mills Brothers, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Abe Lyman, Casa Loma Orchestra, Leo Reisman, Ben Bernie, Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, and Anson Weeks. Many of these artists moved over to Decca in late 1934, causing Brunswick to reissue popular records by these artists on the ARC dime store labels as a means to compete with Decca&#x27;s 35 cent price.
In 1939, the American Record Corp. was bought by the Columbia Broadcasting System for $750,000, which discontinued the Brunswick label in 1940, in favor of reviving the Columbia label (as well as reviving the OKeh label, replacing Vocalion). This, along with the lower than agreed-upon sales/production numbers, violated the Warner lease agreement, resulting in the Brunswick trademark reverting to Warner. In 1941, Warner sold the Brunswick and Vocalion labels to American Decca (which Warner had a financial interest in), with all masters recorded prior to December 1931. Rights to recordings from late December 1931 on were retained by CBS/Columbia.

In 1943, Decca revived the Brunswick label, mostly for reissues of recordings from earlier decades, particularly Bing Crosby&#x27;s early hits of 1931 and jazz items from the 1920s. Since then, Decca and its successors have had ownership of the historic Brunswick Records archive from this time period.

===1945–1956===
After World War II, American Decca releases were issued in the United Kingdom on the Brunswick label until 1968 when the MCA Records label was introduced in the UK. During the war, British Decca sold its American branch. By 1952, Brunswick was put under the management of Decca&#x27;s Coral Records subsidiary. That same year, Brunswick resumed releasing new material, initially as rhythm and blues specialty label, adding pop music in 1957. Later in the 1950s, American Decca made Brunswick its leading rock and roll label, featuring artists such as Buddy Holly &amp; the Crickets, with releases having backup vocals (by The Picks or The Roses) and labeled under the group name without reference to Holly. Hit records by Buddy Holly were released during the same period of his career on the co-owned Coral Records. The records released on Coral by Holly normally were without backup vocals, with the exception of &quot;Rave On&quot; and &quot;Early In The Morning&quot;. In 1957, Brunswick became a subsidiary label to Coral. A pre-Four Seasons Nick Massi made his recording debut for Brunswick in 1959.

===1957–1979/R&amp;B===

Starting in the latter part of the 1950s and continuing well into the 1970s, the label recorded mainly R&amp;B/soul acts, such as the label&#x27;s leading artist in the late 1950s and early/mid 1960s, Jackie Wilson, and later on, the Chi-Lites. Jackie Wilson&#x27;s manager, Nat Tarnopol, joined the label in 1957 as head of A&amp;R. Brunswick became a separate company and a unit of Decca in 1960 with Tarnopol serving as executive vice-president. He acquired a 50% interest in Brunswick from Decca in 1964 and then the rest of Brunswick from Decca in 1969 to settle disputes with Decca management. Nat Tarnopol worked with R&amp;B singer Jackie Wilson.

Many of the recordings which established Brunswick as a major force in R&amp;B and soul music in the mid-1960s and into the 1970s were supervised by producer Carl Davis in Chicago. He joined the label after helping to revive Jackie Wilson&#x27;s recording career with his production on Wilson&#x27;s 1966 hit, &quot;Whispers&quot;. Wilson and Davis collaborated the following year for one of the label&#x27;s biggest selling singles, &quot;Higher And Higher&quot;, which sold over two million copies (No. 1 R&amp;B, No. 5 pop). The Chi-Lites recorded two No. 1 R&amp;B hits in the 1970s for Brunswick, &quot;Have You Seen Her&quot; and &quot;Oh Girl&quot;, both co-written and co-produced by lead singer, Eugene Record. &quot;Oh Girl&quot; also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Davis formed a sister label, Dakar Records, in 1969, with Tyrone Davis (no relation) becoming its main artist and a major-selling R&amp;B act. Dakar was first distributed by Atlantic Records for two years, but moved under Brunswick distribution from January 1972, after the company became independent from Decca.

Brunswick and Dakar artists included the Chi-Lites, Hamilton Bohannon, Tyrone Davis, Jackie Wilson, Barbara Acklin, Young-Holt Unlimited, Gene Chandler, the Artistics, Otis Leavill, the Lost Generation, Walter Jackson, Erma Franklin, Willie Henderson &amp; the Soul, Maryann Farra &amp; Satin soul, Strutt, Touch, Sunny Nash and Little Richard. Main producers for the labels, along with Davis, were Eugene Record, Willie Henderson and later, Leo Graham, while staff arrangers during the Chicago years included Sonny Sanders, Tony Moulton Quinton Joseph and Willie Henderson.

The Chi-Lites&#x27; &quot;Oh Girl&quot; was the label&#x27;s only release from post-1957 to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, but Brunswick and Dakar managed to top the R&amp;B chart a total of 10 times during the same period, six by Jackie Wilson and two each by Tyrone Davis and the Chi-Lites.

Legal problems caused Brunswick to become dormant after 1982, in which Tarnopol licensed Brunswick recordings from 1957 onwards to the special products unit of Columbia Records. Brunswick had its last chart hits in 1982. Although Brunswick was eventually cleared of the charges, the situation, which had resulted in court action, left both the label and Tarnopol in financial difficulties. By then, Carl Davis and most of the artists had left the company. Tarnopol blamed his legal problems on a personal vendetta led by Lew Wasserman, the head of Decca&#x27;s parent corporation, MCA Inc. Tarnopol died in 1987 at age 56.

==Ownership==
The Tarnopol family only claims ownership of Brunswick recordings since Tarnopol joined Brunswick in 1957. Decca&#x27;s parent company, Universal Music controls the Decca-era pre-Tarnopol Brunswick recordings (excluding the late 1931–1939 era, which is still controlled by Columbia Records&#x27; parent, Sony Music Entertainment). The Decca-era Brunswick jazz catalogue is managed by the Verve Music Group (which is also part of Universal).

The official Brunswick Records web site has a detailed history of the Tarnopol-era Brunswick Records. The label was revived in 1995 by Nat&#x27;s children. and many of the Chicago soul recordings have been re-issued in recent years. Brunswick&#x27;s catalog is distributed by AMPED Distribution (a division of Alliance Entertainment).

<text>The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left. At different times the shifting lineup of the Other Ones also included Mark Karan, Steve Kimock, John Molo, Dave Ellis, Alphonso Johnson, Jimmy Herring, Rob Barraco, Jeff Chimenti, and Susan Tedeschi. In 2003, the Other Ones changed their name to The Dead.

The Other Ones continued the musical legacy of the Grateful Dead after Jerry Garcia died in 1995, playing many Grateful Dead songs and utilizing a similar jam band style that emphasized musical improvisation. The name of the band was taken from the title of the Grateful Dead song &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;, from 1968&#x27;s &quot;Anthem of the Sun&quot;.

In 1999, the Other Ones released &quot;The Strange Remain&quot;, a two-disc CD recorded live during their 1998 Furthur Festival tour.

To celebrate the release of the album, on February 8, 1999, the Other Ones performed a live webcast (the first for members of the Grateful Dead), from Herbie Herbert&#x27;s Sy Klopps Studios in San Francisco. The event, produced by Chime Interactive (then named Evolve Internet Solutions), featured a live conversation with online fans moderated by Steve Silberman with band members Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Mark Karan and Dave Ellis. The event began with a live performance of Friend of the Devil, the first time members of the Grateful Dead participated in live streaming.

<text>Charles Richard Drew (June 3, 1904 – April 1, 1950) was an American surgeon and medical researcher. He researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II. This allowed medics to save thousands of Allied forces&#x27; lives during the war. As the most prominent African American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, and resigned his position with the American Red Cross, which maintained the policy until 1950.

== Early life and education ==
Drew was born in 1904 into an African-American middle-class family in Washington, D.C. His father, Richard, was a carpet layer and his mother, Nora Burrell, trained as a teacher. Drew and three (two sisters, one brother) of his four younger siblings (three sisters and one brother total) grew up in Washington&#x27;s largely middle-class and interracial Foggy Bottom neighborhood. From a young age Drew began work as a newspaper boy in his neighborhood, daily helping deliver over a thousand newspapers to his neighbors. Drew attended Washington&#x27;s Dunbar High School which was well known for its equality and opportunities for all, despite the racial climate at the time. From 1920 until his marriage in 1939, Drew&#x27;s permanent address was in Arlington County, Virginia, although he graduated from Washington&#x27;s Dunbar High School in 1922 and resided elsewhere during that period of time.

Drew won an athletics scholarship to Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he played on the football as well as the track and field team, and later graduated in 1926. After college, Drew spent two years (1926–1928) as a professor of chemistry and biology, the first athletic director, and football coach at the historically black private Morgan College in Baltimore, Maryland, to earn the money to pay for medical school.

For his medical career Drew applied to Howard University, Harvard Medical School and later McGill University. Drew lacked some prerequisites for Howard University, and Harvard wanted to defer him a year, so to begin medical school promptly, Drew decided to attend McGill&#x27;s medical school in Montreal, Canada.

It was during this stage in his medical journey that Drew worked with John Beattie, who was conducting research regarding the potential correlations between blood transfusions and shock therapy. Shock occurs as the amount of blood in the body rapidly declines which can be due to a variety of factors such as a wound or lack of fluids (dehydration). As the body goes into shock, both blood pressure and body temperature decrease which then causes a lack of blood flow and a loss of oxygen in the body&#x27;s tissues and cells. Eventually, it became clear that transfusions were the solution to treating victims of shock, but at the time there was no successful method of transportation or mass storage of blood, leaving transfusions to be extremely limited to location.

At McGill, he achieved membership in Alpha Omega Alpha, a scholastic honor society for medical students, ranked second in his graduating class of 127 students, and received the standard Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery degree awarded by the McGill University Faculty of Medicine in 1933.
Drew&#x27;s first appointment as a faculty instructor was for pathology at Howard University from 1935 to 1936. He then joined Freedman&#x27;s Hospital, a federally operated facility associated with Howard University, as an instructor in surgery and an assistant surgeon. In 1938, Drew began graduate work at Columbia University in New York City on the award of a two-year Rockefeller fellowship in surgery. He then began postgraduate work, earning his Doctor of Science at Surgery at Columbia University. He spent time doing research at Columbia&#x27;s Presbyterian Hospital and wrote a doctoral thesis, &quot;Banked Blood: A Study on Blood Preservation,&quot; based on an exhaustive study of blood preservation techniques. It was through this blood preservation research where Drew realized blood plasma was able to be preserved, two months, longer through de-liquification, or the separation of liquid blood from the cells. When ready for use the plasma would then be able to return to its original state via reconstitution. This thesis earned him his Doctor of Science in Medicine degree in 1940, becoming the first African American to do so. The District of Columbia chapter of the American Medical Association allowed only white doctors to join, consequently &quot;... Drew died without ever being accepted for membership in the AMA.&quot;

== Blood for Britain ==
In late 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II and just after earning his doctorate, Drew was recruited by John Scudder to help set up and administer an early prototype program for blood storage and preservation. Here Drew was able to apply his thesis to aid in the blood preservation and transportation. He was to collect, test, and transport large quantities of blood plasma for distribution in the United Kingdom. Drew understood that plasma extraction from blood required both centrifugation and liquid extraction. Each extraction was conducted under controlled conditions to eliminate risk of contamination. Air concealment, ultraviolet light and Merthiolate were all used to mitigate the possibility of plasma contamination.

Drew went to New York City as the medical director of the United States&#x27; Blood for Britain project. It was here that Drew helped set the standard for other hospitals donating blood plasma to Britain by ensuring clean transfusions along with proper aseptic technique to ensure viable plasma dispersals were sent to Britain. The Blood for Britain project was a project to aid British soldiers and civilians by giving U.S. blood to the United Kingdom.

Drew created a central location for the blood collection process where donors could go to give blood. He made sure all blood plasma was tested before it was shipped out. He ensured that only skilled personnel handled blood plasma to avoid the possibility of contamination. The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma. As a result, the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association applauded Drew for his work.

==American Red Cross Blood Bank==

Drew&#x27;s work led to his appointment as director of the first American Red Cross Blood Bank in February 1941. He also invented what would be later known as bloodmobiles, mobile donation stations that could collect the blood and refrigerate it; this allowed for greater mobility in terms of transportation and increased prospective donations. The blood bank supplied blood to the U.S. Army and Navy, who initially rejected the blood of African-Americans and later accepted it only if it were stored separately from that of Whites. Drew objected to the exclusion of African-Americans&#x27; blood from plasma-supply networks, and in 1942 he resigned in protest.

== Academic achievements ==
In 1941, Drew&#x27;s distinction in his profession was recognized when he became the first African-American surgeon selected to serve as an examiner on the American Board of Surgery.

Drew had a lengthy research and teaching career, returning to Freedman&#x27;s Hospital and Howard University as a surgeon and professor of medicine in 1942. He was awarded the Spingarn Medal by the NAACP in 1944 for his work on the British and American projects. He was given an honorary doctor of science degree, first by Virginia State College in 1945 then by Amherst in 1947.

== Personal life ==
In 1939, Drew married Minnie Lenore Robbins, a professor of home economics at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, whom he had met earlier during that year. They had three daughters and a son. His daughter Charlene Drew Jarvis served on Council of the District of Columbia from 1979 to 2000, was the president of Southeastern University from 1996 until 2009, and was a president of the District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce.

== Death ==
Beginning in 1939, Drew traveled to Tuskegee, Alabama, to attend the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital. For the 1950 Tuskegee clinic, Drew drove along with three other black physicians. Drew was driving around 8 a.m. on April 1. Still fatigued from spending the night before in the operating theater, he lost control of the vehicle. After careening into a field, the car somersaulted three times. The three other physicians sustained minor injuries. Drew was trapped with severe wounds; his foot had become wedged beneath the brake pedal.

When reached by emergency technicians, he was in shock and barely alive due to severe leg injuries. Drew was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead a half hour after he first received medical attention. Drew&#x27;s funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, D.C.

Despite a popular myth to the contrary, once repeated on an episode (&quot;Dear Dad... Three&quot;) of the hit TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and in the novels &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; and &quot;The 480&quot;, Drew&#x27;s death was not the result of his having been refused hospital access because of his race. According to John Ford, one of the passengers in Drew&#x27;s car, Drew&#x27;s injuries were so severe that virtually nothing could have been done to save him. Ford added that a blood transfusion might have actually killed Drew sooner. This myth spread, however, because it was not then uncommon for black people to be refused treatment because there were not enough &quot;Negro beds&quot; available or the nearest hospital only serviced whites.

<doc id="181535" wikidata="Q272504" url="?curid=181535" title="Marcus Garvey">
<text>Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. (17 August 188710 June 1940) was a Jamaican political activist. He was the founder and first President-General of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL, commonly known as UNIA), through which he declared himself Provisional President of Africa. Garvey was ideologically a black nationalist and Pan-Africanist. His ideas came to be known as Garveyism.

Garvey was born into a moderately prosperous Afro-Jamaican family in Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay and was apprenticed into the print trade as a teenager. Working in Kingston, he became involved in trade unionism. He later lived briefly in Costa Rica, Panama, and England. On returning to Jamaica, he founded the UNIA in 1914. In 1916, he moved to the United States and established a UNIA branch in New York City&#x27;s Harlem district. Emphasising unity between Africans and the African diaspora, he campaigned for an end to European colonial rule in Africa and advocated the political unification of the continent. He envisioned a unified Africa as a one-party state, governed by himself, that would enact laws to ensure black racial purity. Although he never visited the continent, he was committed to the Back-to-Africa movement, arguing that part of the diaspora should migrate there. Garveyist ideas became increasingly popular, and the UNIA grew in membership. His black separatist views—and his relationship with white racists like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in the interest of advancing their shared goal of racial separatism—caused a division between Garvey and other prominent African-American civil rights activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, who promoted racial integration.

Believing that black people needed to be financially independent from white-dominated societies, Garvey launched various businesses in the U.S., including the Negro Factories Corporation and &quot;Negro World&quot; newspaper. In 1919, he became President of the Black Star Line shipping and passenger company, designed to forge a link between North America and Africa and facilitate African-American migration to Liberia. In 1923 Garvey was convicted of mail fraud for selling the company&#x27;s stock, and was imprisoned in the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta for nearly two years. Garvey blamed Jews and Catholics, claiming that they were prejudiced against him because of his links to the KKK. His sentence was commuted by U.S. president Calvin Coolidge and he was deported to Jamaica in 1927. Settling in Kingston with his wife Amy Jacques, Garvey established the People&#x27;s Political Party in 1929, briefly serving as a city councillor. With the UNIA in increasing financial difficulty, he relocated to London in 1935, where his anti-socialist stance distanced him from many of the city&#x27;s black activists. He died there in 1940, and in 1964 his body was returned to Jamaica for reburial in Kingston&#x27;s National Heroes Park.

Garvey was a controversial figure. Some in the African diasporic community regarded him as a pretentious demagogue, and were highly critical of his collaboration with white supremacists, his violent rhetoric, and his prejudice against mixed-race people and Jews. He received praise for encouraging a sense of pride and self-worth among Africans and the African diaspora amid widespread poverty, discrimination and colonialism. In Jamaica, he is recognized as a national hero, the first person to be recognized as such. His ideas exerted a considerable influence on such movements as Rastafari, the Nation of Islam and the Black Power Movement. In 2025, Garvey was posthumously pardoned by U.S. President Joe Biden.

==Early life==
===Childhood: 1887–1904===

Marcus Mosiah Garvey was born on 17 August 1887 in Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay, a town in the British colony of Jamaica. In the context of colonial Jamaican society, which had a colourist social hierarchy, Garvey was considered at the lowest end, being a black child who was of full African descent. However, later genetic research nevertheless revealed that he had ancestors from the Iberian Peninsula. Garvey&#x27;s paternal great- grandfather had been born into slavery prior to its abolition in Jamaica. His surname, which was of Irish origin, had been inherited from his family&#x27;s former enslavers.

His father, Malchus Garvey, was a stonemason; his mother, Sarah Richards, was a domestic servant and the daughter of peasant farmers. Malchus had had two previous wives before Sarah, having six children between them. Sarah bore him four additional children, of whom Marcus was the youngest, although two died in infancy. Because of his profession, Malchus&#x27; family were wealthier than many of their peasant neighbours; they were petite bourgeoise. Malchus was however reckless with his money and over the course of his life lost most of the land he owned to meet payments. Malchus had a book collection and was self-educated; he also served as an occasional layman at a local Wesleyan church. Malchus was an intolerant and punitive father and husband; he never had a close relationship with his son.

Up to the age of 14, Garvey attended a local church school; further education was unaffordable for the family. When not in school, Garvey worked on his maternal uncle&#x27;s tenant farm. He had friends, with whom he once broke the windows of a church, resulting in his arrest. Some of his friends were white, although he found that as they grew older they distanced themselves from him; he later recalled that a close childhood friend was a white girl: &quot;We were two innocent fools who never dreamed of a race feeling and problem.&quot; In 1901, Marcus was apprenticed to his godfather, a local printer. In 1904, the printer opened another branch at Port Maria, where Garvey began to work, travelling from Saint Ann&#x27;s Bay each morning.

===Early career in Kingston: 1905–1909===

In 1905 he moved to Kingston, where he boarded in Smith Village, a working-class neighbourhood. In the city, he secured work with the printing division of the P.A. Benjamin Manufacturing Company. He rose quickly through the company ranks, becoming their first Afro-Jamaican foreman. His sister and mother, by this point estranged from his father, moved to join him in the city. In January 1907, Kingston was hit by an earthquake that reduced much of the city to rubble. He, his mother, and his sister were left to sleep in the open for several months. In March 1908, his mother died. While in Kingston, Garvey converted to Catholicism.

Garvey became a trade unionist, vice president of the compositors&#x27; section of the Printers&#x27; Union, and took a leading role in the November 1908 print workers&#x27; strike. The strike was broken several weeks later and Garvey was sacked. Henceforth branded a troublemaker, Garvey was unable to find work in the private sector. He then found temporary employment with a government printer. As a result of these experiences, Garvey became increasingly angry at the inequalities present in Jamaican society.

Garvey involved himself with the National Club, Jamaica&#x27;s first nationalist organization, becoming its first assistant secretary in April 1910. The group campaigned to remove the Governor of Jamaica, Sydney Olivier, from office, and to end the migration of Indian &quot;coolies&quot;, or indentured workers, to Jamaica, as they were seen as a source of economic competition by the established population. With fellow Club member Wilfred Domingo he published a pamphlet expressing the group&#x27;s ideas, &quot;The Struggling Mass&quot;. In early 1910, Garvey began publishing a magazine, &quot;Garvey&#x27;s Watchman&quot;—its name a reference to George William Gordon&#x27;s &quot;The Watchman&quot;—although it lasted just three issues. He claimed it had a circulation of 3000, although this was likely an exaggeration. Garvey also enrolled in elocution lessons with the radical journalist Joseph Robert Love, coming to regard him as a mentor. With Garvey&#x27;s enhanced skill at speaking in a Standard English manner, he entered several public-speaking competitions.

===Travels abroad: 1910–1914===

Economic hardship in Jamaica led to growing emigration from the island. In mid-1910, Garvey travelled to Costa Rica, where an uncle had secured him employment as a timekeeper on a large banana plantation in the Limón Province owned by the United Fruit Company (UFC). Shortly after his arrival, the area experienced strikes and unrest in opposition to the UFC&#x27;s attempts to cut its workers&#x27; wages. Although as a timekeeper he was responsible for overseeing the manual workers, he became increasingly angered at how they were treated. In the spring of 1911 he launched a bilingual newspaper, &quot;Nation&quot;/&quot;La Nación&quot;, which criticized the actions of the UFC and upset many of the dominant strata of Costa Rican society in Limón. His coverage of a local fire, in which he questioned the motives of the fire brigade, resulted in his being brought in for police questioning. After his printing press broke, he was unable to replace the faulty part and terminated the newspaper.
Garvey then travelled through Central America, undertaking casual work as he made his way through Honduras, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. While in the port of Colón in Panama, he set up a new newspaper, &quot;La Prensa&quot; (&quot;The Press&quot;). In 1911, he became seriously ill with a bacterial infection and decided to return to Kingston. He then decided to travel to London, the heart of the British Empire, in the hope of advancing his informal education. In the spring of 1912 he sailed to England. Renting a room along Borough High Street in South London, he visited the House of Commons, where he was impressed by the politician David Lloyd George. He also visited Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park and began making speeches there. There were only a few thousand black people in London at the time, and they were often viewed as exotic; most worked as labourers. Garvey initially gained piecemeal work labouring in the city&#x27;s docks. In August 1912, his sister Indiana joined him in London, where she worked as a domestic servant.

In early 1913, he was employed as a messenger and handyman for the &quot;African Times and Orient Review&quot;, a magazine based in Fleet Street that was edited by Dusé Mohamed Ali. The magazine advocated Ethiopianism and home rule for British-ruled Egypt. In 1914, Mohamed Ali began employing Garvey&#x27;s services as a writer for the magazine. Garvey also took several evening classes in law at Birkbeck College in Bloomsbury. He planned a tour of Europe, spending time in Glasgow, Paris, Monte Carlo, Boulogne, and Madrid.

Back in London, he wrote an article on Jamaica for the &quot;Tourist&quot; magazine, and spent time reading in the library of the British Museum. There he discovered &quot;Up from Slavery&quot;, a book by the African-American entrepreneur and activist Booker T. Washington. Washington&#x27;s book heavily influenced Garvey. Now almost financially destitute and deciding to return to Jamaica, he unsuccessfully asked both the Colonial Office and the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines&#x27; Protection Society to pay for his journey. After managing to save the funds for a fare, he boarded the &quot;SS Trent&quot; in June 1914 for a three-week journey across the Atlantic. En route home, Garvey talked with an Afro-Caribbean missionary who had spent time in Basutoland and taken a Basuto wife. Discovering more about colonial Africa from this man, Garvey began to envision a movement that would politically unify black people of African descent across the world.

==Organization of the UNIA==
===Forming the UNIA: 1914–1916===
Garvey arrived back in Jamaica in July 1914. There, he saw his article for &quot;Tourist&quot; republished in &quot;The Gleaner&quot;. He began earning money selling greeting and condolence cards which he had imported from Britain, before later switching to selling tombstones.

Also in July 1914, Garvey launched the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, commonly abbreviated as UNIA. Adopting the motto of &quot;One Aim. One God. One Destiny&quot;, it declared its commitment to &quot;establish a brotherhood among the black race, to promote a spirit of race pride, to reclaim the fallen and to assist in civilising the backward tribes of Africa.&quot; Initially, it had only a few members. Many Jamaicans were critical of the group&#x27;s prominent use of the term &quot;Negro&quot;, a term which was often employed as an insult: Garvey, however, embraced the term in reference to black people of African descent.

Garvey became UNIA&#x27;s president and travelling commissioner; it was initially based out of his hotel room in Orange Street, Kingston. It portrayed itself not as a political organization but as a charitable club, focused on work to help the poor and to ultimately establish a vocational training college modelled on Washington&#x27;s Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Garvey wrote to Washington and received a brief, if encouraging reply; Washington died shortly after. UNIA officially expressed its loyalty to the British Empire, King George V, and the British effort in the ongoing First World War. In April 1915, Brigadier General L. S. Blackden lectured to the group on the war effort; Garvey endorsed Blackden&#x27;s calls for more Jamaicans to sign up to fight for the Empire on the Western Front. The group also sponsored musical and literary evenings as well as a February 1915 elocution contest, at which Garvey took first prize.

In August 1914, Garvey attended a meeting of the Queen Street Baptist Literary and Debating Society, where he met Amy Ashwood, recently graduated from the Westwood Training College for Women. She joined UNIA and rented a better premises for them to use as their headquarters, secured using her father&#x27;s credit. She and Garvey embarked on a relationship, which was opposed by her parents. In 1915, they secretly became engaged. When she suspended the engagement, he threatened to commit suicide, at which she resumed it.

Garvey attracted financial contributions from many prominent patrons, including the Mayor of Kingston and the Governor of Jamaica, William Manning. By appealing directly to Jamaica&#x27;s white elite, Garvey had skipped the brown middle-classes, comprising those who were classified as mulattos, quadroons, and octoroons. They were generally hostile to Garvey, regarding him as a pretentious social climber and being annoyed at his claim to be part of the &quot;cultured class&quot; of Jamaican society. Many also felt that he was unnecessarily derogatory when describing black Jamaicans, with letters of complaint being sent into the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; after it published one of Garvey&#x27;s speeches in which he referred to many of his people as &quot;uncouth and vulgar&quot;. One complainant, a Dr Leo Pink, related that &quot;the Jamaican Negro can not be reformed by abuse&quot;. After unsubstantiated allegations began circling that Garvey was diverting UNIA funds to pay for his own personal expenses, the group&#x27;s support began to decline. He became increasingly aware of how UNIA had failed to thrive in Jamaica and decided to migrate to the United States, sailing there aboard the &quot;SS Tallac&quot; in March 1916.

===Moving to the United States: 1916–1918===

Arriving in the United States, Garvey initially lodged with a Jamaican expatriate family living in Harlem, a largely black area of New York City. He began lecturing in the city, hoping to make a career as a public speaker, although at his first public speech he was heckled and fell off the stage. From New York City, he embarked on a U.S. speaking tour, crossing 38 states. At stopovers on his journey he listened to preachers from the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Black Baptist churches. While in Alabama, he visited the Tuskegee Institute and met with its new leader, Robert Russa Moton. After six months traveling across the U.S. lecturing, he returned to New York City.

In May 1917, Garvey launched a New York branch of UNIA. He declared membership open to anyone &quot;of Negro blood and African ancestry&quot; who could pay the 25-cents-a-month membership fee. He joined many other speakers who made speeches on the street, standing on step-ladders; he often did so at Speakers&#x27; Corner on 135th Street. In his speeches, he sought to reach across to both Afro-Caribbean migrants like himself and native African Americans. Through this, he began to associate with Hubert Harrison, who was promoting ideas of black self-reliance and racial separatism. In June, Garvey shared a stage with Harrison at the inaugural meeting of the latter&#x27;s Liberty League of Negro-Americans. Through his appearance here and at other events organized by Harrison, Garvey attracted growing public attention.

After the U.S. entered the First World War in April 1917, Garvey initially signed up to fight but was ruled physically unfit to do so. He later became an opponent of African-American involvement in the conflict, following Harrison in accusing it of being a &quot;white man&#x27;s war&quot;. In the wake of the East St. Louis Race Riots in May to July 1917, in which white mobs targeted black people, Garvey began calling for armed self-defense. He produced a pamphlet, &quot;The Conspiracy of the East St Louis Riots&quot;, which was widely distributed; proceeds from its sale went to victims of the riots. The Bureau of Investigation began monitoring him, noting that in speeches he employed more militant language than that used in print; it for instance reported his expressing the view that &quot;for every Negro lynched by whites in the South, Negroes should lynch a white in the North.&quot;

By the end of 1917, Garvey had attracted many of Harrison&#x27;s key associates in his Liberty League to join UNIA. Garvey also secured the support of the journalist John Edward Bruce, agreeing to step down from the group&#x27;s presidency in favor of Bruce. Bruce then wrote to Dusé Mohamed Ali to learn more about Garvey&#x27;s past. Mohamed Ali responded with a negative assessment of Garvey, suggesting that he simply used UNIA as a money-making scheme. Bruce read this letter to a UNIA meeting and put pressure on Garvey&#x27;s position. Garvey then resigned from UNIA, establishing a rival group that met at Old Fellows Temple. He also launched legal proceedings against Bruce and other senior UNIA members, with the court ruling that UNIA&#x27;s name and membership—now estimated at 600—belonged to Garvey, who resumed control over the organization.

===The growth of the UNIA: 1918–1921===

UNIA membership grew rapidly in 1918. In June that year it was incorporated, and in July a commercial arm, the African Communities&#x27; League, filed for incorporation. Garvey envisioned UNIA establishing an import-and-export business, a restaurant, and a laundry. He also proposed raising the funds to secure a permanent building as a base for the group. In April, Garvey launched a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Negro World&quot;, which Edmund David Cronon later noted remained &quot;the personal propaganda organ of its founder&quot;. Financially, the &quot;Negro World&quot; was backed by philanthropists such as Madam C. J. Walker, but six months after its launch was pursuing a special appeal for donations to keep it afloat.

Various journalists took Garvey to court for his failure to pay them for their contributions, a fact much publicized by rival publications; at the time, there were over 400 black-run newspapers and magazines in the U.S. Unlike many of these, Garvey refused to feature adverts for skin-lightening and hair-straightening products, urging black people to &quot;take the kinks out of your mind, instead of out of your hair&quot;. By the end of its first year, the circulation of &quot;Negro World&quot; was nearing 10,000; copies circulated not only in the U.S., but also in the Caribbean, Central, and South America. Several British West Indian islands banned the publication.
Garvey appointed his old friend Domingo, who had also arrived in New York City, as the newspaper&#x27;s editor. However, Domingo&#x27;s socialist views alarmed Garvey, who feared that they would imperil UNIA. Garvey had Domingo brought before UNIA&#x27;s nine-person executive committee, where the latter was accused of writing editorials professing ideas at odds with UNIA&#x27;s message. Domingo resigned several months later; he and Garvey henceforth became enemies. In September 1918, Amy Ashwood sailed from Panama to be with Garvey, arriving in New York City in October. In November, she became General Secretary of UNIA. At UNIA gatherings, she was responsible for reciting black-authored poetry, as was the actress Henrietta Vinton Davis, who had also joined the movement.

After the First World War ended, President Woodrow Wilson declared his intention to present a 14-point plan for world peace at the forthcoming Paris Peace Conference. Garvey joined various African Americans in forming the International League for Darker People, a group which sought to lobby Wilson and the conference to give greater respect to the wishes of people of color; their delegates nevertheless were unable to secure the travel documentation. At Garvey&#x27;s prompting, UNIA sent a young Haitian, Eliezer Cadet, as its delegate to the conference. Despite these efforts, the political leaders who met in Paris largely ignored the perspectives of non-European peoples, instead reaffirming their support for continued European colonial rule.

In the U.S., many African Americans who had served in the military refused to return to their more subservient role in society and throughout 1919 there were various racial clashes throughout the country. The government feared that African Americans would be encouraged toward revolutionary behavior following the October Revolution in Russia, and in this context, military intelligence ordered Major Walter Loving to investigate Garvey. Loving&#x27;s report concluded that Garvey was a &quot;very able young man&quot; who was disseminating &quot;clever propaganda&quot;. The Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s J. Edgar Hoover decided that Garvey was politically subversive and should be deported from the U.S., adding his name to the list of those to be targeted in the forthcoming Palmer Raids. To ratify the deportation, the Bureau of Investigation presented Garvey&#x27;s name to the Labor Department under Louis F. Post, however Post&#x27;s department refused to do so, stating that the case against Garvey was not proven.

====Success and obstacles====

UNIA grew rapidly and in just over 18 months it had branches in 25 U.S. states, as well as divisions in the West Indies, Central America, and West Africa. The exact membership is not known, although Garvey—who often exaggerated numbers—claimed that by June 1919 it had two million members. It remained smaller than the better established National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), although there was some crossover in membership of the two groups. The NAACP and UNIA differed in their approach; while the NAACP was a multi-racial organization which promoted racial integration, UNIA had a black-only membership policy. The NAACP focused its attention on what it termed the &quot;talented tenth&quot; of the African-American population, such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers, whereas UNIA included many poorer people and Afro-Caribbean migrants in its ranks, seeking to project an image of itself as a mass organization. To promote his views to a wide audience, Garvey took to shouting slogans from a megaphone as he was driven through Harlem in a Cadillac.

There were tensions between UNIA and the NAACP and the latter&#x27;s supporters accused Garvey of stymieing their efforts at bringing about racial integration in the U.S. Garvey was dismissive of the NAACP leader W. E. B. Du Bois, and in one issue of the &quot;Negro World&quot; called him a &quot;reactionary under [the] pay of white men&quot;. Du Bois generally tried to ignore Garvey, regarding him as a demagogue, but at the same time wanted to learn all he could about Garvey&#x27;s movement. In 1921, Garvey twice reached out to Du Bois, asking him to contribute to UNIA publications, but the offer was rebuffed. Their relationship became acrimonious; in 1923, Du Bois described Garvey as &quot;a little fat black man, ugly but with intelligent eyes and big head&quot;. By 1924, historian Colin Grant has suggested, the two hated each other.

UNIA established a restaurant and ice cream parlor at 56 West 135th Street, and also launched a millinery store selling hats. With an increased income coming in through UNIA, Garvey moved to a new residence at 238 West 131st Street; in 1919, a young middle-class Jamaican migrant, Amy Jacques, became his personal secretary. UNIA also obtained a partly-constructed church building at 114 West 138 Street in Harlem, which Garvey named &quot;Liberty Hall&quot; after its namesake in Dublin, Ireland, which had been established during the Easter Rising of 1916. The adoption of this name reflected Garvey&#x27;s fascination with the Irish independence movement. Liberty Hall&#x27;s dedication ceremony was held in July 1919. During the hunger strike of Terence MacSwiney, Garvey supported solidarity strikes in support of MacSwiney and made appeals to the British government on his behalf.

Garvey also organized the African Legion, a group of uniformed men who would attend UNIA parades; a secret service was formed from Legion members, providing Garvey with intelligence about group members. The formation of the Legion further concerned the Bureau of Investigation, who sent their first full-time black agent, James Wormley Jones, to infiltrate UNIA.
In January 1920, Garvey incorporated the Negro Factories League, through which he opened a string of grocery stores, a restaurant, a steam laundry, and publishing house.
According to Grant, a personality cult had grown up around Garvey within the UNIA movement; life-size portraits of him hung in the UNIA headquarters and phonographs of his speeches were sold to the membership.

In August 1920, UNIA organized the First International Conference of the Negro Peoples in Harlem. This parade was attended by Gabriel Johnson, the Mayor of Monrovia in Liberia. As part of it, an estimated 25,000 people assembled in Madison Square Gardens. At the conference, UNIA delegates declared Garvey to be the Provisional President of Africa, charged with heading a government-in-exile that could take power in the continent when European colonial rule ended via decolonization. Some of the West Africans attending the event were angered by this, believing it wrong that an Afro-Jamaican, rather than a native African, was taking this role.

Many outside the movement ridiculed Garvey for giving himself this title. The conference then elected other members of the African government-in-exile, resulting in the production of a &quot;Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World&quot; which condemned European colonial rule across Africa. In August 1921, UNIA held a banquet in Liberty Hall, at which Garvey gave out honors to various supporters, including such titles as the Order of the Nile and the Order of Ethiopia.

UNIA established growing links with the Liberian government, hoping to secure land in the West African nation on which it could settle African-American migrants. Liberia was in heavy debt, with UNIA launching a fundraising campaign to raise $2 million towards a Liberian Construction Loan. In 1921, Garvey sent a UNIA team to assess the prospects of mass African-American settlement in Liberia.
Internally, UNIA experienced various feuds. Garvey pushed out Cyril Briggs and other members of the African Blood Brotherhood from UNIA, wanting to place growing distance between himself and black socialist groups. In the &quot;Negro World&quot;, Garvey then accused Briggs—who was of mixed heritage—of being a white man posing as a black man. Briggs successfully sued Garvey for criminal libel. This was not the only time he faced this charge; in July 1919 Garvey had been arrested for comments in the &quot;Negro World&quot; about Edwin P. Kilroe, the Assistant District Attorney in the District Attorney&#x27;s office of the County of New York. When this case eventually came to court, the court ordered Garvey to provide a printed retraction.

====Assassination attempt, marriage, and divorce====

In October 1919, George Tyler, a part-time vendor of the &quot;Negro World&quot;, entered the UNIA office and told Garvey that Kilroe &quot;had sent him&quot; and tried to assassinate Garvey. Garvey was shot at four times with a .38-calibre revolver, and received two bullets in his right leg and scalp but survived. Tyler was soon apprehended but committed suicide by leaping from the third-tier of the Harlem jail; it was never revealed why he tried to kill Garvey. Garvey soon recovered from his wounds; five days later he gave a public speech in Philadelphia. After the assassination attempt, Garvey hired a bodyguard, Marcellus Strong. 

Shortly after the incident, Garvey proposed marriage to Amy Ashwood and she accepted. On Christmas Day, they had a private Catholic wedding, followed by a major ceremonial celebration in Liberty Hall, attended by 3000 UNIA members. Jacques was Ashwood&#x27;s maid of honor. After the wedding, Garvey moved into Ashwood&#x27;s apartment. The newlyweds embarked on a two-week honeymoon in Canada, accompanied by a small UNIA retinue, including Jacques. There, Garvey spoke at two mass meetings in Montreal and three in Toronto. Returning to Harlem, the couple&#x27;s marriage was soon strained. Ashwood complained of Garvey&#x27;s growing closeness with Jacques. Garvey was upset by his inability to control his wife, particularly her drinking and her socializing with other men. She was pregnant, although the child was possibly not his; she did not inform him of this, and the pregnancy ended in miscarriage.

Three months into the marriage, Garvey sought an annulment, on the basis of Ashwood&#x27;s alleged adultery and the claim that she had used &quot;fraud and concealment&quot; to induce the marriage. She launched a counter-claim for desertion, requesting $75-a-week alimony. The court rejected this sum, instead ordering Garvey to pay her $12 a week. It refused to grant him the divorce. The court proceedings continued for two years. Now separated, Garvey moved into a 129th Street apartment with Jacques and Henrietta Vinton Davis, an arrangement that at the time could have caused some social controversy. He was later joined there by his sister Indiana and her husband, Alfred Peart. Ashwood, meanwhile, went on to become a lyricist and musical director for musicals amid the Harlem Renaissance.

====The Black Star Line====

From 56 West 135th Street, UNIA also began selling shares for a new business, the Black Star Line. Seeking to challenge white domination of the maritime industry, the Black Star Line based its name on the White Star Line. Garvey envisioned a shipping and passenger line traveling between Africa and the Americas, which would be black-owned, black-staffed, and utilized by black patrons. He thought that the project could be launched by raising $2 million from African-American donors, publicly declaring that any black person who did not buy stock in the company &quot;will be worse than a traitor to the cause of struggling Ethiopia&quot;.

Garvey incorporated the company and then sought about trying to purchase a ship. Many African Americans took great pride in buying company stock, seeing it as an investment in their community&#x27;s future; Garvey also promised that when the company began turning a profit they would receive significant financial returns on their investment. To advertise this stock, he traveled to Virginia, and then in September 1919 to Chicago, where he was accompanied by seven other UNIA members. In Chicago, he was arrested and fined for violating the Blue Sky Laws which banned the sale of stock in the city without a license.

With growing quantities of money coming in, a three-man auditing committee was established, which found that UNIA&#x27;s funds were poorly recorded and that the company&#x27;s books were not balanced. This was followed by a breakdown in trust between the directors of the Black Star Line, with Garvey discharging two of them, Richard E. Warner and Edgar M. Grey, and publicly humiliating them at the next UNIA meeting. People continued buying stock regardless and by September 1919, the Black Star Line company had accumulated $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) by selling stock. It could thus afford a thirty-year-old tramp ship, the SS &quot;Yarmouth&quot;. The ship was formally launched in a ceremony on the Hudson River on 31 October. The company had been unable to find enough trained black seamen to staff the ship, so its initial chief engineer and chief officer were white.

The ship&#x27;s first assignment was to sail to Cuba and then to Jamaica, before returning to New York. After that first voyage, the &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was found to contain many problems and the Black Star Line had to pay $11,000 for repairs. On its second voyage, again to the Caribbean, it hit bad weather shortly after departure and had to be towed back to New York by the coastguard for further repairs.
Garvey planned to obtain and launch a second ship by February 1920, with the Black Star Line putting down a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) deposit on a paddle ship called the SS &quot;Shady Side&quot;. In July 1920, Garvey sacked both the Black Star Line&#x27;s secretary, Edward D. Smith-Green, and its captain, Joshua Cockburn; the latter was accused of corruption. In early 1922, the &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was sold for scrap metal, bringing the Black Star Line less than a hundredth of its original purchase price. The worn-out steamboat &quot;Shady Side&quot; was abandoned on the mud flats at Fort Lee, New Jersey in the fall of 1922, when the Black Star Line collapsed.

In 1921, Garvey traveled to the Caribbean aboard a Black Star Line ship, the newly-acquired . While in Jamaica, he criticized its inhabitants as being backward and claimed that &quot;Negroes are the most lazy, the most careless and indifferent people in the world&quot;. His comments in Jamaica earned many enemies, who criticized him on multiple fronts, including the fact he had left his destitute father to die in an almshouse. Attacks back-and-forth between Garvey and his critics appeared in the letters published by &quot;The Gleaner&quot;.

From Jamaica, Garvey traveled to Costa Rica, where the United Fruit Company assisted his transportation around the country, hoping to gain his favor. There, he met with President Julio Acosta. Arriving in Panama, at one of his first speeches, in Almirante, he was booed after doubling the advertised entry price; his response was to call the crowd &quot;a bunch of ignorant and impertinent Negroes. No wonder you are where you are and for my part you can stay where you are.&quot; He received a far warmer reception at Panama City, after which he sailed to Kingston. From there he sought a return to the U.S., but was repeatedly denied an entry visa. This was granted only after he wrote directly to the State Department.

===Criminal charges: 1922–1923===

In January 1922, Garvey was arrested and charged with mail fraud for having advertised the sale of stocks in a ship, &quot;Orion&quot;, which the Black Star Line did not yet own. He was bailed for $2,500. Hoover and the BOI were committed to securing a conviction; they had also received complaints from a small number of the Black Star Line&#x27;s stock owners, who wanted them to pursue the matter further. Garvey spoke out against the charges he faced, but focused on blaming not the state, but rival African-American groups, for them. As well as accusing disgruntled former members of UNIA, in a Liberty Hall speech, he implied that the NAACP were behind the conspiracy to imprison him. The mainstream press picked up on the charge, largely presenting Garvey as a con artist who had swindled African-American people.
After his arrest, Garvey announced that the activities of the Black Star Line were being suspended. He also made plans for a tour of the western and southern states. This included a parade in Los Angeles, partly to woo back members of UNIA&#x27;s California branch, which had recently splintered off to become independent.
In June 1922, Garvey met with Edward Young Clarke, the Imperial Wizard &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) at the Klan&#x27;s offices in Atlanta. Garvey made a number of incendiary speeches in the months leading up to that meeting; in some, he thanked the whites for Jim Crow. Garvey once stated:

I regard the Klan, the Anglo-Saxon clubs and White American societies, as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together. I like honesty and fair play. You may call me a Klansman if you will, but, potentially, every white man is a Klansman as far as the Negro in competition with whites socially, economically and politically is concerned, and there is no use lying.

News of Garvey&#x27;s meeting with the KKK soon spread and it was covered on the front page of many African-American newspapers, causing widespread upset. When news of the meeting was revealed, it generated much surprise and anger among African Americans; Grant noted that it marked &quot;the most significant turning point in his popularity&quot;. Several prominent black Americans—Chandler Owen, A. Philip Randolph, William Pickens, and Robert Bagnall—launched the &quot;Garvey Must Go&quot; campaign in the wake of the revelation. Many of these critics played to nativist ideas by emphasising Garvey&#x27;s Jamaican identity and sometimes calling for his deportation. Pickens and several other of Garvey&#x27;s critics claimed to have been threatened, and sometimes physically attacked, by Garveyites. Randolph reported receiving a severed hand in the post, accompanied by a letter from the KKK threatening him to stop criticising Garvey and to join UNIA.

1922 also brought some successes for Garvey. He attracted the country&#x27;s first black pilot, Hubert Fauntleroy Julian, to join UNIA and to perform aerial stunts to raise its profile. The group also launched its Booker T. Washington University from the UNIA-run Phyllis Wheatley Hotel at 3-13 West 136th Street. He also finally succeeded in securing a UNIA delegation to the League of Nations, sending five members to represent the group to Geneva.

Garvey also proposed marriage to his secretary, Jacques. She accepted, although later stated: &quot;I did not marry for love. I did not love Garvey. I married him because I thought it was the right thing to do.&quot; They married in Baltimore in July 1922. She proposed that a book of his speeches be published; it appeared as &quot;The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey&quot;, although the speeches were edited to remove more inflammatory material. That year, UNIA also launched a new newspaper, the &quot;Daily Negro Times&quot;.

At UNIA&#x27;s August 1922 convention, Garvey called for the impeachment of several senior UNIA figures, including Adrian Johnson and J. D. Gibson, and declared that the UNIA cabinet should not be elected by the organization&#x27;s members, but appointed directly by him. When they refused to step down, he resigned both as head of UNIA and as Provisional President of Africa, probably in an act designed to compel their own resignations. He then began openly criticising another senior member, Reverend James Eason, and succeeded in getting him expelled from UNIA.

With Eason gone, Garvey asked the rest of the cabinet to resign; they did so, at which he resumed his role as head of the organization. In September, Eason launched a rival group to UNIA, the Universal Negro Alliance. In January 1923, Eason was assassinated by Garveyites while in New Orleans. Hoover suspected that the killing had been ordered by senior UNIA members, although Garvey publicly denied any involvement; he nevertheless launched a defense fund campaign for Eason&#x27;s killers.

Following the murder, eight prominent African Americans signed a public letter calling Garvey &quot;an unscrupulous demagogue who has ceaselessly and assiduously sought to spread among Negroes distrust and hatred of all white people&quot;. They urged the Attorney-General to bring forth the criminal case against Garvey and disband UNIA. Garvey was furious, publicly accusing them of &quot;the greatest bit of treachery and wickedness that any group of Negroes could be capable of.&quot; In a pamphlet attacking them he focused on their racial heritage, lambasting the eight for the reason that &quot;nearly all [are] Octoroons and Quadroons&quot;. Du Bois—who was not among the eight—then wrote an article critical of Garvey&#x27;s activities in the U.S. Garvey responded by calling Du Bois &quot;a Hater of Dark People&quot;, an &quot;unfortunate mulatto who bewails every drop of Negro blood in his veins&quot;.

===Trial: 1923===
Having been postponed at least three times, in May 1923, the trial finally came to court, with Garvey and three other defendants accused of mail fraud.
The judge overseeing the proceedings was Julian Mack, although Garvey disliked his selection on the grounds that he thought Mack an NAACP sympathiser. At the start of the trial, Garvey&#x27;s attorney, Cornelius McDougald, urged him to plead guilty to secure a minimum sentence, but Garvey refused, dismissing McDougald and deciding to represent himself in court. The trial proceeded for more than a month. Throughout, Garvey struggled due to his lack of legal training. In his three-hour closing address he presented himself as a selfless leader who was beset by incompetent and thieving staff who caused all the problems for UNIA and the Black Star Line. On 18 June, the jurors retired to deliberate on the verdict, returning after ten hours. They found Garvey himself guilty of a scheme to defraud, but his three co-defendants not guilty.

Garvey was furious with the verdict, shouting abuse in the courtroom and calling both the judge and district attorney &quot;damned dirty Jews&quot;. Imprisoned in The Tombs jail while awaiting sentencing, he continued to blame a Jewish cabal for the verdict; in contrast, prior to this he had never expressed antisemitic sentiment and was supportive of Zionism. When it came to sentencing, Mack sentenced Garvey to five years&#x27; imprisonment and a $1000 fine.

The severity of the sentence—which was harsher than those given to similar crimes at the time—may have been a response to Garvey&#x27;s antisemitic outburst. He felt that they and Catholic jurors had been biased because of their political objections to his meeting with the acting imperial wizard of the antisemitic and anti-Catholic Ku Klux Klan the year before. In 1928, Garvey told a journalist: &quot;When they wanted to get me they had a Jewish judge try me, and a Jewish prosecutor. I would have been freed but two Jews on the jury held out against me ten hours and succeeded in convicting me, whereupon the Jewish judge gave me the maximum penalty.&quot; A decade later, however, in a &quot;New Jamaican&quot; editorial on March 28, 1933, he wrote: &quot;The Jewish race is a noble one, and the Jew is only persecuted because he has certain qualities of progress that other people have not learnt,&quot; likened antisemitism to anti-Black persecution, and denounced Nazi racial intolerance.

A week after the sentence, 2000 Garveyite protesters met at Liberty Hall to denounce Garvey&#x27;s conviction as a miscarriage of justice. However, with Garvey imprisoned, UNIA&#x27;s membership began to decline, and there was a growing schism between its Caribbean and African-American members. From jail, Garvey continued to write letters and articles lashing out at those he blamed for the conviction, focusing much of his criticism on the NAACP.

====Out on bail: 1923–1925====

In September, appellate judge Martin Manton awarded Garvey bail for $15,000 − which UNIA was able to raise and post — while he appealed his conviction. At least temporarily a free man, Garvey toured the U.S., giving a lecture at the Tuskegee Institute. In speeches given during this tour he further emphasised the need for racial segregation through migration to Africa, calling the United States &quot;a white man&#x27;s country&quot;. He continued to defend his meeting with the KKK, describing them as having more &quot;honesty of purpose towards the Negro&quot; than the NAACP. Although he previously avoided involvement with party politics, for the first time he encouraged UNIA to propose candidates in elections, often setting them against NAACP-backed candidates in areas with high black populations.

In February 1924, UNIA put forward its plans to bring 3000 African-American migrants to Liberia. The latter&#x27;s president, Charles D. B. King, assured them that he would grant them area for three colonies. In June, a team of UNIA technicians was sent to start work in preparing for these colonies. When they arrived in Liberia, they were arrested and immediately deported. At the same time, Liberia&#x27;s government issued a press release declaring that it would refuse permission for any Americans to settle in their country.

Garvey blamed Du Bois for this apparent change in the Liberian government&#x27;s attitude, for the latter had spent time in the country and had links with its ruling elite; Du Bois denied the accusation. Later examination suggested that, despite King&#x27;s assurances to the UNIA team, the Liberian government had never seriously intended to allow African-American colonization, aware that it would harm relations with the British and French colonies on their borders, who feared the political tensions it could bring with it.

UNIA faced further setbacks when Bruce died; the group organized a funeral procession ending in a ceremony at Liberty Hall. In need of additional finances, &quot;Negro World&quot; dropped its longstanding ban on advertising skin lightening and hair straightening products. The additional revenues allowed the Black Star Line to purchase a new ship, the SS &quot;General G W Goethals&quot;, in October 1924. It was then renamed the SS &quot;Booker T. Washington&quot;.

===Imprisonment: 1925–1927===

In early February 1925, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the original court decision. Writing for the unanimous court, judge Charles Merrill Hough opined: &quot;It may be true that Garvey fancied himself a Moses, if not a Messiah; that he deemed himself a man with a message to deliver, and believed that he needed ships for the deliverance of his people; but with this assumed, it remains true that if his gospel consisted in part of exhortations to buy worthless stock, accompanied by deceivingly false statements as to the worth thereof, he was guilty of a scheme or artifice to defraud, if the jury found the necessary intent about his stock scheme, no matter how uplifting, philanthropic, or altruistic his larger outlook may have been. And if such scheme to defraud was accompanied by the use of the mails defined by the statute, he was guilty of an offense under Criminal Code, § 215.&quot; 
Denial of his appeal meant the termination of the bail that had been granted following conviction. Garvey was in Detroit at the time and was arrested while aboard a train back to New York City. He was taken to the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary and incarcerated there. Imprisoned, he was made to carry out cleaning tasks. On one occasion he was reprimanded for insolence towards the white prison officers. There, he became increasingly ill with chronic bronchitis and lung infections. Two years into his imprisonment he was hospitalized with influenza.

Garvey received regular letters from UNIA members and from his wife; she also visited him every three weeks. With his support, she assembled another book of his collected speeches, &quot;Philosophy and Opinions&quot;; these had often been edited to remove inflammatory comments about wielding violence against white people. He also wrote &quot;The Meditations of Marcus Garvey&quot;, its name an allusion to &quot;The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius&quot;. From prison, Garvey continued corresponding with far-right white separatist activists like Earnest Sevier Cox of the White American Society and John Powell of the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America; the latter visited Garvey in prison.

While Garvey was imprisoned, Ashwood launched a legal challenge against his divorce from her. Had the divorce been found void, then his marriage to Jacques would have been invalid. The court ruled in favor of Garvey, recognising the legality of his divorce. With Garvey absent, William Sherrill became acting head of UNIA. To deal with the organization&#x27;s financial problems, he re-mortgaged Liberty Hall to pay off debts and ended up selling off the &quot;SS Booker T Washington&quot; at a quarter of what UNIA had paid for it.

Garvey was angry and in February 1926 wrote to the &quot;Negro World&quot; expressing his dissatisfaction with Sherrill&#x27;s leadership. From prison, he organized an emergency UNIA convention in Detroit, where delegates voted to depose Sherrill. The latter&#x27;s supporters then held a rival convention in Liberty Hall, reflecting the growing schism in the organization. A subsequent court ruling determined that it was UNIA&#x27;s New York branch, then controlled by Sherrill, rather than the central UNIA leadership itself, that owned Liberty Hall. The financial problems continued, resulting in Liberty Hall being repeatedly re-mortgaged and then sold.

The Attorney General, John Sargent, received a petition with 70,000 signatures urging for Garvey&#x27;s release. Sargeant warned President Calvin Coolidge that African Americans were regarding Garvey&#x27;s imprisonment not as a form of justice against a man who had swindled them but as &quot;an act of oppression of the race in their efforts in the direction of race progress&quot;. Eventually, Coolidge agreed to commute the sentence so that it would expire immediately, on 18 November 1927, after Garvey had served about half of the five-year term of imprisonment. The commutation stipulated, however, that Garvey should be deported immediately. On being released, Garvey was taken by train to New Orleans, where around a thousand supporters saw him onto the &quot;SS Saramaca&quot; on 3 December. The ship then stopped at Cristóbal in Panama, where supporters again greeted him, but where the authorities refused his request to disembark. He then transferred to the &quot;SS Santa Maria&quot;, which took him to Kingston, Jamaica.

==Later years==
===Return to Jamaica: 1927–1935===
In Kingston, Garvey was greeted by supporters. UNIA members had raised $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms)to help him settle in Jamaica, with which he bought a large house in an elite neighbourhood, which he called the &quot;Somali Court&quot;. His wife shipped over his belongings—which included 18,000 books and hundreds of antiques—before joining him. In Jamaica, he continued giving speeches, including at a building in Kingston he had also named &quot;Liberty Hall&quot;. He urged Afro-Jamaicans to raise their standards of living and rally against Chinese and Syrian migrants who had moved to the island. Meanwhile, the U.S. UNIA had been taken over by E. B. Knox; the latter was summoned to Jamaica for a meeting with Garvey after Laura Kofey, the leader of a group that had broken from UNIA, was killed, bringing the organization into further disrepute.
Garvey attempted to travel across Central America but found his hopes blocked by the region&#x27;s various administrations, who regarded him as disruptive. Instead, he travelled to England in April, where he rented a house in London&#x27;s West Kensington area for four months. On 6th June 1928 he spoke at the Royal Albert Hall. Later that year, he and his wife visited Paris, where he had his office at the black newspapers &quot;La Dépêche Africaine&quot; headquarter and spoke at the Club du Fauborg, before traveling to Switzerland. They then travelled to Canada, where Garvey was detained for one night before being barred from making speeches.

Back in Kingston, UNIA obtained Edelweiss Park in Cross Roads, which it established as its new headquarters. They held a conference there, opened by a parade through the city which attracted tens of thousands of onlookers. At Edelweiss Park, UNIA also began putting on plays. One of these, &quot;Coronation of an African King&quot;, was written by Garvey and performed in August 1930. Its plot revolved around the crowning of Prince Cudjoe of Sudan, although it anticipated the crowning of Haile Selassie of Ethiopia later that year. In Jamaica, Garvey became a &quot;de facto&quot; surrogate father to his niece, Ruth, whose father had recently died. In September 1930, his first son, Marcus Garvey III, was born; three years later a second son, Julius, followed.

In Kingston, Garvey was elected a city councillor and established the country&#x27;s first political party, the People&#x27;s Political Party (PPP), through which he intended to contest the forthcoming legislative council election. In September 1929 he addressed a crowd of 1,500 supporters, launching the PPP&#x27;s manifesto, which included land reform to benefit tenant farmers, the addition of a minimum wage to the constitution, pledges to build Jamaica&#x27;s first university and opera house, and a proposed law to impeach and imprison corrupt judges. The latter policy led to Garvey&#x27;s being charged with demeaning the judiciary and undermining public confidence in it. He pled guilty, and was sentenced to three months in a Spanish Town prison and a £100 fine.

While imprisoned, Garvey was removed from the Kingston council by other councillors. Garvey was furious and wrote an editorial against them, published in the &quot;Blackman&quot; journal. This resulted in his being charged with seditious libel, for which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison. His conviction was then overturned on appeal. He then campaigned as the PPP&#x27;s candidate for the legislative assembly in Saint Andrew Parish, in which he secured 915 votes, being defeated by George Seymour-Jones.

In increasingly strained finances amid the Great Depression, Garvey began working as an auctioneer, and by 1935 was supplementing this with his wife&#x27;s savings. He re-mortgaged his house and personal properties and in 1934 Edelweiss Park was foreclosed and auctioned off. Dissatisfied with life in Jamaica, Garvey decided to move to London, sailing aboard the &quot;SS Tilapa&quot; in March 1935.
Once in London, he told his friend Amy Bailey that he had &quot;left Jamaica a broken man, broken in spirit, broken in health and broken in pocket... and I will never, never, never go back.&quot;

===Life in London: 1935–1940===

In London, Garvey sought to rebuild UNIA, although found there was much competition in the city from other black activist groups. He established a new UNIA headquarters in Beaumont Avenue, West Kensington and launched a new monthly journal, &quot;Black Man&quot;. Garvey returned to speaking at Speakers&#x27; Corner in Hyde Park. When he spoke in public, he was increasingly harangued by socialists for his conservative stances. He also had hopes of becoming a Member of Parliament, although this amounted to nothing.

In 1935, the Second Italo-Ethiopian War broke out as Italy invaded Ethiopia. Garvey spoke out against the Italians and praised the government of Haile Selassie. By October, however, he was becoming increasingly critical of Selassie, blaming his lack of preparedness for Ethiopia&#x27;s failures in the war. When Selassie fled his homeland and arrived in Britain, Garvey was among the black delegates who arranged to meet him at Waterloo station, but was rebuffed. From that point he became more openly hostile to Selassie, describing him as a &quot;feudal monarch who looks down upon his slaves and serfs with contempt&quot; and &quot;a great coward who ran away from his country to save his skin&quot;. Garvey&#x27;s vocal criticisms of Selassie further ostracised him from the broader black activist community—including many Garveyites—most of whom were rallying around Selassie as a symbol of Ethiopia&#x27;s struggle against colonialism.

In June 1937, Garvey&#x27;s wife and children arrived in England, where the latter were sent to a school in Kensington Gardens. Shortly after, Garvey embarked on a lecture and fundraising tour of Canada and the Caribbean, in which he attended the annual UNIA convention in Toronto. In Trinidad, he openly criticised a recent oil workers&#x27; strike; this probably exacerbated tensions between him and two prominent Trinidadian Marxists then living in London, C. L. R. James and George Padmore. Once he had returned to London, Garvey took up a new family home in Talgarth Road, not far from UNIA&#x27;s headquarters. In public debates, Garvey repeatedly clashed with Padmore, who was chair of the International African Service Bureau. In the summer of 1938, Garvey returned to Toronto for the next UNIA conference.

While Garvey was gone, his wife and sons returned to Jamaica. Doctors had recommended that Marcus Garvey III be moved to a warm climate to aid with his severe rheumatism; Jacques had not informed her husband of the decision. When Garvey returned to London, he was furious with his wife&#x27;s decision. Garvey was increasingly isolated, while UNIA was running out of funds as its international membership dwindled. For the first time in many years, he met up with Ashwood, who was also living in London.

===Death and burial: 1940===
In January 1940, Garvey suffered a stroke which left him largely paralysed. His secretary, Daisy Whyte, took on responsibility for his care. At this point, Padmore spread rumours of Garvey&#x27;s death; this led to many newspapers publishing premature obituaries in late May 1940, many of which he read. According to his secretary, on the second day of reading through his pile of obituaries, Garvey suffered another massive stroke and died two weeks later at the age of 52 on 10 June 1940. His body was interred in a vault in the catacombs of the chapel of St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Kensal Green, West London.

Various wakes and memorials were held for Garvey, especially in New York City and Kingston. In Harlem, a procession of mourners paraded to his memorial service. Some Garveyites refused to believe Garvey had died, even when confronted with photographs of his body in its coffin, insisting that this was part of a conspiracy to undermine his movement. Both Ashwood and Jacques presented themselves as the &quot;widow of Marcus Garvey&quot; and Ashwood launched legal action against Jacques in an attempt to secure control over his body.

The writer Richard Hart later noted that within a decade of his death &quot;a veritable cult&quot; had begun to grow around Garvey&#x27;s memory in Jamaica. By the 1950s, Jamaican politicians of varied ideological backgrounds were invoking his name. Leslie Alexander, a Kingston real estate agent, proposed the removal of Garvey&#x27;s body and its return to Jamaica. Alexander&#x27;s campaign was successful and in 1964 Garvey&#x27;s remains were exhumed and returned to Jamaica. The body lay in state at Holy Trinity Cathedral in Kingston and thousands of visitors came for a viewing.

His body was then reburied in King George VI Memorial Park on 22 November 1964 with pomp and ceremony befitting a national hero; numerous foreign diplomats attended. The monument, designed by G. C. Hodges, consists of a tomb at the center of a raised platform in the shape of a black star, a symbol often used by Garvey. Behind it, a peaked and angled wall houses a bust, by Alvin T. Marriot, of Garvey, which was added to the park in 1956 (before his reinterment) and relocated after the construction of the monument.

==Ideology==

Ideologically, Garvey was a black nationalist. Generally referring to dark-skinned peoples of African descent as &quot;Negroes&quot;, he and the UNIA insisted that that term should be capitalized, thus affording dignity and respect to those whom it described. His ideas were influenced by a range of sources. According to Grant, while he was living in London, Garvey displayed &quot;an amazing capacity to absorb political tracts, theories of social engineering, African history and the Western Enlightenment.&quot; Garvey was exposed to the ideas about race that were prevalent at the time; his ideas on race were also heavily informed by the writings of Edward Wilmot Blyden and by his work in London with Dusé Mohamed Ali.

During the late 1910s and 1920s, Garvey was also influenced by the ideas of the Irish independence movement, to which he was sympathetic. He saw strong parallels between the subjugation of Ireland and the global subjugation of black people, and identified strongly with the Irish independence leader Éamon de Valera. In 1922, he sent a message to Valera stating that &quot;We believe Ireland should be free even as Africa shall be free for the Negroes of the world. Keep up the fight for a free Ireland.&quot;

For Garvey, Ireland&#x27;s Sinn Féin and the Irish independence movement served as blueprints for his own black nationalist cause. In July 1919 he stated that &quot;the time has come for the Negro race to offer up its martyrs upon the altar of liberty even as the Irish [had] given a long list from Robert Emmet to Roger Casement.&quot; He also expressed admiration for the Indian independence movement, which was seeking independence from British rule in India, describing Mahatma Gandhi as &quot;one of the noblest characters of the day&quot;.

===Race and racial separatism===

&quot;Race first&quot; was the adage which was widely used in Garveyism. In Garvey&#x27;s view, &quot;no race in the world is so just as to give others, for the asking, a square deal in things economic, political and social&quot;, but rather each racial group will favor its own interests, rejecting the &quot;melting pot&quot; notion of much 20th century American nationalism. He was hostile to the efforts of the progressive movement to agitate for social and political rights for African Americans, arguing that this was ineffective and that laws would never change the underlying racial prejudice of European Americans.

He argued that the European-American population of the U.S. would never tolerate the social integration which was being advocated by activists like Du Bois because he believed that campaigns for such integration would lead to anti-black riots and lynchings. He openly conceded that the U.S. was a white man&#x27;s country and thus, he did not think that African Americans should expect equal treatment within it. Thus, he opposed attempts to socially and economically integrate the different races which lived within the country. Garveyism promoted the view that whites had no duty to help blacks achieve racial equality, maintaining the view that the latter needed to advance themselves on their own initiative. He advocated racial separatism, but he did not believe in black supremacy. He also rallied against Eurocentric beauty standards among blacks, seeing them as impediments to black self-respect.

In the U.S., ideas about the need for black racial purity became central to Garvey&#x27;s thought. He vehemently denounced miscegenation, believing that mixed-race individuals were &quot;torn by dual allegiances&quot; and they would often ally themselves &quot;with the more powerful race,&quot; thus, they would become &quot;traitors to the [black] race&quot;. Garvey argued that mixed-race people would be bred out of existence. Cronon believed that Garvey exhibited &quot;antipathy and distrust of anybody but the darkest-skinned Negroes&quot;; the hostility towards black people whose African blood was not considered &quot;pure&quot; was a sentiment which Garvey shared with Blyden.

This view caused great friction between Garvey and Du Bois, with the former accusing Du Bois and the NAACP of promoting &quot;amalgamation or general miscegenation&quot;. He rallied against what he called the &quot;race destroying doctrine&quot; of those African Americans who were promulgating racial integration in the U.S., instead, he maintained the view that his UNIA stood for &quot;the pride and purity of race. We believe that the white race should uphold its racial pride and perpetuate itself, and we also believe that the black race should do likewise. We believe that there is room enough in the world for the various race groups to grow and develop by themselves without seeking to destroy the Creator&#x27;s plan by the constant introduction of mongrel types.&quot; Arguing that Garvey &quot;imitated white supremacist ideas at random&quot;, the scholar John L. Graves commented that &quot;racism permeated nearly every iota of his ideology,&quot; with Garveyism representing &quot;a gospel of hate for whites&quot;.

Garvey&#x27;s belief in racial separatism, his advocacy of the migration of African Americans to Africa, and his opposition to miscegenation endeared him to the KKK, which supported many of the same policies. Garvey was willing to collaborate with the KKK in order to achieve his aims, and it was willing to work with him because his approach effectively acknowledged its belief that the U.S. should only be a country for white people and campaigns for advanced rights for African Americans who are living within the U.S. should be abandoned. Garvey called for collaboration between black and white separatists, stating that they shared common goals: &quot;the purification of the races, their autonomous separation and the unbridled freedom of self-development and self-expression. Those who are against this are enemies of both races, and rebels against morality, nature and God.&quot; In his view, the KKK and other far-right white groups were &quot;better friends&quot; of black people &quot;than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together&quot; because they were honest about their desires and intentions.

===Pan-Africanism===

Garvey was a Pan-Africanist, and an African nationalist. In Jamaica, he and his supporters were heavily influenced by the pan-Africanist teachings of Dr Love and Alexander Bedward. In the wake of the First World War, Garvey called for the formation of &quot;a United Africa for the Africans of the World&quot;. The UNIA promoted the view that Africa was the natural homeland of the African diaspora. While he was imprisoned, he penned an editorial for the &quot;Negro World&quot; titled &quot;African Fundamentalism&quot;, in which he called for &quot;the founding of a racial empire whose only natural, spiritual and political aims shall be God and Africa, at home and abroad.&quot;

Garvey supported the Back-to-Africa movement, which had been influenced by Edward Wilmot Blyden, who migrated to Liberia in 1850. However, Garvey did not believe that all African Americans should migrate to Africa. Instead, he believed that an elite group, namely those African Americans who were of the purest African blood, should do so. The rest of the African-American population, he believed, should remain in the United States, where it would become extinct within fifty years.

A proponent of the Back-to-Africa movement, Garvey called for a vanguard of educated and skilled African Americans to travel to West Africa, a journey which would be facilitated by his Black Star Line. Garvey stated that &quot;The majority of us may remain here, but we must send our scientists, our mechanics and our artisans and let them build railroads, let them build the great educational and other institutions necessary&quot;, after which other members of the African diaspora could join them. He was aware that the majority of African Americans would not want to move to Africa until it had the more modern comforts that they had become accustomed to in the U.S. Through the UNIA, he discussed plans for a migration to Liberia, but these plans came to nothing and his hope to move African Americans to West Africa ultimately failed.

In the 1920s, Garvey referred to his desire for a &quot;big black republic&quot; in Africa. Garvey&#x27;s envisioned Africa was to be a one-party state in which the president could have &quot;absolute authority&quot; to appoint &quot;all of his lieutenants from cabinet ministers, governors of States and Territories, administrators and judges to minor offices&quot;. According to the scholar of African-American studies Wilson S. Moses, the future African state which Garvey envisioned was &quot;authoritarian, elitist, collectivist, racist, and capitalistic&quot;, suggesting that it would have resembled the later Haitian government of François Duvalier. Garvey told the historian J. A. Rogers that he and his followers were &quot;the first fascists&quot;, adding that &quot;Mussolini copied Fascism from me, but the Negro reactionaries sabotaged it&quot;.

Garvey never visited Africa himself, and he did not speak any African language. He knew very little about the continent&#x27;s varied customs, languages, religions, and traditional social structures, and his critics frequently believed that his views of the continent were based on romanticism and ignorance. It has been suggested that the European colonial authorities would not have given Garvey permission to visit colonies where he would be calling for decolonization.

For instance, the Jamaican writer and poet Claude McKay noted that Garvey &quot;talks of Africa as if it were a little island in the Caribbean Sea.&quot; Garvey believed in negative stereotypes about Africa which portrayed it as a backward continent that was in need of the civilizing influence of Western, Christian states. Among his stated aims, he wanted &quot;to assist in civilizing the backward tribes of Africa&quot; and he also wanted &quot;to promote a conscientious Christian worship among&quot; them. His belief that Africans would ultimately be liberated by the efforts of the African diaspora which was living outside the continent has been considered condescending.

Moses stated that instead of being based on respect for indigenous African cultures, Garvey&#x27;s views of an ideal united Africa were based on an &quot;imperial model&quot; of the kind which was promoted by western powers. When he extolled the glories of Africa, Garvey cited the ancient Egyptians and Ethiopians who had built empires and monumental architectural structures, which he cited as evidence of civilization, rather than the smaller-scale societies which lived on other parts of the continent. In doing so, he followed the lead of white academics of that era, who were similarly ignorant of most of African history and who focused nearly exclusively on ancient Egypt. Moses thought that Garvey &quot;had more affinity for the pomp and tinsel of European imperialism than he did for black African tribal life&quot;. Similarly, the writer Richard Hart noted that Garvey was &quot;much attracted by the glamour of the British nobility&quot;, an attraction which was reflected when he honored prominent supporters by giving them such British-derived titles as &quot;Lords&quot;, &quot;Ladies&quot;, and &quot;Knights&quot;. Garvey&#x27;s head was not turned, however, by the scholarly authority of Harvard University professor George Reisner whose opinion Garvey challenged on the pages of &quot;The Negro World.&quot;

===Economic views===
Garvey believed in economic independence for the African diaspora and through the UNIA, he attempted to achieve it by forming ventures like the Black Star
Line and the Negro Factories Corporation. In Garvey&#x27;s opinion, &quot;without commerce and industry, a people perish economically. The Negro is perishing because he has no economic system&quot;. In his view, European-American employers would always favor European-American employees, so to gain more security, African Americans needed to form their own businesses. In his words, &quot;the Negro[...] must become independent of white capital and white employers if he wants salvation.&quot; He believed that financial independence for the African-American community would ensure greater protection from discrimination, and provide the foundation for social justice.

Economically, Garvey supported capitalism, stating that &quot;capitalism is necessary to the progress of the world, and those who unreasonably and wantonly oppose it or fight against it are enemies of human advancement.&quot; In the U.S., Garvey promoted a capitalistic ethos for the economic development of the African-American community, advocating black capitalism. His emphasis on capitalist ventures meant, according to Grant, that Garvey &quot;was making a straight pitch to the petit-bourgeois capitalist instinct of the majority of black folk.&quot;

He admired Booker T. Washington&#x27;s economic endeavours but criticized his focus on individualism: Garvey believed that African-American interests would best be advanced if businesses included collective decision-making and group profit-sharing. His advocacy of capitalistic wealth distribution was a more equitable view of capitalism than the view of capitalism which was then prevalent in the U.S.; he believed that some restrictions should be imposed on individuals and businesses in order to prevent them from acquiring too much wealth, in his view, no individual should be allowed to control more than one million dollars and no company should be allowed to control more than five million dollars. While he was living in Harlem, he envisioned the formation of a global network of black people who would trade among themselves, believing that his Black Star Line would contribute to the achievement of this aim.

There is no evidence to support the view that Garvey was ever sympathetic to socialism. While he was living in the U.S., he strongly opposed attempts to recruit African Americans into the trade union movement by socialist and communist groups, and he urged African Americans not to support the Communist Party. This led to heavy scrutiny from communist group leaders and figureheads such as Grace Campbell, among others. He believed that the communist movement did not serve the interests of African Americans because it was a white person&#x27;s creation. He stated that communism was &quot;a dangerous theory of economic or political reformation because it seeks to put government in the hands of an ignorant white mass who have not been able to destroy their natural prejudices towards Negroes and other non-white people. While it may be a good thing for them, it will be a bad thing for the Negroes who will fall under the government of the most ignorant, prejudiced class of the white race.&quot; In response, the Communist International characterised Garveyism as a reactionary bourgeois philosophy.

===Black Christianity===

Grant noted that &quot;Garveyism would always remain a secular movement with a strong under-tow of religion&quot;. Garvey envisioned a form of Christianity which would specifically be designed for black African people, a sort of black religion. Reflecting his own view of religion, he wanted this black-centric Christianity to be as close to Catholicism as possible.

Even so, he attended the foundation ceremony of the African Orthodox Church in Chicago in 1921. According to Graves, this Church preached &quot;the orthodox Christian tradition with emphasis on racism&quot;, and Cronon suggested that Garvey promoted &quot;racist ideas about religion&quot;.

Garvey emphasised the idea of black people worshipping a God who was also depicted as black. In his words, &quot;If the white man has the idea of a white God, let him worship his God as he desires. Since the white people have seen their God through white spectacles, we have only now started out to see our God through our own spectacles[...] we shall worship Him through the spectacles of Ethiopia.&quot; He called for black people to worship images of Jesus of Nazareth and the Virgin Mary that depicted these figures as black Africans. In doing so, he did not make use of pre-existing forms of black-dominated religions. Garvey had little experience with them, because he had attended a white-run Wesleyan congregation when he was a child, and later, he converted to Catholicism.

==Personality and personal life==

Physically, Garvey was short and stocky. He suffered from asthma, and was prone to lung infections; and throughout his adult life, he was affected by bouts of pneumonia. Tony Martin called Garvey a &quot;restless young man&quot;, while Grant thought that Garvey had a &quot;naïve but determined personality&quot; in his early years. Grant noted that Garvey &quot;possessed a single-mindedness of purpose that left no room for the kind of spectacular failure that was always a possibility.&quot;

He was an eloquent orator, with Cronon suggesting that his &quot;peculiar gift of oratory&quot; stemmed from &quot;a combination of bombast and stirring heroics&quot;. Grant described Garvey&#x27;s public speeches as &quot;strange and eclectic – part evangelical […] partly formal King&#x27;s English, and part lilting Caribbean speechifying&quot;. Garvey enjoyed arguing with people, and he wanted to be seen as a learned man; he read widely, particularly in history.

Cronon suggested that &quot;Garvey&#x27;s florid style of writing and speaking, his fondness for appearing in a richly colored cap and gown, and his use of the honorary degree initials &quot;D.C.L.&quot; after his name were crude attempts to compensate&quot; for his lack of formal academic qualifications. Grant thought that Garvey was an &quot;extraordinary salesman who&#x27;d developed a philosophy where punters weren&#x27;t just buying into a business but were placing a down payment on future black redemption.&quot; Even his enemies acknowledged that he was a skilled organiser and promoter.

For Grant, Garvey was &quot;a man of grand, purposeful gestures&quot;. He thought that the black nationalist leader was an &quot;ascetic&quot; who had &quot;conservative tastes&quot;. Garvey was a teetotaller who believed that alcohol consumption was morally reprehensible; he collected antique ceramics and enjoyed going around antique shops and flea markets and searching for items to add to his collection. He placed value on courtesy and respect, discouraging his supporters from being loutish.

Garvey enjoyed dressing up in military costumes, and he also adored regal pomp and ceremony; he believed that pageantry would stir the black masses out of their apathy, despite the accusations of buffoonery which were made by members of the African-American intelligentsia. Grant noted that Garvey had a &quot;tendency to overstate his achievements&quot;, but Cronon thought that Garvey tended to surround himself with sycophants rather than more competent advisors. In 1947, the Jamaican historian J. A. Rogers included Garvey in his book, the &quot;World&#x27;s Great Men of Colour&quot;, where he noted that &quot;had [Garvey] ever come to power, he would have been another Robespierre&quot;, resorting to violence and terror to enforce his ideas.

Garvey was a Catholic. In 1919, he married Amy Ashwood in a Catholic ceremony, but they separated after three months. The New York court did not grant Garvey a divorce, but later, he obtained a divorce in Jackson County, Missouri. Ashwood contested the legitimacy of this divorce, and for the rest of her life, she claimed that she was Garvey&#x27;s legitimate spouse. He married secondly to Amy Jacques Garvey, and they had two sons. His first son, Marcus Garvey III (1930 – 8 December 2020), became an electrical engineer and served as the seventh president-general of the UNIA-ACL. His second son, Julius Garvey, (born 1933) became a cardiovascular surgeon. 

==Reception and legacy==
A polarizing figure, Garvey was both revered and reviled. Grant noted that views on him largely divided between two camps, one camp portrayed him as a charlatan and the other camp portrayed him as a saint; similarly, Cronon noted that Garvey was varyingly perceived as a &quot;strident demagogue or a dedicated prophet, a martyred visionary or a fabulous con man&quot;. Martin noted that by the time Garvey returned to Jamaica in the 1920s, he was &quot;just about the best known Black man in the whole world&quot;. The size and scope of the UNIA has also attracted attention; Mark Christian described Garvey as the leader of &quot;the largest Black mass movement in modern history,&quot; and John Henrik Clarke termed it &quot;the first Black mass protest crusade in the history of the United States&quot;. Garvey&#x27;s ideas influenced many black people who never became paying members of the UNIA, with Graves noting that &quot;more than anything else, Garvey gave Negroes self-assertion and self-reliance.&quot;

In Jamaica, Garvey is considered a national hero. In 1969, Jamaica&#x27;s government posthumously conferred the Order of the National Hero upon him.
The scholar of African-American studies Molefi Kete Asante included Garvey on his 2002 list of 100 Greatest African Americans, and in 2008, the American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates described Garvey as the &quot;patron saint&quot; of the black nationalist movement. Grant thought that Garvey, along with Du Bois, deserved to be seen as the &quot;father of Pan-Africanism&quot;, and the Nigerian historian B. Steiner Ifekwe called Garvey &quot;one of the greatest Pan-African leaders of the time&quot;. Garvey has received praise from people who believe that he was a &quot;race patriot&quot;, and many African Americans believe that he encouraged black people to develop a sense of self-respect and pride. While he was living in the U.S., Garvey was frequently referred to—sometimes sarcastically—as the &quot;Negro Moses&quot;, implying that like the eponymous Old Testament figure, he would lead his people out of the oppressive situation which they were living in.

In 1955, Cronon stated that while Garvey &quot;achieved little in the way of permanent improvement&quot; for black people, he &quot;awakened fires of Negro nationalism that have yet to be extinguished&quot;. In Cronon&#x27;s view, Garvey was important because he gave African-descended peoples a new feeling of collective pride and a sense of individual worth. Hart believed that Garvey&#x27;s importance lay in the fact that he stirred millions of people who were otherwise apathetic into action. In this way, Hart believed that Garvey had helped lay the groundwork for the U.S. civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s, even though that movement&#x27;s call for racial integration and equality within the U.S. ran contrary to Garvey&#x27;s belief in racial separation and his advocacy of migration to Africa.

Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, wrote in his autobiography that of all the works of literature which he had studied, the book that inspired him more than any other book was &quot;The Philosophy and Opinions of Marcus Garvey, or Africa for the Africans&quot;. Nkrumah went on to name Ghana&#x27;s national shipping line the &quot;Black Star Line&quot;, and there is a Black Star Square in Accra, and the Ghanaian flag also contains a black star. Ghana&#x27;s national football team is also nicknamed the Black Stars.

While he was living in the U.S., Garvey faced strong opposition from many prominent figures in the African-American community as well as from leading progressive and left-wing organisations. He was also unpopular within elite sections of the African-American community, in part perhaps out of envy of his successes in attracting the support of the black masses, and in part out of concern that he was leading their community astray. Critics regarded him as an idealist, and he was sometimes regarded as &quot;an egotist, a zealot, a charlatan and
a buffoon&quot;. Garvey obtained a reputation for failing to pay his debts, and his detractors accused him of dishonesty.

Critics like Du Bois often mocked Garvey for his outfits and the grandiose titles which he gave to himself; in their view, he was embarrassingly pretentious. According to Grant, many members of the established African-American middle-class were &quot;perplexed and embarrassed&quot; by Garvey, who thought that the African-American working class should turn to their leadership rather than his. Concerns were also raised about his violent language because the people who raised them believed that it was inciting many Garveyites to carry out violent acts against Garvey&#x27;s critics.

During his lifetime, some African Americans wondered if he really understood the racial issues which were present in U.S. society because he was a foreigner, and later African-American leaders frequently held the view that Garvey had failed to adequately address anti-black racism in his thought. Grant noted that in the years after Garvey&#x27;s death, his life was primarily presented by his political opponents. Writing for &quot;The Black Scholar&quot; in 1972, the scholar of African-American studies Wilson S. Moses expressed concern about the &quot;uncritical adulation&quot; of Garvey within African-American political circles. In Moses&#x27; opinion, this adulation led to &quot;red baiting&quot; and &quot;divisive rhetoric&quot; about being &quot;Blacker-than-thou&quot;. Moses argued that it was wrong for people to regard Garvey as a &quot;man of the people&quot; because he had a petty bourgeoise background and as a result, he had &quot;enjoyed cultural, economic, and educational advantages which few of his black contemporaries&quot; had enjoyed.

===Influence on political movements===
In the late 1920s Garvey had some ties to the French black movement, especially the group of the Comité de Défense de la Race Noire, and the editor of its journal, Maurice Satineau. As the group was somewhat divided between a larger group of colonial reformists and a smaller group of representants of the Négritude, there was strong concern by moderate members about Garvey as they were afraid of his radical nationalist approach, resulting in a cut of the ties.

In the Colony of Jamaica, Garvey was largely forgotten in the years after his death, but interest in him was revived by the Rastafari religious movement. Jacques wrote a book about her late husband, &quot;Garvey and Garveyism&quot;, and after finding that no publishers were interested in it she self-published the volume in 1963. In 1962, when Jamaica became independent, the government hailed Garvey as a hero. In 1969, he was posthumously conferred with the Order of the National Hero by the Jamaican government. In 1975 the reggae artist Burning Spear released the album &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot;.

Interest in Garvey&#x27;s ideas would also be revived in the 1960s through the growth of independent states across Africa and the emergence of the Black Power movement in the United States. Mark Christian suggested that Garveyism gave an important psychological boost to African leaders campaigning for independence from European colonial rule, while Claudius Fergus proposed that it played an important role in encouraging Africans to see the African diaspora as an &quot;integral constituent of their own political destiny.&quot;

In his autobiography, Kwame Nkrumah, the prominent Pan-Africanist activist who became Ghana&#x27;s first president, acknowledged Garvey&#x27;s influence on him. The flag that Ghana adopted when it became independent adopted the colours of UNIA (See: Pan-African colours). In November 1964, Garvey&#x27;s body was removed from West Kensal Green Cemetery and taken to Jamaica. There, it lay in state in Kingston&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral before a motorcade took it to King George VI Memorial Park, where it was re-buried.

During a trip to Jamaica, Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife Coretta Scott King visited Garvey&#x27;s shrine on 20 June 1965 and laid a wreath. In a speech he told the audience that Garvey &quot;was the first man of color to lead and develop a mass movement. He was the first man to give millions of Negroes a sense of dignity and destiny on a mass scale and level. And he was the first man to make the Negro feel that he was somebody.&quot;
The Vietnamese Communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh said that Garvey and Korean nationalists shaped his political outlook during his stay in America. Thandeka K. Chapman believed that Garveyism contributed to the formation of the multicultural education movement during the 1960s. Chapman believed that both &quot;Garveyism and multicultural education share the desire to see students of color learning and achieving academic success&quot;, and both allotted significant attention to generating racial pride.

===Influence on religious movements===
Garvey never regarded himself as a religious visionary but he was perceived as such by some of his followers. Various Bedwardites for example regarded him as the reincarnation of Moses. The Moorish Science Temple of America regarded Garvey as a prophet akin to John the Baptist in relation to their prophet Noble Drew Ali, whom they regarded as a Jesus figure. Garvey&#x27;s ideas were a significant influence on the Nation of Islam, a religious group for African Americans established in the U.S. in 1930.

Garvey and Garveyism was a key influence on Rastafari, a new religious movement that appeared in 1930 Jamaica.
According to the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro, Rastafari &quot;emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey&quot;, while for the sociologist Ernest Cashmore, Garvey was the &quot;most important&quot; precursor of the Rastafari movement. Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, nevertheless, it shares many of them. Garvey knew of the Rastas from his time in Jamaica during the 1930s but his view of them, according to the scholar Barry Chevannes, &quot;bordered on scorn&quot;.

According to Chevannes, Garvey would have regarded the Rastas&#x27; belief in the divinity of Haile Selassie as blasphemy. Many Rastas regard Garvey as a prophet, believing that he prophesied the crowning of Haile Selassie in a manner which was similar to how John the Baptist prophesied the coming of Jesus Christ. Many legends and tales are told about him within Jamaica&#x27;s Rasta community. Many attribute him with supernatural attributes, for instance there is a tale told about him—and also independently told about the pioneering Rasta Leonard Howell—that Garvey miraculously knew that his bath had been poisoned and refused to get into it. Other stories among Jamaica&#x27;s Rastas hold that Garvey never really died and remained alive, perhaps living in Africa. Some Rastas also organise meetings, known as Nyabinghi Issemblies, to mark Garvey&#x27;s birthday.

===Memorials===

Garvey&#x27;s birthplace, 32 Market Street, St. Ann&#x27;s Bay, Jamaica, has a marker signifying it as a site of importance in the nation&#x27;s history. His likeness was on the 20-dollar coin and 25-cent coin of the Jamaican dollar. In 2012 the Jamaican government declared 17 August as Marcus Garvey Day. The Governor General&#x27;s proclamation stated &quot;from here on every year this time, all of us here in Jamaica will be called to mind to remember this outstanding National Hero and what he has done for us as a people, and our children will call this to mind also on this day&quot; and went on to say &quot;to proclaim and make known that the 17th Day of August in each year shall be designated as Marcus Garvey Day and shall so be observed.&quot;

The Brownsville neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York City, is home to Marcus Garvey Village, whose construction was completed in 1976. This building complex is home to the first energy storage microgrid at an affordable housing property in the country. It will use the energy storage system to cut electricity costs, improve grid reliability, and provide backup power during extended outages.

In the 1980s, Garvey&#x27;s two sons launched a campaign requesting that the U.S. government issue a pardon for their father. In this they had the support of Harlem-based U.S. congressman Charles Rangel. In 2006, Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller tasked various Jamaican lawyers with investigating how they could assist this campaign. The Obama administration declined to pardon Garvey in 2011, writing that its policy was not to consider requests for posthumous pardons.

There have been several proposals to make a biopic of Garvey&#x27;s life. Those mentioned in connection with the role of Garvey have included the Jamaican-born actor Kevin Navayne and the British-born actor of Jamaican descent Delroy Lindo.

Marcus Garvey appears in Jason Overstreet&#x27;s &quot;The Strivers&#x27; Row Spy&quot;, a 2016 historical novel about the Harlem Renaissance. The novel also includes as characters W. E. B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, and Adam Clayton Powell, among other historically significant figures.

The 2021 documentary film &quot;African Redemption: The Life and Legacy of Marcus Garvey&quot;, directed by Roy T. Anderson, was made with the collaboration of Julius Garvey.

In 2023, the short film &quot;Mosiah&quot; became the first narrative film released about Marcus Garvey. The film was shot and directed by Jirard. The script was co-written by the lead actor, Samuel Lee Fudge and Jirard&quot;.&quot; 

Garvey is briefly portrayed in composer Michael R. Jackson&#x27;s Tony Award Best Musical &quot;A Strange Loop&quot;.
=== Posthumous pardon by President Joe Biden ===

President Joe Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon to Garvey on 19 January 2025, the last full day of Biden&#x27;s term in office.

<text>Lewis Roberts Binford (November 21, 1931 – April 11, 2011) was an American archaeologist known for his influential work in archaeological theory, ethnoarchaeology and the Paleolithic period. He is widely considered among the most influential archaeologists of the later 20th century, and is credited with fundamentally changing the field with the introduction of processual archaeology (or the &quot;New Archaeology&quot;) in the 1960s. Binford&#x27;s influence was controversial, however, and most theoretical work in archaeology in the late 1980s and 1990s was explicitly construed as either a reaction to or in support of the processual paradigm. Recent appraisals have judged that his approach owed more to prior work in the 1940s and 50s than suggested by Binford&#x27;s strong criticism of his predecessors.

==Early life and education==
Binford was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on November 21, 1931. As a child he was interested in animals, and after finishing high school at Matthew Fontaine Maury High School
studied wildlife biology at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Previously a mediocre student, Binford excelled in college and considered pursuing an academic career in biology until he was put off the idea when a professor suggested that there were &quot;still a few species of blind cave salamanders&quot; that he could be the first to study. It was during his time in the military that Binford first became interested in anthropology and archaeology. After graduating he was drafted as an interpreter and assigned to a group of anthropologists tasked with resettling people on the Pacific islands occupied by the United States during World War II. He also became involved with the recovery of archaeological material from tombs on Okinawa that were to be removed to make way for a military base. Though he had no training in archaeology, Binford found himself excavating and identifying these artifacts, which were then used to restock the destroyed museum in Shuri.

After leaving the military Binford went to study anthropology at the University of North Carolina (UNC). The military subsidy he received was not enough to fund his study completely, so Binford used the skills in construction he learned from his father (a carpenter) to start a modest contracting business. He gained a second BA at UNC and then in 1957 transferred to the University of Michigan to complete a combined MA and PhD. His thesis was the interaction between Native Americans and the first English colonists in Virginia, a subject he became interested in while still at UNC.

==New Archaeology==
Binford first became dissatisfied with the present state of archaeology while an undergraduate at UNC. He felt that culture history reflected the same &#x27;stamp collecting&#x27; mentality that had turned him away from biology. At Michigan, he saw a sharp contrast between the &quot;excitement&quot; of the anthropology department&#x27;s cultural anthropologists (which included Leslie White) and the &quot;people in white coats counting their potsherds&quot; in the Museum of Anthropology. His first academic position was as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, where he taught New World archaeology and statistical methods in archaeology. Shortly after his appointment he wrote his first major article, &quot;Archaeology as Anthropology&quot; (1962), which was stimulated by problems in archaeological methodology that had become apparent with the use of radiocarbon dating to verify the dates and cultural typologies generated with relative dating techniques such as seriation. Binford criticised what he saw as a tendency to treat artifacts as undifferentiated traits, and to explain variations in these traits only in terms of cultural diffusion. He proposed that the goal of archaeology was exactly the same as that of anthropology more generally, viz. to &quot;explicate and explain the total range of physical and cultural similarities and differences characteristic of the entire spatio-temporal span of man&#x27;s existence.&quot; This would be achieved by relating artifacts to human behavior, and behavior to cultural systems (as understood by his mentor, cultural anthropologist Leslie White).

Several other archaeologists at Chicago shared Binford&#x27;s ideas, a group their critics began calling the &quot;New Archaeologists&quot;. In 1966 they presented a set of papers at a meeting of the Society for American Archaeology which were later collected in the landmark &quot;New Perspectives in Archaeology&quot; (1968), edited by Binford and his then wife Sally, also an archaeologist. By the time this volume was published he had left Chicago – dismissed, according to Binford, because of increasing tension between himself and the senior archaeologists in the faculty, particularly Robert Braidwood. He moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara for a year and then on to UCLA. He did not like the atmosphere at UCLA&#x27;s large faculty, and so took the opportunity to relocate to the University of New Mexico in 1969.

==Ethnoarchaeology==

Binford withdrew from the theoretical debates that followed the rapid adoption of New Archaeology (by then also called processual archaeology) in the 1960s and 70s, instead focusing on his work on the Mousterian, a Middle Palaeolithic lithic industry found in Europe, North Africa and the Near East. In 1969 he decided to undertake ethnographic fieldwork among the Nunamiut in Alaska, in order to better understand the periglacial environment that Mousterian hominins occupied, and to see first hand how hunter-gatherer behavior is reflected in material remains. This methodology—conducting ethnographic fieldwork to establish firm correlations between behavior and material culture—is known as ethnoarchaeology and while not being invented by Binford, was shaped by his incorporation with Processual (New) Archaeology. Most of Binford&#x27;s later work was focused on the Palaeolithic and hunter-gatherers in the archaeological record.

==Later career==

Binford joined the Southern Methodist University faculty in 1991, after teaching for 23 years as a distinguished professor at the University of New Mexico.

Binford&#x27;s last published book, &quot;Constructing Frames of Reference&quot; (2001), was edited by his then wife, Nancy Medaris Stone. His wife at the time of his death, Amber Johnson, has said that she and a colleague will finish editing a book Binford had in progress at the time of his death.

He died on April 11, 2011, in Kirksville, Missouri, at the age of 79.

==Personal life==

Binford was married six times. His first marriage was to Jean Riley Mock, with whom he had his only daughter, Martha. Binford also had a son, Clinton, who died as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident in 1976. He frequently collaborated with his third wife, Sally Binford, who was also an archaeologist; the couple married while they were graduate students at the University of Chicago, and co-edited &quot;New Perspectives in Archaeology&quot; (1968), among other works. After his marriage to Sally ended, Binford married Mary Ann Howell nee Wilson, an elementary school teacher. His fifth wife was Nancy Medaris Stone, an archaeologist. At the time of his death he was married to Amber Johnson, professor and chair of sociology and anthropology at Truman State University who had worked with Binford as a research student at Southern Methodist University.

==Influence==
Binford is mainly known for his contributions to archaeological theory and his promotion of ethnoarchaeological research. As a leading advocate of the &quot;New Archaeology&quot; movement of the 1960s, he proposed a number of ideas that became central to processual archaeology. Binford and other New Archaeologists argued that there should be a greater application of scientific methodologies and the hypothetico-deductive method in archaeology. He placed a strong emphasis on generalities and the way in which human beings interact with their ecological niche, defining culture as the extrasomatic means of adaptation. This view reflects the influence of his Ph.D supervisor, Leslie White. Binford&#x27;s work can largely be seen as a reaction to the earlier culture history approach to archaeology. New Archaeology was considered a revolution in archaeological theory.

Binford was involved in several high-profile debates including arguments with James Sackett on the nature and function of style and on symbolism and methodology with Ian Hodder. Binford has spoken out and reacted to a number of schools of thought, particularly the post-processual school, the behavioural school, and symbolic and postmodern anthropologies. Binford was also known for a friendlier rivalry with French archaeologist François Bordes, with whom he argued over the interpretation of Mousterian sites. Binford&#x27;s disagreement with Bordes over the interpretation of Mousterian stone artifacts provided the impetus for much of Binford&#x27;s theoretical work. Bordes interpreted variability in Mousterian assemblages as evidence of different tribes, while Binford felt that a functional interpretation of the different assemblages would be more appropriate. His subsequent inability to explain the Mousterian facies using a functional approach led to his ethnoarchaeological work among the Nunamiut and the development of his middle-range theory.

==Awards and recognition==
Binford was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2001. He also received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008 from the Society for American Archaeology and an honorary doctorate from Leiden University. There is an asteroid named &quot;Binford&quot; in his honor.

<text>Berliner Gramophone – its discs identified with an etched-in &quot;E. Berliner&#x27;s Gramophone&quot; as the logo – was the first (and for nearly ten years the only) disc record label in the world. Its records were played on Emile Berliner&#x27;s invention, the Gramophone, which competed with the wax cylinder–playing phonographs that were more common in the 1890s and could record.

==History==

Emile Berliner received U.S. patents 372,786 and 382,790 on the Gramophone on November 8, 1887, and May 15, 1888, respectively. This was before the organization of the North American Phonograph Company, which first produced cylinder recordings for public use, and thus Berliner&#x27;s flat disc record is roughly contemporary with the exploitation of the cylinder medium, though it took longer for Berliner to commence production of his discs in America. Although based in Washington, D.C., Berliner&#x27;s first joint venture was undertaken in Germany in 1889 with the manufacturer , a maker of toys.

The Kämmer &amp; Reinhardt machine utilized 5&quot; hard rubber discs, and some machines and discs were exported to England. An 1890 recording of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot;, likely made by Berliner himself, is the oldest disc in the BBC Library or in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and was once touted as the oldest commercial disc in the world, though this has since been disproven. The Kämmer &amp; Reinhardt venture did not last very long, though just how long is unclear.

In the early 1890s, Berliner attempted to found his first American company, the American Gramophone Company, in New York City, but it fell apart before issuing a single machine or disc. Back in Washington, D.C., Berliner tried again under the name of the United States Gramophone Company and began to manufacture machines and record 7-inch hard rubber discs in 1892 and in 1894 (though commercially available plates would only appear since 1894). Some celluloid discs were also made. In 1895, hard rubber was replaced by a shellac compound, which in various formulations remained the standard disc record material until the first vinyl records – initially made only for radio use and other special applications – were introduced in the 1930s.

Beginning in 1896, Berliner&#x27;s gramophone players were made by Philadelphia-based machinist Eldridge Johnson, who added a spring motor to drive the previously hand-rotated turntable. Berliner also opened an office in New York City, staffed by Frank Seaman and O. D. LaDow and organized as the National Gramophone Company.

Master recordings were made onto zinc plates, which were then electroplated and a negative-image &quot;mother&quot; made from them to stamp discs. A major reversal of Berliner&#x27;s fortunes occurred when the mastering plant in Washington, D.C. burned down on September 29, 1897, destroying a hundred unissued masters and all of his record manufacturing equipment. Within a few months, however, Berliner was up and running again, with some record production aspects moved to Philadelphia. 
Berliner records were short-playing. Only about two minutes could comfortably fit on each single-sided 7-inch disc. The absolute maximum depended on the speed, which was not standardized and ranged from about 75 rpm to a more typical 70 rpm down to as slow as 60 rpm. During most of the 1890s, the competing small-diameter brown wax cylinder records were recorded at about 120 rpm and could play for as long as three minutes, although recordings fully that long were uncommon. At the end of the decade, cylinder record makers began a transition to higher speeds, mainly to produce louder-playing cylinders that could better compete with the considerably louder gramophone – cylinders had usually been heard through individual stethoscope-like listening tubes, rather than through a horn that yielded relatively feeble sound. A new standard cylinder speed of 160 rpm was soon established, reducing the maximum playing time to a little over two minutes and losing an advantage over Berliner&#x27;s discs.

As the popularity of the gramophone began to pick up, Berliner found himself having to deal with infringers on his patents. In 1898, Berliner shut down at least two firms that were leeching off his business models and, in the first case, products. In 1899, Berliner discovered that Frank Seaman was behind a machine called the Zonophone that seemed an exact replica of the Gramophone. Furious, Berliner cut off all supply to New York, which proved a fatal error.

Seaman countersued for breach of contract, and in June 1900 the court granted an injunction against Berliner and United States Gramophone Company. Though he would attempt in several proceedings afterward to have the injunction overturned, it was allowed to stand and it compelled Emile Berliner&#x27;s exit from the gramophone business in the United States of America.

Berliner transferred his patents to Eldridge Johnson, who then changed the name over the door to his own, though Berliner retained a share in the new company. In March 1901, Johnson registered the name Victor Talking Machine Company and launched the brand later in the year. By 1905 it had regained the lead in the American disc record business, while by 1906 Seaman&#x27;s Zonophone was on a receiver&#x27;s index.

==Foreign interests==
In 1895, comic Billy Golden introduced Berliner to Fred Gaisberg, who, with Barry Peter Owen – a trusted associate within the National Gramophone Company – helped to establish Berliner&#x27;s overseas interests. Although the German partnership with Kämmer &amp; Reinhardt had long since ended, Berliner still held patents in Germany and England. In 1898, Owen founded the Berliner subsidiary in England which eventually took the name of Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Ltd.; in 1931, this was one of the companies that was folded into EMI. That same year, Gaisberg established Berliner&#x27;s German subsidiary as Deutsche Grammophon; this was the longest-lasting record company in history under its original charter, until finally being acquired by Universal Music Group in 1999. Gaisberg also founded a Berliner subsidiary in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1901.

E. Berliner Gramophone of Canada was established in 1899. It was first located in the Aqueduct Street building of Northern Electric in Montreal, and commenced marketing records and gramophones the following year. In 1904, the company received its charter as the Berliner Gram-o-phone Company of Canada. Early recordings were imported from masters recorded in the United States until a recording studio in Montreal was established in 1906.

The Berliner name as a record label lasted longest in Canada. In 1918, Emile Berliner&#x27;s son Herbert Berliner left Berliner Gram-O-Phone and founded the Compo Company. Herbert&#x27;s younger brother, Edgar, continued as chief executive of Berliner Gram-o-phone. In 1924, Canadian Berliner was bought out by USA&#x27;s Victor and became Victor Talking Machine Company of Canada. Emile Berliner died in 1929 – the same year RCA bought out Victor – and Edgar Berliner resigned from Canadian RCA in 1930.

Berliner Gram-o-phone&#x27;s facilities in Montreal, a complex of buildings at 1001 rue Lenoir and 1050 rue Lacasse in the St-Henri district, became home to RCA Victor Canada over the next several decades, developing and producing such high-tech products as microwave radio relay systems, communication satellites, television broadcast equipment, etc. Since the dissolution of RCA in 1986, the buildings have been turned into a multi-use office/commercial development, in which the Musée des ondes Emile Berliner, is documenting the history of the man, his company and the building complex, occupies part of the space. The historic Studio Victor located there was until 2014 an active recording studio. In 2015 the La hacienda creativ used the studio for recordings until 2021.

==Legacy and preservation==
The range of material on Berliner records was wider than that available from cylinder companies in the 1890s. As may be expected, Berliner was well-supplied with the typical band and song selections commonly found on cylinders, but he also branched out into piano music, ragtime, speeches, sermons, instrumental solos and some ethnographic material on a greater scale than his competitors. From the beginning, Berliner&#x27;s European subsidiaries were deeply invested in opera and classical music, only indirectly exploited by American cylinder companies, at least in the 1890s.

Documenting the output of American Berliner has proved a daunting task, as original records are scarce collector&#x27;s items and the company employed a system of block numbering that seems to make little sense. Although referred to commonly as &quot;Berliner matrices&quot;, they are not true matrix numbers, but catalog numbers concerned with preserving the same number for each selection even if a given title was re-recorded by another artist. Subsequent re-recordings are usually given a letter suffix, usually &quot;Z-W&quot; for early releases. Helpfully, the recording or matrix processing date is usually inscribed in the label area, but as Berliner did not employ paper labels sometimes the information is difficult to read. Many times the matrix numbers were reused to fit new records into the crumbling block system, such as the case of block 900 (which was meant to be for popular and international songs, only to be completely scrapped and refocused on opera excerpts, granting most matrix numbers to opera singer Ferruccio Giannini).

A simple new more or less sequential numbering system was started in March 1899, in which every number had a leading zero (never used previously) and the letter suffix, when present, denoted the category, e.g., &quot;A&quot; for marching band, &quot;F&quot; for banjo, &quot;N&quot; for vocal quartet. Berliner&#x27;s foreign matrices employed entirely different strategies, and many to most of those have been documented by discographer Alan Kelly.

In 2014, the EMI Archive Trust announced an online initiative that would collect information on Berliner records worldwide. They have what appears to be the largest concentration of Berliner records in one place, numbering close to 18,000 items and largely collected by Fred Gaisberg in the early years of the company. Another large concentration of Canadian Berliners are held by the National Library of Canada, which has set up the Virtual Gramophone on the web to provide access to them, though their focus is primarily on Canadian artists.

There is a notable collection of Berliner records and gramophones housed at the Musée des ondes Emile Berliner, located in Montreal, QC, in one of the old RCA Victor factories.

<doc id="181547" wikidata="Q154308" url="?curid=181547" title="Manuel II of Portugal">
<text>&quot;Dom&quot; Manuel II (15 November 1889 – 2 July 1932), &quot;the Patriot&quot; () or &quot;the Unfortunate&quot; (), was the last King of Portugal, ascending the throne after the assassination of his father, King Carlos I, and his elder brother, Luís Filipe, the Prince Royal. Before ascending the throne, he held the title of Duke of Beja. His reign ended with the fall of the monarchy during the 5 October 1910 revolution, and Manuel lived the rest of his life in exile in Twickenham, Middlesex, England.

==Early life==
Manuel was born in the Palace of Belém, Lisbon, less than a month after his father King Carlos I ascended the Portuguese throne. He was the third child and second son of Carlos and Amélie of Orléans.

A member of the House of Braganza, he was baptised a few days later, with his maternal grandfather as godfather. The former Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Manuel II&#x27;s paternal great-granduncle, who had been deposed from the Brazilian throne on the day of Manuel&#x27;s birth, attended the ceremony.

He received the traditional education of a member of the royal family, without the political preoccupations that befell his older brother, who was destined to become King. Although Manuel was raised as a member of the upper class he took a more populist tone after ascending to the throne, and abandoned many of the court protocols. He studied history and languages, learning English and French from an early age. He demonstrated a love of literature and reading, unlike his older brother who was more interested in physical activities. Manuel&#x27;s upbringing included horse riding, fencing, rowing, tennis and gardening. He was a great lover of music, especially Beethoven and Wagner, and played the piano.

As a child, Manuel played with the children of Count of Figueiró, Count of Galveias and with other families of the Court. In 1902, he was taught Latin and German by Franz Kerausch, later instruction was by Father João Damasceno Fiadeiro (Portuguese history); Marquês Leitão (Mathematics); M. Boeyé (French and French literature); Alfredo King (English and English literature), Father Domingos Fructuoso (Religion and Morals) and Alexandre Rey Colaço (piano).

In 1903, Manuel travelled with his mother and his brother to Egypt, on board the royal yacht &quot;Amélia&quot;. According to R. Benton, the trip &quot;may have been decisive in Manuel&#x27;s decision to enter the Portuguese navy and make it a career.&quot; In the summer of 1904, the prince became a cadet in the Portuguese Navy. He began his training in the Escola Naval in 1907.

== Lisbon regicide ==


Manuel&#x27;s future in the Portuguese Navy was abruptly shelved on 1 February 1908. On that day, the royal family returned from the Ducal Palace in Vila Viçosa to Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the carriage carrying King Carlos and his family passed through the Terreiro do Paço plaza where shots were fired by at least two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries: Alfredo Luis da Costa and Manuel Buiça. It is unclear whether the assassins were attempting to kill the King, the Prince Royal or the prime minister, João Franco. The murderers were shot dead on the spot by the royal bodyguard. The King was killed; Prince Luís Filipe was mortally wounded; Prince Manuel was hit in the arm; Queen Amélie was unharmed. It was Amélie&#x27;s quick thinking that saved her younger son. About 20 minutes later, Prince Luis Filipe died. Days later, Manuel II was proclaimed King of Portugal. The young King, who had not been groomed to rule, sought to save the fragile position of the Braganza dynasty by dismissing João Franco and his entire cabinet in 1908. The ambitions of various political parties made Manuel&#x27;s short reign a turbulent one. In free elections held on 28 August 1910, the republicans won only 14 seats in the legislature.

==King of Portugal and the Algarves==
His first act was to meet with his Council of State and request the resignation of João Franco, whose policies may have been responsible for the tragedy. He appointed a government of national unity, presided over by Admiral Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. This quieted the republicans, but in retrospect was seen as weakness.

He opened the Royal Court Assembly on 6 May 1908 in the presence of national representatives, and affirmed his support of the Constitution. The King received general public sympathy, due to the deaths of his father and older brother. He was protected by his mother, Amélie, and sought out the support of the experienced politician José Luciano de Castro. Judging that the intervention of King Carlos was a reason for the events of 1908, he declared that he would reign, but not govern.

For his part, the new King tried to increase the monarchy&#x27;s connection with its subjects. The King visited several areas of the country. His trips included stops in Porto, Braga, Viana do Castelo, Oliveira de Azeméis, Santo Tirso, Vila Nova de Gaia, Aveiro, Guimarães, Coimbra and Barcelos. During these visits, his subjects were captivated by the young king, and he was received warmly. On 23 November he travelled to Espinho in open the Vale do Vouga Railway. On his journeys, he ingratiated himself with the people with his candour and pious character.

However, he was not popular with republicans. One of them, João Chagas, the anti-monarchist journalist and propagandist of the Republican Party, warned the King of the problems that would develop when he declared:

:&quot;...your Highness arrives too young into a very old world...!&quot;

==Social issues==
During the 19th century, many intellectuals and politicians were preoccupied with the growth of the urban proletariat as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution. In Portugal, owing to lower levels of industrialisation, this was not an important question, but it was exacerbated by an economic crisis and the Republican Party, who believed a republic would resolve the problems. This was the &quot;Questão Social&quot; (social question) of the times.

The Socialist Party had existed since 1875, but it never had representation in Parliament. This was not only because it was not popular, but also because the Republican Party was the principal channel of radical discontent within the political system. The King made some moves that did not infringe his constitutional restrictions, but which created incentives for the Socialist Party to lessen their support for the Republican Party. In 1909, Manuel invited the French sociologist, Léon Poinsard, to examine the social environment and report back to him. Poinsard wrote that the only way to combat clientelism, created by the system of rotational governments, would be a reorganisation of the local administrations. Enthusiastically, the King wrote to the President of the Council of Ministers Wenceslau de Sousa Pereira de Lima, to make him aware of the reorganisation of the Socialist Party (under Alfredo Aquiles Monteverde) and to remind him of the importance of working with the Socialists, &quot;...so that, we will empty their supporters from the Republican Party, and orient them into a useful and productive force.&quot; 


Notwithstanding the contacts made by the government of Artur Alberto de Campos Henriques with the Socialist Azedo Gneco, Venceslau de Lima considered this difficult after the Congresso Nacional Operário, which was boycotted by anarchists and republicans. For their part, the Socialists were enthusiastic about Royal support between Manuel and Aquiles Monteverde. Monteverde would later inform the King of the failure of the October 1909 trade union congress, but little was formalised between the socialists and the government, although they supported the work of Poinsard. During the government of António Teixeira de Sousa, in July 1910, that the government created a commission to study the establishment of an Instituto de Trabalho Nacional (&quot;Institute of National Work&quot;), that had three socialists and included Azedo Gneco. However, Aquiles Monteverde would complain that the commission lacked the resources to be effective: specifically that permanent members and unlimited transport, in order for the Socialists to promote their propaganda. Manuel II informed the government, through the Minister of Public Works, that he agreed with the establishment of the Instituto de Trabalho Nacional, but by September, it was too late for the constitutional monarchy.

During his reign he visited many parts of northern Portugal, in addition to Spain, France, and the United Kingdom, where he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Garter, in November 1909. He cultivated a foreign policy that was close to Great Britain, which was not only the geo-political strategy that his father maintained, but it also reinforced his position on the throne by having a strong ally. The court also considered the marriage of a King of the House of Braganza to a British princess would secure the protection of the United Kingdom in any impending conflict. But, the country&#x27;s instability, the assassination of the King and Prince Royal, and the drawn-out negotiations that were ended with the death of Edward VII, ended these pretensions. The old British monarch, a personal friend of Carlos, would have been the great protector of the House of Braganza, and without him, the liberal government of Britain had no interest in maintaining the Portuguese monarchy.

==Revolution==
The stability of the government deteriorated; seven governments were established and fell in a period of 24 months. The monarchist parties continued to fragment, while the Republican Party continued to gain ground. The legislative elections on 28 August 1910 had elected 14 new representatives (resulting in an assembly that was divided: 9% Republican, 58% Government and 33% Opposition) which helped the revolutionary cause, but which made little importance since the Setúbal Congress (on 24–25 April 1909) had determined that the Republicans would take power by force. The murder of a prominent republican precipitated the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that had been so long in coming.

During the waning days of King Manuel II&#x27;s reign, Prior Sardo besought the monarch to bestow Gafanha da Nazaré with a parish, achieving royal recognition, marking the last town to receive such acknowledgment. This historic event was officially documented in Diário do Governo nº 206 on 16 September 1910.

Between 4 and 5 October 1910, the Republican Revolution erupted in the streets of Lisbon. What started as a military coup commenced by soldiers, was joined by some civilians and municipal guards attacking the loyal garrisons and the royal palace, while the guns from the cruiser NRP &quot;Adamastor&quot; added to the cannonade. The Palace of Necessidades (then official residence of the young King) was bombarded, forcing Manuel to move to the Mafra National Palace, where he rendezvoused with his mother, Queen Amélia, and his grandmother, the Queen Mother Maria Pia of Savoy. There was little apparent popular reaction to these events: pictures from the square in front of the City Hall in Lisbon, where the declaration of the Republic occurred, did not show an overwhelming multitude, and even some in the military were fearful that their actions would not be successful. One republican commander, Admiral Cândido dos Reis, even committed suicide when he believed that the events had not succeeded.

One day later, once it was clear that the Republicans had taken the country, Manuel decided to embark from Ericeira on the royal yacht &quot;Amélia IV&quot; for Porto, with armed Republicans arriving as the ship departed. It is unclear whether his advisers motivated Manuel to change his intentions or whether he was forced to change his destination en route, but the Royal Family disembarked in Gibraltar shortly later, after they received notice that Porto had fallen to the Republicans. The coup d&#x27;état was complete, and the Royal Family departed for exile, arriving in the United Kingdom, where he was received by King George V.

==Personal life==
In the spring of 1912, Manuel visited Switzerland, where he met Princess Augusta Victoria of Hohenzollern (1890–1966), daughter of William, Prince of Hohenzollern, and was deeply impressed by her. They were second cousins, both being great-grandchildren of Maria II. 

In the following year, on 4 September 1913, Manuel married Augusta Victoria. During the Mass, which was celebrated in the Chapel of Sigmaringen Castle, Manuel, wearing his Order of the Garter Star and the sash of the Three Portuguese Orders, stood on a crate containing soil brought from Portugal. The ceremony was conducted by Cardinal José Sebastião de Almeida Neto, Patriarch of Lisbon, then exiled in Seville, who had baptised Manuel as a young prince; Manuel was also assisted by the Prince of Wales (Edward VIII) and King Alfonso XIII of Spain, as well as representatives of the royal houses of Europe (including Spain, Germany, Italy, France and Romania, in addition to the principalities and German kingdoms). After festivities which lasted two days, the couple went on their honeymoon to Munich, where the Princess fell ill and withdrew from the public.

==Exile==
In exile, Manuel resided in Fulwell Park, Twickenham now in London (where his mother had been born). At Fulwell Park he tried to recreate a Portuguese environment, as the attempts to restore him to his throne (1911, 1912 and 1919) failed. He was active in the local community, attended services at the Church of St James, Twickenham, and became godfather to several children. In 1932 he donated a window to St James Church bearing the Braganza crest and depicting St Anthony to celebrate the 700th anniversary of the saint&#x27;s death. His influence is also recalled by a number of toponymic references in the area: Manuel Road, Lisbon Avenue, and Portugal Gardens. He followed political events in Portugal, and was concerned with the anarchy of the First Republic, fearing that it could provoke a Spanish intervention and risk the country&#x27;s independence.

While in exile, there was one case where the former King&#x27;s direct intervention had an effect. After the overthrow of the government of Gomes da Costa by General Óscar Fragoso Carmona in 1926, Costa was appointed Ambassador to London. Given the rapid succession of ambassadors during this period, the British government refused to recognise the new official&#x27;s credentials. As the ambassador was to negotiate the liquidation of the Portuguese debt to the United Kingdom, the Minister of Foreign Affairs asked Manuel to straighten out the situation. The former monarch was delighted by the opportunity to help his homeland and communicated with many of his British contacts (including, probably, King George V) in order to resolve the dispute. Even in exile Manuel continued to be a patriot, going as far as declaring in his 1915 testament his intention to transfer his possessions to the Portuguese State for the creation of a museum, and showing his interest in being buried in Portugal.

==World War I==
Manuel defended the entry of Portugal into the First World War and its active participation. He asked monarchists to desist from restoration efforts as long as the war continued. He even met with republicans, and at one time, solicited his involvement in the Portuguese army. But, contrary to his hopes, a majority of the monarchists did not follow his pleas for cooperation. Many of them backed the aspirations of Germany, and had hoped to see the victory of the Kaiser as another channel to restore the monarchy. Manuel believed that supporting Great Britain would guarantee the retention of overseas colonies, which would have been lost to German aggression even if the Germans were supported in the conflict. Of his close subordinates who offered their support to the Republic, none were accepted.

Manuel attempted to make himself available to the Allied Powers, wherever they saw use, but was disappointed when he was assigned a post in the British Red Cross. He characteristically put all his efforts into the role, participating in conferences, fund drives, visits to hospitals and the wounded soldiers on the front, which ultimately gave him a lot of gratification. The visits to the front were difficult on the French government, but his friendship with George V was sufficient to alleviate their concerns. Regardless, most of his efforts were not credited; years later, in an interview with António Ferro, he lamented, &quot;The operating room in the Portuguese Hospital in Paris, during the War, was constructed by me. Do you know what they put on the plaque? &#x27;From a Portuguese in London&#x27;.&quot; The King was also responsible for the creation of the Orthopedic Department at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Hospital which, at his insistence continued to function until 1925, in order to continue to treat the disfiguring effects of the war. A proof of his recognition by the British was by his friend King George V, who invited him to be with the King during the victory celebrations during the parade of soldiers in 1919.

==Monarchy and its status==
Since 1911, the Portuguese monarchists-in-exile had concentrated in Galicia, Spain in order to enter Portugal and restore the monarchy but without the tacit approval of the Spanish government. The monarchists were led by the charismatic Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro, a veteran of the African colonial campaigns. The &quot;Paladin&quot;, as the Portuguese newspapers called him, believed that demonstrating a show of force would force the rural people to rise-up and support the restoration. But he was wrong; poorly prepared and badly financed, his forces encountered apathy from the rural population and the incursions ended with retreats into Galicia.

For his part, Manuel supported these incursions the best way he could, but his financial resources were limited. He also faced a group of monarchists who were not clear supporters of his claim to the throne: one attack was made under a blue and white flag, but without the crown, while Paiva Couceiro himself declared at one time that his movement was &quot;neutral&quot; and wanted a plebiscite on the form of the new regime. It was only after he traded correspondence with Couceiro that the King was able to support the Galician monarchists, who had promised to support the Constitutional Charter of 1826. The second incursion, in 1912, although better prepared did not succeed because the Spanish government was forced to cede to Republican diplomats the illegality of monarchist encampments in Galicia and disarmed the remaining combatants within its territory. Manuel was never able to restore his kingdom by force and always defended that the monarchists should organise internally in order to reach power legally (by elections). This was not accepted by militant monarchists who, in the following years, continued their badly prepared attempts to restore the monarchy (for example on 20 October 1914), creating anarchy in the streets. His preoccupation worsened at the beginning of the Great War: Manuel was fearful that the United Kingdom would ally with Spain, in light of Portugal&#x27;s instability, and that Spain would want to annex Portugal, as the price for Spain&#x27;s entry into the War.

==Dover Pact==
After the failure of the first monarchist incursion, and with Manuel appearing relatively unenthusiastic for a restoration of the monarchy (and entirely against armed counter-revolution), another group of royalists attempted to legitimise the claims of the descendants of Miguel I to the throne. In order to counter this, the King allegedly entered into direct negotiations with the Duke of Braganza&#x27;s representatives: he attempted to establish himself as the rightful king and, according to the Integralismo Lusitano group, he recognised the descendants of Miguel as being in line to the throne of Portugal. There are no proof of an encounter between Manuel II and Miguel in Dover on 30 January 1912. The results of the supposed meeting remain controversial: although there was an accord on challenging the republic, there remained no clear agreement on hereditary lines of succession, and Manuel still retained his claim to the throne.

==Monarchy of the North==


Some monarchists continued unsuccessful counter-revolutionary activities during the War, while the former King continued to condemn their actions and to exhort them to restore the monarchy at the ballot-box. This option seemed viable after the dictatorship of General Pimenta de Castro (January 1915) broke the momentum of the Democratic Party, who attempted to garner sympathies from the conservative right, by removing restrictions imposed on monarchist groups on 5 October. Between April and May 1915, 55 monarchist centres opened (33 in the north and 12 in the centre of the country), causing many republicans to close ranks and on 14 May 1915 the revolution returned to the streets, when 15,000 armed civilians and the soldiers from the Navy tried to maintain the loyalty of the Army to the government. After three days of combat 500 deaths and more than 1,000 wounded, the Democratic Party retained control and the monarchist groups were once again declared illegal. During the Sidónio Pais government, Pais cultivated support from conservative factions and incorporated a re-establishment of a regime based on universal male suffrage. His assassination allowed moderate republicans to re-establish control, but the creation of military juntas in the provinces of the north, with monarchist tendencies, created expectations of a possible monarchist restoration through a military coup d&#x27;état.

Manuel continued to plead for calm at the end of the War; while not abandoning the possibility of taking action in the future, he insisted on waiting to the end of peace negotiations in Paris: he was fearful that continued anarchy in Portugal would prejudice its negotiating position. But, for Paiva Couceiro and the other Integralists, this was the moment: they awaited the royal authorisation of the King&#x27;s adjunct Aires de Ornelas. Receiving a memorandum that requested this authorisation, and convinced that this action would not occur immediately, Ornelas wrote on the margin, &quot;Go on. Palavras de El-Rei&quot;, and signed the document. On 19 January 1919 a thousand soldiers and some artillery, under the command of Paiva Couceiro occupied Porto, in order to restore the Constitutional Monarchy, and its King Manuel II. A provisional government was established that controlled Minho, Trás-os-Montes (with the exception of Chaves, Mirandela and Vila Real), as well as part of the district of Aveiro, but contrary to Couceiro&#x27;s expectations, the rest of the country did not rise.

In Lisbon, Aires de Ornelas was caught completely by surprise, but he could not escape with other monarchists to the safety of the 2nd Regimental Lancers, in Ajuda. There the number of refugees, who suffered as the republican reprisals increased, and the commander removed his forces and those civilians, marching them to Monsanto, where the 4th, 7th and 9th Cavalry and the 30th Infantry Battery from Belém were entrenched. Aires de Ornelas wavered in his support, which risked the possibility that Integralists would transfer their loyalty to Miguel&#x27;s supporters, or assume the leadership of the monarchist movement. In a small area, and circled by Republican forces, the monarchists surrendered on 24 January. With the failure of the Restoration in the centre and south of the country, luck turned on Paiva Couceiro. On 13 February a part of the Republican National Guard deserted and restored the Republic in Porto. Those monarchists who did not escape were incarcerated and subsequently sentenced to long-term imprisonment. The King, in exile, did not hear of the failure and was informed only after reading the reports in the newspapers.

==Paris Pact==
Although it is not likely that such a pact took place, it is said that in 1922, with cooling of relations between monarchists of the Integralismo Lusitano and the King, and mindful that his marriage to Augusta Victória had not produced heirs, Manuel, in a Paris meeting in April 1922, represented by his adjunct Aires de Ornelas, and Miguelist representatives Infanta Adelgundes, who was by now calling herself Duchess of Guimarães, and tutor to Duarte Nuno, agreed that owing to an heir, the rights of succession would pass to Duarte Nuno. Integralists disagreed because, in their view, the agreement failed to make reference to the reestablishment of a traditional monarchy, which was fundamental to their assertions. Integralismo Lusitano withheld their support, and in September 1925, Aldegundes, in a letter to Manuel, repudiated the agreement owing the continue operation of the Constitutional Newspaper (the Integralist paper was closed as part of the accord) and the lack of Integralist participation.

== Bibliographer ==
Manuel was always an avid reader and, during his exile, dedicated himself to the study of literature, penning treatises on Medieval and Renaissance literature in Portugal. Following the First World War and with more free time, apart from his contacts with monarchist organisations, he dedicated himself to these studies (a tradition that was instilled in him by his father). Initially, he was interested in writing a biography, and began research on a biography of Manuel I of Portugal, who he believed was badly treated by other historians. He contracted the services of the bibliographer Maurice Ettinghausen in 1919, to find older books for his project, and was helped by the dissolution of many private collections after the implementation of the Republic.

By 1926, Manuel had abandoned the idea of a biography and concentrated on descriptions of older books in his library (itself, a complete library of older works). More than a simple list, the work allowed Manuel to write of the glories of Portugal, writing not just a bibliography but also an examination of the authors and the context of their writings. His interpretation was scientifically rigorous, and resulted in a final work that was marked by a nationalism and the exaltation of ancestral valor. His examples were limited and illustrated by facsimiled copies of the works, both written in English and Portuguese. The first volume of the work &quot;Livros Antigos Portuguezes 1489–1600, da Bibliotheca de Sua Magestade Fidelíssima Descriptos por S. M. El-Rey D. Manuel em Três volumes&quot; was published in 1929. Manuel delivered, by hand, a copy of his work to his friend George V at Windsor Castle. The work was received well by critics, and the King dedicated himself to the second volume, which covered the period 1540 to 1569. But the project was terminated prematurely in 1932, when Manuel died unexpectedly: the third volume was posthumously published under the supervision of his librarian, Margery Winters. His completed works gave the King a respectful reputation among Portuguese historians, and his bust was added to the entrance atrium of the National Library in Lisbon.

==Death, aftermath, and legacy==
King Manuel died unexpectedly in his residence on 2 July 1932, via suffocation following an attack of &quot;acute oedema of the glottis&quot;, a swelling of the narrow opening at the upper end of the larynx, or tracheal oedema. The Portuguese government, at that time led by António Oliveira de Salazar, authorised his burial in Lisbon, after a state funeral. His body arrived in Lisbon on 2 August 1932, on board the British cruiser HMS &quot;Concord&quot; which had made the journey from the United Kingdom and sailed into the Tagus River to deliver the coffin of the former King. The body was received at Praça do Comércio, where a crowd of people had gathered to follow the coffin to São Vicente de Fora and the roads were inundated with people interested in seeing the funeral procession. His body was interred in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza in the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora.

By some he was given the nickname &quot;O Patriota&quot; (&#x27;The Patriot&#x27;), for his preoccupation with the national identity; &quot;O Desventurado&quot; (&#x27;The Unfortunate&#x27;), because he lost his throne to the Republic; and &quot;O Estudioso&quot; or &quot;O Bibliófilo&quot; (&#x27;The Studious&#x27; or &#x27;The Bibliophile&#x27;) for his love for Portuguese literature. Monarchists also referred to him as &quot;O Rei-Saudade&quot; (&#x27;The Missed King&#x27;), for the longing that was felt when the monarchy was abolished.

His death has been regarded as suspicious by some because he had been playing tennis on 1 July and was apparently in excellent health. An incident surrounding his sudden death was mentioned in the autobiography of Harold Brust, a member of Scotland Yard Special Branch in charge of protecting public figures. In his memoirs, Brust speaks of an incident which probably occurred in 1931 in which an intruder was discovered in the grounds of Fulwell Park who, when arrested, the Police confirmed as being a prominent member of a Portuguese republican terrorist group known as the Carbonária and who was subsequently deported to Lisbon. To date the identity of the intruder has not been confirmed. Questions remain as to the reason for the man&#x27;s intrusion.

Since neither the Dover nor Paris Pacts resolved the issue of succession and there are no known documents proving them, there was no direct heir to the defunct throne. King Manuel also made it clear that the Portuguese royal family (including the Brazilian branch of the Imperial House of Orléans-Braganza and the Portuguese family branch of the descendants of the Infanta Ana de Jesus Maria of Braganza and the Duke of Loulé) would end with the last dynastic male heir of the House of Braganza (himself), the collateral Miguelist line having been furthermore excluded from the throne by the Portuguese Cortes, in December 1834, and categorically through the Constitution of 1838 (the article 98). Still, the monarchist Integralismo Lusitano movement supported (since 1920 as miguelist) and acclaimed Duarte Nuno, Duke of Braganza as King of Portugal in 1932, at the death of Manuel II. Their justification, ironically, included the fact that both branches had met to determine the line of succession in Dover and Paris, even though those accords were both later repudiated.

After King Manuel&#x27;s death, the Portuguese National Assembly, under António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s dictatorship, authorised the return of the banned branch of the Braganzas (ex-King Miguel&#x27;s descendants) on 27 May 1950, repealing the laws of exile of 19 December 1834 and 15 October 1910, and founded, with the sale of the King&#x27;s English estate and some of his remaining personal possessions, the Foundation of the House of Braganza, according to King Manuel&#x27;s desire to leave his personal fortune to the Portuguese people.

<text>Colorado College is a private liberal arts college in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Founded in 1874 by Thomas Nelson Haskell in his daughter&#x27;s memory, the college offers over 40 majors and 30 minors, and enrolls approximately 2,000 undergraduates at its campus.

Colorado College is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, and is a QuestBridge partner. Notable alumni include Diana DeGette, Liz Cheney, Dutch Clark, Thomas Hornsby Ferril, James Heckman, Steve Sabol, Ken Salazar, and Marc Webb. Most of the university&#x27;s varsity sports teams compete in NCAA Division III, with the exception of Division I teams in men&#x27;s hockey and women&#x27;s soccer.

== History ==

Colorado College was founded in 1874 on land designated by U.S. Civil War veteran General William Jackson Palmer, the founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad and of Colorado Springs. Founder Thomas Nelson Haskell of the Presbyterian Church described it as a coeducational liberal arts college in the tradition of Oberlin College. As many U.S. colleges and universities that have endured from the 19th century, it now is secular in outlook but retains its focus on the liberal arts.

Cutler Hall, the college&#x27;s first building, was completed in 1880 and the first degrees were conferred in 1882.

William F. Slocum, president from 1888 to 1917, oversaw the initial building of the campus, expanded the library and recruited top scholars in a number of fields. In 1930, Shove Chapel was erected by John Gray to meet the religious needs of the students (though Colorado College is not religiously affiliated).

Katharine Lee Bates wrote &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; during her summer teaching position at Colorado College in 1893.

Manya Whitaker has been serving as interim president since 2024. She will be serving in this role for a term of two years.

==Academics==

Colorado College offers 42 majors and more than 30 minors. In addition to its undergraduate programs, the college offers two master&#x27;s degree programs in teaching. The college uses a block plan wherein students take only one class at a time, for a period of 3 and a half weeks per class. In 2023, the institution yielded a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1. The college&#x27;s Charles L. Tutt Library holds over 400 thousand physical volumes. Its most popular undergraduate majors, by 2021 graduates, were:
::Economics (43)
::Political Science &amp; Government (38)
::Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology (28)
::Multi-/Interdisciplinary Studies (25)
::Computer &amp; Information Sciences (23)
::Psychology (23)
::Cell/Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology (22)

===Admissions===

Colorado College is considered a &quot;most selective school&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the class of 2026, Colorado College received a record number of applications, 11,026, and admitted just above eleven percent of those who applied. Those accepted who identified themselves as students of color numbered twenty-five percent. The Class of 2026 is geographically diverse, representing 15 countries and 47 states, with 24 percent who hail from both the Northeast and the West; 17 percent from Colorado; 16 percent from the Midwest; and 15 percent from the South. 

===Rankings===
In its 2025 edition, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks Colorado College as tied for 29th best liberal arts college in the nation and 3rd most innovative national liberal arts colleges. The most innovative schools are those &quot;making the most innovative improvements in terms of curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology or facilities&quot;.

&quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Colorado College 16th in its 2017 ranking of best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.

In 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated it 111th overall in &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot;, which ranked 500 national universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies. 
CC is one of six colleges in the western US included in the guidebook &quot;The Hidden Ivies&quot;.

===Requirements===
Students must satisfactorily complete 32 credits to graduate in addition to specifying a major of study and fulfilling those requirements. The college offers a unique alternative for students who wish to design their own major. However, standardized cross-cutting requirements still apply, though these criteria are fairly broad compared to those at comparable colleges.

==Student life==
The college&#x27;s motto is the Latin phrase &quot;Scientia et Disciplina&quot;, translated as &quot;Learning through Hard Work&quot; or &quot;Acquiring Knowledge and Living It&quot;. The median family income of Colorado College students is $277,500, the highest of any college or university in the United States, with 54% of students coming from the top 5% highest-earning families and 10.5% from the bottom 60%.

===Extracurriculars===
The small campus of 2,000 students boasts more than one hundred clubs and student groups, ranging from professional groups, interests clubs, and social groups. Among them are intramural sports groups, which have a strong presence on campus. There are intramural teams, ranging from broomball to ultimate frisbee.

===Housing===
Most students live on or directly adjacent to the college campus. Up until their junior year, students are required to live on campus in one of the residence halls or small houses, while apartments and student-owned cottages are available to upperclassmen.

==Campus==
Many of the earliest campus buildings, including Bemis, Cossitt, Cutler, McGregor, Montgomery, Palmer, and Ticknor Halls, are on the National Register of Historic Places, along with Shove Memorial Chapel and the William I. Spencer Center. Arthur House or Edgeplain, once home to the son of President Chester A. Arthur, is also on the National Register.

Since the mid-1950s, newer facilities include three large residence halls, Worner Campus Center, Olin Hall of Science and the Barnes Science Center, Honnen Ice Rink, Boettcher Health Center, Schlessman Pool, Armstrong Hall of Humanities, and the El Pomar Sports Center. The face of campus changed again at the beginning of the 21st century with construction of the Western Ridge Housing Complex, which offers apartment-style living for upper-division students and completion of the Russell T. Tutt Science Center. The east campus has been expanded, and is now home to the Greek Quad and several small residence halls known as &quot;theme houses&quot;.

Some of the more recent notable buildings include Tutt Library, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and later expanded and renovated by Pfeiffer Partners to be the largest carbon-neutral academic library in the United States, Packard Hall of Music and Art, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, and the Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center, which was designed by Antoine Predock with input from faculty and students.

===Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center===
Colorado College&#x27;s Edith Kinney Gaylord Cornerstone Arts Center, completed in 2008 and located at the intersection of a performing arts corridor in Colorado Springs, is home to the college&#x27;s film, drama and dance departments and contains a large theater, several smaller performance spaces, a screening room, the I.D.E.A. Space gallery, and classrooms, among other rooms. The building is also LEED certified.

===Ed Robson Arena===
The Ed Robson Arena is a 3,400-seat ice hockey arena on the campus of Colorado College. The arena opened on September 18 2021. Plans for a school-run arena date as far back as 2008 in the Colorado College Long Range Development Plan. At the time of planning, the Robson arena would be the second smallest facility in the NCHC, ahead of just the Goggin Ice Center. Colorado College justified this decision due to both the small undergraduate size of the college (approximately 2,000) and the average actual attendance of Tiger games (about 2,800). In spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, the arena was opened ahead of schedule in mid-September 2021. It succeeded the Broadmoor World Arena as the home for the Colorado College Tigers ice hockey team and became the first on-campus home for the program after 82 years of operation.

==Athletics==
The school&#x27;s sports teams are nicknamed the &quot;Tigers&quot;. Colorado College competes at the NCAA Division III level in all sports except men&#x27;s hockey, in which it participates in the NCAA Division I National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and women&#x27;s soccer, where it competes as an NCAA Division I team in the Mountain West Conference. CC dropped its intercollegiate athletic programs in football, softball, and women&#x27;s water polo following the 2008–09 academic year.

In 1994, a student referendum to change the athletic teams&#x27; nicknames to the Cutthroat Trout narrowly failed, by a margin of 468–423.

The Tigers hockey team won the NCAA Division I championship twice (1950, 1957), were runners up three times (1952, 1955, 1996) and have made the NCAA Tournament eighteen times, including eleven times since 1995. In 1996, 1997, and 2005, CC played in the Frozen Four, finishing second in 1996. Fifty-five CC Tigers have been named All-Americans. Hockey Hall of Fame coach Bob Johnson coached the Tigers from 1963 to 1966.

The current hockey coach is Kris Mayotte, who had been an assistant coach at Providence College and the University of Michigan.

==KRCC radio==
Colorado College operates National Public Radio Member Station KRCC-FM. In 1944, KRCC began as a two-room public address system in the basement of Bemis Hall. Professor Woodson &quot;Chief&quot; Tyree, Director of Radio and Drama Department at Colorado College was the founder and inspirational force in the program that one day became KRCC-FM. In 1946, KRCC moved to South Hall (where Packard Hall now stands) on campus where two students, Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Edmonds &#x27;51, and Margaret Merle-Smith &#x27;51, were instrumental in securing a war surplus FM transmitter. KRCC began over the air broadcasting in April 1951 as the first non-commercial educational FM radio station in the state of Colorado.

KRCC broadcasts through a series of eleven transmitters and translators throughout southern Colorado and a portion of northern New Mexico. KRCC&#x27;s main transmitter, atop Cheyenne Mountain, broadcasts three separate HD multi-cast channels, including a channel run completely by Colorado College students called the SOCC (Sounds of Colorado College).

==Notable people==

Colorado College has graduated a Nobel Prize winner, a Pulitzer Prize winner, 2 MacArthur Fellows, 14 Rhodes Scholars, 31 Fulbright Scholars, 68 Watson Fellows, and winners of Academy Awards, Emmy Awards, and Grammy Awards. Alumni include Liz Cheney, Peggy Fleming, Steve Sabol, William A. Welch, Frederick Madison Roberts, and Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani. Board members include Robert J. Ross, France Winddance Twine, and alumni Frieda Ekotto and Joe Ellis. Life Trustees include David M. Lampton and alumnus Neal A. Baer. Honorary Trustees include alumni Lynne Cheney, Diana DeGette, and Ken Salazar.

<text>Mytilene (; ) is the capital of the Greek island of Lesbos, and its port. It is also the capital and administrative center of the North Aegean Region, and hosts the headquarters of the University of the Aegean. It was founded in the 11th century BC.

Mytilene is one of the two municipalities on the island of Lesbos, created in 2019; the other is West Lesbos. Mytilene is built on the southeast edge of the island. It is the seat of a metropolitan bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church.

==History==


As an ancient city, lying off the east coast, Mytilene was initially confined to a small island just offshore that later was joined to Lesbos, creating a north and south harbor. The early harbors of Mytilene were linked during ancient times by a channel 700 m long and 30 m wide. The Roman writer Longus speaks of white stone bridges linking the two sides. The Greek word εὔριπος &quot;eúripos&quot; is a commonly-used term when referring to a strait. The strait allowed ancient warships called triremes, with three tiers of rowers or more. The boats that passed were ca. 6 m wide plus oars and had depth of 2 m.

The areas of the city that were densely populated connected the two bodies of land with marble bridges. They usually followed a curved line. The strait begins at the old market called Apano Skala. It was also close to Metropolis Street and ended at the Southern Harbor. One could argue that the channel transversed what is now called Ermou Street. Over time the strait began to collect silt and earth. There was also human intervention for the protection of the Castle of Mytilene. The strait eventually filled with earth.

Mytilene contested successfully with Mithymna in the north of the island for the leadership of the island in the seventh century BC and became the centre of the island&#x27;s prosperous eastern hinterland. Her most famous citizens were the poets Sappho and Alcaeus and the statesman Pittacus (one of the Seven Sages of Greece). The city was famed for its great output of electrum coins struck from the late sixth through mid-fourth centuries BC.

The Mytilenean revolt against Athens in 428 BC was overcome by an Athenian expeditionary force. The Athenian public assembly voted to massacre all the men of the city and to sell the women and children into slavery but the next day in the Mytilenian Debate changed its mind. A fast trireme sailed the in less than a day and brought the decision to cancel the general massacre, but a thousand citizens were executed for taking part in the rebellion.

Aristotle lived on Mytilene for two years, 337–335 BC, with his friend and successor, Theophrastus (a native of the island), after being the tutor to Alexander, son of King Philip II of Macedon.

The Romans, among whom was a young Julius Caesar, successfully defeated Mytilene in 81 BC at the Siege of Mytilene. Although Mytilene supported the losing side in most of the great wars of the first century BC, her statesmen succeeded in convincing Rome of her support of the new ruler of the Mediterranean and the city flourished in Roman times.

In AD 56, Luke the Evangelist, Paul the Apostle and their companions stopped there briefly on the return trip of Paul&#x27;s third missionary journey (), having sailed from Assos (about away). From Mytilene they continued towards Chios ().

The novel &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; by Longus, is set in the country around it and opens with a description of the city.

Scholar and historian Zacharias Rhetor, also known as Zacharias of Mytilene was from Mytilene and lived from 465 to around 536. He was made Bishop of Mytilene and may have been a Chalcedonian Christian. He either died or was deposed between 536 and 553.

The city of Mytilene was also home to 9th century Byzantine saints who were brothers, Archbishop George, Symeon Stylites, and David the Monk. The Church of St. Symeon, Mytilene venerates one of the three brothers.

Catching the eye of the Empress Zoë Porphyrogenita, Constantine IX Monomachos was exiled to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos by her second husband, Michael IV the Paphlagonian. The death of Michael IV and the overthrow of Michael V in 1042 led to Constantine being recalled from his place of exile and appointed as a judge in Greece.
Lesbos and Mytilene had an established Jewish population since ancient times. In 1170, Benjamin of Tudela found ten small Jewish communities on the island.

In the Middle Ages, it was part of the Byzantine Empire and was occupied for some time by the Seljuqs under Tzachas in 1085. In 1198, the Republic of Venice obtained the right to commerce from the city&#x27;s port.

In the 13th century, it was captured by the Emperor of Nicaea, Theodore I Laskaris. In 1335, the Byzantines, with the help of Ottoman forces, reconquered the island, then property of the Genoese nobleman Domenico Cattaneo. In 1355, emperor John V Palaiologos gave it to the Genoese adventurer Francesco Gattilusio, who married the emperor&#x27;s sister, Maria. They renovated the fortress in 1373, and it remained in Genoese hands until 1462, when it was besieged and captured by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror.

As part of the wider Great Turkish War, the Battle of Mytilene took place off the coast of Mytilene in 1690 when Venetian sailing ships attacked Ottoman and Barbary flagships. Resulting in a victory for the Venetians.

Mytilene along with the rest of Lesbos remained under Ottoman control until the First Balkan War in 1912, when in November it was captured by the Kingdom of Greece.

==Geography and climate==
Mytilene is located in the southeastern part of the island, north and east of the Bay of Gera. Its municipal unit has a land area of and a population of 41,379 inhabitants (2021).

One ship, named during the 2001 IAAF games in Edmonton &quot;Aeolus Kenteris&quot;, after Kostas Kenteris, used to serve this city (his hometown) with 6-hour routes from Athens and Thessaloniki. The main port serving Mytilene on the Greek mainland is Piraeus.

The city produces ouzo. There are more than 15 commercial producers on the island.

The city exports also sardines harvested from the Bay of Kalloni, olive oil, ladotyri cheese and woodwork.

==Landmarks and urban architecture==

The town of Mytilene has a large number of neoclassical buildings, public and private houses. Some of them are the building of the Lesbos Prefecture, the old City Hall, the Experimental Lyceum and various mansions and hotels all over the town.

==Archaeology==

Archaeological investigations at Mytilene began in the late 19th century when Robert Koldewey (later excavator of Babylon) and a group of German colleagues spent many months on the island preparing plans of the visible remains at various ancient sites like Mytilene. Significant excavations, however, do not seem to have started until after the First World War when in the mid-1920s Evangelides uncovered much of the famous theatre (according to Plutarch it was the inspiration for Pompey&#x27;s theatre in Rome in 55 BC, the first permanent stone theatre in Rome) on the hill on the western side of town. Subsequent work in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s by various members of the Archaeological Service revealed more of the theatre, including a Roman conversion to a gladiatorial arena. Salvage excavations carried out by the Archaeological Service in many areas of the city have revealed sites going back to the Early Bronze Age although most have been much later (Hellenistic and Roman). Particularly significant is a large stoa over a hundred metres long recently dug on the North Harbour of the city. It is clear from various remains in different parts of the city that Mytilene was indeed laid out on a grid plan as the Roman architect Vitruvius had written.

Archaeological excavations carried out between 1984 and 1994 in the Castle of Mytilene by the University of British Columbia and directed by Caroline and Hector Williams revealed a previously unknown sanctuary of Demeter and Kore of late classical/Hellenistic date and the burial chapel of the Gattelusi, the medieval Genoese family that ruled the northern Aegean from the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries of our era. The Demeter sanctuary included five altars for sacrifices to Demeter and Kore and later also to Cybele, the great mother goddess of Anatolia. Among the discoveries were thousands of oil lamps, terracotta figurines, loom weights and other dedications to the goddesses. Numerous animal bones, especially of piglets, also appeared. The Chapel of St. John served as the church of the castle and as a burial place for the Gattelusi family and its dependents. Although conversion to a mosque after the Ottoman capture of the city in 1462 resulted in the destruction of many graves, some remained. The great earthquake of February 1867 damaged the building beyond repair and it was demolished; the Ottomans built a new mosque over the ruins to replace it later in the 19th century.

Other excavations done jointly with the 20th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities near the North Harbour of the city uncovered a multiperiod site with remains extending from a late Ottoman cemetery (including a &quot;vampire&quot; burial, a middle aged man with spikes through his neck, middle and ankles) to a substantial Roman building constructed around a colonnaded courtyard (probably a tavern/brothel in its final phase in the mid-4th century AD) to remains of Hellenistic structures and debris from different Hellenistic manufacturing processes (pottery, figurines, cloth making and dyeing, bronze and iron working) to archaic and classical levels with rich collections of Aeolic grey wares. A section of the late classical city wall runs across the site which was close to the channel that divided the mainland from the off shore island part of the city. Considerable remains of the two moles that protected the large North Harbour of the city are still visible just below or just breaking the surface of the sea; it functioned as the commercial harbour of the ancient city although today it is a quiet place where a few small fishing boats are moored. 

The city has two excellent archaeological museums, one by the south harbour in an old mansion and the other two hundred metres further north in a large new purpose built structure. The former contains the rich Bronze Age remains from Thermi, a site north of Mytilene dug by the British in the 1930s as well as extensive pottery and figurine displays; the former coach house accommodates ancient inscriptions, architectural pieces, and coins. The latter museum is especially rich in mosaics and sculpture, including the famous late Roman mosaic floor from the &quot;House of Menander&quot; with scenes from plays by that Athenian 4th-century BC playwright. There are also mosaics and finds from other Roman mansions excavated by the Greek Archaeological Service under the direction of the archeologist Aglaia Archontidou-Argyri.

==Education==

There are 15 primary schools in Mytilene, along with seven lyceums, and eight gymnasiums. There are six university schools with 3671 undergraduates, the largest in the University of the Aegean. Here also is the Headquarters, the Central Library and the Research Committee of Aegean University. The University of Aegean is housed in privately owned buildings, in rented buildings located in the city centre and in modern buildings on the University Hill.

==Refugee camps==

By 2015, the city of Mytilene had become a primary entry point for refugees and migrants who seek to pass through Greece to resettle elsewhere in Europe. In 2015, over half a million people arrived in Lesbos. The number of individuals coming through Lesbos has dwindled since the signing of the EU-Turkey deal which restricted the number of refugees that could legally resettle in Europe. , seventy to eighty refugees were still arriving in Greece daily despite the deal and &quot;many of them on Lesbos&quot;, according to Daniel Esdras, the chief of the International Organization for Migration.

* Mória Reception &amp; Identification Centre (in Greek : Κέντρο Υποδοχής και Ταυτοποίησης Μόριας), better known as &quot;Mória Refugee Camp&quot;, or just &quot;Mória&quot;, was the biggest refugee camp in Europe. It was located outside the village of Moria ( &quot;Mória&quot;). Enclosed by barbed wire and a chain-link fence, the military camp served as a European Union hotspot camp. It burned down and was permanently closed in September 2020. A new closed reception centre will be built in 2021 at Vastria near Nees Kydonies.
* Kara Tepe Refugee Camp is a camp which has been transformed into a living space for around 700 refugees classified as vulnerable. It will be replaced by a new closed reception centre at Vastria near Nees Kydonies in 2021.
* Pikpa camp or Lesbos Solidarity, once a children&#x27;s holiday camp, aims to support the most vulnerable refugees who pass through Mytilene: families with children, the disabled, women who are pregnant, and the injured. The camp focuses on humanitarian aid and on providing for the various needs of refugees, including food, medical help, clothing, and psychological support.

<text>Gennett Records () was an American record company and label in Richmond, Indiana, United States, which flourished in the 1920s and produced the Gennett, Starr, Champion, Superior, and Van Speaking labels. The company also produced some Supertone, Silvertone, and Challenge records under contract. The firm also pressed, under contract, records for record labels such as Autograph, Rainbow, Hitch, Our Song, and Vaughn. Gennett produced some of the earliest recordings by Louis Armstrong, King Oliver, Bix Beiderbecke, and Hoagy Carmichael. Its roster also included Jelly Roll Morton, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Charley Patton, and Gene Autry.

==History==
Gennett Records was founded in Richmond, Indiana, by the Starr Piano Company in 1917. By the late 1930s, the label had produced more than 16,000 masters. The company had produced early recordings under the green or blue Starr Records label as early as 1915. The new Gennett label was named after Harry, Fred, and Clarence Gennett, brothers and joint managers, and was an attempt to distinguish the label from its parent company and widen distribution beyond Starr piano stores. Early record pressings were outsourced but by October 1917, Starr Valley - home to the Starr Piano manufacturing campus along the Whitewater River - had a six-story phonograph and manufacturing and record-pressing facility. The early issues were vertically cut in the phonograph record grooves, using the hill-and-dale method of a U-shaped groove and sapphire ball stylus, but they switched to the lateral cut method in April 1919. Gennett Records rarely paid artists upfront. Some were paid a flat fee, from $15–50 per session, while Black artists received even less. Most artists signed royalty contracts that promised one penny for each copy or side sold.

Gennett first set up a recording studio in Manhattan, New York City. Throughout the 1920s, the Manhattan studio saw artists such as Bailey&#x27;s Lucky Seven, the Original Memphis Five under the pseudonym Ladd&#x27;s Black Aces, and in November 1924, Louis Armstrong and the Red Onion Jazz Babies. In 1921, the label set up a second studio on the grounds of the piano factory in Richmond under the supervision of Ezra C.A. Wickemeyer, who would manage the studio from August 1921 to mid-1927. The bulk of the labels productions came out of the Richmond studio, which was long and wide with a control room separated by a double pane of glass. For sound proofing, a Mohawk rug was placed on the floor and drapes and towels were hung on the wall. Gennett was one of the few companies to have a recording facility outside of New York, a move which allowed the label to capture Midwestern and Southern artists. Their locality also led to their recordings being appealing to Black individuals and other rural peoples who were largely neglected by the leading New York labels. Some call the Richmond studio the &quot;cradle of recorded jazz.&quot;

Gennett recorded early jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton, Bix Beiderbecke, The New Orleans Rhythm Kings, King Oliver&#x27;s band with Louis Armstrong, Lois Deppe&#x27;s Serenaders with Earl Hines, Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington, The Red Onion Jazz Babies, The State Street Ramblers, Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels, Alphonse Trent and his Orchestra and many others. Many of these jazz artists, such as Morton, the Rhythm Kings, and Oliver&#x27;s band were popular at the Lincoln Gardens and the Friar&#x27;s Inn nightclubs and had been sent by train to rural Richmond by Chicago, Illinois Starr Piano store manager and talent scout Fred Wiggins. Gennett notably was among the first to record people of color and racially integrated sessions, despite over twenty percent of Wayne County&#x27;s white male population being members of the Ku Klux Klan. Other estimates suggest forty to fifty percent of non-Catholic white men were members of the Richmond klavern.

Throughout the 1920s, Gennett pressed vanity records for the Ku Klux Klan with red labels and gold KKK lettering, often listing performers such as the &quot;100 percent Americans.&quot; Klan members politicized hymns with new lyrics, such as &quot;Onward Christian Klansman&quot; for &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; as well as custom songs such as &quot;Daddy Swiped Our Last Clean Sheet and Joined the Ku Klux Klan.&quot; These private pressings never appeared in Gennett catalogs and were shipped directly to Klan headquarters in Indianapolis after the Klan paid for the records. Some of D.C. Stephenson&#x27;s speeches were recorded by the label. Ironically, Richmond had a large gathering of Ku Klux Klan members in Glen Miller Park followed by a parade on October 5, 1923, the same day King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, with Louis Armstrong, recorded a second series of discs at the Richmond studio. Approximately 30,000 people gathered with Richmond residents to view over 6,000 Klan members participate in a parade. Although the Gennett family was not involved in the Richmond klavern, historian Leonard Moore estimates one of every three native-born white Protestant male in Richmond was a member during this time.

Gennett also recorded early blues and gospel music artists such as Thomas A. Dorsey, Sam Collins, Jaybird Coleman, as well as early hillbilly or country music performers such as Vernon Dalhart, Bradley Kincaid, Ernest Stoneman, Fiddlin&#x27; Doc Roberts, and Gene Autry. Blues artists from Chicago, such as Georgia Tom Dorsey, Big Bill Broonzy, and Scrapper Blackwell, recorded in Richmond. The label preserved several rare varieties of traditional Kentucky music thanks to the work of talent scouts Dennis Taylor and, eventually, one of Taylor&#x27;s recruits the Fiddlin&#x27; Doc Roberts, recording more Kentucky musicians than any other state. Taylor brought hundreds of Kentucky musicians to Richmond between 1925 and 1931, including Asa Martin, Marion Underwood, and Charlie Taylor.

Many early religious recordings were made by Homer Rodeheaver, early shape note singers and others. Classical ensembles around the Midwest, such as the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, traveled to Richmond to record. Gennett also recorded groups such as Gonzalez&#x27;s Mexican Band, the Hawaiian Guitars, the National Marimba Orchestra, and the Italian Degli Arditi Orchestra.
Temporary recording studios were sometimes set up in various Starr Piano Company stores or other buildings. Their downtown Cincinnati, Ohio store recorded West Virginian singer David Miller for a time. The Birmingham, Alabama store, in July and August 1927 under the direction of recording engineer Gordon Soule, which attracted many Southern country blues artists such as Jaybird Coleman and Johnny Watson under the name Daddy Stove Pipe. The Birmingham studio also recorded William Harris, an early Mississippi Delta blues player. From September to November 1927, portable sound equipment was set up in the Hotel Lowry in St. Paul, Minnesota where primarily Swedish, German, and Polish folk music was recorded. Temporary studios were set up in Chicago from November–December 1927 and February–April 1928.

By the late 1920s, Gennett was pressing records for more than 25 labels worldwide, including budget disks for the Sears catalog. In 1926, Fred Gennett created Champion Records as a budget label for tunes previously released on Gennett. Many of the recording artists used pseudonyms, such as the Seven Champions for Bailey&#x27;s Lucky Seven, Skillet Dick and His Frying Pans for Syd Valentine and His Patent Leather Kids - a Black Indiana jazz trio, and the Hill Top Inn Orchestra for Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians. Some Champion artists were not informed that their recordings were reissued under pseudonyms.

Gennett issued a few early electrically recorded masters recorded in the Autograph studios in Chicago in 1925. These recordings were exceptionally crude, and like many other Autograph issues can be easily mistaken for acoustic masters. Gennett began serious electrical recording in March 1926, using a process licensed from General Electric which was found to be unsatisfactory. Although the quality of the recordings taken by the General Electric process was quite good, there were many customer complaints about poor wear characteristics of the electric process records. The composition of the Gennett biscuit (record material) was of insufficient hardness to withstand the increased wear that resulted when the new recordings with their greatly increased frequency range were played on obsolete phonographs with mica diaphragm reproducers. The company discontinued recording by this process in August 1926, and did not return to electric recording until February 1927, after signing a new agreement to license the RCA Photophone recording process. The company also introduced an improved record biscuit which was adequate to the demands imposed by the electric recording process. The improved records were identified by a newly designed black label touting the &quot;New Electrobeam&quot; process.

Recordings were not limited to music. In 1923, orator and statesman William Jennings Bryan traveled to Richmond to record portions of his 1896 Cross of Gold speech, which was released in 1924. In the 1930s, Harry Gennett, Jr. became involved in the recording business and roamed the country in the Gennett recording truck producing sound effects. The Gennett catalog of sound recordsings would be sold by mail to radio stations and filmmakers.

The label was hit severely by the Great Depression in 1930. It cut back on record recording and production and only maintained the budget Champion label until halting activities altogether in 1934. Throughout the 1930s, Fred Wiggins sold thousands of metal discs, which would be worth millions after Gennett&#x27;s rise to fame, for scrap money, likely to make payroll for Starr Piano employess. At this time, the only product Gennett Records produced under its own name was a series of recorded sound effects for use by radio stations. In 1935, the Starr Piano Company sold some Gennett masters, and the Gennett and Champion trademarks to Decca Records. Jack Kapp of Decca was primarily interested in jazz, blues and old time music items in the Gennett catalog which he thought would add depth to the selections offered by the newly organized Decca. Kapp attempted to revive the Gennett and Champion labels between 1935 and 1937 specializing in bargain pressings of race and old-time music with but little success.

The Starr record plant soldiered on under the supervision of Harry Gennett through the remainder of the decade by offering contract pressing services. For a time the Starr Piano Company was the principal manufacturer of Decca records, but much of this business dried up after Decca purchased its own pressing plant in 1938 (the Newaygo, Michigan, plant that formerly had pressed Brunswick and Vocalion records). In the years remaining before World War II, Gennett did contract pressing for New York-based jazz and folk music labels, including Joe Davis, who briefly produced records on Gennett, Beacon, and Joe Davis labels that were pressed in Starr Valley.

With the coming of the Second World War, the War Production Board in March 1942 declared shellac a rationed commodity, limiting record manufacturers to 70% of their 1939 shellac usage. Newly organized record labels were forced to purchase their shellac from existing companies. Joe Davis purchased the Gennett shellac allocation, some of which he used for his own labels, and some of which he sold to the newly formed Capitol Records. Harry Gennett intended to use the funds from the sale of his shellac ration to modernize this pressing plant after Victory, but there is no indication that he did so. Gennett sold decreasing numbers of special purpose records (mostly sound effects, skating rink, and church tower chimes) until 1947 or 1948, and the business then faded away.

Brunswick Records acquired the old Gennett pressing plant for Decca. After Decca opened a new pressing plant in Pinckneyville, Illinois, in 1956, the old Gennett plant in Richmond, Indiana, was sold to Mercury Records in 1958. Mercury operated the historic plant until 1969 when it moved to a nearby modern plant later operated by Cinram.

<text>A period 4 element is one of the chemical elements in the fourth row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The fourth period contains 18 elements beginning with potassium and ending with krypton – one element for each of the eighteen groups. It sees the first appearance of d-block (which includes transition metals) in the table.

==Properties==

All 4th-period elements are stable, and many are extremely common in the Earth&#x27;s crust and/or core; it is the last period with no unstable elements. Many transition metals in the period are very strong, and therefore common in industry, especially iron. Some are toxic, with all known vanadium compounds toxic, arsenic one of the most well-known poisons, and bromine a toxic liquid. Conversely, many elements are essential to human survival, such as calcium, the main component in bones.

===Atomic structure===
Progressing towards increase of atomic number, the Aufbau principle causes elements of the period to put electrons onto 4s, 3d, and 4p subshells, in that order. However, there are exceptions, such as chromium. The first twelve elements—K, Ca, and transition metals—have from 1 to 12 valence electrons respectively, which are placed on 4s and 3d.

Twelve electrons over the electron configuration of argon reach the configuration of zinc, namely 3d10 4s2. After this element, the filled 3d subshell effectively withdraws from chemistry and the subsequent trend looks much like trends in the periods 2 and 3. The p-block elements of period 4 have their valence shell composed of 4s and 4p subshells of the fourth () shell and obey the octet rule.

For quantum chemistry namely this period sees transition from the simplified electron shell paradigm to research of many differently-shaped subshells. The relative disposition of their energy levels is governed by the interplay of various physical effects. The period&#x27;s s-block metals put their differentiating electrons onto 4s despite having vacancies among nominally lower states – a phenomenon unseen in lighter elements. Contrariwise, the six elements from gallium to krypton are the heaviest where all electron shells below the valence shell are filled &quot;completely&quot;. This is no longer possible in further periods due to the existence of f-subshells starting from .

==List of elements==

(*) Exception to the Madelung rule

==s-block elements==
===Potassium===

Potassium (K) is an alkali metal, underneath sodium and above rubidium, and the first element of period 4. One of the most reactive chemical elements, it is usually found only in compounds. It is a silvery metal that tarnishes rapidly when exposed to the oxygen in air, which oxidizes it. It is soft enough to be cut with a knife and the second least-dense element. Potassium has a relatively low melting point; it will melt under a small open flame. It also is less dense than water, and can, in principle, float (although it will react with any water it is exposed to).

===Calcium===

Calcium (Ca) is the second element in the period. An alkali earth metal, native calcium is almost never found in nature, because it reacts with water. It has one of the most widely-known biological roles in all animals and some plants, making up structural elements such as bones and teeth. It also has applications in cells, such as signals for cellular processeses. It is regarded as the most abundant mineral in the human body.

==d-block elements==
===Scandium===

Scandium (Sc) is the third element in the period, and is the first transition metal in the periodic table. Scandium is quite common in nature, but difficult to isolate because its chemistry mirrors that of the other rare earth compounds quite closely. Scandium has very few commercial applications, the major exception being aluminium alloys.

===Titanium===

Titanium (Ti) is an element in group 4. Titanium is both one of the least dense metals and one of the strongest and most corrosion-resistant. As such, it has many applications, especially in alloys with other elements, such as iron. It is commonly used in airplanes, golf clubs, and other objects that must be strong, but lightweight.

===Vanadium===

Vanadium (V) is an element in group 5. Vanadium is never found in pure form in nature, but is commonly found in compounds. Vanadium is similar to titanium in many ways, such as being very corrosion-resistant, however, unlike titanium, it oxidizes in air even at room temperature. All vanadium compounds have at least some level of toxicity, with some of them being extremely toxic.

===Chromium===

Chromium (Cr) is an element in group 6. Chromium is, like titanium and vanadium before it, extremely resistant to corrosion, and is indeed one of the main components of stainless steel. Chromium also has many colorful compounds, and as such is very commonly used in pigments, such as chrome green.

===Manganese===

Manganese (Mn) is an element in group 7. Manganese is often found in combination with iron. Manganese, like chromium before it, is an important component in stainless steel, preventing the iron from rusting. Manganese is also often used in pigments, again like chromium. Manganese is also poisonous; if enough is inhaled, it can cause irreversible neurological damage.

===Iron===

Iron (Fe) is an element in group 8. Iron is the most common on Earth among elements of the period, and probably the most well-known of them. It is the principal component of steel. Iron-56 has the lowest energy density of any isotope of any element, meaning that it is the most massive element that can be produced in supergiant stars. Iron also has some applications in the human body; hemoglobin is partly iron.

===Cobalt===

Cobalt (Co) is an element in group 9. Cobalt is commonly used in pigments, as many compounds of cobalt are blue in color. Cobalt is also a core component of many magnetic and high-strength alloys. The only stable isotope, cobalt-59, is an important component of vitamin B-12, while cobalt-60 is a component of nuclear fallout and can be dangerous in large enough quantities due to its radioactivity.

===Nickel===

Nickel (Ni) is an element in group 10. Nickel is rare in the Earth&#x27;s crust, mainly due to the fact that it reacts with oxygen in the air, with most of the nickel on Earth coming from nickel iron meteorites. However, nickel is very abundant in the Earth&#x27;s core; along with iron it is one of the two main components. Nickel is an important component of stainless steel, and in many superalloys.

===Copper===

Copper (Cu) is an element in group 11. Copper is one of the few metals that is not white or gray in color, the only others being gold, osmium and caesium. Copper has been used by humans for thousands of years to provide a reddish tint to many objects, and is even an essential nutrient to humans, although too much is poisonous. Copper is also commonly used as a wood preservative or fungicides.

===Zinc===

Zinc (Zn) is an element in group 12. Zinc is one of the main components of brass, being used since the 10th century BCE. Zinc is also incredibly important to humans; almost 2 billion people in the world suffer from zinc deficiency. However, too much zinc can cause copper deficiency. Zinc is often used in batteries, aptly named carbon-zinc batteries, and is important in many platings, as zinc is very corrosion resistant.

==p-block elements==

===Gallium===

Gallium (Ga) is an element in group 13, under aluminium. Gallium is noteworthy because it has a melting point at about 303 kelvins, right around room temperature. For example, it will be solid on a typical spring day, but will be liquid on a hot summer day. Gallium is an important component in the alloy galinstan, along with tin. Gallium can also be found in semiconductors.

===Germanium===

Germanium (Ge) is an element in group 14. Germanium, like silicon above it, is an important semiconductor and is commonly used in diodes and transistors, often in combination with arsenic. Germanium is fairly rare on Earth, leading to its comparatively late discovery. Germanium, in compounds, can sometimes irritate the eyes, skin, or lungs.

===Arsenic===

Arsenic (As) is an element in group 15, the pnictogens. Arsenic, as mentioned above, is often used in semiconductors in alloys with germanium. Arsenic, in pure form and some alloys, is incredibly poisonous to all multicellular life, and as such is a common component in pesticides. Arsenic was also used in some pigments before its toxicity was discovered.

===Selenium===

Selenium (Se) is an element in group 16, the chalcogens. Selenium is the first nonmetal in period 4, with properties similar to sulfur. Selenium is quite rare in pure form in nature, mostly being found in minerals such as pyrite, and even then it is quite rare. Selenium is necessary for humans in trace amounts, but is toxic in larger quantities. Selenium is red in monomolar structure but metallic gray in its crystalline structure.

===Bromine===

Bromine (Br) is an element in group 17 (halogen). It does not exist in elemental form in nature. Bromine is barely liquid at room temperature, boiling at about 330 kelvins. Bromine is also quite toxic and corrosive, but bromide ions, which are relatively inert, can be found in halite, or table salt. Bromine is often used as a fire retardant because many compounds can be made to release free bromine atoms.

===Krypton===

Krypton (Kr) is a noble gas, placed under argon and over xenon. Being a noble gas, krypton rarely interacts with itself or other elements; although compounds have been detected, they are all unstable and decay rapidly, and as such, krypton is often used in fluorescent lights. Krypton, like most noble gases, is also used in lighting because of its many spectral lines and the aforementioned reasons.

==Biological role==
Many period 4 elements find roles in controlling protein function as secondary messengers, structural components, or enzyme cofactors. A gradient of potassium is used by cells to maintain a membrane potential which enables neurotransmitter firing and facilitated diffusion among other processes. Calcium is a common signaling molecule for proteins such as calmodulin and plays a critical role in triggering skeletal muscle contraction in vertebrates. Selenium is a component of the noncanonical amino acid, selenocysteine; proteins which contain selenocysteine are known as selenoproteins. Manganese enzymes are utilized by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and may play a role in the virulence of some pathogenic bacteria. Vanabins, also known as vanadium-associated proteins, are found in the blood cells of some species of sea squirts. The role of these proteins is disputed, although there is some speculation that they function as oxygen carriers. Zinc ions are used to stabilize the zinc finger milieu of many DNA-binding proteins.

Period 4 elements can also be found complexed with organic small molecules to form cofactors. The most famous example of this is heme: an iron-containing porphyrin compound responsible for the oxygen-carrying function of myoglobin and hemoglobin as well as the catalytic activity of cytochrome enzymes. Hemocyanin replaces hemoglobin as the oxygen carrier of choice in the blood of certain invertebrates, including horseshoe crabs, tarantulas, and octopuses. Vitamin B12 represents one of the few biochemical applications for cobalt.

<doc id="181556" wikidata="Q239813" url="?curid=181556" title="Period 6 element">
<text>A period 6 element is one of the chemical elements in the sixth row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements, including the lanthanides. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The sixth period contains 32 elements, tied for the most with period 7, beginning with caesium and ending with radon. Lead is currently the last stable element; all subsequent elements are radioactive. For bismuth, however, its only primordial isotope, 209Bi, has a half-life of more than 1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current age of the universe. As a rule, period 6 elements fill their 6s shells first, then their 4f, 5d, and 6p shells, in that order; however, there are exceptions, such as gold.

==Properties==
This period contains the lanthanides, also known as the &quot;rare earths&quot;. Many lanthanides are known for their magnetic properties, such as neodymium. Many period 6 transition metals are very valuable, such as gold, however many period 6 other metals are incredibly toxic, such as thallium. Period 6 contains the last stable element, lead. All subsequent elements in the periodic table are radioactive. After bismuth, which has a half-life or more than 1019 years, polonium, astatine, and radon are some of the shortest-lived and rarest elements known; less than a gram of astatine is estimated to exist on earth at any given time.

==Atomic characteristics==

* In many periodic tables, the f-block is erroneously shifted one element to the right, so that lanthanum and actinium become d-block elements, and Ce–Lu and Th–Lr form the f-block, tearing the d-block into two very uneven portions. This is a holdover from early erroneous measurements of electron configurations. Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz pointed out in 1948 that lutetium is not an f-block element, and since then physical, chemical, and electronic evidence has overwhelmingly supported that the f-block contains the elements La–Yb and Ac–No, as shown here and as supported by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry reports dating from 1988 and 2021.
* An exception to the Madelung rule.

==s-block elements==

===Caesium===

Caesium or cesium is the chemical element with the symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal with a melting point of 28 °C (82 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at (or near) room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at−116 °C (−177 °F). It is the least electronegative element having a stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors.

Two German chemists, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, discovered caesium in 1860 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy. The first small-scale applications for caesium have been as a &quot;getter&quot; in vacuum tubes and in photoelectric cells. In 1967, a specific frequency from the emission spectrum of caesium-133 was chosen to be used in the definition of the second by the International System of Units. Since then, caesium has been widely used in atomic clocks.

Since the 1990s, the largest application of the element has been as caesium formate for drilling fluids. It has a range of applications in the production of electricity, in electronics, and in chemistry. The radioactive isotope caesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years and is used in medical applications, industrial gauges, and hydrology. Although the element is only mildly toxic, it is a hazardous material as a metal and its radioisotopes present a high health risk in case of radioactivity releases.

===Barium===

Barium is a chemical element with the symbol Ba and atomic number 56. It is the fifth element in Group 2, a soft silvery metallic alkaline earth metal. Barium is never found in nature in its pure form due to its reactivity with air. Its oxide is historically known as baryta but it reacts with water and carbon dioxide and is not found as a mineral. The most common naturally occurring minerals are the very insoluble barium sulfate, BaSO4 (barite), and barium carbonate, BaCO3(witherite). Barium&#x27;s name originates from Greek &quot;barys&quot; (βαρύς), meaning &quot;heavy&quot;, describing the high density of some common barium-containing ores.

Barium has few industrial applications, but the metal has been historically used to scavenge air in vacuum tubes. Barium compounds impart a green color to flames and have been used in fireworks. Barium sulfate is used for its density, insolubility, and X-ray opacity. It is used as an insoluble heavy additive to oil well drilling mud, and in purer form, as an X-ray radiocontrast agent for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. Soluble barium compounds are poisonous due to release of the soluble barium ion, and have been used as rodenticides. New uses for barium continue to be sought. It is a component of some &quot;high temperature&quot; YBCOsuperconductors, and electroceramics.

==f-block elements (lanthanides)==

The lanthanide or lanthanoid (IUPAC nomenclature) series comprises the fifteen metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71, from lanthanum through lutetium. These fifteen elements, along with the chemically similar elements scandium and yttrium, are often collectively known as the rare-earth elements.

The informal chemical symbol Ln is used in general discussions of lanthanide chemistry. All but one of the lanthanides are f-block elements, corresponding to the filling of the 4f electron shell; lanthanum, a d-block element, is also generally considered to be a lanthanide due to its chemical similarities with the other fourteen. All lanthanide elements form trivalent cations, Ln3+, whose chemistry is largely determined by the ionic radius, which decreases steadily from lanthanum to lutetium.
*Between initial [Xe] and final 6s2 electronic shells

The lanthanide elements are the group of elements with atomic number increasing from 57 (lanthanum) to 71 (lutetium). They are termed lanthanide because the lighter elements in the series are chemically similar to lanthanum. Strictly speaking, both lanthanum and lutetium have been labeled as group 3 elements, because they both have a single valence electron in the d shell. However, both elements are often included in any general discussion of the chemistry of the lanthanide elements.

In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and rutherfordium, respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table&#x27;s sixth and seventh rows (periods).

==d-block elements==

===Lutetium===

Lutetium ( ) is a chemical element with the symbol Lu and atomic number 71. It is the last element in the lanthanide series, which, along with the lanthanide contraction, explains several important properties of lutetium, such as it having the highest hardness or density among lanthanides. Unlike other lanthanides, which lie in the f-block of the periodic table, this element lies in the d-block; however, lanthanum is sometimes placed on the d-block lanthanide position. Chemically, lutetium is a typical lanthanide: its only common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds. In an aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble lutetium compounds form a complex with nine water molecules.

Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. All of these men found lutetium as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was previously thought to consist entirely of ytterbium. The dispute on the priority of the discovery occurred shortly after, with Urbain and von Welsbach accusing each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other; the naming honor went to Urbain as he published his results earlier. He chose the name lutecium for the new element but in 1949 the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. In 1909, the priority was finally granted to Urbain and his names were adopted as official ones; however, the name cassiopeium (or later cassiopium) for element 71 proposed by von Welsbach was used by many German scientists until the 1950s. Like other lanthanides, lutetium is one of the elements that traditionally were included in the classification &quot;rare earths.&quot;

Lutetium is rare and expensive; consequently, it has few specific uses. For example, a radioactive isotope lutetium-176 is used in nuclear technology to determine the age of meteorites. Lutetium usually occurs in association with the element yttrium and is sometimes used in metal alloys and as a catalyst in various chemical reactions. 177Lu-DOTA-TATE is used for radionuclide therapy (see Nuclear medicine) on neuroendocrine tumours.
===Hafnium===

Hafnium is a chemical element with the symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and is found in zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Hafnium was the penultimate stable isotope element to be discovered (rhenium was identified two years later). Hafnium is named for &quot;Hafnia&quot;, the Latin name for &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, where it was discovered.

Hafnium is used in filaments and electrodes. Some semiconductor fabrication processes use its oxide for integrated circuits at 45 nm and smaller feature lengths. Some superalloys used for special applications contain hafnium in combination with niobium, titanium, or tungsten.

Hafnium&#x27;s large neutron capture cross-section makes it a good material for neutron absorption in control rods in nuclear power plants, but at the same time requires that it be removed from the neutron-transparent corrosion-resistant zirconium alloys used in nuclear reactors.

===Tantalum===

Tantalum is a chemical element with the symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as &quot;tantalium&quot;, the name comes from &quot;Tantalus&quot;, a character from Greek mythology. Tantalum is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion resistant. It is part of the refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor component in alloys. The chemical inertness of tantalum makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum, but its main use today is in tantalum capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.
Tantalum, always together with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).

===Tungsten===

Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a chemical element with the chemical symbol W and atomic number 74. The word &quot;tungsten&quot; comes from the Swedish language &quot;tung sten&quot; directly translatable to &quot;heavy stone&quot;, though the name is &quot;volfram&quot; in Swedish to distinguish it from Scheelite, in Swedish alternatively named &quot;tungsten&quot;.

A hard, rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined, tungsten is found naturally on Earth only in chemical compounds. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the non-alloyed metals and the second highest of all the elements after carbon. Also remarkable is its high density of 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Tungsten with minor amounts of impurities is often brittle and hard, making it difficult to work. However, very pure tungsten, though still hard, is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.

The unalloyed elemental form is used mainly in electrical applications. Tungsten&#x27;s many alloys have numerous applications, most notably in incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, and superalloys. Tungsten&#x27;s hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are most often used industrially as catalysts.

Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria. It is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism, and is somewhat toxic to animal life.

===Rhenium===

Rhenium is a chemical element with the symbol Re and atomic number 75. It is a silvery-white, heavy, third-row transition metal in group 7 of the periodic table. With an &quot;estimated&quot; average concentration of 1 part per billion (ppb), rhenium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The free element has the third-highest melting point and highest boiling point of any element. Rhenium resembles manganese chemically and is obtained as a by-product of molybdenum and copper ore&#x27;s extraction and refinement. Rhenium shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.

Discovered in 1925, rhenium was the last stable element to be discovered. It was named after the river Rhine in Europe.

Nickel-based superalloys of rhenium are used in the combustion chambers, turbine blades, and exhaust nozzles of jet engines, these alloys contain up to 6% rhenium, making jet engine construction the largest single use for the element, with the chemical industry&#x27;s catalytic uses being next-most important. Because of the low availability relative to demand, rhenium is among the most expensive of metals, with an average price of approximately US$4,575 per kilogram (US$142.30 per troy ounce) as of August 2011; it is also of critical strategic military importance, for its use in high performance military jet and rocket engines.

===Osmium===

Osmium is a chemical element with the symbol Os and atomic number 76. It is a hard, brittle, blue-gray or blue-black transition metal in the platinum family and is the densest naturally occurring element, with a density of (slightly greater than that of iridium and twice that of lead). It is found in nature as an alloy, mostly in platinum ores; its alloys with platinum, iridium, and other platinum group metals are employed in fountain pen tips, electrical contacts, and other applications where extreme durability and hardness are needed.

===Iridium===

Iridium is the chemical element with atomic number 77, and is represented by the symbol Ir. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum family, iridium is the second-densest element (after osmium) and is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.

Iridium was discovered in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named the iridium for the goddess Iris, personification of the rainbow, because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. and are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.

The most important iridium compounds in use are the salts and acids it forms with chlorine, though iridium also forms a number of organometallic compounds used in industrial catalysis, and in research. Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-end spark plugs, crucibles for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the chloralkali process. Iridium radioisotopes are used in some radioisotope thermoelectric generators.

Iridium is found in meteorites with an abundance much higher than its average abundance in the Earth&#x27;s crust. For this reason the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary gave rise to the Alvarez hypothesis that the impact of a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66 million years ago. It is thought that the total amount of iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that observed in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet was young and still molten.

===Platinum===

Platinum is a chemical element with the chemical symbol Pt and an atomic number of 78.

Its name is derived from the Spanish term &quot;platina&quot;, which is literally translated into &quot;little silver&quot;. It is a dense, malleable, ductile, precious, gray-white transition metal.

Platinum has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarest elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust and has an average abundance of approximately 5 μg/kg. It is the least reactive metal. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, which accounts for 80% of the world production.

As a member of the platinum group of elements, as well as of the group 10 of the periodic table of elements, platinum is generally non-reactive. It exhibits a remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and as such is considered a noble metal. As a result, platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, but it was not until Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it became investigated by scientists.

Platinum is used in catalytic converters, laboratory equipment, electrical contacts and electrodes, platinum-resistance thermometers, dentistry equipment, and jewelry. Because only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, it is a scarce material, and is highly valuable. Being a heavy metal, it leads to health issues upon exposure to its salts, but due to its corrosion resistance, it is not as toxic as some metals. Its compounds, most notably cisplatin, are applied in chemotherapy against certain types of cancer.

===Gold===

Gold is a dense, soft, shiny, malleable and ductile metal. It is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79.

Pure gold has a bright yellow color and luster traditionally considered attractive, which it maintains without oxidizing in air or water. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, usually with tellurium.

Gold resists attacks by individual acids, but it can be dissolved by the aqua regia (nitro-hydrochloric acid), so named because it dissolves gold. Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which have been used in mining. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to confirm the presence of gold in items, giving rise to the term &quot;the acid test.&quot;

Gold has been a valuable and highly sought-after precious metal for coinage, jewelry, and other arts since long before the beginning of recorded history. Gold standards have been a common basis for monetary policies throughout human history, later being supplanted by fiat currency starting in the 1930s. The last gold certificate and gold coin currencies were issued in the U.S. in 1932. In Europe, most countries left the gold standard with the start of World War I in 1914 and, with huge war debts, failed to return to gold as a medium of exchange.

A total of 165,000 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, as of 2009. This is roughly equivalent to 5.3 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 8500 m3, or a cube 20.4 m on a side. The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry.

Besides its widespread monetary and symbolic functions, gold has many practical uses in dentistry, electronics, and other fields. Its high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity led to many uses of gold, including electric wiring, colored-glass production and even gold leaf eating.

It has been claimed that most of the Earth&#x27;s gold lies at its core, the metal&#x27;s high density having made it sink there in the planet&#x27;s youth. Virtually all of the gold that mankind has discovered is considered to have been deposited later by meteorites which contained the element. This supposedly explains why, in prehistory, gold appeared as nuggets on the earth&#x27;s surface.

===Mercury===

Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is also known as quicksilver or hydrargyrum ( &lt; Greek &quot;&quot; &quot;water&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;silver&quot;). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metal that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, francium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature. With a freezing point of −38.83 °C and boiling point of 356.73 °C, mercury has one of the narrowest ranges of its liquid state of any metal.

Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is mostly obtained by reduction from cinnabar. Cinnabar is highly toxic by ingestion or inhalation of the dust. Mercury poisoning can also result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), inhalation of mercury vapor, or eating seafood contaminated with mercury.

Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, and other devices though concerns about the element&#x27;s toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alcohol-filled, galinstan-filled, digital, or thermistor-based instruments. It remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce, making visible light.

==p-block elements==

===Thallium===

Thallium is a chemical element with the symbol Tl and atomic number 81. This soft gray other metal resembles tin but discolors when exposed to air. The two chemists William Crookes and Claude-Auguste Lamy discovered thallium independently in 1861 by the newly developed method of flame spectroscopy. Both discovered the new element in residues of sulfuric acid production.

Approximately 60–70% of thallium production is used in the electronics industry, and the remainder is used in the pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. Thallium is highly toxic and was used in rat poisons and insecticides. Its use has been reduced or eliminated in many countries because of its nonselective toxicity. Because of its use for murder, thallium has gained the nicknames &quot;The Poisoner&#x27;s Poison&quot; and &quot;Inheritance Powder&quot; (alongside arsenic).

===Lead===

Lead is a main-group element in the carbon group with the symbol Pb (from ) and atomic number 82. Lead is a soft, malleable other metal. It is also counted as one of the heavy metals. Metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut, but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air. Lead has a shiny chrome-silver luster when it is melted into a liquid.

Lead is used in building construction, lead-acid batteries, bullets and shots, weights, as part of solders, pewters, fusible alloys and as a radiation shield. Lead has the highest atomic number of all of the stable elements, although the next higher element, bismuth, has a half-life that is so long (much longer than the age of the universe) that it can be considered stable. Its four stable isotopes have 82 protons, a magic number in the nuclear shell model of atomic nuclei.

Lead, at certain exposure levels, is a poisonous substance to animals as well as for human beings. It damages the nervous system and causes brain disorders. Excessive lead also causes blood disorders in mammals. Like the element mercury, another heavy metal, lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates both in soft tissues and the bones. Lead poisoning has been documented from ancient Rome, ancient Greece, and ancient China.

===Bismuth===

Bismuth is a chemical element with symbol Bi and atomic number 83. Bismuth, a trivalent other metal, chemically resembles arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally uncombined, although its sulfide and oxide form important commercial ores. The free element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when newly made, but often seen in air with a pink tinge owing to the surface oxide. Bismuth metal has been known from ancient times, although until the 18th century it was often confused with lead and tin, which each have some of bismuth&#x27;s bulk physical properties. The etymology is uncertain but possibly comes from Arabic meaning having the properties of antimony or German words or meaning &quot;white mass&quot;.

Bismuth is the most naturally diamagnetic of all metals, and only mercury has a lower thermal conductivity.

Bismuth has classically been considered to be the heaviest naturally occurring stable element, in terms of atomic mass. Recently, however, it has been found to be very slightly radioactive: its only primordial isotope bismuth-209 decays via alpha decay into thallium-205 with a half-life of more than a billion times the estimated age of the universe.

Bismuth compounds (accounting for about half the production of bismuth) are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, alloy uses for bismuth metal (presently about a third of bismuth production), as a replacement for lead, have become an increasing part of bismuth&#x27;s commercial importance.

===Polonium===

Polonium is a chemical element with the symbol Po and atomic number 84, discovered in 1898 by Marie Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie. A rare and highly radioactive element, polonium is chemically similar to bismuth and tellurium, and it occurs in uranium ores. Polonium has been studied for possible use in heating spacecraft. As it is unstable, all isotopes of polonium are radioactive. There is disagreement as to whether polonium is a post-transition metal or metalloid.

===Astatine===

Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. It occurs on the Earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements, and decays away rapidly, so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table. Earlier studies have shown this element follows periodic trends, being the heaviest known halogen, with melting and boiling points being higher than those of lighter halogens.

Until recently most of the chemical characteristics of astatine were inferred from comparison with other elements; however, important studies have already been done. The main difference between astatine and iodine is that the HAt molecule is chemically a hydride rather than a halide; however, in a fashion similar to the lighter halogens, it is known to form ionic astatides with metals. Bonds to nonmetals result in positive oxidation states, with +1 best portrayed by monohalides and their derivatives, while the higher are characterized by bond to oxygen and carbon. Attempts to synthesize astatine fluoride have been met with failure. The second longest-living astatine-211 is the only one to find a commercial use, being useful as an alpha emitter in medicine; however, only extremely small quantities are used, and in larger ones it is very hazardous, as it is intensely radioactive.

Astatine was first produced by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segrè in the University of California, Berkeley in 1940. Three years later, it was found in nature; however, with an estimated amount of less than 28 grams (1 oz) at given time, astatine is the least abundant element in Earth&#x27;s crust among non-transuranium elements. Among astatine isotopes, four (with mass numbers 215, 217, 218 and 219) are present in nature as the result of decay of heavier elements; however, the most stable astatine-210 and the industrially used astatine-211 are not.

===Radon===

Radon is a chemical element with symbol Rn and atomic number 86. It is a radioactive, colorless, odorless, tasteless noble gas, occurring naturally as the decay product of uranium or thorium. Its most stable isotope, 222Rn, has a half-life of 3.8 days. Radon is one of the densest substances that remains a gas under normal conditions. It is also the only gas that is radioactive under normal conditions, and is considered a health hazard due to its radioactivity. Intense radioactivity also hindered chemical studies of radon and only a few compounds are known.

Radon is formed as part of the normal radioactive decay chain of uranium and thorium. Uranium and thorium have been around since the earth was formed and their most common isotope has a very long half-life (14.05 billion years). Uranium and thorium, radium, and thus radon, will continue to occur for millions of years at about the same concentrations as they do now. As the radioactive gas of radon decays, it produces new radioactive elements called radon daughters or decay products. Radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces such as dust particles in the air. If contaminated dust is inhaled, these particles can stick to the airways of the lung and increase the risk of developing lung cancer.

Radon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to ionizing radiation. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual&#x27;s background radiation dose, and is the most variable from location to location. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as attics and basements. It can also be found in some spring waters and hot springs.

Epidemiological studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of lung cancer. Thus, radon is considered a significant contaminant that affects indoor air quality worldwide. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States. About 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, it is the number one cause among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates.

==Biological role==
Of the period 6 elements, only tungsten and the early lanthanides are known to have any biological role in organisms, and even then only in lower organisms (not mammals). However, gold, platinum, mercury, and some lanthanides such as gadolinium have applications as drugs.

==Toxicity==
Most of the period 6 elements are toxic (for instance lead) and produce heavy-element poisoning. Promethium, polonium, astatine and radon are radioactive, and therefore present radioactive hazards.

<text>A waypoint is a point or place on a route or line of travel, a stopping point, an intermediate point, or point at which course is changed, the first use of the term tracing to 1880. In modern terms, it most often refers to coordinates which specify one&#x27;s position on the globe at the end of each &quot;leg&quot; (stage) of an air flight or sea passage, the generation and checking of which are generally done computationally (with a computer or other programmed device).

Hence, the term connotes a reference point in physical space, most often associated with navigation, especially in the sea or air—e.g., in the case of sea navigation, a longitudinal and latitudinal coordinate or a GPS point in open water, a location near a known mapped shoal or other entity in a body of water, a point a fixed distance off of a geographical entity such as a lighthouse or harbour entrance, etc. When such a point corresponds to an element of physical geography on land, it can be referred to as a landmark. In air navigation, waypoints most often consist of a series of abstract GPS points that create artificial airways—&quot;highways in the sky&quot;—created specifically for purposes of air navigation that have no clear connection to features of the real world.

==Concept==
Waypoints are sets of coordinates that identify a point in physical space. Coordinates used can vary depending on the application. For terrestrial navigation these coordinates can include longitude and latitude. Air navigation also includes altitude. Waypoints have only become widespread for navigational use by the layman since the development of advanced navigational systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and certain other types of radio navigation. Waypoints located on the surface of the Earth are usually defined in two dimensions (&quot;e.g.,&quot; longitude and latitude); those used in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or in outer space are defined in at least three dimensions (four if time is one of the coordinates, as it might be for some waypoints outside the Earth).

Although the term &quot;waypoint&quot; has only entered common use in recent years, the equivalent of a waypoint in all but name has existed for as long as human beings have navigated. Waypoints have traditionally been associated with distinctive features of the real world, such as rock formations, springs, oases, mountains, buildings, roadways, waterways, railways, and so on. Today, these associations persist, but waypoints are more often associated with physical artifacts created specifically for navigation, such as radio beacons, buoys, satellites or control points.

In the modern world, waypoints are increasingly abstract, often having no obvious relationship to any distinctive features of the real world. These waypoints are used to help define invisible routing paths for navigation. For example, artificial airways &quot;highways in the sky&quot;, created specifically for purposes of air navigation, often have no clear connection to features of the real world, and consist only of a series of abstract waypoints in the sky through which pilots navigate; these airways are designed to facilitate air traffic control and routing of traffic between heavily traveled locations, and do not reference natural terrain features. Abstract waypoints of this kind have been made practical by modern navigation technologies, such as land-based radio beacons and the satellite-based GPS.

Abstract waypoints typically have only specified longitude and latitude or UTM coordinates plus the reference datum, and often a name if they are marked on charts, and are located using a radio navigation system such as a VOR or GPS receiver. A waypoint can be a destination, a fix along a planned course used to make a journey, or simply a point of reference useful for navigation.

==Modern applications==
=== With GPS===
GPS systems are increasingly used to create and use waypoints in navigation of all kinds. A typical GPS receiver can locate a waypoint with an accuracy of three meters or better when used with land-based assisting technologies such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Waypoints can also be marked on a computer mapping program and uploaded to the GPS receiver, marked on the receiver&#x27;s own internal map, or entered manually on the device as a pair of coordinates.

If the GPS receiver has track-logging capabilities, one can also define waypoints after the fact from where one has been. For example, marine GPS receivers often have a &quot;man overboard&quot; function, which instantly creates a waypoint in the receiver for the boat&#x27;s position when enabled and then begins displaying the distance and course back to that position.

In GPS navigation, a &quot;route&quot; is usually defined as a series of two or more waypoints. To follow such a route, the GPS user navigates to the nearest waypoint, then to the next one in turn until the destination is reached. Most receivers have the ability to compute a great circle route towards a waypoint, enabling them to find the shortest route even over long distances, although waypoints are often so closely spaced that this is not a factor.

Many GPS receivers, both military and civilian, now offer integrated cartographic databases (also known as &quot;base maps&quot;), allowing users to locate a point on a map and define it as a waypoint. Some GPS systems intended for automobile navigation can generate a suggested driving route between two waypoints, based on the cartographic database. As one drives along the route, the system indicates the driver&#x27;s current location and gives advance notice of upcoming turns. The best of these systems can take into account traffic restrictions such as one-way streets and intersections where left or right turns are prohibited when computing the suggested driving route.

Most GPS receivers allow the user to assign a name to each waypoint. Many models also let the user select a symbol or icon to identify the waypoint on a graphical map display from a built-in library of icons. These include standard map symbols for marine navigation aids such as buoys, marinas and anchorages, as well as land-based landmarks such as churches, bridges, shopping centers, parks and tunnels.

GPS receivers used in air navigation have databases which contain named waypoints, radio navigation aids, airports and heliports. These references comprise the National Airspace System&#x27;s method of allowing air traffic to select routes that yield efficient point-to-point navigation. Waypoints are often used in the termination phase of a flight to its destination airport. Some GPS receivers are integrated into autopilot or flight management systems, to aid the pilot in control of an aircraft. Waypoints may be found on Aeronautical Charts known as Instrument Flight Rules Enroute Low Altitude Charts, Terminal Arrival Procedures or Sectional Charts.

===Without GPS===

Although the concept of waypoints has been greatly popularized among non-specialists by the development of the GPS, waypoints can be used with other navigational aids. A notable example is the worldwide use, in orienteering sports, of waypoints with a map that omits a coordinate system, known as control points.

In aerial celestial navigation, waypoints are precomputed along an aircraft&#x27;s great circle route to divide the flight into rhumb lines and allow celestial fixes to be more rapidly taken using the precomputed intercept method.

In air navigation, waypoints are sometimes defined as intersections between two VOR radials or NDB bearings, or in terms of specific distances and headings towards or away from a radio beacon. For visual air navigation (see the article on visual flight rules), waypoints may be directly associated with distinctive features on the ground that are easily identifiable from aircraft, such as stadiums, power plants, racetracks, etc. Temporary waypoints are sometimes defined as traffic requires, &quot;e.g.,&quot; air-traffic controllers may instruct a pilot to reference a terrain feature at &quot;your ten o&#x27;clock position, two miles.&quot;

==In aviation==
In aviation, area navigation (RNAV)—a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of station-referenced navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these—relies heavily upon waypoints. RNAV is increasingly used as the primary method of navigation for aircraft.

In the RNAV context, a waypoint is a predetermined geographical position that is defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates (altitude is ignored). Waypoints may be a simple named point in space or may be associated with existing navigational aids, intersections, or fixes. A waypoint is most often used to indicate a change in direction, speed, or altitude along the desired path.

Aviation RNAV procedures make use of both &quot;fly-over&quot; and &quot;fly-by&quot; waypoints. A fly-over waypoint is a waypoint that must be crossed vertically by an aircraft. A fly-by waypoint is a waypoint that marks the intersection of two straight paths, with the transition from one path to another being made by the aircraft using a precisely calculated turn that &quot;flies by&quot; but does not vertically cross the waypoint.

Waypoints used in aviation are given five-letter names. These names are meant to be pronounceable or have a mnemonic value, so that they may easily be conveyed by voice. In some cases the names correspond to a notable feature or landmark in the area (for example, a waypoint near Newton, Iowa, has the name &quot;MATAG&quot;; Newton was where appliance manufacturer Maytag was founded). The waypoint names might not be unique globally.

<doc id="181560" wikidata="Q923619" url="?curid=181560" title="Jules Favre">
<text>Jules Claude Gabriel Favre (21 March 1809 – 20 January 1880) was a French statesman and lawyer. After the establishment of the Third Republic in September 1870, he became one of the leaders of the Opportunist Republicans in the National Assembly.

== Early years==

He was born in Lyon, and began his career as a lawyer. From the time of the Revolution of 1830, he openly declared himself a republican, and in political trials he took the opportunity to express this opinion. After the Revolution of 1848 he was elected deputy for Lyon to the Constituent Assembly, where he sat among the Moderate Republicans, voting against the socialists. When Louis Napoleon was elected President of France, Favre openly opposed him.On 2 December 1851 he tried with Victor Hugo and others to organize armed resistance in the streets of Paris. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, he withdrew from politics, returned to the legal profession, distinguishing himself by his defence of Felice Orsini, the perpetrator of the attack against the life of Napoleon III.

In 1858 he was elected deputy for Paris, being one of the &quot;Five&quot; who gave the signal for the republican opposition to the Empire. In 1863 he became the head of his party and delivered a number of addresses denouncing the Mexican expedition and the occupation of Rome. These addresses, eloquent, clear and incisive, won him a seat in the Académie française in 1867.

== Franco-Prussian War and Third Republic ==

With Adolphe Thiers he opposed the war against Prussia in 1870, and at the news of the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan he demanded the deposition of the emperor. Favre opposed the removal of the government from Paris during the siege.

In the government of National Defence he became vice-president under General Trochu, and minister of foreign affairs, with the onerous task of negotiating peace with victorious Germany. He proved to be less adroit as a diplomat than he had been as an orator, and committed several irreparable blunders. His famous statement on 6 September 1870, that he &quot;would not yield to Germany an inch of territory nor a single stone of the fortresses&quot; was a piece of oratory which Bismarck met on the 19th by his declaration to Favre that Alsace and Lorraine had to be ceded as a condition of peace.

He arranged for the armistice of 28 January 1871 without knowing the situation of the armies, and without consulting the government at Bordeaux. By a grave oversight, he neglected to inform Léon Gambetta that the Army of the East (80,000 men) was not included in the armistice, and it was thus obliged to retreat to neutral territory. He showed no diplomatic skill in the negotiations for the Treaty of Frankfurt, and it was Bismarck who imposed all the conditions. He withdrew from the ministry, discredited, on 2 August 1871, but remained in the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Opportunist parliamentary group, &quot;Gauche républicaine&quot;. Elected Senator on 30 January 1876, he continued to support the government of the republic against the reactionary opposition until his death on 20 January 1880.

==Post-war scandal==
Favre turned out to have a skeleton in his closet, although he probably never saw it as such. He had a series of children with a married woman who never got a divorce. Although Favre recognized these children as his own legally, the story did not become known generally until after 1871, when his bungling of the diplomacy with Bismarck left him a good target for political enemies. The story was released, and Favre did win damages against one of the men who released it, but whatever influence he might still have had was smashed. Ironically, it is apparent that his old opponent, Napoleon III knew of the situation, but as Favre never attacked the Emperor about his sexual affairs, the Emperor respected Favre on the same issue.

== Descendants ==

Favre was the grandfather of the Existential Thomist philosopher and theologian Jacques Maritain, through Favre&#x27;s daughter Geneviève.

== Works ==

His works include many speeches and addresses, notably &quot;La Liberté de la Presse&quot; (1849), &quot;Défense de F. Orsini&quot; (1866), &quot;Discours de réception a l&#x27;Académie française&quot; (1868), &quot;Discours sur la liberté intérieure&quot; (1869). In &quot;Le Gouvernement de la Défense Nationale&quot;, 3 vols., 1871–1875, he explained his role in 1870–1871.

After Favre&#x27;s death his wife Julie Velten Favre, an educator and philosopher who had collaborated with Favre during their marriage, compiled and edited his speeches into 8 volumes.
