<text>Histrionic personality disorder (HPD) is defined by the American Psychiatric Association as a personality disorder characterized by a pattern of excessive attention-seeking behaviors, usually beginning in adolescence or early adulthood, including inappropriate seduction and an excessive desire for approval. People diagnosed with the disorder are said to be lively, dramatic, vivacious, enthusiastic, extroverted and flirtatious.

HPD lies in the emotional cluster of personality disorders, also known as the Cluster B. People with HPD have a high desire for attention, make loud and inappropriate appearances, exaggerate their behaviors and emotions, and crave stimulation. They very often exhibit pervasive and persistent sexually provocative behavior, express strong emotions with an impressionistic style, and can be easily influenced by others. Associated features can include egocentrism, self-indulgence, continuous longing for appreciation, and persistent manipulative behavior to achieve their own wants.

== Signs and symptoms ==
People diagnosed with HPD may be dramatic. They often fail to see their own personal situation realistically, instead dramatizing and exaggerating their difficulties. Patients with this disorder can have rapidly shifting emotions and a decreased ability to recognize the emotions of others. Their emotions may appear superficial or exaggerated to others. This disorder is associated with extraversion, a lower tolerance for frustration or delayed gratification, and openness to new experiences. People with HPD may have little self-doubt and often appear egocentric.

Research has also shown those with histrionic personality have a greater desire for social approval and reassurance and will constantly seek it out, making those with HPD more vulnerable to social media addiction. People with this disorder often display excessive sensitivity to criticism or disapproval. They will work hard to get others to pay attention to them, possibly as a method of testing the stability of relationships. They may enjoy situations in which they can be the center of attention, and may feel uncomfortable when people are not paying attention to them. People with this disorder may wear flamboyant clothing, try body modifications, and fake medical conditions in an attempt to draw others&#x27; attention. They may be inappropriately sexually provocative, flirtatious, or exploitative. Sexually suggestive and exhibitionist behavior are also behaviors people with this condition sometimes exhibit, and are more likely to seek out casual sexual relationships. Some people with histrionic traits or personality disorder change their seduction technique into a more parental style as they age. When their desire for attention is not met, it can heighten the severity of their symptoms.

Patients with HPD are usually high-functioning, both socially and professionally. They usually have good social skills, despite tending to use them to make themselves the center of attention. HPD may also affect a person&#x27;s social and romantic relationships, as well as their ability to cope with losses or failures. People with HPD tend to consider relationships closer than they usually are. They may seek treatment for clinical depression when romantic (or other close personal) relationships end. Substance disorders, such as alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder, are all common in patients with histrionic personality disorder. They are also at higher risks of suicide, body dysmorphia (a preoccupation with perceived flaws in one&#x27;s physical appearance), and divorce. They may go through frequent job changes, as they become easily bored and may prefer withdrawing from frustration (instead of facing it). Because they tend to crave novelty and excitement, they may place themselves in risky situations. All of these factors may lead to greater risk of developing clinical depression. People with this condition can have an impressionistic and undetailed style of speech.

Despite these traits, they can be prideful of their own personality, and may be unwilling to change, viewing any change as a threat. They may even blame their personal failures or disappointments on others.

== Causes ==
Little research has been done to find evidence of what causes histrionic personality disorder. Although direct causes are inconclusive, various theories and studies suggest multiple possible causes, of a neurochemical, genetic, psychoanalytic, or environmental nature. Traits such as extravagance, vanity, and seductiveness of hysteria have similar qualities to women diagnosed with HPD. HPD symptoms typically do not fully develop until late teens or early 20s, while the onset of treatment only occurs, on average, at approximately 40 years of age.

Although 80% of diagnosed cases are in females, it may be equally prevalent among men. Little is known about how this disorder affects males, but it is thought to be more difficult to detect in men. 

=== Authoritarian parenting ===
Authoritarian or distant attitudes, usually by the mother but sometimes both parents, may result in children developing this disorder later in life.
Psychoanalytic theories incriminate authoritarian or distant attitudes by one (mainly the mother) or both parents, along with conditional love based on expectations the child can never fully meet. Using psychoanalysis, Freud believed that lustfulness was a projection of the patient&#x27;s lack of ability to love unconditionally and develop cognitively to maturity, and that such patients were overall emotionally shallow. He believed the reason for being unable to love could have resulted from a traumatic experience, such as the death of a close relative during childhood or divorce of one&#x27;s parents, which gave the wrong impression of committed relationships. Exposure to one or multiple traumatic occurrences of a close friend or family member&#x27;s leaving (via abandonment or mortality) could make the person unable to form true and affectionate attachments towards other people.

=== Neurochemical/physiological ===
Studies have shown that there is a strong correlation between the function of certain hormones, neurotransmitters and the Cluster B personality disorders such as HPD. This seems to be especially evident with respect to the catecholamines. Individuals diagnosed with HPD have a highly responsive noradrenergic system, which is responsible for the synthesis, storage, and release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. High levels of norepinephrine lead to anxiety-proneness, dependency, novelty seeking, and high sociability.

=== Genetic ===
Twin studies have aided in breaking down the genetic vs. environment debate. A twin study conducted by the Department of Psychology at the University of Oslo attempted to establish a correlation between genetics and Cluster B personality disorders. With a test sample of 221 twins, 92 monozygotic and 129 dizygotic, researchers interviewed the subjects using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders (SCID-II) and concluded that there was a correlation of 0.67 that histrionic personality disorder is hereditary.

=== HPD and antisocial personality disorder ===
Another theory suggests a possible relationship between histrionic personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Research has found 2/3 of patients diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder also meet criteria similar to those of the antisocial personality disorder, which suggests both disorders based towards sex-type expressions may have the same underlying cause.

Some family history studies have found that histrionic personality disorder, as well as antisocial and borderline personality disorders, tend to run in families, but it is unclear how much is due to genetic versus environmental factors. Both examples suggest that predisposition could be a factor as to why certain people are diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder, however little is known about whether or not the disorder is influenced by any biological compound or is genetically inheritable. Little research has been conducted to determine the biological sources, if any, of this disorder.

== Diagnosis ==
The person&#x27;s appearance, behavior and history, along with a psychological evaluation, are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis. There is no test to confirm this diagnosis. Because the criteria are subjective, some people may be wrongly diagnosed.

=== DSM 5 ===
The current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM 5, defines histrionic personality disorder (in Cluster B) as:

The DSM 5 requires that a diagnosis for any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria.

=== ICD-10 ===
The World Health Organization&#x27;s ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder (F60.4) as:

It is a requirement of ICD-10 that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfy a set of general personality disorder criteria.

=== Comorbidity ===
Most histrionics also have other mental disorders. Comorbid conditions include: antisocial, dependent, borderline, and narcissistic personality disorders, as well as depression, anxiety disorders, panic disorder, somatoform disorders, anorexia nervosa, substance use disorder and attachment disorders, including reactive attachment disorder.

=== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ===
In 2000, Theodore Millon suggested six subtypes of histrionic personality disorder. Any individual histrionic may exhibit one or more of the following:
== Treatment ==
Treatment is often prompted by depression associated with dissolved relationships. Medication does little to affect the personality disorder, but may be helpful with symptoms such as depression. Treatment for HPD itself involves psychotherapy, including cognitive therapy.

=== Interviews and self-report methods ===
In general clinical practice with assessment of personality disorders, one form of interview is the most popular: an unstructured interview. The actual preferred method is a semi-structured interview but there is reluctance to use this type of interview because they can seem impractical or superficial. The reason that a semi-structured interview is preferred over an unstructured interview is that semi-structured interviews tend to be more objective, systematic, replicable, and comprehensive. Unstructured interviews, despite their popularity, tend to have problems with unreliability and are susceptible to errors leading to false assumptions of the patient.

One of the single most successful methods for assessing personality disorders by researchers of normal personality functioning is the self-report inventory following up with a semi-structured interview. A disadvantage to the self-report inventory method is that, with histrionic personality disorder, there is a distortion in character, self-presentation, and self-image. This means that most clients cannot be assessed by simply asking them if they match the criteria for the disorder. Most projective testing depends less on the ability or willingness of the person to provide an accurate description of the self, but there is currently limited empirical evidence on projective testing to assess histrionic personality disorder.

=== Functional analytic psychotherapy ===
Another way to treat histrionic personality disorder after identification is through functional analytic psychotherapy. The job of a Functional Analytic Psychotherapist is to identify the interpersonal problems with the patient as they happen in session or out of session. Initial goals of functional analytic psychotherapy are set by the therapist and include behaviors that fit the client&#x27;s needs for improvement. Functional analytic psychotherapy differs from the traditional psychotherapy due to the fact that the therapist directly addresses the patterns of behavior as they occur in-session.

The in-session behaviors of the patient or client are considered to be examples of their patterns of poor interpersonal communication and to adjust their neurotic defenses. To do this, the therapist must act on the client&#x27;s behavior as it happens in real time and give feedback on how the client&#x27;s behavior is affecting their relationship during therapy. The therapist also helps the client with histrionic personality disorder by denoting behaviors that happen outside of treatment; these behaviors are termed &quot;Outside Problems&quot; and &quot;Outside Improvements&quot;. This allows the therapist to assist in problems and improvements outside of session and to verbally support the client and condition optimal patterns of behavior&quot;. This then can reflect on how they are advancing in-session and outside of session by generalizing their behaviors over time for changes or improvement&quot;.

=== Coding client and therapist behaviors ===
In these sessions there is a certain set of dialogue or script that can be forced by the therapist for the client to give insight on their behaviors and reasoning&quot;. Here is an example; the conversation is hypothetical. T = therapist C = Client. This coded dialogue can be transcribed as:

* ECRB – Evoking clinically relevant behavior
** T: Tell me how you feel coming in here today (CRB2) C: Well, to be honest, I was nervous. Sometimes I feel worried about how things will go, but I am really glad I am here.
* CRB1 – In-session problems
** C: Whatever, you always say that. (becomes quiet). I don&#x27;t know what I am doing talking so much.
* CRB2 – In-session improvements
* TCRB1 – Clinically relevant response to client problems
** T: Now you seem to be withdrawing from me. That makes it hard for me to give you what you might need from me right now. What do you think you want from me as we are talking right now?&quot;.
* TCRB2 – Responses to client improvement
** T: That&#x27;s great. I am glad you&#x27;re here, too. I look forward to talking to you.

==== Functional ideographic assessment template ====
Another example of treatment besides coding is functional ideographic assessment template. The functional ideographic assessment template, also known as FIAT, was used as a way to generalize the clinical processes of functional analytic psychotherapy. The template was made by a combined effort of therapists and can be used to represent the behaviors that are a focus for this treatment. Using the FIAT therapists can create a common language to get stable and accurate communication results through functional analytic psychotherapy at the ease of the client; as well as the therapist.

== Epidemiology ==
The survey data from the National epidemiological survey from 2001 to 2002 suggests a prevalence of HPD of 1.84 percent. Major character traits may be inherited, while other traits may be due to a combination of genetics and environment, including childhood experiences. This personality is seen more often in women than in men. Approximately 65% of HPD diagnoses are women while 35% are men. In Marcie Kaplan&#x27;s &quot;A Women&#x27;s View of DSM-III&quot;, she argues that women are overdiagnosed due to potential biases and expresses that even healthy women are often automatically diagnosed with HPD. It has also been argued due to diagnostic bias that prevalence rates are equal among women and men.

Many symptoms representing HPD in the DSM are exaggerations of traditional feminine behaviors. In a peer and self-review study, it showed that femininity was correlated with histrionic, dependent and narcissistic personality disorders. Although it has typically been found that at least two thirds of HPD diagnoses are female, there have been a few exceptions. Whether or not the rate will be significantly higher than the rate of women within a particular clinical setting depends upon many factors that are mostly independent of the differential sex prevalence for HPD. Those with HPD are more likely to look for multiple people for attention, which leads to marital problems due to jealousy and lack of trust from the other party. This makes them more likely to become divorced or separated once married. With few studies done to find direct causations between HPD and culture, cultural and social aspects play a role in inhibiting and exhibiting HPD behaviors.

<doc id="181641" wikidata="Q1098590" url="?curid=181641" title="Monastic grange">
<text>Monastic granges were outlying landholdings held by monasteries independent of the manorial system. The first granges were owned by the Cistercians, and other orders followed. Wealthy monastic houses had many granges, most of which were largely agricultural providing food for the monastic community. A grange might be established adjacent to the monastery, but others were established wherever it held lands, some at a considerable distance. Some granges were worked by lay-brothers belonging to the order, others by paid labourers.

Granges could be of six known types: agrarian; sheep runs; cattle ranges and holdings; horse studs; fisheries; industrial complexes. Industrial granges were significant in the development of medieval industries, particularly iron working.

==Description==
Granges were landed estates used for food production, centred on a farm and out-buildings and possibly a mill or a tithe barn. The word &quot;grange&quot; comes through French from Latin , meaning a granary. The granges might be located at some distance. They could farm livestock or produce crops. Specialist crops might include apples, hops or grapes to make beverages. Some granges had fish-ponds to supply Friday meals to the monastery. The produce could sustain the monks or be sold for profit. While under monastic control, granges might be run by a steward and worked by local farm labourers or perhaps lay brothers.

==England==
At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, all monastic land was seized by Henry VIII. The lands were sold or given to Henry&#x27;s followers. Granges often retained their names and many can still be found in the British landscape today.

<doc id="181649" wikidata="Q684106" url="?curid=181649" title="Dornier Do 215">
<text>The Dornier Do 215 was a light bomber, aerial reconnaissance aircraft and later a night fighter, produced by Dornier originally for export, but in the event most served in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Like its predecessor, the Dornier Do 17, it inherited the title &quot;The Flying Pencil&quot; because of its slim fuselage. The successor of the Do 215 was the Do 217.

==Design and development==
The Do 17 fast bomber elicited renewed interest from foreign air forces (after the initial Do 17K series production). It was the interest shown by Yugoslavia in the Do 17Z which gave rise to the designation Dornier Do 215, allotted for no apparent reason to the Do 17Z sent to Yugoslavia for demonstration purposes in July 1937.

Dornier therefore prepared a pre-series Do 17 Z-0 as a demonstrator for export customers. It was given the civil registration D-AAIV. While this aircraft was essentially identical to the production Do 17Z, the assigned the designation Do 215 to the export version. However, in spite of the Do 215 being designated as an export version, many Do 215s were used by the Luftwaffe.

The first prototype, Do 215 V1, retained the nine-cylinder Bramo 323 &quot;Fafnir&quot; radial engine of the Do 17Z. It crashed during testing. The second prototype, Do 215 V2, was equipped with the Gnome-Rhône 14-NO radial engine. It safely completed testing, but did not attract export orders because it did not offer a notable performance increase over the Do 17Z. The third prototype, Do 215 V3, used a 1,175 PS (1,159 hp) Daimler-Benz DB 601 Ba inline engine. In 1937, Dornier had used the earlier Daimler-Benz DB 600 powerplants in the Do 17L and Do 17M subtypes. The Do 215 V3, which first flew in the spring of 1939, demonstrated a noticeable improvement in flight performance compared to the earlier prototypes.

Series production of the Do 215 A-1 began in 1939. The order, intended for the Swedish Air Force, was stopped in August 1939, due to the political situation. The 18 extant aircraft were embargoed and pressed into &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service upon the outbreak of World War II.

Some modifications were made and the resulting aircraft were redesignated as Do 215 B-0 through Do 215 B-5. This was the standard production version. According to official figures, 105 Do 215s were produced between 1939 and 1941 by Dornier in its factory at Oberpfaffenhofen.

==Operational history==
The Do 215 was employed by the &quot;Aufklärungsgruppe des Oberbefelshabers der Luftwaffe&quot; (Aufk.Gr.Ob,d,L.) which was a special, strategic reconnaissance unit within the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, operating a very rare mix of aircraft types, often prototypes or aircraft built to their special requirements in very limited numbers. They flew on clandestine missions in civil markings over countries with whom Germany was not yet at war, or on challenging long-range strategic missions far behind enemy lines. This unit would also participate in developing technology and procedures for operational high-altitude missions.
The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; initially operated the Do 215 as a bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. Aircraft equipped with Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 cameras were used for long-range reconnaissance missions, primarily at the Ob.d.L (). Later aircraft operated as night fighters. The last of the Do 215s were retired in late 1944.

==Variants==

;Do 215 V1: Dornier Do 17 Z-0 used as first prototype of Do 215 and crashed during trials.
;Do 215 V2: Dornier Do 17 Z-0 (D-AIIB) equipped with Gnome-Rhône 14-cylinder radial engines and used as second prototype of Do 215.
;Do 215 V3: Third prototype of Do 215, equipped with Daimler-Benz DB 601Ba inline engines.
;Do 215 A-1: Designation of original 18 aircraft built for Swedish Air Force order.
;Do 215 B-0: Three aircraft of A-1 version re-equipped for &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with FuG 10 and operated for bomber/reconnaissance duties.
;Do 215 B-1: Renamed remaining 15 aircraft of A-1 version operated by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.
;Do 215 B-2: Rebuilt with sliding cover under bomb bay and equipped with three Rb 50/30 cameras in bomb bay used for reconnaissance missions.
;Do 215 B-3: Two aircraft similar to B-1 sold to Soviet Union.
;Do 215 B-4: Improved reconnaissance version developed from B-2 version and equipped with Rb 20/30 &amp; Rb 50/30 cameras.
;Do 215 B-5: Night fighter version called Kauz III. 20 aircraft converted from B-1 and B-4 versions with Do 17 Z-10 &quot;Kauz II&quot; nose-equipped with IR searchlight for the Spanner infrared detection system. Do 215 B-5s were armed with four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20 mm MG FF cannon in the lower nose. The Spanner system proved to be useless and the Lichtenstein 202 B/C radar was installed on some aircraft starting from the middle of 1942.

Of the versions of the Do 215 that existed, the A-1 bomber with DB 601 engines, and the B-0 and B-1 export machines were both re-equipped with FuG 10 navigation devices for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The Do 215 B-5 was the first night fighter to be equipped with the FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C navigation device. These aircraft saw action from January 1941 to May 1944 with I. and IV./NJG 1 and II./NJG 2.

==Operators==

;Wartime operators:
* &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;
* Royal Hungarian Air Force operated at least 11 aircraft.
* Soviet Air Force bought two aircraft from Germany.

;Planned operators:
* Swedish Air Force ordered 18 Do 215 A-1s but the aircraft were embargoed and transferred to the Luftwaffe.
* Yugoslav Royal Air Force ordered Do 215s, but due to the start of World War II the order was never completed.
* In summer 1939 the Luchtvaartafdeeling (Netherlands Army Air Force) planned to buy 24 to replace the Fokker T.V which suffered reliability problems with its engines and propellers.

==Surviving aircraft==
Until recently, none of the Dornier twin-engined bomber variants were thought to have survived. In September 2007, a Dornier Do 215 B was found largely intact in the shallow waters of the Waddenzee, the Netherlands. This aircraft was flown by a Luftwaffe fighter ace Helmut Woltersdorf. On the night of 6/7 July 1941, Woltersdorf shot down a Vickers Wellington, but his Dornier was damaged by return fire and crash-landed off the Dutch Coast. The area where the Dornier came down was named as a seal sanctuary and thus it escaped the attentions of scrap merchants and souvenir hunters. At low tide the aircraft becomes visible.

The Aircraft Recovery Group from the Airwar Museum at Fort Veldhuis in Heemskerk received permission to partially recover the Do 215. The only missing part of the aircraft is the tail section which lies to the rear of the main wreckage. The Daimler-Benz DB 601 engines were recovered along with the starboard portion of the cockpit.

<doc id="181651" wikidata="Q153965" url="?curid=181651" title="Joseph Beuys">
<text>Joseph Heinrich Beuys ( , ; 12 May 1921 – 23 January 1986) was a German artist, teacher, performance artist, and art theorist whose work reflected concepts of humanism and sociology. With Heinrich Böll, , Caroline Tisdall, Robert McDowell, and Enrico Wolleb, Beuys created the Free International University for Creativity &amp; Interdisciplinary Research (FIU). Through his talks and performances, he also formed The Party for Animals and The Organisation for Direct Democracy. He was a member of a Dadaist art movement Fluxus and singularly inspirational in developing of Performance Art, called Kunst Aktionen, alongside Wiener Aktionismus that Allan Kaprow and Carolee Schneemann termed Art Happenings. Today, internationally, the largest performance art group is BBeyond in Belfast, led by Alastair MacLennan who knew Beuys and like many adapts Beuys&#x27;s ethos.

Beuys is known for his &quot;extended definition of art&quot; in which the ideas of social sculpture could potentially reshape society and politics. He frequently held open public debates on a wide range of subjects, including political, environmental, social, and long-term cultural issues.

Beuys&#x27; social sculpture proposals and underpinning ideas have been extensively explored, shared and developed through the practices, pedagogies, actions and writings of his master student and collaborator Shelley Sacks, first in South Africa in the 1970s as a branch of the Free International University (FIU); in the first Social Sculpture Colloquium, hosted by the Goethe Institute in Glasgow (1995); from 1997-2018 as Professor in Social Sculpture in the Social Sculpture Research Unit (SSRU) at Oxford Brookes University, where Johannes Stüttgen, Caroline Tisdall and Volker Harlan were research fellows; and since 2021, through the Social Sculpture Lab, curated by Sacks and hosted by the Documenta Archive in 2021 for the Beuys Centenery. The Social Sculpture Lab continues to engage with, develop and share Beuys&#x27; social sculpture understandings through such initiatives as the 7000 HUMANS Global Social Forest. which has close connections with Beuys&#x27; 7000 Oaks, Sacks&#x27; social sculpture-connective practice methodologies, and a growing network of Social Sculpture Hubs in Germany, India, Holland, Brazil and UK.

Beuys was professor at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1961 until 1972. He was a founding member and life-long supporter of the German Green Party.

==Biography==
=== Childhood and early life in the Third Reich (1921–1941) ===
Joseph Beuys was born in Krefeld, Germany, on 12 May 1921, to Josef Jakob Beuys (1888–1958), a merchant, and Johanna Maria Margarete Beuys née Hülsermann (1889–1974). Soon after his birth, the family moved from Krefeld to Kleve, an industrial town in Germany&#x27;s Lower Rhine region, close to the Dutch border. Beuys attended primary school at the &quot;Katholische Volksschule&quot; and secondary school at the &quot;Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve&quot; (now the &quot;Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium&quot;). While in school he developed skills in drawing and took lessons in piano and cello. Other interests included the natural sciences, as well as Nordic history and mythology. By his own account, when the Nazi Party staged their book-burning in Kleve on 19 May 1933 in his school courtyard, he salvaged the book &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Carl Linnaeus &quot;... from that large, flaming pile&quot;.

In 1936, Beuys was a member of the Hitler Youth; the organization at that time included a large majority of German children and adolescents, and later that year membership became compulsory. He participated in the Nuremberg rally in September 1936. He was 15 years old at the time.

Given his early interest in natural sciences, Beuys had considered a career in medical studies, but in his last years of school he became interested in pursuing a career in sculpture, possibly influenced by pictures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck&#x27;s sculptures. In around 1939 he began working part-time at a circus, where his responsibilities included posturing and taking care of animals. He held the job for about a year. He graduated from school in the spring of 1941, having successfully earned his &quot;Abitur&quot;.

=== World War II (1941–1945) ===
Although he finally opted for a career in medicine, in 1941, Beuys volunteered for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, and began training as an aircraft radio operator under the tutelage of Heinz Sielmann in Posen, Poland (now Poznań). They both attended lectures on biology and zoology at the University of Posen, at that time a Germanized university. During this time he began to consider pursuing a career as an artist.

In 1942, Beuys was stationed in the Crimea and was a member of various combat bomber units. From 1943 onward, he was deployed as rear-gunner in a Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bomber, initially stationed in Königgrätz, later moving to the eastern Adriatic region. Drawings and sketches from this time have been preserved, and his characteristic style is evident in this early work. 
On 16 March 1944, Beuys&#x27;s plane crashed on the Crimean Front close to Znamianka, then Freiberg Krasnohvardiiske Raion. Drawing from this incident, Beuys fashioned the myth that he was rescued from the crash by nomadic Tatar tribesmen, who wrapped his broken body in animal fat and felt and nursed him back to health:

&quot;Had it not been for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man&#x27;s land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good relationship with them and often wandered off to sit with them. &#x27;Du nix njemcky&#x27; they would say, &#x27;du Tartar,&#x27; and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts ... My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That&#x27;s how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying &#x27;Voda&#x27; (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat, and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in.&quot;

Records state that Beuys remained conscious, was recovered by a German search commando, and that there were no Tatars in the village at the time. Beuys was brought to a military hospital where he stayed for three weeks, from 17 March to 7 April. It is consistent with Beuys&#x27; work that his biography would have been subject to his own reinterpretation; this particular story has served as a powerful origin myth for Beuys&#x27;s artistic identity, and has provided an initial interpretive key to his use of unconventional materials, amongst which felt and fat were central.

Despite prior injuries, he was deployed to the Western Front in August 1944, assigned to a poorly-equipped and trained paratrooper unit. He received a gold Wound Badge for having been wounded in action over five times. On the day after the German unconditional surrender (8 May 1945), Beuys was taken prisoner in Cuxhaven and brought to a British internment camp from which he was released three months later, on 5 August. He returned to his parents who had moved to a suburb of Kleve.

=== Studies and beginnings (1945–1960) ===

After returning to Kleve, Beuys met local sculptor Walter Brüx and painter Hanns Lamers, who encouraged him to take up art as a full-time career. He joined the Kleve Artists Association, which had been established by Brüx and Lamers. On 1 April 1946, Beuys enrolled in the monumental sculpture program at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts. Initially he was assigned to the class of Joseph Enseling, who had a more traditional, representational focus, but he managed to change his mentor after three semesters, joining the small class of Ewald Mataré in 1947, who had rejoined the academy the previous year, after having been banned by the Nazis in 1939. The anthroposophical philosophy of Rudolf Steiner became an increasingly important basis for Beuys&#x27;s philosophy. In his view it is &quot;...an approach that refers to reality in a direct and practical way, and that by comparison, all forms of epistemological discourse remain without direct relevance to current trends and movements.&quot; Reaffirming his interest in science, Beuys re-established contact with Heinz Sielmann, and assisted with a number of nature- and wildlife documentaries in the region between 1947 and 1949.

In 1947 Beuys, along with other artists (including Hann Trier), founded the group &#x27;Donnerstag-Gesellschaft&#x27; (&quot;Thursday Group&quot;). The group organised discussions, exhibitions, events and concerts between 1947 and 1950 in Alfter Castle.

In 1951, Mataré accepted Beuys into his master class where he shared a studio with Erwin Heerich, that he kept until 1954, a year after graduation. Nobel laureate Günter Grass recollects Beuys&#x27;s influence in Mataré&#x27;s class as shaping &quot;a Christian anthroposophic atmosphere&quot;. He read Joyce, impressed by the &quot;Irish-mythological elements&quot; in his works, the German romantics Novalis and Friedrich Schiller, and studied Galileo and Leonardo, whom he admired as examples of artists and scientists who are conscious of their position in society and who work accordingly. Early shows include participation in the Kleve Artists Association annual exhibition in Kleve&#x27;s Villa Koekkoek, where Beuys showed aquarelles and sketches, a solo show at the home of and in Kranenburg as well as a show in the Von der Heydt Museum in Wuppertal.

Beuys finished his education in 1953, graduating at age 32 as master student from Mataré&#x27;s class. He had a modest income from a number of craft-oriented commissions: a gravestone and several pieces of furniture. Throughout the 1950s, Beuys struggled both financially and from the trauma of his wartime experiences. His output consisted of drawings and sculptural work. Beuys explored a range of unconventional materials and developed his artistic agenda, exploring metaphorical and symbolic connections between natural phenomena and philosophical systems. Often difficult to interpret in themselves, his drawings constitute a speculative, contingent and hermetic exploration of the material world, myth and philosophy. In 1974, 327 drawings, the majority of which were made during the late 1940s and 1950s, were collected into a group entitled The Secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland (a reference to Joyce), and exhibited in Oxford, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Belfast.

In 1956, artistic self-doubt and material impoverishment led to a physical and psychological crisis, and Beuys entered a period of serious depression. He recovered at the house of his most important early patrons, the van der Grinten brothers, in Kranenburg. In 1958, Beuys participated in an international competition for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial. His proposal did not win and his design was never realised. In 1958, Beuys began a cycle of drawings related to Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Completed in around 1961, the six exercise books of drawings would constitute, Beuys declared, an extension of Joyce&#x27;s seminal novel. In 1959, Beuys married Eva Wurmbach. They had two children, Wenzel (born 1961) and Jessyka (born 1964).

=== Academia and public (1960–1975) ===
In 1961, Beuys was appointed professor of monumental sculpture at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. His students were artists Anatol Herzfeld, Katharina Sieverding, Jörg Immendorff, Blinky Palermo, Peter Angermann, Walter Dahn, , Sigmar Polke and Friederike Weske. His youngest student was Elias Maria Reti who began to study art in his class at the age of 15.

Beuys entered wider public consciousness in 1964, when he participated in a festival at the Technical College Aachen which coincided with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. Beuys created a performance or action () which was interrupted by a group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic CV, which he titled &quot;Lebenslauf/Werklauf&quot; (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist&#x27;s life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the &#x27;Exhibition of a wound;&#x27; he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out &#x27;at James Joyce&#x27;s request&#x27; – impossible, given that the writer was long dead by 1961). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys&#x27; self-created persona.

Beuys manifested his social philosophical ideas in abolishing entry requirements to his Düsseldorf class. Throughout the late 1960s, this renegade policy caused great institutional friction, coming to a head in October 1972 when Beuys was dismissed from his post. That year, he found 142 applicants who had not been accepted whom he wished to enroll under his teaching. Beuys and 16 students subsequently occupied the offices of the academy to force a hearing regarding their admission. They were admitted by the school, but the relationship between Beuys and the school was irreconcilable. He again occupied the university offices with a group of students; the police were called and he was escorted laughing from the building. This was depicted in a photograph which was used to create a 1973 silkscreen print with the title &quot;Democracy Is Funny&quot;. Shortly after, he was dismissed from his post. The dismissal, which Beuys refused to accept, produced a wave of protests from students, artists and critics. Although now without an institutional position, Beuys continued an intense schedule of public lectures and discussions, and became increasingly active in German politics. Despite this dismissal, the walkway on the academy&#x27;s side of the Rhine is named for Beuys. Later in life, Beuys became a visiting professor at various institutions (1980–1985).
===Teaching philosophy===
&quot;The most important discussion is epistemological in character,&quot; stated Beuys, demonstrating his desire for continuous intellectual exchange. Beuys attempted to apply philosophical concepts to his pedagogical practice. Beuys&#x27;s action, &quot;How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare&quot;, exemplifies a performance that is especially relevant to the pedagogical field because it addresses &quot;the difficulty of explaining things&quot;. The artist spent three hours explaining his art to a dead hare with his head covered with honey and gold leaf, and Ulmer argues not only that the honey on the head but the hare itself are models of thinking, of man embodying his ideas in forms. Contemporary movements such as performance art may be considered &#x27;laboratories&#x27; for a new pedagogy since &quot;research and experiment have replaced form as the guiding force&quot;.

During an &quot;Artforum&quot; interview with Willoughby Sharp in 1969, Beuys added to his famous statement – &quot;teaching is my greatest work of art&quot; – that &quot;the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourself you must present something tangible. But after a while this has only the function of a historic document. Objects aren&#x27;t very important any more. I want to get to the origin of matter, to the thought behind it.&quot; Beuys saw his role of an artist as a teacher or shaman who could guide society in a new direction.

At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did not impose his artistic style or techniques on his students; in fact, he kept much of his work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys&#x27;s actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality and the need for students to take draftsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to conform to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys&#x27;s pedagogy was open &quot;ring discussions&quot; or , where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of his ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that &quot;everyone [was] an artist.&quot; Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys&#x27;s students enjoyed the open discourse of the , others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder and anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.

Beuys also advocated taking art outside of the boundaries of the (art) system and opening it up to multiple possibilities, bringing creativity into all areas of life. His nontraditional and anti-establishment pedagogical practice and philosophy made him the focus of much controversy, and to battle the policy of &quot;restricted entry&quot;, under which only a few select students were allowed to attend art classes, he deliberately allowed students to over-enroll in his courses (Anastasia Shartin), true to his belief those who have something to teach and those who have something to learn should come together.

===The artist as shaman===

According to Cornelia Lauf (1992), &quot;in order to implement his idea, as well as a host of supporting notions encompassing cultural and political concepts, Beuys crafted a charismatic artistic persona that infused his work with mystical overtones and led him to be called &quot;shaman&quot; and &quot;messianic&quot; in the popular press.&quot;

Beuys had adopted shamanism not only as a presentation mode of his art but also in his own life. Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated &quot;his art and his life into the shaman role.&quot; Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate emotions and thus eliminate a major source of energy and creativity. In his first lecture tour in America he espoused that humanity was in an evolving state and that as &quot;spiritual&quot; beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to our thinking powers so that &quot;our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.&quot;

Beuys saw his performance art as shamanistic and psychoanalytic to both educate and heal the general public.

&quot;It was thus a strategic stage to use the shaman&#x27;s character but, subsequently, I gave scientific lectures. Also, at times, on one hand, I was a kind of modern scientific analyst, on the other hand, in the actions, I had a synthetic existence as shaman. This strategy aimed at creating in people an agitation for instigating questions rather than for conveying a complete and perfect structure. It was a kind of psychoanalysis with all the problems of energy and culture.&quot;

Beuys&#x27;s art was considered both instructive and therapeutic – &quot;His intention was to use these two forms of discourse and styles of knowledge as pedagogues.&quot; He used shamanistic and psychoanalytic techniques to &quot;manipulate symbols&quot; and affect his audience.
In his personal life, Beuys had adopted a felt hat, a felt suit, a cane and a vest as his standard look. The imagined story of him being rescued by Tartar herdsmen perhaps is an explanation for his adopting materials such as felt and fat.

Beuys experienced severe depression between 1955 and 1957. After recovering, he observed at the time that &quot;his personal crisis&quot; caused him to question everything in life, and he called the incident &quot;a shamanistic initiation.&quot; He saw death not only in its inevitability for people, but also death in the environment, and through his art and his political activism, he became a strong critic of environmental destruction. He said at the time, &quot;I don&#x27;t use shamanism to refer to death, but vice versa – through shamanism, I refer to the fatal character of the times we live in. But at the same time I also point out that the fatal character of the present can be overcome in the future.&quot;

=== National and international recognition (1975–1986) ===

The only major retrospective of Beuys work to be organised in Beuys&#x27;s lifetime opened at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 1979. The exhibition has been described as a &quot;lightning rod for American criticism,&quot; eliciting as it did some powerful and polemical responses.

=== Death ===
Beuys died of heart failure on 23 January 1986, in Düsseldorf.

==Body of work==

Beuys&#x27;s extensive body of work principally comprises four domains: works of art in a traditional sense (painting, drawing, sculpture and installations), performance, contributions to the theory of art and academic teaching, and social and political activities.

=== Artworks and performances ===
In 1962, Beuys befriended his Düsseldorf colleague Nam June Paik, a member of the Fluxus movement. This began what was to be a brief formal involvement with Fluxus, a loose international group of artists who championed radical erosion of artistic boundaries, bringing aspects of creative practice outside of the institution and into the everyday. Although Beuys participated in a number of Fluxus events, it soon became clear that he viewed the implications of art&#x27;s economic and institutional framework differently. Indeed, whereas Fluxus was directly inspired by the radical Dada activities emerging during the First World War, Beuys in a 1964 broadcast (from the Second German Television Studio) a different message: &quot;&quot; (&#x27;The silence of Marcel Duchamp is overrated&#x27;). Beuys&#x27;s relationship with the legacy of Duchamp and the readymade is a central (if often unacknowledged) aspect of the controversy surrounding his practice.

On 12 January 1985, Beuys, together with Andy Warhol and Kaii Higashiyama, became involved in the &quot;Global-Art-Fusion&quot; project. This was a fax art project, initiated by the conceptual artist Ueli Fuchser, in which faxes with drawings of all three artists were sent within 32 minutes around the world – from Düsseldorf (Germany) via New York (USA) to Tokyo (Japan), and received at Vienna&#x27;s Palais-Liechtenstein Museum of Modern Art. This fax event was a sign of peace during the Cold War in the 1980s.

===&quot;How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare&quot; (performance, 1965)===
Beuys&#x27;s first solo exhibition in a private gallery opened on 26 November 1965 with one of his most famous performances: &quot;How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare&quot;. The artist could be viewed through the glass of the gallery&#x27;s window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, and an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he uttered muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings lining the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys sits with the hare, has been described &quot;by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century,&quot; though Beuys disagreed with the description.

Beuys explained his performance this way:
&quot;In putting honey on my head I am clearly doing something that has to do with thinking. Human ability is not to produce honey, but to think, to produce ideas. In this way the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again. For honey is undoubtedly a living substance. Human thinking can be lively too. But it can also be intellectualized to a deadly degree, and remain dead, and express its deadliness in, say, the political or pedagogic fields. Gold and honey indicate a transformation of the head, and therefore, naturally and logically, the brain and our understanding of thought, consciousness and all the other levels necessary to explain pictures to a hare: the warm stool insulated with felt ... and the iron sole with the magnet. I had to walk on this sole when I carried the hare round from picture to picture, so along with the strange limp came the clank of iron on the hard stone floor—that was all that broke the silence, since my explanations were mute ... This seems to have been the action that most captured people&#x27;s imaginations. On one level this must be because everyone consciously or unconsciously recognizes the problem of explaining things, particularly where art and creative work are concerned, or anything that involves a certain mystery or question. The idea of explaining to an animal conveys a sense of the secrecy of the world and of existence that appeals to the imagination. Then, as I said, even a dead animal preserves more powers of intuition than some human beings with their stubborn rationality.

The problem lies in the word &#x27;understanding&#x27; and its many levels, which cannot be restricted to rational analysis. Imagination, inspiration, and longing all lead people to sense that these other levels also play a part in understanding. This must be the root of reactions to this action, and is why my technique has been to try and seek out the energy points in the human power field, rather than demanding specific knowledge or reactions on the part of the public. I try to bring to light the complexity of creative areas.&quot;

Beuys produced many such spectacular, ritualistic performances, and he developed a compelling persona whereby he took on a liminal, shamanistic role, as if to enable passage between different physical and spiritual states. Further examples of such performances include: &quot;&quot; (1967), &quot;Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony&quot; (1970), and &quot;I Like America and America Likes Me&quot; (1974).

===&quot;The Chief – Fluxus Chant&quot; (performance, installation, 1963–1964)===
&quot;The Chief&quot; was first performed in Copenhagen in 1963 and in Berlin in 1964. Beuys positioned himself on the gallery floor wrapped entirely in a large felt blanket, and remained there for nine hours. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt, fat, hair, and fingernails. Inside the blanket Beuys held a microphone into which he breathed, coughed, groaned, grumbled, whispered and whistled at irregular intervals, with the results amplified by a PA system as viewers observed from the doorway.

In her book on Beuys, Caroline Tisdall wrote that &quot;The Chief&quot; &quot;is the first performance in which the rich vocabulary of the next fifteen years is already suggested,&quot; and that its theme is &quot;the exploration of levels of communication beyond human semantics, by appealing to atavistic and instinctual powers.&quot; Beuys stated that his presence in the room &quot;was like that of a carrier wave, attempting to switch off my own species&#x27; range of semantics.&quot; He also said: &quot;For me &quot;The Chief&quot; was above all an important sound piece. The most recurring sound was deep in the throat and hoarse like the cry of the stag...This is a primary sound, reaching far back. ... The sounds I make are taken consciously from animals. I see it as a way of coming into contact with other forms of existence beyond the human one. It&#x27;s a way of going beyond our restricted understanding to expand the scale of producers of energy among co-operators in other species, all of whom have different abilities[.]&quot; Beuys also acknowledged the physical demands of the performance. &quot;It takes a lot of discipline to avoid panicking in such a condition, floating empty and devoid of emotion and without specific feelings of claustrophobia or pain, for nine hours in the same position ... such an action ... changes me radically. In a way it&#x27;s a death, a real action and not an interpretation.&quot;

Writer Jan Verwoert noted that Beuys&#x27; &quot;voice filled the room, while the source was nowhere to be found. The artist was the focus of attention, yet remained invisible, rolled up in a felt blanket throughout the duration of the event...visitors were...forced to stay in the neighboring room. They could see what was happening but remained barred from direct physical access to the event. The partial closing-off of the performance space from the audience space created distance, and at the same time increased the attraction of the artist&#x27;s presence. He was present acoustically and physically as part of a piece of sculpture, but also absent, invisible, untouchable[.]&quot; Verwoert suggests that &quot;The Chief&quot; &quot;can be read as a parable of cultural work in a public medium. The authority of those who dare — or are so bold as — to speak publicly results from the fact that they isolate themselves from the gaze of the public, under the gaze of the public, in order to still address it in indirect speech, relayed through a medium. What is constituted in this ceremony is authority in the sense of authorship, in the sense of a public voice...Beuys stages the creation of such a public voice as an event that is as dramatic as it is absurd. He thus asserts the emergence of such a voice as an event. At the same time, however, he also undermines this assertion through the lamentably powerless form by which this voice is produced: in emitting half-smothered inarticulate sounds that would have remained inaudible without electronic amplification.&quot; Lana Shafer Meador wrote: &quot;Inherent to &quot;The Chief&quot; were issues of communication and transformation ... For Beuys, his own muffled coughs, breaths, and grunts were his way of speaking for the hares, giving a voice to those who are misunderstood or do not possess their own...In the midst of this metaphysical communication and transmission, the audience was left out in the cold. Beuys deliberately distanced the viewers by physically positioning them in a separate gallery room — only able to hear, but not see what is occurring — and by performing the action for a grueling nine hours.&quot;

===&quot;Infiltration Homogen for Piano&quot; (performance, 1966)===
Beuys performed in Düsseldorf in 1966. The result was a piano covered entirely in felt with two crosses made of red material affixed to its sides. Beuys wrote: &quot;The sound of the piano is trapped inside the felt skin. In the normal sense a piano is an instrument used to produce sound. When not in use it is silent, but still has a sound potential. Here no sound is possible and the piano is condemned to silence.&quot; He also said, &quot;The relationship to the human position is marked by the two red crosses signifying emergency: the danger that threatens if we stay silent and fail to make the next evolutionary step...Such an object is intended as a stimulus for discussion, and in no way is to be taken as an aesthetic product.&quot; During the performance he also used wax earplugs and drew and wrote on a blackboard.

The piece is subtitled &quot;The greatest composer here is the thalidomide child&quot;, and attempts to bring attention to the plight of children affected by the drug. (Thalidomide was a sleep aid introduced in the 1950s in Germany. It was promoted to help relieve the symptoms of morning sickness and was prescribed in unlimited doses to pregnant women. However, it quickly became apparent that Thalidomide caused death and deformities in some children of mothers who had taken the drug. It was on the market for less than four years. In Germany around 2,500 children were affected.) During his performance, Beuys held a discussion about the tragedy surrounding Thalidomide children.

Beuys also prepared &quot;Infiltration Homogens for Cello&quot;, a cello wrapped in grey felt with a red cross attached, for musician Charlotte Moorman, who performed it in conjunction with Nam June Paik.

Caroline Tisdall noted how, in this work, &quot;sound and silence, exterior and interior, are ... brought together in objects and actions as representatives of the physical and spiritual worlds.&quot; Australian sculptor Ken Unsworth wrote that &quot;Infiltration&quot; &quot;became a black hole: instead of sound escaping, sound was drawn into it ... It wasn&#x27;t as if the piano was dead. I realised Beuys identified felt with saving and preserving life.&quot; Artist Dan McLaughlin wrote of the &quot;quiet absorptive silencing of an instrument capable of an infinity of expressions The power and potency of the instrument is dressed, swaddled even, in felt, legs and all, and creates a clumsy, pachyderm-like metaphor for a kind of silent entombment. But it is also a power incubated, protected and storing potential expressions ... pieces like &quot;Infiltration&quot; showcase the intuitive power Beuys had, understanding that some materials had invested in them human language and human gesture through use and proximity, through morphological sympathy.&quot;

===&quot;I Like America and America Likes Me&quot; (performance, 1974)===
Art historian considers this performance pivotal for the reception of German avant-garde art in the United States since it paved the way for recognition of not only Beuys&#x27; own work but also that of contemporaries such as Georg Baselitz, Kiefer, Lüpertz, and many others in the 1980s. In May 1974, Beuys flew to New York and was taken by ambulance to the site of the performance, a room in the René Block Gallery at 409 West Broadway. Beuys lay on the ambulance stretcher swathed in felt. He shared this room with a coyote for eight hours over three days. At times he stood, wrapped in a thick, grey blanket of felt, leaning on a large shepherd&#x27;s staff. At times he lay on the straw, at times he watched the coyote as the coyote watched him and cautiously circled the man or shredded the blanket to pieces, and at times he engaged in symbolic gestures, such as striking a large triangle or tossing his leather gloves to the animal; the performance continuously shifted between elements that were required by the realities of the situation and elements that had a purely symbolic character. At the end of the three days, Beuys hugged the coyote that had grown quite tolerant of him and was taken to the airport. Again he rode in a veiled ambulance, leaving America without having set foot on its ground. As Beuys later explained: &#x27;I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.&#x27;

In 2013, Dale Eisinger of &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;I Like America and America Likes Me&quot; the second greatest work of performance art ever, after &quot;Pandrogeny&quot; by Genesis P-Orridge.

===&quot;Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony&quot;, &quot;Celtic+&quot;, &quot;Agnus Vitex Castus&quot; and &quot;Three Pots for The Poorhouse&quot; (performances 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973)===
Richard Demarco invited Beuys to Scotland in May 1970 and again in August to show and perform in the Edinburgh International Festival with Günther Uecker, Blinky Palermo and other Düsseldorf artists plus Robert Filliou where they took over the main spaces of the Edinburgh College of Art. The exhibition was a defining moment for British and European art, directly influencing several generations of artists and curators.

In Edinburgh in 1970, Beuys created ARENA for Demarco as a retrospective of his art up to that time, showed his installation &quot;&quot; and performed &quot;Celtic Kinloch Rannoch&quot; with Henning Christiansen and in support, seen by several thousands. This was Beuys&#x27; first use of blackboards and the beginning of nine trips to Scotland to work with Richard Demarco, and six to Ireland and five to England, working mainly with art critic Caroline Tisdall and Troubled Image Group artist Robert McDowell and others in the detailed formulation of the Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research (FIU) presented at documenta 6 in 1977, in London in 1978 and Edinburgh in 1980, as well as in many other iterations.

In Edinburgh, at the end of the 1970s the FIU became among four organisations that founded the German Green Party. Beuys became entranced by the periphery of Europe as a dynamic counter in cultural and economic terms to Europe&#x27;s centralisation, and this included linking Europe&#x27;s energies North-South to Italy and East-West in the Eurasia concept, with special emphasis on Celtic traditions in landscape, poetry, and myths that also define Eurasia. In his view anything that survives as art and ideas and beliefs, including the great religions for centuries or millennia, contain eternal truths and beauty. The truth of ideas and of &#x27;thinking as form&#x27;, the sculpture of energies across a wide and variegated spectrum from mythos and spirituality to materialism, Socialism and Capitalism, and of &#x27;creativity = capital&#x27; encompassed for him the study of geology, botany, and animal life, finding meanings and precepts in all of these as much as in the study of society, philosophy and the human condition, and in his art practice as &#x27;Social Sculpture&#x27;.

He adopted and developed a Gestalt way to examine and work with both organic and inorganic substances and human social elements, following Leonardo, Loyola, Goethe, Steiner, Joyce, and many other artists, scientists and thinkers, working with all visible and invisible aspects comprising a totality of cultural, moral and ethical significance as much as practical or scientific value. These trips inspired many works and performances. Beuys considered Edinburgh with its Enlightenment history as a laboratory of inspirational ideas. When visiting Loch Awe and Rannoch Moor on his May 1970 visit to Demarco he first conceived the necessity of the &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot; work. After making the Loch Awe sculpture, at Rannoch Moor he began what became the &quot;Celtic (Kinlock Rannoch) Scottish Symphony&quot; performance, developed further in Basel the next year as &quot;Celtic+&quot;. The performance in Edinburgh included his first blackboard that later appeared in many performances when in discussion with the public. With it and his Eurasian staff he is a transmitter and, despite long periods of imperturbable stillness interspersed by Christiansen&#x27;s &#x27;sound sculptures&#x27;, he also creates dialogue evoking artists&#x27; thoughts and in discussion with spectators. He collected gelatin representing crystalline stored energy of ideas that had been spread over the wall. In Basel the action including washing the feet of seven spectators. He immersed himself in water with reference to Christian traditions and baptism and symbolized revolutionary freedom from false preconceptions.

He then, as in Edinburgh, pushed a blackboard across the floor alternately writing or drawing on it for his audience. He put each piece in a tray and as the tray became full he held it above his head and convulsed, causing the gelatin to fall on him and the floor. He followed this with a quiet pause. He stared into emptiness for over half an hour, fairly still in both performances. During this time, he had a lance in his hand and was standing by the blackboard where he had drawn a grail. He took a protective stance. After this he repeated each action in the opposite order, ending with the washing with water as a final cleansing. The performances were filled with Celtic symbolism with various interpretations or historic influences. This extended in 1972 with the performance &quot;Vitex Agnus Castus&quot; in Naples, of combining female and male elements and evoking much else, and extended further with &quot;I Like America and America Likes Me&quot; to have a performance dialogue with the original energy of America represented by the endangered yet highly intelligent coyote.

In 1974, in Edinburgh, Beuys worked with Buckminster Fuller in Demarco&#x27;s &#x27;Black &amp; White Oil Conference&#x27;, where Beuys talked of &#x27;The Energy Plan of the Western Man&#x27; using blackboards in open discussion with audiences at Demarco&#x27;s Forrest Hill Schoolhouse. In the 1974 Edinburgh Festival, Beuys performed &quot;Three Pots for the Poorhouse&quot; again using gelatin in Edinburgh&#x27;s ancient poorhouse, continuing the development begun with &quot;Celtic Kinloch Rannoch&quot;. He met there Tadeusz Kantor directing &quot;Lovelies and Dowdies&quot; and was at Marina Abramović&#x27;s first ever performance. In 1976, Beuys performed &quot;In Defence of the Innocent&quot; at the Demarco Gallery where he stood for the imprisoned gangster and sculptor Jimmy Boyle in a manner associating Boyle with the coyote. In 1980 Edinburgh Festival Beuys was at the FIU exhibition and performed &quot;Jimmy Boyle Days&quot; (the name of the blackboards he used in public discussions), and where he went on a hunger strike as a public protest and led with others in a legal action against the Scottish Justice system. This was the first case under the new European Human Rights Act. The eight performances should be understood as one continuum.

=== The concept of &quot;Social Sculpture&quot; ===

During the 1960s Beuys formed his central theoretical concepts about arts&#x27; social, cultural and political function and potential. Indebted to Romantic writers like Novalis and Schiller, Beuys was motivated by a belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident about the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the body of social ideas of Rudolf Steiner, known as Social Threefolding, of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys&#x27;s devising the concept of social sculpture, in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys&#x27;s most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is &quot;Everyone is an artist&quot;). In the video &quot;Willoughby SHARP,&quot; Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues&quot; (1974/120 min.)&quot;, a record of Beuys&#x27;s first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful. In 1973, Beuys wrote:

&quot;Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build &#x27;A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART&#x27; ... EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER.&quot;

In 1982, he was invited to create a work for documenta 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in a stone&#x27;s new location. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation is perpetuating his project and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones, too.

Beuys said that:
My point with these seven thousand trees was that each would be a monument, consisting of a living part, the live tree, changing all the time, and a crystalline mass maintaining its shape, size, and weight. This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument&#x27;s two parts will never be the same.

=== &quot;Sonne Statt Reagan&quot; ===
In 1982, Beuys recorded a music video for a song he had written entitled &quot;Sonne statt Reagan&quot; which translates to &quot;Sun, not Rain/Reagan&quot;, an anti-Reagan political piece that included some German puns and reinforced some key messages of Beuys&#x27;s career (at least, after his days as a soldier) – namely, a liberal, pacifist political attitude, a desire to perpetuate open discourse about art and politics, a refusal to sanctify his own image and &#x27;artistic reputation&#x27; by only doing the kinds of work other people expected he would do, and above all an openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the &#x27;art world&#x27; was never more clear than it is here.

Beuys made it clear that he regarded this song as a work of art, not the &quot;pop&quot; product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. This becomes clearer when one reads the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the &quot;Cold War&quot; to make it &quot;Hot.&quot; The song is perhaps best understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan &quot;et al.&quot; that the peace-loving masses are behind him, including Americans as well. Some discourse about Beuys by those who consider his body of artwork sacrosanct has avoided &quot;Sonne statt Reagan&quot;, regarding the video as an outlier, even to be ridiculed. Yet by choosing the vehicle of popular music, Beuys showed commitment to his views and to engage a broad means to have them reach people.

=== &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot; ===

Among Beuys&#x27;s more ambitious pieces of social sculpture was the &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot; project, one of enormous scope which met with some controversy.

=== Political activities ===
Amongst other things, Beuys founded (or co-founded) the following political organisations: German Student Party (1967), Organization for Direct Democracy Through Referendum (1971), Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research (1974), and German Green Party Die Grünen (1980). Beuys became a pacifist and a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons; he campaigned for environmental causes (in fact he was elected as a Green Party candidate for the European Parliament). Some of his art directly addressed the political issues of the day among groups with which he affiliated. His song and music video &quot;Sun Instead of Reagan&quot; (1982) expresses the theme of regeneration (optimism, growth, hope) running through his life and work as well as his interest in contemporary nuclear politics: &quot;But we want: sun instead of Reagan, to live without weapons! Whether West, whether East, let missiles rust!&quot;

==Critiques==
The Guggenheim retrospective and catalogue offered a comprehensive view of Beuys&#x27;s practice and rhetoric to an American critical audience. Although for some time he had been a central figure in the post-war European artistic consciousness, his work to that point had had only fleeting and partial exposure among American audiences. In 1980, building on scepticism voiced by Belgian artist Marcel Broodthaers, who in a 1972 Open Letter had compared Beuys to Wagner, art historian Benjamin Buchloh (who was teaching at Staatliche Kunstakademie, just like Beuys) launched a polemically forceful attack on Beuys. The essay was a vitriolic and extensive critique of both Beuys&#x27;s rhetoric (referred to as &quot;simple-minded utopian drivel&quot;) and persona (Buchloh regards Beuys as both infantile and messianic).

First, Buchloh notes Beuys&#x27; fictionalisation of his own biography, which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency to disavow past trauma and retreat into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh critiques Beuys for failing to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and their implications. Buchloh then criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage with the consequences of the work of Marcel Duchamp, in particular, a failure to acknowledge the framing function of the art institution and the inevitable dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art&#x27;s power to foster political transformation, Buchloh asserts that Beuys nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks which, he asserts, may serve somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead tried to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, often through dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh&#x27;s critique has been expounded upon by commentators like Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.

===Rehabilitation===
Buchloh&#x27;s critique has been subject to revision. His attention is given to dismantling a mythologized artistic persona and utopian rhetoric, which he regarded to be irresponsible. Since Buchloh&#x27;s essay was published, however, much new archival material has come to light, most significantly Beuys&#x27; proposal for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial, submitted in 1958. Some argue that the existence of such a project invalidates Buchloh&#x27;s claim that Beuys retreated from engaging with the Nazi legacy, a point that Buchloh himself has acknowledged, although the charges of romanticism and self-mythologizing remain.

Beuys&#x27; charisma and eclecticism may have polarized some of his audience. His work has attracted admirers and devotees, some who may uncritically accept Beuys&#x27; own explanations as interpretive solutions to his work. In contrast, some of those in Buchloh&#x27;s camp charge Beuys&#x27; with weak rhetoric and arguments and dismiss his work as bogus. Relatively few accounts have addressed works themselves, with the exception of scholarship from art historians like Gene Ray, Claudia Mesch, Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes, Briony Fer, Alex Potts, and others. The drive here has been to separate Beuys&#x27; work from his rhetoric, and to explore both wider discursive formations within which Beuys operated (this time, productively), and the physical properties of the works themselves.

Examples of contemporary artists who have drawn from the legacy of Beuys include AA Bronson, former member of the artists&#x27; collaborative General Idea, who, not without irony, adopts the subject position of the shaman to reclaim art&#x27;s restorative, healing powers; Andy Wear whose installations are deliberately formed according to the Beuysian notion of &#x27;stations&#x27; and are (in particular, referencing the Block Beuys in Darmstadt) essentially a constellation of works performed or created external to the installation; and Peter Gallo, whose drawing cycle &quot;I wish I could draw like Joseph Beuys&quot; features stretches of Beuys&#x27; writings combined with images traced from vintage gay pornography onto random pieces of paper.

Additionally, the counter-institution of the FIU or Free International University, initiated by Beuys, continues as a publishing concern (FIU Verlag) and has active chapters in German cities including Hamburg, Munich, and Amorbach.

==Exhibitions and collections==

Franz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten organized Beuys&#x27;s first solo show at their house in Kranenburg in 1953. The Alfred Schmela Galerie was the first commercial gallery to hold a Beuys solo exhibition in 1965. Beuys participated for the first time in documenta in Kassel in 1964. In 1969, he was included in Harald Szeemann&#x27;s groundbreaking exhibition &quot;When Attitudes Become Form&quot; at the Kunsthalle Bern.

The 1970s were marked by numerous major exhibitions throughout Europe and the United States. In 1970, a large collection of Beuys&#x27;s work formed under the artist&#x27;s own aegis, the Ströher Collection, was installed in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt, which remains the most important public collection of his work. Pontus Hultén invited him to exhibit at Moderna Museet in 1971. Beuys exhibited and performed at each documenta Kassel, most notably with &quot;The Honeypump at the FIU Workplace&quot; in 1977 and with &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot; in 1982. He showed four times at the Edinburgh International Festival and represented Germany at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and 1980. In 1980, Beuys took part in a meeting with Alberto Burri at the Rocca Paolina in Perugia, curated by Italo Tomassoni. During his performance, Beuys explained &quot;Opera Unica&quot;: six blackboards then purchased by the municipality of Perugia and now housed in the Museo civico di Palazzo della Penna in Perugia. A retrospective of his work was held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in 1979. In 1984, Beuys visited Japan and showed various works, including installations and performances, while also holding discussions with students and giving lectures. His first Beuys exhibition took place at the Seibu Museum of Art in Tokyo that same year. The DIA Art Foundation held exhibitions of Beuys&#x27; work in 1987, 1992, and 1998, and has planted trees and basalt columns in New York City as part of his &quot;7,000 Oaks&quot;, echoing his planting of 7,000 oaks each with a basalt stone, a project begun in 1982 for Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany. Large collections of his multiples are held by Harvard University, the Walker Art Center Minneapolis, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which also has a collection of Beuys vitrines, The Schellmann and D&#x27;Offey collections. Most of the Marx collection of Beuys works including &quot;The secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland&quot; drawings is at The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum, Berlin. Major art museums in Germany have Beuys works including Fond III at Landesmuseum Darmstadt, while Moechengladbach Museum has the Poor House Doors and much more. Beuys also gave a large collection to the Solidarinosc Movement in Poland. Feuerstätte I und Feuerstätte II (Hearth I and Hearth II) and other works are at the Museum for Contemporary Art Basel, and a dedicated museum was created for &#x27;The Museum des Geldes&#x27; collection mainly of FIU blackboards from Documenta 6. As well, perennial Beuys exhibitions continue to take place around the world.

==Art market==
The first works Franz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten bought from Joseph Beuys in 1951 cost about €10 each in 2021 currency. Beginning with small woodcuts, they purchased about 4,000 works, creating the largest Beuys collection in the world. In 1967, the &#x27;Beuys Block&#x27;, a group of first works, was purchased by the collector Karl Ströher in Darmstadt (now part of the Hessisches Landesmuseum).

Beuys&#x27; artworks have fluctuated in price in the years since his death, sometimes even failing to reach bid minimums. A bronze sculpture titled &quot;Bett&quot; (&quot;Corsett,&quot; 1949/50) sold for US$900,000 (hammer price) at Sotheby&#x27;s New York in May 2008, a record. His &quot;Schlitten&quot; (&quot;Sled&quot;, 1969) sold for $314,500 at Phillips de Pury &amp; Company, New York, in April 2012. At the same auction, a &quot;Filzanzug&quot; (&quot;Felt Suit,&quot; 1970) sold for $96,100. This surpassed the previous auction record for a &quot;Filzanzug&quot;, 62,000 euros (US$91,381.80) at Kunsthaus Lempertz (Cologne, Germany) in November 2007. Details and prices of Beuys&#x27;s works sold at auction are listed by Artsy.

The artist produced over 600 original multiples in his lifetime. Large sets of multiples are in the collections of the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, Germany, Harvard University Art Museums in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and the Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany. In 2006, the Broad Art Foundation in Los Angeles acquired 570 multiples by Beuys, including a &quot;Filzanzug&quot; and a &quot;Schlitten&quot;, thereby becoming the most complete collection of Beuys works in the United States and among the largest collections of Beuys multiples in the world.

<doc id="181653" wikidata="Q13339" url="?curid=181653" title="Mohawk language">
<text>Mohawk () or (&quot;[language] of the Flint Place&quot;) is an Iroquoian language currently spoken by around 3,500 people of the Mohawk nation, located primarily in current or former Haudenosaunee territories, predominately Canada (southern Ontario and Quebec), and to a lesser extent in the United States (western and northern New York). The word &quot;Mohawk&quot; is an exonym. In the Mohawk language, the people say that they are from (&#x27;Mohawk Country&#x27; or &quot;Flint Stone Place&quot;) and that they are &quot;People of the Flint Stone Place&quot; or &quot;People of the Flint Nation&quot;.

The Mohawks were extremely wealthy traders, as other nations in their confederacy needed their flint for tool-making. Their Algonquian-speaking neighbors (and competitors), the People of &quot;Muh-heck Heek Ing&quot; (&quot;food-area place&quot;), a people called by the Dutch &quot;Mohicans&quot; or &quot;Mahicans&quot;, called the People of Ka-nee-en Ka &quot;Maw Unk Lin&quot; or &quot;Bear People&quot;. The Dutch heard and wrote that as &quot;Mohawks&quot; and so the People of Kan-ee-en Ka are often referred to as &quot;Mohawks&quot;. The Dutch also referred to the Mohawk as &quot;Egils&quot; or &quot;Maquas&quot;. The French adapted those terms as &quot;Aigniers&quot; or &quot;Maquis&quot;, or called them by the generic &quot;Iroquois&quot;.

==History==
The Mohawks were the largest and most powerful of the original Five Nations, controlling a vast area of land on the eastern frontier of the Iroquois Confederacy. The North Country and Adirondack region of present-day Upstate New York would have constituted the greater part of the Mohawk-speaking area lasting until the end of the 18th century.

==Current status==

The Mohawk language is currently classified as threatened, and the number of native speakers has continually declined over the past several years.

Mohawk has the largest number of speakers among the Northern Iroquoian languages, and today it is the only one with more than a thousand remaining speakers. At Akwesasne, residents have founded a language immersion school (pre-K to grade 8) in &quot;Kanienʼkéha&quot; to revive the language. With their children learning it, parents and other family members are taking language classes, too.

The radio station CKON-FM (97.3 on-air in Hogansburg, New York and Saint Regis, Quebec and widely available online through streaming), licensed by the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation, broadcasts portions of its programming in &quot;Kanienʼkéha&quot;. The call sign is a reference to the Mohawk word &quot;sekon&quot; (or &quot;she:kon&quot;), which means &quot;hello&quot;.

A Mohawk language immersion school was established. Mohawk parents, concerned with the lack of culture-based education in public and parochial schools, founded the Akwesasne Freedom School in 1979. Six years later, the school implemented a Mohawk language immersion curriculum based on a traditional cycle of fifteen seasonal ceremonies, and on the Mohawk Thanksgiving Address, or Ohén꞉ton Karihwatékwen, &quot;The words before all else.&quot; Every morning, teachers and students gather in the hallway to recite the Thanksgiving Address in Mohawk.

An adult immersion program was also created in 1985 to address the issue of intergenerational fluency decline of the Mohawk language.

Kanatsiohareke (Gah-nah-jo-ha-lay-gay), meaning &quot;Place of the clean pot&quot;, is a small Mohawk community on the north bank of the Mohawk River, west of Fonda, New York.[1] Kanatsiohareke was created to be a &quot;Carlisle Indian Boarding School in Reverse&quot;, teaching Mohawk language and culture.[2] Located at the ancient homeland of the Kanienkehaka (Mohawk), it was re-established in September 1993 under the leadership of Thomas R. Porter (Sakokwenionkwas-&quot;The One Who Wins&quot;).[3] The community must raise their own revenue and frequently hold cultural presentations, workshops, and academic events, including an annual Strawberry Festival.[4] A craft shop on site features genuine handmade Native crafts from all over North America.

The primary mission of the community is to try to preserve traditional values, culture, language and lifestyles in the guidance of the &quot;Kaienerekowa&quot; (Great Law of Peace).[5] Kanatsiohareke, Inc. is a non-profit organization under IRS code 501c3.

In 2006, over 600 people were reported to speak the language in Canada, many of them elderly.

Kahnawake is located at a metropolitan location, near central Montreal, Quebec, Canada. As Kahnawake is located near Montreal, many individuals speak both English and French, and this has contributed to a decline in the use of Mohawk language over the past century. The Mohawk Survival School, the first immersion program was established in 1979. The school&#x27;s mission was to revitalize Mohawk language. To examine how successful the program had been, questionnaire was given to the Kahnawake residents following the first year. The results indicated that teaching towards younger generation have been successful and showed an increase in the ability to speak the language in private settings, as well as an increase in the mixing of Mohawk in English conversations were found.

===Current number of speakers===
In 2011, there were approximately 3,500 speakers of Mohawk, primarily in Quebec, Ontario and western New York. Immersion (monolingual) classes for young children at Akwesasne and other reserves are helping to train new first-language speakers. The importance of immersion classes among parents grew after the passage of Bill 101, and in 1979 the Mohawk Survival School was established to facilitate language training at the high school level.
 Kahnawake and Kanatsiohareke offer immersion classes for adults. In the 2016 Canadian census, 875 people said Mohawk was their only mother tongue.

===Usage in popular culture===
Mohawk dialogue features prominently in Ubisoft Montreal&#x27;s 2012 action-adventure open world video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, through the game&#x27;s main character, the half-Mohawk, half-Welsh Ratonhnhaké꞉ton, also called Connor, and members of his native Kanièn꞉ke village around the times of the American Revolution. Ratonhnhaké꞉ton was voiced and modelled by Crow actor Noah Bulaagawish Watts. Hiawatha, the leader of the Iroquoian civilization in &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;, voiced by Kanentokon Hemlock, speaks modern Mohawk.

The stories of Mohawk language learners are also chronicled in &#x27;Raising The Words&#x27;, a short documentary film released in 2016 that explores personal experiences with Mohawk language revitalization in Tyendinaga, a Mohawk community roughly 200 kilometres east of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The film was set to be shown at the 4th annual Ethnografilm festival in Paris, France.

The Mohawk language is used in the 2017 film &quot;Mohawk&quot;, the 1991 film &quot;Black Robe&quot;, and the 2020 television series &quot;Barkskins&quot;.

The language was used throughout in the Marvel Studios animated series &quot;What If...?&quot;, in the season 2 episode &quot;What If... Kahhori Reshaped the World?&quot;, where they introduce an original Mohawk superhero named Kahhori.

==Dialects==
Mohawk has three major dialects: Western ( and ), Central (), and Eastern ( and ); the differences between them are largely phonological. These are related to the major Mohawk territories since the eighteenth century. The pronunciation of and several consonant clusters may differ in the dialects.
==Phonology==

The phoneme inventory of Mohawk is as follows (using the International Phonetic Alphabet).

===Consonants===
A typologically uncommon feature of Mohawk (and Iroquoian) phonology is that there are no labials (m, p, b, f, v), except in a few adoptions from French and English, where and appear (e.g., &quot;matches&quot; and &quot;Abraham&quot;); these sounds are late additions to Mohawk phonology and were introduced after widespread European contact.

====Consonant clusters====
The Central () dialect has the following consonant clusters. 
All clusters can occur word-medially; those on a tinted background can also occur word-initially.

Note that /th/ and /sh/ are pronounced individually in consonant clusters, &quot;not&quot; single sounds like in English ⟨th⟩ and ⟨sh⟩ in &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;she&quot;.

====Consonant voicing====
The consonants and the clusters are pronounced voiced before any voiced sound (i.e. a vowel or ). They are voiceless at the end of a word or before a voiceless sound. is voiced word initially and between vowels.

: &quot;car&quot;
: &quot;that&quot;
: &quot;still&quot;

===Vowels===
Mohawk has oral and nasalized vowels; four vowel qualities occur in oral phonemes , and two only occur as nasalized vowels (). Vowels can be long or short.

===Suprasegmentals===
==== Stress, length, and tone ====

Mohawk words have both stress and tone, and it can be classified as a restricted tone system (aka pitch-accent system). Stressed vowels carry one of four tonal configurations, two of which are contour tones: high, low, rising and falling tones. Contour tones only occur in syllables with long vowels.
*High tone usually appears in closed syllables containing a short vowel, or before . It is written with an acute accent: , .
*Rising tone generally occurs in open syllables. It is written with a combination acute accent and colon: /kaˈnáːta/ , /ˈrṹːkwe/ . Notice that when it is one of the nasal vowels which is long, the colon appears after the .
*Long-falling tone is the result of the word stress falling on a vowel which comes before a or + a consonant (there may be, of course, exceptions to this and other rules). The underlying or reappears when stress is placed elsewhere. It is written with a grave accent and colon: .

== Orthography ==

Mohawk orthography was standardized in 1993. The orthography uses the following letters: ⟨Aa Ee Hh Ii Kk Ll Nn Rr Ss Tt Ww Yy⟩ and . It uses diacritics for tone, stress, and vowel duration, along with three digraphs: ⟨ts en on⟩ for /d͡ʒ ʌ̃ ũ/, respectively. 

The standard allows for some variation of how the language is represented, and the clusters , , and are written as pronounced in each community. The orthography matches the phonological analysis as above except:
*The glottal stop is written with an apostrophe , but is often omitted at the end of words, especially in Eastern dialect where it is typically not pronounced.
**Written in the Eastern dialect (reflecting pronunciation), as in &quot;seven&quot;.
**Written in the Central dialect, as in &quot;seven&quot;.
**Written in the Western dialect, as in &quot;seven&quot;.
**Typically written with in the Central and Eastern dialects, as in &quot;six&quot;.
**Typically written with a in the Western dialect, as in &quot;six&quot;.
*The nasalized vowel is written as , as in &quot;one&quot;.
*The nasalized vowel is written , as in &quot;eight&quot;.
*In cases where the vowel or is followed by an in the same syllable, the is written with an under-macron diacritic: &quot;I am closing a door&quot;. If the did not have the diacritic, the sequence would be pronounced . Another convention is to write the nasal vowel with an ogonek, e.g. .
The low-macron accent is not a part of standard orthography and is not used in the Central or Eastern dialects. In standard orthography, is written before to create the or : &#x27;I am closing it&#x27;.

==Grammar==
Mohawk words tend to be longer on average than words in English, primarily because they consist of a large number of morphemes.

Mohawk expresses a number of distinctions on its pronominal elements: person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), number (singular, dual, plural), gender (masculine, feminine/indefinite, feminine/neuter) and inclusivity/exclusivity on the first person dual and plural. Pronominal information is encoded in prefixes on the verbs; separate pronoun words are used for emphasis. There are three main paradigms of pronominal prefixes: subjective (with dynamic verbs), objective (with stative verbs), and transitive.

There are three core components to the Mohawk proposition: the noun, the predicate, and the particle.

Mohawk words can be composed of many morphemes. What is expressed in English in many words can often be expressed by just one Mohawk word, a phenomenon known as polysynthesis.

===Nouns===
Nouns are given the following form in Mohawk:

Noun prefixes give information relating to gender, animacy, number and person, and identify the word as a noun.

For example:

1) oʼnenste &quot;corn&quot;

2) oienʼkwa &quot;tobacco&quot;

Here, the prefix &quot;o-&quot; is generally found on nouns found in natural environments. Another prefix exists which marks objects that are made by humans.

3) kanhoha &quot;door&quot;

4) kaʼkhare &quot;slip, skirt&quot;

Here, the prefix &quot;ka-&quot; is generally found on human-made things. Phonological variation amongst the Mohawk dialects also gives rise to the prefix &quot;ga-&quot;.

Noun roots are similar to nouns in English in that the noun root in Mohawk and the noun in English have similar meanings.

(Caughnawaha)

5) –eri- &quot;heart&quot;

6) –hi- &quot;river&quot;

7) –itshat- &quot;cloud&quot;

These noun roots are bare. There is no information other than the noun root itself. Morphemes cannot occur individually. That is, to be well-formed and grammatical, &quot;-eri-&quot; needs pronominal prefixes, or the root can be incorporated into a predicate phrase.

Nominal suffixes are not necessary for a well-formed noun phrase. The suffixes give information relating to location and attributes. For example:

Locative Suffix:

8) i. onuʼtaʼ &quot;hill&quot;

ii. onutaʼke &quot;on the hill&quot;

9) i. onekwvhsaʼ &quot;blood&quot;

ii. onekwvhsaʼke &quot;in the blood&quot;

Here the suffix &lt; -ke &gt; denotes location.

Attributive Suffix:

10) kvjyʼ &quot;fish&quot;

11) kvjaʼkoʼwa &quot;sturgeon&quot; or &quot;big fish&quot;

Here, the suffix &quot;-koʼwa&quot; denotes an augmentative suffix, which increases the attribute of the noun in question.

===Verbs===
Mohawk verbs are one of the more complex parts of the language, composed of many morphemes that describe grammatical relations. The verb takes the following structure:

Mohawk grammar allows for whole prepositions to be expressed by one word, which we classify as a verb. The other core elements (subjects, objects, etc.) can be incorporated into the verb. Well-formed verb phrases contain at the bare minimum a verb root and a pronominal prefix. The rest of the elements are not necessary.

Tense, aspect and modality are expressed via suffixes on the verb phrase as well.

Some examples:

This is composed of three parts; the pronominal prefix, the verb root and a suffix which marks aspect. Mohawk seems to prefer aspect markers to tense to express grammaticalisation in time.

This example shows multiple prefixes that can be affixed to the verb root, but certain affixes are forbidden from coexisting together. For example, the aorist and the future tense affix will not be found on the same well-formed sentence.



Here, different prefixes and suffixes are used that mark tense, aspect and modality.

Most grammatical relations in Mohawk are expressed through various different affixes onto a verb. Subjects, objects, and relationships between subjects and objects are given their own affixes. In Mohawk, each transitive relationship between subjects and objects are given their own prefix. For example:



Each of these affixes are denoting a transitive relationship between two things. There are more affixes for denoting transitive relationships like &quot;we-they&quot;, they-us (inclusive/exclusive), etc.

===Noun incorporation===

One of the features of Mohawk called &quot;noun incorporation&quot; allows a verb to absorb a noun into it. When incorporation happens, an epenthetic &quot;a&quot; can appear between the noun root and the verb root. For example:

With noun incorporation:



Most of these examples take the epenthetic vowel &quot;a&quot;; it can be omitted if the incorporated noun does not give rise a complex consonant cluster in the middle of the word.

==Education==
Six Nations Polytechnic in Ohsweken, Ontario, offers Ogwehoweh language diploma and degree programs in Mohawk or Cayuga.

Since September 2017, the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Offers a credit course in Mohawk; the classes are given at Renison University College in collaboration with the Waterloo Aboriginal Education Centre, St. Paul&#x27;s University College.

<doc id="181657" wikidata="Q854036" url="?curid=181657" title="Lady of the Lake">
<text>The Lady of the Lake (, , , , ) is a title used by multiple characters in the Matter of Britain, the body of medieval literature and mythology associated with the legend of King Arthur. As either actually fairy or fairy-like yet human enchantresses, they play important roles in various stories, notably by providing Arthur with the sword Excalibur, eliminating the wizard Merlin, raising the knight Lancelot after the death of his father, and helping to take the dying Arthur to Avalon after his final battle. Different Ladies of the Lake appear concurrently as separate characters in some versions of the legend since at least the Post-Vulgate Cycle and consequently the seminal &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, with the latter describing them as members of a hierarchical group, while some texts also give this title to either Morgan or her sister.

==Names and origins==
Today, the Lady of the Lake is best known as the character called either Nimue, or several scribal variants of Ninianne and Viviane. French and foreign medieval authors and copyists since the early 13th century produced various forms of the latter two, including: Nymenche (in addition to Ninianne / Ninienne) in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot;; Nim[i]ane and Ui[n/ui]ane (in addition to Viviane) in the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot; (Niniane in the version &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;); Nin[i]eve / Nivene / Niviène / Nivienne and Vivienne in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot; (Niviana in the Spanish &quot;Baladro del Sage Merlin&quot;); and Nimiane / Niniame and Vivian / Vivien in &quot;Arthour and Merlin&quot; and Henry Lovelich&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;. Further variations of these include alternate spellings with the letter &quot;i&quot; written as &quot;y&quot;, such as in the cases of Nymanne (Nimanne as in Michel le Noir&#x27;s &quot;Merlin&quot;) and Nynyane (Niniane). According to Lucy Paton, the most primitive French form of this name might have been Niniane. Danielle Quéruel of the Bibliothèque nationale de France explains:

The much later form Nimue, in which the letter &quot;e&quot; can be written as &quot;ë&quot; or &quot;é&quot;, was invented and popularized by Thomas Malory through his 15th-century English &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; and itself has several variations: her name appears as Nymue, Nyneue, Nyneve and Nynyue in William Caxton&#x27;s print edition, but it had been rather Nynyve (used predominantly) and Nenyve in Malory&#x27;s original Winchester Manuscript. Even though &#x27;Nymue&#x27; (with the &quot;m&quot;) appears only in the Caxton text, the modernized and standardized &#x27;Nimue&#x27; is now the most common form of the name of Malory&#x27;s character, as Caxton&#x27;s edition was the only version of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; published until 1947. Nimue is also sometimes rendered by modern authors and artists as either Nimüe and Nimuë, the forms introduced in the 19th century (in Tennyson&#x27;s poem and a painting by Burne-Jones, respectively), or Nimueh.

Arthurian scholar A. O. H. Jarman, following suggestions first made in the 19th century, proposed that the name Viviane used in French Arthurian romances, was ultimately derived from (and a corruption of) the Welsh word &quot;chwyfleian&quot; (also spelled &quot;hwimleian&quot; and &quot;chwibleian&quot; in medieval Welsh sources), meaning &quot;a wanderer of pallid countenance&quot;, which was originally applied as an epithet to the famous prototype of Merlin, a prophetic wild man figure Myrddin Wyllt in medieval Welsh poetry. Due to the relative obscurity of the word, it was misunderstood as &quot;fair wanton maiden&quot; and taken to be the name of Myrddin&#x27;s female captor. Others have linked the name Nymenche with the Irish mythology&#x27;s figure Niamh (an otherworldly woman from the legend of Tír na nÓg), and the name Niniane with the Welsh mythology&#x27;s figure Rhiannon (another otherworldly woman of a Celtic myth), or, as a feminine form of the masculine name Ninian, with the likes of the 5th-century (male) saint Ninian and the river Ninian.

Further theories connect her to the Welsh lake fairies known as the Gwragedd Annwn (including a Lady of the Lake unrelated to the legend of Arthur), the Celtic water goddess Covianna (worshipped in the Romano-British times as Coventina), and the Irish goddess of the underworld Bé Finn (Bébinn, mother of the hero Fráech). It has been also noted how the North Caucasian goddess Satana (Satanaya) from the Nart sagas is both associated with water and helps the Scythian hero Batraz gain his magic sword. Possible literary prototypes include two characters from Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;: Merlin&#x27;s one-time wife Guendoloena and Merlin&#x27;s half-sister Ganieda. Another possibility involves Diana, the Roman goddess of hunt and nature, a direct or spiritual descent from whom is actually explicitly attributed to Viviane within some French prose narratives, in which she is arguably even serving as Diana&#x27;s avatar. It has also been speculated that the name Viviane may be a derivative form of Diana (French &quot;Diane&quot;).

The mythical Greek sea nymph Thetis, mother of the hero Achilles, similarly provides her son with magical weapons. Like the Lady of the Lake, Thetis is a water spirit who raises the greatest warrior of her time. Thetis&#x27; husband is named Peleus, while in some tales the Lady of the Lake has the knight Pelleas as her lover; Thetis also uses magic to make her son invulnerable, similar to how Lancelot receives a ring that protects him from evil magic. The Greek myth may therefore have inspired or influenced the Arthurian legend, especially since &quot;The Iliad&quot; involving Thetis was well known across the former Roman Empire and among the medieval writers dealing with Celtic myths and lore. The Roman fort Aballava, known to the post-Roman Britons as Avalana and today seen by some as the location of the historical Avalon, had been also curiously dedicated the Roman water goddess Dea Latis. Laurence Gardner interpreted the supposed (as attributed by medieval authors) Biblical origins of Lancelot&#x27;s bloodline by noting the belief about Jesus&#x27; purported wife Mary Magdalene&#x27;s later life in Gaul (today&#x27;s France) and her death at Aquae Sextiae; he identified her descendant as the 6th-century Comtess of Avallon named Viviane del Acqs (&quot;of the water&quot;), whose three daughters (associated with the mothers of Lancelot, of Arthur, and of Gawain) would thus become known as the &#x27;Ladies of the Lake&#x27;.

Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s French &quot;Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart&quot;, the first known story featuring Lancelot as a prominent character, was also the first to mention his upbringing by a fairy in a lake. If it is accepted that the Franco-German &quot;Lanzelet&quot; by Ulrich von Zatzikhoven contains elements of a more primitive version of this tale than Chrétien&#x27;s, the infant Lancelot was spirited away to a lake by a water fairy (&quot;merfeine&quot; in Old High German) known as the Lady of the Sea and then raised in her Land of Maidens (&quot;Meide lant&quot;). The fairy queen character and her paradise island in &quot;Lanzelet&quot; are reminiscent of Morgen (Morgan) of the Island of Avallon in Geoffrey&#x27;s work. Furthermore, the fairy from &quot;Lanzelet&quot; has a son whose name Mabuz is an Anglo-Norman form of Mabon, son of Morgan&#x27;s early Welsh counterpart Modron. According to Roger Sherman Loomis, &quot;it seems almost certain&quot; that Morgan and the Lady of the Lake have originally began as one character in the legend. In a related hypothesis, the early Myrddyn tradition could have merged with the fairy lover motif popular in medieval stories, and such role would later split into Merlin&#x27;s two fairy mistresses, one of them &#x27;good&#x27; and the other &#x27;bad&#x27;.

== Medieval legend ==
===Lancelot&#x27;s guardian===


Following her early, unnamed appearances in the 12th-century poems of Chrétien and Ulrich, the Lady of the Lake began being featured by this title in the French chivalric romance prose by the 13th century. As a fairy godmother-type foster mother of the hero Lancelot, she inherits the role of an unnamed aquatic fairy queen, her prototype in the earlier texts. However, while Ulrich&#x27;s &quot;Lanzelet&quot; uses the changeling part of the fairy abduction lore for the background of Lancelot as having been swapped with her son Mabuz, the figure of Lancelot&#x27;s supernatural foster mother has no offspring of her own in neither Chrétien&#x27;s &quot;Lancelot&quot; nor any of the later texts.

In the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) prose cycle, the Lady resides in an otherworldly enchanted realm, the entry to which is disguised as an illusion of a lake (the Post-Vulgate explains it as Merlin&#x27;s work). There, she raises Lancelot from his infancy having stolen him from his mother following the death of his father, King Ban. She teaches Lancelot arts and writing, infusing him with wisdom and courage, and overseeing his training to become an unsurpassed warrior. She also rears his orphaned cousins Lionel and Bors after having her sorcerous damsel Saraïde (later called Celise) rescue them from King Claudas. All this takes her only a few years in the human world. Afterwards, she sends off the adolescent Lancelot to King Arthur&#x27;s court as the nameless White Knight, due to her own affinity with the color white.

Through much of the Prose &quot;Lancelot Propre&quot;, the Lady keeps aiding Lancelot in various ways during his early adventures to become a famed knight and discover his true identity, usually acting through her maidens serving as her agents and messengers. She gives him her magical gifts, including a magic ring of protection against enchantments in a manner similar in that to his fairy protectoress in Chrétien&#x27;s poem (the same of another of her magic rings also grants Lancelot&#x27;s lover Queen Guinevere immunity from Morgan&#x27;s power in the Italian &quot;Prophéties de Merlin&quot;). Later on, she also works to actively encourage Lancelot and Guinevere&#x27;s relationship and its consummation. That includes sending Guinevere a symbolically illustrated magic shield, the crack in which closes up after the queen finally spends her first night with Lancelot. She furthermore personally arrives to restore Lancelot to sanity during some of his recurring periods of madness, on one occasion using the above-mentioned shield to heal his mind.

===Merlin&#x27;s beloved and captor===


The Vulgate Cycle is first to tell of either a different or the same Lady of the Lake in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;-derived section. It takes place before its main Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; section but was written later, linking her with the disappearance of Merlin from the romance tradition of Arthurian legend. She is given the name Viviane (or similar) and a human origin, although she is still being called a fairy. In the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, Viviane refuses to give Merlin (who at this time is already old but appears to her in the guise of a handsome young man) her love until he has taught her all his secrets, after which she uses her power to seal him by making him sleep forever. The Post-Vulgate revision changes it into Viviane causing Merlin&#x27;s death out of her hatred and fear of him. Though Merlin knows beforehand that this will happen due to his power of foresight, he is unable to counteract her because of the &#x27;truth&#x27; this ability of foresight holds. He decides to do nothing for his situation other than to continue to teach her his secrets until she takes the opportunity to get rid of him.

Consequently, she entraps and entombs her unresisting mentor within a tree, in a hole underneath a large stone, or inside a cave, depending on the version of this story as it is told in the different texts. In the &quot;Prophéties de Merlin&quot;, for instance, Viviane is especially cruel in the way she disposes of Merlin and then takes Tristan&#x27;s brother Meliadus the Younger as her actual lover. There she is proud of how Merlin had never taken her virginity, unlike what happened with his other female students such as Morgan. The Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot; explains this by a spell she put &quot;on her groin which, as long as it lasted, prevented anyone from deflowering her and having relations with her.&quot; The &quot;Lancelot&quot; too has Viviane leave Merlin for another lover, in this case the evil king Brandin of the Isles, whom she teaches some magic that he then applies to his terrible castle Dolorous Gard; in the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, an incognito Viviane abortively turns King Brandegorre&#x27;s son Evadeam into the deformed Dwarf Knight for refusing her love. Conversely, the &quot;Livre d&#x27;Artus&quot;, a late variant of the Prose &quot;Lancelot&quot;, shows a completely peaceful scene taking place under a blooming hawthorn tree where Merlin is lovingly put to sleep by Viviane, as it is required by his destined fate that she has learned of. He then wakes up inside an impossibly high and indestructible tower, invisible from the outside, where she will come to meet him there almost every day or night (a motif reminiscent of Ganieda&#x27;s visits of Merlin&#x27;s house in an earlier version of his life as described by Geoffrey in &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;). In any case, as a result of their usually final encounter Merlin almost always either dies or is never seen again by anyone else. Only in the recently found, alternative Bristol &quot;Merlin&quot; fragment, she resists his seduction with the help of a magic ring during the week they spend together; this particular text ends with him reuniting with Arthur.

According to her backstory in the chronologically later (but happening earlier plotwise) Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, Viviane was a daughter of the knight Dionas (&quot;Dyonas&quot;) and a niece of the Duke of Burgundy. She was born in Dionas&#x27; domain that included the fairy forests of Briosque (Brocéliande) and Darnantes, and it was an enchantment of her fairy godmother, Diana the Huntress Goddess, that caused Viviane to be so alluring to Merlin when she first met him there as a young teenager. The Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; informs the reader that, back &quot;in the time of Virgil&quot;, Diana had been a Queen of Sicily that was considered a goddess by her subjects. The Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite de Merlin&quot; describes how Viviane was born and lived in a magnificent castle at the foot of a mountain in Brittany as a daughter of the King of Northumbria. She is initially known as the beautiful 12-year-old Damsel Huntress (&quot;Damoiselle Cacheresse&quot;) in her introductory episode, in which she serves the role of a damsel in distress in the adventure of the three knights separately sent by Merlin to rescue her from kidnapping; the quest is soon completed by King Pellinore who tracks down and kills her abductor. The Post-Vulgate rewrite also describes how Diana had killed her partner Faunus to be with a man named Felix, but then she was herself killed by her lover at that lake, which came to be called the Lake of Diana (&quot;Lac Diane&quot;). This is presumably the place where Lancelot of the Lake (&quot;du Lac&quot;) is later raised, at first not knowing his real parentage, by Viviane. Nevertheless, in the French romances only the narration of the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; actually makes it clear that its Lady of the Lake and Viviane are in fact the one and same character. There, she also uses other names, including Elaine.

===Giver of Excalibur===


Another, unnamed Lady of the Lake appears in the Post-Vulgate tradition to bestow the magic sword Excalibur from Avalon to Arthur in a now iconic scene. She is presented as a mysterious early benefactor of the young King Arthur, who is directed and led to her by Merlin. Appearing in her lake, she grants him Excalibur and its special scabbard after his original (also unnamed) sword breaks in the duel against King Pellinore. She is a mysterious character who is evidently neither Morgan nor the Damsel Huntress, but may possibly have a connection to the Lady of Avalon (&quot;Dame d&#x27;Avalon&quot;) from the &quot;Propheties de Merlin&quot;. Later in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot;, this Lady of the Lake is suddenly attacked and beheaded at King Arthur&#x27;s court by Sir Balin as a result of a kin feud between them (she blames Balin for the death of variably either her brother or her lover, while he blames her for the death of his mother, who had been burned at the stake) and a dispute over another enchanted sword from Avalon; her body later vanishes.

All this takes place during the time when Merlin is still at Arthur&#x27;s side and prior to the introduction of the young Viviane in the same branch of the Post-Vulgate Cycle. Modern retellings, however, usually omit the episode of her apparent killing by Balin and at the same time often make her the same character as Viviane.

===&quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;===
In Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, a 15th-century compilation of Arthurian stories that is often considered definitive in much of the world today, the first Lady of the Lake remains unnamed besides this epithet. When the young King Arthur, accompanied by his mentor Merlin, comes to her lake in need of a sword (the original sword-from-the-stone having been recently broken in battle), he sees an arm extending from the surface of the water holding a sword. Arthur, informed by Merlin that the Lady can grant him the sword, requests the sword from the Lady and is granted permission to go out upon the lake and take it if he promises to fulfill any request from her later, to which he agrees. Later, when the Lady comes to Camelot to hold Arthur to his promise, she asks for the head of Sir Balin the Savage, whom she blames for her brother&#x27;s death. However, Arthur refuses this request. Instead it is Balin, claiming that &quot;by enchantment and sorcery she has been the destroyer of many good knights&quot;, who swiftly decapitates her with his own magic sword (a cursed blade that had been stolen by him from a mysterious lady from Avalon just a moment earlier) in front of Arthur and then sends off his squire with her severed head, much to the distress and shame of the king under whose protection she should have been there. Arthur gives the Lady a rich burial, has her slayer banished despite Merlin telling him Balin would become Arthur&#x27;s greatest knight, and gives his permission for Sir Launcenor of Ireland (an Irish prince similarly named but entirely unrelated to Malory&#x27;s &quot;Launcelot&quot; Lancelot) to go after Balin to avenge this disgrace by killing him.

The second Lady of the Lake is sometimes referred to by her title and sometimes referred to by name, today best known as Nimue (rendered Nynyve in Malory&#x27;s original Winchester Manuscript of &quot;Le Morte&quot;). Malory does not use Nimue&#x27;s name for the Lady of the Lake associated with Lancelot, who remains unnamed as well, described as only &quot;one of the ladies of the lake&quot;, and she may thus be considered a third one. It is also possible that Malory had only access to the &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot; part of the Post-Vulgate Cycle as a relevant source.

Nimue, whom Malory describes as the &quot;chief Lady of the Lake&quot;, plays a pivotal role in the Arthurian court throughout his story. The first time the character named Nimue appears is at the wedding of Arthur and Guinevere, as the young huntress rescued by Pellinore. She then proceeds to perform some of the same actions as the Lady of the Lake of his sources but is different in some ways. For instance, in the Post-Vulgate &quot;Suite du Merlin&quot;, Malory&#x27;s source for the earlier parts of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, the Lady of the Lake traps Merlin in a tomb, which results in his death. She does this out of cruelty and a hatred of Merlin. In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, on the other hand, Nimue is still the one to trap Merlin, but Malory gives her a sympathetic reason: Merlin falls in love with her and will not leave her alone; Malory gives no indication that Nimue loves him back. Eventually, since she cannot free herself of him otherwise, she decides to trap him under rock and makes sure he cannot escape. She is tired of his sexual advances, and afraid of his power as &quot;a devil&#x27;s son&quot;, so she does not have much of a choice but to ultimately get rid of him.

After enchanting Merlin, Malory&#x27;s Nimue replaces him as Arthur&#x27;s magician aide and trusted adviser. When Arthur himself is in need in Malory&#x27;s text, some incarnation of the Lady of the Lake, or her magic, or her agent, reaches out to help him. For instance, she saves Arthur from a magical attempt on his life made by his sister Morgan le Fay and from the death at the hands of Morgan&#x27;s lover Accolon as in the Post-Vulgate, and together with Tristan frees Arthur from the lustful sorceress Annowre in a motif taken from the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. In Malory&#x27;s version, Brandin of the Isles, renamed Brian (Bryan), is Nimue&#x27;s evil cousin rather than her paramour. Nimue instead becomes the lover and eventually wife of Pelleas, a gentle young knight whom she then also puts under her protection so &quot;that he was never slain by her days.&quot;

In an analysis by Kenneth Hodges, Nimue appears through the story as the chivalric code changes, hinting to the reader that something new will happen in order to help the author achieve the wanted interpretation of the Arthurian legend: each time the Lady reappears in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, it is at a pivotal moment of the episode, establishing the importance of her character within Arthurian literature, as she transcends any notoriety attached to her character by aiding Arthur and other knights to succeed in their endeavors, subtly helping sway the court in the right direction. According to Hodges, when Malory was looking at other texts to find inspiration, he chose the best aspects of all the other Lady of the Lake characters, making her pragmatic, compassionate, clever, and strong-willed. However, Nimue&#x27;s character is often seen as still very ambiguous by other scholars. As summarized by Amy S. Kaufman,

In the end, a female hand emerging from a lake reclaims Excalibur in a miraculous scene when the sword is thrown into the water by Sir Bedivere just after Arthur&#x27;s final battle. Malory&#x27;s narration then counts Nimue among the magical queens who arrive in a black boat with Morgan (in the original account in the Vulgate Cycle&#x27;s &quot;Mort Artu&quot;, the chief lady in the boat, seen holding hands with Morgan and calling for Arthur, is not recognised by Girflet who is the scene&#x27;s witness instead of Malory&#x27;s Bedivere). Together, they bear the mortally wounded Arthur away to Avalon.

===Other identities and relations===
In some cases, it is uncertain whether Morgan and the Lady of the Lake are identical or separate characters. Richard Cavendish wrote: &quot;It may be that the two sides of Morgan&#x27;s nature separated into two different characters and that the Lady of the Lake is an aspect of Morgan herself. If so, the two fays represent the two aspects (...) fertile and destructive, motherly and murderous, loving and cruel.&quot;

According to Anne Berthelot, Morgan herself should be considered &quot;&quot;the&quot; Lady of the Lake&quot;, as compared to the &quot;upstart magician&quot; Viviane in the French prose cycles. The 13th/14th-century English poem &quot;Of Arthour and of Merlin&quot; explicitly gives the role of Lady of the Lake to Morgan, explaining her association with the name &quot;Nimiane&quot; by just having her residing near a town called Nimiane (Ninniane). Morgan is also depicted as a fairy from a lake (with an underwater and invisible castle that can be accessed only with a guide water dragon) in the Italian tale &quot;Cantari del Falso Scudo&quot;, and as a former student of her fellow fairy Viviana in the French romance &quot;Claris et Laris&quot;.

The 15th-century Italian prose &quot;La Tavola Ritonda&quot; (&quot;The Round Table&quot;) makes the Lady a daughter of Uther Pendragon and thus a sister to both Morgan the Fairy (Fata Morgana) and Arthur. Here she is a character mischievous to the extent that her own brother Arthur swears to burn her at the stake (as he also threatens to do with Morgan). This version of her briefly kidnaps Lancelot when he is an adult (along with Guinevere and Tristan and Isolde), a motif usually associated with Morgan; here it is also Morgan herself who sends the magical shield to Guinevere in an act recast as having malicious intent. The Lady is also described as Morgan&#x27;s sister in some other Italian texts, such as the 13th-century poem &quot;Pulzella Gaia&quot;. Mike Ashley identified Viviane with one of Arthur&#x27;s other sisters, the otherwise obscure Elaine.

In the 14th-century French prose romance &quot;Perceforest&quot;, a lengthy romance prequel to the Arthurian legend, the figures of the Lady of the Lake and of the enchantress Sebile have been merged to create the character of Sebile [the Lady] of the Lake (&quot;Sébil[l]e [la Dame] du Lac&quot;, named as such due to her residence of the Castle of the Lake later known as the Red Castle), who is depicted as an ancestor of Arthur himself from her union with King Alexander (Alexander the Great). The later Lady of the Lake who raises Lancelot is also mentioned in &quot;Perceforest&quot;, where both hers and Merlin&#x27;s ancestry lines are derived from the ancient Fairy Morgane (&quot;Morg[u]ane la Faee&quot; / &quot;la Fée&quot;, living in a castle on the Isle of Zeeland). Here, their shared ancestors have been born from an illicit love between her beautiful daughter Morg[u]anette and Passelion, an amorous young human protégé of the mischievous spirit Zephir, hundreds years earlier when Morgane cursed them so that one of their descendants would one day kill the other.

== The lake ==
A number of locations are traditionally associated with the Lady of the Lake&#x27;s abode. Such places within Great Britain include the lakes Dozmary Pool and The Loe in Cornwall, the lakes Llyn Llydaw and Llyn Ogwen in Snowdonia, River Brue&#x27;s area of Pomparles Bridge in Somerset, and the lake Loch Arthur in Scotland.

In France, Viviane is also connected with Brittany&#x27;s Paimpont forest, often identified as the Arthurian enchanted forest of Brocéliande, where her lake (that is, the Lake of Diana) is said to be located at the castle Château de Comper. The oldest localization of the Lake is in the &quot;Lancelot en prose&quot;, written around 1230: the place where Lancelot is raised is described there as to the north of Trèves-Cunault, on the Loire, in the middle of the (now extinct) forest of Beaufort-en-Vallée (the &quot;Bois en Val&quot; of the book).
== Modern culture ==
Walter Scott wrote an influential poem, &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, in 1810, drawing on the romance of the legend, but with an entirely different story set around Loch Katrine in the Trossachs of Scotland. Scott&#x27;s material furnished subject matter for &quot;La donna del lago&quot;, an 1819 opera by Gioachino Rossini. Franz Schubert set seven songs from Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;, including the three &quot;Ellen songs&quot; (&quot;Ellens Gesang I&quot;, &quot;Ellens Gesang II&quot;, and &quot;Ellens Gesang III&quot;), although Schubert&#x27;s music to Ellen&#x27;s third song has become far more famous in its later adaptation, known as &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

William Wordsworth&#x27;s 1831 poem, &quot;The Egyptian Maid or The Romance of the Water-Lily&quot; features the Lady of the Lake Nina, who, inverting Nimue&#x27;s role in Malory, brings Merlin out of his cave and back to Arthur&#x27;s court. Alfred, Lord Tennyson adapted several stories of the Lady of the Lake for his 1859–1885 poetic cycle &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. He splits her into two characters: Viviane is a Circe-like deceitful villain and an associate of King Mark and Mordred who ensnares Merlin, while the Lady of the Lake is a guardian angel style benevolent figure who raises Lancelot and gives Arthur his sword.

The full French name of the University of Notre Dame, founded in 1842, is &quot;Notre Dame du Lac&quot;. This is translated as &quot;Our Lady of the Lake&quot;, making reference to Mary, mother of Jesus as the Lady of the Lake in a fusion between Arthurian legend and French Catholicism.

===Popular culture===

20th- and 21st-century authors of Arthurian fiction adapt the legend of the Lady of the Lake in various ways, sometimes using two or more bearers of this title while others choose to emphasize a single character. Typically influenced by Thomas Malory&#x27;s telling of the story, fantasy writers tend to give their version of Merlin a sorcerous female enemy, usually either Nimue, Morgan (often perceived as more plausible in this role due to her established enmity with Arthur in much of the legend), or Morgan&#x27;s sister Morgause. Various characters of the Lady (or Ladies) of the Lake appear in many works, including poems, novels, films, television series, stage productions, comics, and games. Though her identity may change, her role as a significant figure in the lives of Arthur and Merlin usually remains consistent. Some examples of such works are listed below.

*Nimue appears in T. H. White&#x27;s book series &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; as a water nymph and Merlin&#x27;s enchantress. True to the legend she traps Merlin in a cave, but White&#x27;s Merlyn does not convey it as negative, and even refers to it as a holiday. They thus disappear together near the beginning of &quot;The Ill-Made Knight&quot; (1940), however Merlyn later returns in &quot;The Book of Merlyn&quot;.
*Nineue ferch Afallach, &quot;Tennyson&#x27;s Vivien&quot;, is a fairy enchantress in John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;&quot; (1951). In Welsh mythology, Modron (&quot;divine mother&quot;) was a daughter of Avallach; she was derived from the Gaulish goddess Matrona and may have been the prototype of Morgan. The novel ends with the protagonist Porius saving the wizard Myrddin (the story&#x27;s Merlin figure) from his entombment by Nineue on the summit of Snowdon, Wales&#x27; highest mountain.
*The 1960 musical &quot;Camelot&quot; includes the character Nimue who has a song called &quot;Follow Me&quot; performed in Act I. In the play, Nimue, a beautiful water nymph, has come to draw Merlyn into her cave for an eternal sleep. He begs Nimue for answers, as he has forgotten if he has warned Arthur about Lancelot and Mordred, before his memories fade permanently and he is led away. She does not appear in the film adaptation, but &quot;Follow Me&quot; is echoed in the notably similar &quot;Come with Me&quot; sung by the Lady of the Lake for Galahad in the later musical &quot;Spamalot&quot; (2005).
*The Lady of the Lake is satirized off-screen in the 1975 comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, in which late 20th century notions are inserted into a mythic tale for comical effect. In a famous scene, a peasant named Dennis says, &quot;Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.&quot; Arthurian scholar N. J. Higham described this iconic dialogue line as ever &quot;immortal&quot; in 2005.
*In the DC Comics Universe, Vivienne is the Lady of the Lake. Nimue is the good Madame Xanadu (introduced in 1978), her youngest sister, and their middle sister is the evil Morgaine le Fey (given name Morgana); their surname is Inwudu. The Lady of the Lake has appeared in &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Aquaman&quot;, and her sister&#x27;s own series. In the 1983 DC Comics series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, an unrelated Lady of the Lake is referred to as Nyneve, depicted as a woman with a beautiful body but wearing a mask, who is sent to confront the heroes of Camelot. When Nyneve removes the mask, Merlin, upon seeing her face, is unable to resist her and departs, thus removing him from Morgan&#x27;s path. Later, when he escapes her control, it is revealed that her only facial feature is a gigantic mouth with a long serpentine tongue, &quot;vagina dentata&quot; style, which Merlin turns against her.
*Mary Stewart&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;The Last Enchantment&quot; in her &quot;Arthurian Saga&quot; series radically recasts the story of Merlin and Niniane (Nimue), completely removing the aspect of malicious seduction and treachery dominant in the traditional version; it is the witch Morgause, the mother of Mordred (with Mordred notably undergoing a similarly revisionist treatment as Nimue), who takes Nimue&#x27;s traditional role and then continues as the chief villain. In this depiction, after she saves him from being poisoned by Morgause, Merlin takes Niniane on as an apprentice, with her at first disguised as a boy named Ninian, and willingly teaches her his magic, which he had refused to Morgause. When her identity as a woman is discovered, they fall in love despite their age difference. Their love is peaceful and idyllic; even when Nimue marries Pelleas, this is not a betrayal of Merlin. As Merlin gives her the secrets of his power and how to control it, he seems to lose them himself, which he does not mind. In a depleted, weakened condition, he falls into a coma, and is believed to be dead. Nimue has him buried within his &quot;crystal cave&quot;, from which he escapes after a few weeks, through a combination of chance luck and ingenious planning, and travels incognito to let Arthur know he is still alive and can help him against Morgause and Morgan. Nimue takes Merlin&#x27;s place as the court enchanter, while Merlin retires to the crystal cave and lives a quiet and happy life as a hermit. Niniane takes his place and role to the degree she even proclaims &quot;I am Merlin&quot;, thus creating a &#x27;Nimue-Merlin&#x27; character.
*In John Boorman&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Excalibur&quot;, an uncredited actress plays the Lady of Lake, twice holding up the fabled sword, once for Merlin to give to Uther Pendragon, and once to return to Arthur. Separately, the film&#x27;s Morgana (Helen Mirren) takes on other parts of the traditional Lady of the Lake story, learning the occult arts from Merlin and ultimately trapping him with his own powerful &quot;Charm of Making&quot;, the magic of shapeshifting.
*Marion Zimmer Bradley&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, a feminist retelling of the legend, expands on the tradition of multiple Ladies, with Viviane, Niniane and Nimue all being separate characters. Furthermore, in Bradley&#x27;s works, both the &#x27;Lady of the Lake&#x27; and the &#x27;Merlin&#x27; are names of offices in the Celtic pagan hierarchy: the Lady of the Lake is the title of the ruling priestess of Avalon, and the Merlin is a druid who has pledged his life to the protection of Britain. Various tragic characters assume the title of the Lady of the Lake, including Viviane, the initial High Priestess of Avalon, Arthur&#x27;s aunt, and Lancelot&#x27;s mother who ends up killed by Balin (here as her other son Balan&#x27;s foster-brother); Niniane, Taliesin&#x27;s daughter and yet another of Arthur&#x27;s half-sisters who reluctantly becomes the Lady of the Lake after Viviane is slain and becomes Mordred&#x27;s lover until he kills her; the main protagonist and narrator Morgaine (Morgan), portrayed similar as in the medieval romances but more sympathetically; and Nimue, a sympathetic and tragic young priestess who falls in love with the Merlin but is duty bound by Morgaine to seduce and lure him to his death – following which she drowns herself. Their ancestors (the previous priestesses of Avalon and, before that, of Atlantis) are subjects of Bradley&#x27;s extended &quot;Avalon&quot; universe novels, among them the direct prequel &quot;Lady of Avalon&quot; (1997), the third part of which follows the young Viviane. A 2001 television adaptation of &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; starred Anjelica Huston as Viviane, and Julianna Margulies and Tamsin Egerton as Morgaine.
*In his Christian-themed 1987–1999 book series &quot;The Pendragon Cycle&quot;, Stephen Lawhead takes up the figure of the Lady of the Lake under a different name: the Faery princess Charis, daughter of Avallach, the king of Atlantis and later of Avalon. Married to the Breton prince Taliesin, she gives birth to Merlin. After Taliesin&#x27;s death, Charis takes care of Merlin at Lake Logres, hence her name &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;. She is the protagonist and narrator of the first book in the cycle, &quot;Taliesin&quot;. The traditional figure of Nimue belongs to Charis&#x27; shapeshifting evil sister Morgian (Morgan), the main antagonist through the entire series, including the modern-day-set &quot;Avalon: The Return of King Arthur&quot;.
*In Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s 1995–1997 novel series &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot;, more historically grounded and realistic than usual treatments of Arthurian legend, Nimue is an Irish orphan adopted by the British druid Merlin. She is a prominent character in the books, being a childhood friend of, a major love interest for, and finally an adversary to the series&#x27; main protagonist, Arthur&#x27;s warrior Derfel Cadarn. She begins as Merlin&#x27;s most adept priestess and lover, but as she grows ever more brutal and fanatical, by the time of the final novel she turns against him and imprisons him, torturing him to reveal the last of his magical secrets in her desperate obsession to bring back the Old Gods of Britain at any price. Eventually, she brings Merlin to total madness before ultimately sacrificing him to their lost gods, whose return she believes would rid the island of the Saxons and the Christians alike. As Nimue believes the key to her goal is to sacrifice Gwydre, Arthur&#x27;s son with Guinevere using Excalibur (as she already did with Gawain), Derfel&#x27;s final act of casting the sword away is not to return it to her but to hide it from her forever. Stephen Thomas Knight, commenting on Cornwell&#x27;s vicious Nimue, with her tunnel-vision ruthlessness, vindicativeness, and frequent use of prolonged torture, opined the &quot;pro-Celtic quasi-historian&quot; author &quot;links her to the Saxons as part of her hostility to decent people, including Merlin.&quot; Symbolically, both Nimue and the hypocritical Bishop Sansum, representing the Christian side of the books&#x27; major theme of the danger of religious extremism, remain still alive as the story comes to the end. Nimue is due to be portrayed by Ellie James in the upcoming television adaptation &quot;The Winter King&quot;.
*In the 1995–1996 animated series &quot;Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders&quot;, the name of the first season&#x27;s antagonist Lady Kale (voiced by Corinne Orr), an evil twin sister of the Queen of Avalon and a former student of Merlin who magically imprisons him, was created as an anagram of Lady of the Lake. Lady Kale seeks to steal Merlin&#x27;s magic so she can rule Avalon forever, later working together with the also evil Morgana. However, a good character of the Lady of the Lake (called the Spirit of Avalon in an alternate version &quot;Starla and the Jewel Riders&quot;) herself briefly appears during the second seasons&#x27;s finale in the eponymous episode &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; (&quot;Spirit of Avalon&quot;) to help Princess Gwenevere and Merlin defeat Lady Kale and Morgana.
*In the 1998 television miniseries &quot;Merlin&quot;, the characters of the Lady of the Lake (Miranda Richardson) and Nimue (Isabella Rossellini) are separated, with the former being a goddess-like beneficent fae who is the twin sister of the evil Queen Mab, and the latter being a noblewoman damsel in distress with no supernatural powers who is the object of Merlin&#x27;s affections. In the motif evoking Edwin Arlington Robinson&#x27;s 1917 poem &quot;Merlin&quot;, Nimue and Merlin live together in another world until he leaves in order to help Arthur; in the end, however, Merlin returns to her and makes them both young again with the last of his magic. In the 2006 pseudo-sequel &quot;Merlin&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, Miranda Richardson reprises her role as the Lady of the Lake, as the only returning cast member aside of Merlin&#x27;s Sam Neill, though she portrays a much different characterization: the Lady is the main antagonist seeking to destroy Camelot. It also depicts Merlin&#x27;s sleep in the cave; as he slept, the Lady used her magic to conceive a son with Merlin and then enchanted him to sleep for 50 years.
*In the 2005–2009 television series &quot;Kaamelott&quot;, the Lady of the Lake (Audrey Fleurot) is an angel sent to help King Arthur progress in the quest for the Grail. Upending the established connections, the series&#x27; Lancelot not only never interacts with the Lady but cannot even see her.
*The 2008–2012 television series &quot;Merlin&quot; also features two characters based on the Lady of the Lake. Nimueh (Michelle Ryan) serves as the primary antagonist of the show&#x27;s first season, which includes the episode titled &quot;The Mark of Nimueh&quot;. The character has no connection to Merlin beyond his opposition to her plans, and her only connection to a lake is her use of a location called the Isle of the Blessed (Thomas Wentworth Higginson&#x27;s 19th-century name for Avalon). She ends up killed by Merlin in a showdown on her Isle of Nimueh in the season&#x27;s last episode, &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. The ninth episode of the second season is titled &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, wherein a sorceress named Freya (Laura Donnelly) dies and vows to repay Merlin for his kindness to her. In the third season finale, Freya, now a water spirit, returns Excalibur to Merlin so that he can give it to Prince Arthur Pendragon.
*Nimue, the Blood Queen, appears as one of the primary antagonists in the &quot;Hellboy&quot; comic book series by Mike Mignola, influenced by the classic comics series &quot;Prince Valiant.&quot; Here she was introduced in 2008 as a witch who driven mad after the powers she acquired from Merlin, gave her knowledge of the Ogdru Jahad, prompting the witches of Britain to dismember her and seal her away underground. Resurrected in the present day by Arthur&#x27;s last descendant, Hellboy, she assumes the mantle of the Irish triple war goddess the Morrígan and assembles an army of legendary and folkloric beings to eradicate mankind, only to stopped by Hellboy at the cost of his own life. Although having been turned into an evil creature trying to destroy the word, Nimue still had a human part &quot;that hated and feared what she had become.&quot;
**She is portrayed by Milla Jovovich as the main antagonist in the 2019 film adaptation &quot;Hellboy&quot;. Just when massing a plague throughout London, Nimue was thwarted and dismembered by Arthur with his Excalibur before her pieces were separately concealed. After Gruagach recovered all her pieces, Nimue is resurrected for revenge and seeks Hellboy to create the apocalypse. Later in the climax, she betrays and kills Gruagach, and then Trevor to enrage Hellboy to pull Excalibur from Arthur&#x27;s tomb and releases all demons throughout England]. However, Alice Monaghan channels Trevor&#x27;s spirit to encourage Hellboy, who decapitated Nimue, and send her and all demons back into hell.
*Nimue is featured in the 2010s television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in which Arthurian characters live in the land inhabited by other fairy tale characters. She appears as a secondary antagonist in the first half of Season 5, portrayed by Caroline Ford. She is introduced in the eponymous episode &quot;Nimue&quot; when, fleeing from Vortigan who sacked and burned her village, she meets Merlin and they fall in love; with Merlin being immortal, Nimue drinks from the Holy Grail so they can be together forever. Afterwards, she kills Vortigan, which darkens her magic and turns her into the very first Dark One. Nimue breaks Excalibur but Merlin cannot bring himself to kill her and ends up being trapped in a tree. At some point, Nimue dies but she manages to live on in all of the following Dark Ones, appearing to them as a vision. She forms an alliance with Captain Hook, manipulating him into casting the Dark Curse and reviving her and the Dark Ones, and then leads a Dark One invasion in Storybrooke, which ultimately leads to her demise at the hands of Hook, who betrays her to redeem himself and destroy her and the Dark Ones forever using Excalibur. The separate character of the Lady of the Lake is referenced as Lancelot&#x27;s mother, but she never appears; even the episode titled &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; does not feature her and its title instead refers to Prince Charming&#x27;s mother.
*The 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot; features the Lady of the Lake (Jacqui Ainsley) bound Excalibur to the Pendragon bloodline after Merlin used it to destroy the Mage Tower and appears to catch the sword underwater after Arthur throws it into the lake in shame at his failures; she pulls Arthur underwater and motivates him to fight Vortigern before returning the sword to him. This good Lady of the Lake has her mirror image in the film&#x27;s monstrous character &quot;Syren&quot; that replaces the two dragons in the film&#x27;s revision of the legend of Vortigern&#x27;s Tower.
*In the 2020 television series &quot;Cursed&quot;, a feminist re-imagining of the Arthurian legend based on an illustrated novel of the same title, Nimue is the protagonist, portrayed by Katherine Langford in the adaptation. Writer and showrunner Tom Wheeler said he was inspired by &quot;this really evocative image of this young woman’s hand reaching out of this lake and offering the sword to Arthur, so that image is what captivated us. And it&#x27;s a really mysterious, magical, sad image, and it begged all of these questions: Why is she giving the sword to Arthur? What was their relationship? Why him? Why does she have the sword?&quot; (Contrary to Wheeler&#x27;s stated belief, it is not Nimue who gives the sword in Malory&#x27;s unrevised telling.) In &quot;Cursed&quot;, before becoming the Lady of the Lake, Nimue, also known as the &quot;Wolf-Blood Witch&quot;, is a young woman coming into her Fey abilities, but whilst her home was ravaged by the Christian fanatics called the Red Paladins she is sent on a mission by her dying mother to deliver &quot;The Sword of Power&quot; (Excalibur but never named) to Merlin. Taking great liberties from the source materials, &quot;Cursed&quot;&#x27;s Lancelot (known until the finale as only &quot;The Weeping Monk&quot;) is already adult when Nimue first meets him and is for most part just one of her enemies, Merlin is revealed to be her father, and she is instead Arthur&#x27;s love interest. The story of &quot;Cursed&quot; ends abruptly when Nimue is shot with arrows by a nun named Iris (an original character with no counterpart in the legend) and falls with the sword into a body of water, where she (or her spirit, as her exact fate is left unexplained) will guard the sword until &quot;a true king rises to claim it.&quot; Albeit the TV series adapted the entire original book, it was supposed to continue in the canceled second season.

<doc id="181658" wikidata="Q598709" url="?curid=181658" title="They Call Me Trinity">
<text>They Call Me Trinity () is a 1970 spaghetti Western comedy film written and directed by Enzo Barboni (under the pseudonym of E.B. Clucher) and produced by Italo Zingarelli. The film stars the duo of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer as half-brothers Trinity and Bambino, who help defend a Mormon settlement from Mexican bandits and the henchmen of the land-grabbing Major Harriman. It was filmed on location in Campo Imperatore, Abruzzo, Italy, with financial backing from West Film.

A sequel, &quot;Trinity Is Still My Name&quot;, was more successful than &quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Sons of Trinity&quot;, starring Heath Kizzier and Keith Neubert, was released as a continuation of the &quot;Trinity&quot; series.

==Plot==
Trinity, a lazy, ne&#x27;er-do-well gunfighter with unnaturally fast drawing ability and marksmanship, is dragged on a travois by his horse to a way station and restaurant. There, he encounters a pair of bounty hunters with an injured Mexican prisoner. Trinity calmly takes the Mexican away from the two men, killing them before they can shoot him in the back. The pair reach a small town, where they witness the local sheriff, a large, burly man with a similarly fast drawing ability to Trinity, gunning down three men after they harass him for not allowing one of their criminal friends to be released.

It becomes apparent that Trinity and the man, Bambino, are brothers. Bambino is merely posing as the new sheriff of the small town while he awaits the arrival of his gang from the penitentiary from which he escaped, following a run-in with the actual sheriff who incidentally took the same way as Bambino on his way to his new post. Bambino is not happy to see his trouble-making brother. However, the two form a temporary partnership to deal with Major Harriman, who is attempting to run a group of pacifist Mormon farmers off their land with the intention of using their property to graze his own horses. The fact that these horses are valuable and unbranded explains Bambino&#x27;s grudging willingness to work with his little brother, even though he considers Trinity to be a shiftless bum without ambition.

Trinity has fallen in love with two Mormon sisters and is genuinely concerned with the Mormon settlers&#x27; welfare. He persuades Bambino and Bambino&#x27;s henchmen to help train the pacifistic Mormons to fight, and in the final battle, the Mormon leader finds in the Book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible that &quot;there is a time for fighting&quot; and the Mormons are unleashed against Major Harriman&#x27;s goons, using the dirty fighting tricks that they have just learned.

Bambino is flabbergasted and infuriated to learn that Trinity has given the Major&#x27;s horses to the Mormons. Trinity is about to be happily married to the two Mormon sisters when he learns that being a married Mormon means actually having to work, causing him to hurry after Bambino, who angrily sends him off in the opposite direction. After Bambino departs for California, the real sheriff appears, and Trinity points him in Bambino&#x27;s direction. Trinity then reclines in his travois and brings up the rear with his horse, following them all.

==Production==
Director Enzo Barboni wrote the original story and screenplay for the film. Initially, the script only included the Trinity character and not Bambino but producer Italo Zingarelli suggested the inclusion of a brother. When the film was first announced, Peter Martell was set to play Trinity and George Eastman as Bambino. The two characters were later portrayed by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, who were then a popular comic duo following the release of Western film &quot;God Forgives... I Don&#x27;t!&quot; in October 1967 in Italy, where they were cast as comedic and violent characters. Hill and Spencer did their own stunts in the film with the rest of the supporting cast being portrayed predominantly by stuntmen.

Interiors and the towns in the film were shot at Incir De Paolis Studios in Rome. The stage station was shot at Magliana quarry in Lazio, while the valley locations were shot at Parco Dei Monti Simbruini. The waterfall scene was shot at Treja Valley Park.

The main title song was written by Franco Micalizzi and Lally Stott. It is sung by Annibale Giannarelli. &quot;Trinity: Titoli&quot; was later used as the closing theme for Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2012 Western &quot;Django Unchained&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; was released in Italy just before Christmas 1970. It proved very popular abroad, such as in Spain, where it outgrossed all previous Italian Westerns, save for &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot;. The film further proved foundational for future German dubs of Hill and Spencer films: the main dialogue was rewritten to be more humorous, with initially silent areas of the original film receiving additional dialogue from characters with their back to the camera. The film was released in the United States and United Kingdom in 1971. As of 2004, &quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; was the 22nd most successful Italian film, one position below &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film&#x27;s sense of humour, as did Roger Ebert, who gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars. In a review published by &quot;Time Out&quot;, the film is called &quot;first and best in the &quot;Trinity&quot; series of spaghetti Westerns, rare in that it is successful in combining laughter and some degree of interest in the action&quot;. In his book &quot;Once Upon a Time in the Italian West: The Filmgoers&#x27; Guide to Spaghetti Westerns&quot;, author Howard Hughes writes &quot;&quot;They Call Me Trinity&quot; is Hill and Spencer&#x27;s finest vehicle&quot;.

==Legacy==
Following initial popularity, a variety of derivatives were released, such as &quot;Two Sons of Trinity&quot; and the &quot;Carambola!&quot; series, the latter of which featured Hill and Spencer lookalikes Michael Coby and Paul L. Smith. Other films using the &quot;They Call Me...&quot; title include &quot;They Call Me Hallelujah&quot; (1971), &quot;They Call Me Cemetery&quot; (1971), and &quot;They Call Me Holy Ghost&quot; (1972). In 1987, Enzo Barboni directed a contemporary &quot;remake&quot;, entitled &quot;They Call Me Renegade&quot;.

<doc id="181660" wikidata="Q132705" url="?curid=181660" title="Niigata Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture in the Chūbu region of Honshu of Japan. Niigata Prefecture has a population of 2,131,009 (1 July 2023) and is the fifth-largest prefecture of Japan by geographic area at . Niigata Prefecture borders Toyama Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture to the southwest, Gunma Prefecture to the south, Fukushima Prefecture to the east, and Yamagata Prefecture to the northeast.

Niigata is the capital and largest city of Niigata Prefecture, with other major cities including Nagaoka, Jōetsu, and Sanjō. Niigata Prefecture contains the Niigata Major Metropolitan Area centered on Niigata with a population of 1,395,612, the largest metropolitan area on the Sea of Japan coast and the twelfth-largest in Japan. Niigata Prefecture is part of the historic Hokuriku region and features Sado Island, the sixth largest island of Japan in area following the four main islands and Okinawa Island.

== History ==
Until after the Meiji Restoration, the area that is now Niigata Prefecture was divided into Echigo Province (on the mainland) and Sado Province. During the Sengoku period, the Nagao clan, who were at times vassals to the Uesugi, ruled a fief in the western part of modern Niigata from Kasugayama Castle. The most notable member of the Nagao clan was Nagao Kagetora, later and better known as Uesugi Kenshin. He unified the leaders of Echigo Province and became its sole ruler. By taking the surname Uesugi, he also became the head of the Uesugi clan and effectively brought their realm under his control.

The city of Niigata is now the third largest Japanese city facing the Sea of Japan, after Fukuoka and Kitakyushu. It was the first Japanese port on the Sea of Japan to be opened to foreign trade following the opening of Japan by Matthew Perry. It has since played an important role in trade with Russia and Korea. A freighter from North Korea visits Niigata once a month, in one of the few forms of direct contact between Japan and that country.

The Etsuzankai organization, led by the politician Kakuei Tanaka, was highly influential in bringing infrastructure improvements to Niigata Prefecture in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Jōetsu Shinkansen high-speed rail line and the Kanetsu Expressway to Tokyo.

On October 23, 2004, the Chūetsu earthquake struck Niigata Prefecture and was measured at Shindo 6+ at Ojiya.

On January 9, 2006, a heavy winter storm struck the prefecture and its neighbors. At least 71 people died and more than 1,000 were injured. Also in 2006, a massive tsunami and earthquake damaged homes and caused casualties in the maritime areas of Niigata Prefecture, especially near Sado Island.

On July 16, 2007, another earthquake hit the area.

Niigata Prefecture hosts the Fuji Rock Festival, an annual event held at the Naeba ski resort. The three-day event, organized by Smash Japan, features more than 200 Japanese and international musicians. It is one of the largest outdoor music events in Japan, with more than 100,000 people attending in 2005.

== Geography ==

Niigata Prefecture stretches about along the Sea of Japan, from the southwest to the northeast, with a coastal plain between the mountains and the sea. It also includes Sado Island. Niigata Prefecture could be placed in either the Hokuriku or the Kōshinetsu, both of which are considered parts of the Chūbu region.
The prefecture is generally divided into four geographical areas: in the south, in the center, in the north, and Sado Island. The mouth of the Shinano River, the longest river in Japan, is located in Niigata Prefecture.

As of 1 April 2014, 25% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Bandai-Asahi, Chūbu-Sangaku, Nikkō, and Oze National Parks; Echigo Sanzan-Tadami and Sado-Yahiko-Yoneyama Quasi-National Parks; and thirteen Prefectural Natural Parks.

== Economy ==

===Agriculture, forestry and fishing===

The major industry in Niigata Prefecture is agriculture. Rice is the principal product, and among the prefectures of Japan Niigata ranks first in rice output, followed by Hokkaidō and Akita. The area around Uonuma is known for producing the Koshihikari variety, widely considered to be the highest-quality rice produced in Japan.

Rice-related industries are also very important to the prefectural economy. Niigata Prefecture is known throughout Japan for its high-quality sake, senbei, mochi, and arare. In sake production, the prefecture comes third after Gunma and Kyoto prefectures.

The prefecture was also the place of origin of the ornamental carp known as koi.

Niigata Prefecture produces the highest volume of azaleas and cut lilies in Japan, and is increasing the production of cut flowers and flower bulbs. Along with Toyama Prefecture, it produces the highest volume of tulips in the country.

===Mining and manufacturing===

Crude oil is produced in Niigata Prefecture, although Japan relies heavily on petroleum imported from other countries. Kerosene heaters are also produced for use in the cold Niigata winters.

Kinzan, on Sado Island, was an active gold mine until it was closed in 1989.

Sanjō and Tsubame produce 90 percent of all the silverware made in Japan. The two cities are second after Osaka in the production of scissors, kitchen knives, nail clippers and wrenches.

Niigata Prefecture may have been the first area in Japan to produce knitted textiles, although the earliest products may have been imported from China. A nuclear power plant, which formerly had the highest energy output in the world, is located in the tiny village of Kariwa. It has been closed since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

== Demographics ==
In the Census of 2020, Niigata ranked as the 15th most populous prefecture. Its population decreased by 103,000 between 2015 and 2020 and this was the second largest decline after Hokkaido (157,000).

<text>William G. &quot;Bill&quot; Ouchi (born 1943) is an American professor and author in the field of business management. He is the Distinguished Professor of Management and Organizations, Sanford and Betty Sigoloff Chair in Corporate Renewal at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

==Early years and education==
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. He earned a BA from Williams College in 1965, and an MBA from Stanford University and a PhD in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. He was a Stanford business school professor for 8 years and has been a faculty member of the Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles for many years.

===Theory Z===
Ouchi first came to prominence for his studies of the differences between Japanese and American companies and management styles.

His first book in 1981 summarized his observations. &quot;Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge&quot; and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller for over five months.

His second book, &quot;The M Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge&quot;, examined various techniques implementing that approach.

Ouchi also came up with his three approaches to control in an organization&#x27;s management:
*Market control
*Bureaucratic control
*Clan control
==Research regarding schools==
In recent years Ouchi has turned his attention to the challenges posed for local schools by a top-down management style at the central office. He published an overview in 2003 in &quot;Making Schools Work&quot;. He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and chief of staff to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.

In 2009 his book, &quot;The Secret of TSL: The Revolutionary Discovery That Raises School Performance&quot; was published which explores the revolutionary potential of reducing total student load, the number of students a teacher interacts with on a daily basis over the course of a semester.

==Other activities==
In the larger community, Ouchi serves on the Advisory Board of the U.S. Commission on Presidential Debates, on the Board of Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, and on the Board of Directors of The Alliance for College-Ready Public Schools - an operator of inner-city charter schools in Los Angeles.

He previously served on the boards of Williams College, KCET Public Television, The California Community Foundation, Leadership Education for Asian-Pacifics, the Consumer Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and of the Harvard-Westlake School.

In the business community, he serves on the boards of directors of The Hilton Foundation, AECOM, FirstFed Financial, Sempra Energy, and Water-Pik Technologies.

<doc id="181669" wikidata="Q315325" url="?curid=181669" title="Russ Meyer">
<text>Russell Albion Meyer (March 21, 1922 – September 18, 2004) was an American filmmaker. He is known primarily for writing and directing a series of successful sexploitation films that featured campy humor, sly satire and large-breasted women, which have attracted a considerable cult following. His best-known works include &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; (1966), the &quot;Vixen&quot; trilogy — consisting of &quot;Vixen!&quot; (1968), &quot;Supervixens&quot; (1975) and &quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot; (1979) — and the film he considered to be his definitive work, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970).

== Early years ==
Russ Meyer was born in San Leandro, California, the son of Lydia Lucinda (Hauck) and William Arthur Meyer, an Oakland police officer. His parents were both of German descent. Meyer&#x27;s parents divorced soon after he was born, and Meyer was to have virtually no contact with his father during his life. When he was 14 years old, his mother pawned her wedding ring in order to buy him an 8 mm film camera. He made a number of amateur films at the age of 15, and served during World War II as a U.S. Army combat cameraman for the 166th Signal Photo Company, ultimately attaining the rank of technician third grade (equivalent to staff sergeant).

In the Army Meyer forged his strongest friendships, and he would later ask many of his fellow combat cameramen to work on his films. Much of Meyer&#x27;s work during World War II can be seen in newsreels and in the film &quot;Patton&quot; (1970).

On his return to civilian life, he was unable to secure cinematography work in Hollywood due to a lack of industry connections. He made industrial films, freelanced as a still photographer for mainstream films (including &quot;Giant&quot;), and became a well-known glamour photographer whose work included some of the initial shoots for Hugh Hefner&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. Meyer would go on to shoot three &quot;Playboy&quot; centerfolds during the magazine&#x27;s early years, including one of his then-wife Eve Meyer in 1955. He also shot a pictorial of then-wife Edy Williams in March 1973.

== Film career ==
===Early films===
Meyer was the cinematographer for the 1950 Pete DeCenzie film &quot;French Peep Show&quot;, and the 1954 Samuel Newman production, &quot;The Desperate Women&quot;, among the few Hollywood films to depict a woman dying from an illegal abortion in pre–&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; America, the original version of which is believed lost.

===&quot;The Immoral Mr. Teas&quot; and &quot;nudie cuties&quot;===
His first feature, the naughty comedy &quot;The Immoral Mr. Teas&quot; (1959), cost $24,000 to produce and eventually grossed more than $1 million on the independent/exploitation circuit, enthroning Meyer as &quot;King of the Nudies.&quot; It is considered one of the first nudie-cuties.

Russ Meyer was an auteur who wrote, directed, edited, photographed and distributed all his own films. He was able to finance each new film from the proceeds of the earlier ones, and became very wealthy in the process.

Meyer followed &quot;Teas&quot; with some shorts, &quot;This Is My Body&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Naked Camera&quot;, then made a second nudie cutie, &quot;Eve and the Handyman&quot; (1960). This starred Meyer&#x27;s wife Eve and Anthony-James Ryan, both of whom would be crucial to the production of Meyer&#x27;s films.

His next features were &quot;Erotica&quot; (1961) and &quot;Wild Gals of the Naked West&quot; (1962). Audience reception of &quot;Wild Gals&quot; was lukewarm, and Meyer decided to change genres.

He did a documentary, &quot;Europe in the Raw&quot; (1963), and tried a comedy, &quot;Heavenly Bodies!&quot; (1963).

He then directed a version of &quot;Fanny Hill&quot; (1964) in Europe.

===&quot;Lorna&quot; and the &quot;Gothic&quot; period===

&quot;Lorna&quot; (1964) marked the end of Meyer&#x27;s &quot;nudies&quot; and his first foray into serious film making.

He followed this with three other similar films, and would call this his &quot;Gothic&quot; period: &quot;Mudhoney&quot; (1965), &quot;Motorpsycho&quot; (1965) and &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; (1965).

&quot;Lorna&quot; was very successful commercially, making almost a million dollars. &quot;Mudhoney&quot; was more ambitious, based on a novel, and did not perform as well. &quot;Motorpsycho&quot;, about three men terrorising the countryside, was a big hit—so much so Meyer decided to make a film about three bad girls, &quot;Faster Pussycat&quot;. &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; was commercially underwhelming but would eventually be acclaimed as a cult classic. It has a following all over the world and has inspired countless imitations, music videos and tributes.

===Color melodramas===
Meyer made the popular mockumentary &quot;Mondo Topless&quot; (1966) with the remnants of his production company&#x27;s assets and made two mildly successful color melodramas: &quot;Common Law Cabin&quot; (1967) and &quot;Good Morning... and Goodbye!&quot; (1967).

Meyer made headlines once again in 1968 with the controversial &quot;Vixen!&quot;. Although its lesbian overtones are tame by today&#x27;s standards, the film—envisaged by Meyer and longtime producer Jim Ryan as a reaction to provocative European art films—grossed millions on a five-figure budget and captured the zeitgeist just as &quot;The Immoral Mr. Teas&quot; had a decade earlier.

He followed it with &quot;Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!&quot; (1969), and &quot;Cherry, Harry &amp; Raquel!&quot; (1970), which utilized long montages of the California landscape (replete with anti-marijuana voiceovers) and Uschi Digard dancing in the desert as the film&#x27;s &quot;lost soul.&quot; These plot devices were necessitated after lead actress Linda Ashton left the shoot early, forcing Meyer to compensate for 20 minutes of unshot footage.
===20th Century Fox: &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; and &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot;===
After the unexpected success of Columbia Pictures&#x27; low-budget &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, and impressed by Meyer&#x27;s frugality and profitability, Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown of 20th Century Fox signed Meyer to produce and direct a proposed sequel to &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; in 1969, fulfilling Meyer&#x27;s longstanding ambition to direct for a major Hollywood studio. What eventually appeared was &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1970), scripted by &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic and longtime Meyer devotee Roger Ebert. Ebert, who became the first film critic to receive the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1975, would remain a close friend and key artistic collaborator for the remainder of Meyer&#x27;s life.

The film bears no relation to the novel or film adaptation&#x27;s continuity, a development necessitated when Jacqueline Susann sued the studio after several drafts of her script were rejected. Many critics perceive the film as perhaps the greatest expression of his intentionally vapid surrealism, with Meyer going so far as to refer to it as his definitive work in several interviews. Others, such as &quot;Variety&quot;, saw it &quot;as funny as a burning orphanage and a treat for the emotionally retarded.&quot; Contractually stipulated to produce an R-rated film, the brutally violent climax (depicting a decapitation) ensured an X rating (eventually reclassified to NC-17 in 1990). Despite gripes from the director after he attempted to recut the film to include more titillating scenes after the ratings debacle, it still earned $9 million domestically in the United States on a budget of $2.09 million.

The executives at Fox were delighted with the box office success of &quot;Dolls&quot; and signed a contract with Meyer to make three more films: &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot;, from a bestseller by Irving Wallace; &quot;Everything in the Garden&quot;, from a play by Edward Albee; and &quot;The Final Steal&quot;, from a 1966 novel by Peter George. &quot;We&#x27;ve discovered that he&#x27;s very talented and cost conscious&quot;, said Zanuck. &quot;He can put his finger on the commercial ingredients of a film and do it exceedingly well. We feel he can do more than undress people.&quot;

Per his new contract, Meyer then made a faithful adaptation of &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot; (1971). Featuring loquacious courtroom scenes alongside little nudity, the comparatively subdued film was commercially unsuccessful, and his oeuvre would be disowned by the studio for decades after Zanuck and Brown departed to form an independent production company in 1972.

===Return to independent film making===
Richard Zanuck, who brought Meyer to Fox, had moved to Warner Bros and there was some talk Meyer would make a film at that studio. However, Meyer would never make a studio film again. He returned to exploitation-style independent cinema in 1973 with the blaxploitation period piece &quot;Black Snake&quot;, which was dismissed by critics and audiences as incoherent.

&quot;Foxy&quot;, a proposed vehicle for Edy Williams, was cancelled in the wake of the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Miller v. California&quot; decision in June 1973, which modified its definition of obscenity from that of &quot;utterly without socially redeeming value&quot; to that which lacks &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot;. His marriage to Williams subsequently disintegrated.

&quot;Those years were very confusing to me&quot;, said Meyer. &quot;But instead of rushing off and throwing myself out the window, I was able to psychoanalyze myself and discern what was best for me. I looked myself square in the face and realized I couldn&#x27;t do everything.&quot;

In 1975, he released &quot;Supervixens&quot;, a return to the world of big bosoms, square jaws, and the Sonoran Desert that earned $8.2 million during its initial theatrical run in the United States on a shoestring budget.

Meyer&#x27;s theatrical career ended with the release of the surreal &quot;Up!&quot; (1976) and 1979&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot;, his most sexually graphic films. Film historians and fans have called these last three films &quot;Bustoons&quot; because his use of color and mise en scène recalled larger-than-life pop art settings and cartoonish characters.

In 1977, Malcolm McLaren hired Meyer to direct a film starring The Sex Pistols. Meyer handed the scriptwriting duties over to Ebert, who, in collaboration with McLaren, produced a screenplay entitled &quot;&quot;Who Killed Bambi?&quot;&quot; According to Ebert, filming ended after a day and a half when the electricians walked off the set after McLaren was unable to pay them. (McLaren has claimed that the project was scrapped at the behest of the main financier and Meyer&#x27;s erstwhile employer, 20th Century Fox, whose board of directors considered the prospect of a Meyer production to be untenable and incompatible with the insurgent family values ethos in popular culture.) The project ultimately evolved into &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;.

===Later years===
Despite hardcore pornographic films overtaking Meyer&#x27;s softcore market share, he retired from filmmaking in the late 1970s a very wealthy man. 

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Meyer announced several projects (including the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; parody &quot;Blitzen, Vixen and Harry&quot;, ultimately thwarted by Meyer reneging on a profit-sharing agreement with envisaged lead actor and longtime collaborator Charles Napier; a sequel to &quot;Mondo Topless&quot; provisionally entitled &quot;Mondo Topless, Too&quot;; and a color remake of &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot;) that stalled in development hell. &quot;I don&#x27;t care about making another movie,&quot; he concluded in 1988. &quot;I got all the money I&#x27;ll ever need. You gotta be hungry to make a movie. I don&#x27;t have the desire, the urge.&quot; 

Amid Meyer&#x27;s cognitive decline, longtime collaborator Jim Ryan oversaw the 2001 direct-to-video release of &quot;Russ Meyer&#x27;s Pandora Peaks&quot;, featuring the nude glamour model of the same name. (An analogous film featuring Meyer&#x27;s then-partner Melissa Mounds was never completed.) Around the same time, he also participated in &quot;Voluptuous Vixens II&quot;, a made-for-video softcore production by &quot;Playboy&quot;. 

&quot;Pandora Peaks&quot; interpolated footage originally intended for &quot;The Breast of Russ Meyer&quot; (1979-c. 2001), an unfinished &quot;gargantuan, umpteen-hour anthology film&quot; that would have encompassed précises of Meyer&#x27;s earlier films; memoiristic documentary footage (including voluminous accounts of his Army service in which Kitten Natividad functioned as a metonymic representation of Meyer&#x27;s sexual desires, culminating in a timer-shot assignation between the filmmaker and his longtime muse); and &quot;Mondo Topless&quot;-style profiles of such performers as &quot;Tundi&quot; Horvath, Shawn &quot;Baby Doll&quot; Devereaux, Tami Roche and Kristine Mills. In late 1985, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the film had &quot;rapidly [approached] $2 million in production costs&quot; and was &quot;nearly 12 hours in length.&quot; In December 2024, Russ Meyer Trust officer Janice Cowart confirmed that all project footage for &quot;The Breast of Russ Meyer&quot; was bequeathed to the Museum of Modern Art. The institution had expressed its intent to acquire the project by the late 1980s (per a contemporaneous 1988 interview with Roger Ebert for Meyer&#x27;s installment of &quot;The Incredibly Strange Film Show&quot;, which also previewed brief snippets of a wartime-oriented segment featuring Natividad and Roche) and remains interested in &quot;doing something&quot; with the film.

== Use of satire ==
Russ Meyer was also adept at mocking moral stereotypes and flagrantly lampooning conservative American values. Many of his films feature a narrator who attempts to give the audience a &quot;moral roadmap&quot; of what they are watching. Like his contemporary Terry Southern, Meyer realized that sex—as one of the few common interests among most humans—was a natural vehicle for satirizing values and conventions held by the Greatest Generation. According to Roger Ebert in a commentary recorded in 2003 for the DVD release of &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, Meyer continually reiterated that this irreverence was the true secret to his artistic success.

Meyer was also known for his quick wit. While participating with Ebert in a panel discussion at Yale University, he was confronted by an angry woman who accused him of being &quot;nothing but a breast man.&quot; His immediate reply: &quot;That&#x27;s only the half of it.&quot;

== The Meyer physical archetype ==
Russ Meyer&#x27;s lifelong unabashed fixation on large breasts featured prominently in all his films and is his best-known character trait both as an artist and as a person. His discoveries include Kitten Natividad, Erica Gavin, Lorna Maitland, Tura Satana, and Uschi Digard, among many others. The majority of them were naturally large-breasted and he occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy as it enhanced their breast size even further.

Rarely were there cosmetically enhanced breasts in any of his films until &quot;Up!&quot; (1976) and &quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot; (1979). However, by the early 1980s, when surgical advancements had made the gargantuan breasts of Meyer&#x27;s fantasies a reality, many felt he had started viewing the female body as simply a &quot;tit transportation device&quot; and that his aesthetic vision was no longer attractive or vibrant. Darlene Gray, a natural 36H-22-33 from Great Britain who appeared in &quot;Mondo Topless&quot; (1966), is said to be Russ Meyer&#x27;s most busty discovery.

The Russ Meyer female physical archetype is fairly complex to decipher. Firstly, it&#x27;s not to be confused with today&#x27;s surgically enhanced Hollywood porn starlets or even slim, naturally endowed actresses. Russ Meyer was almost as much about a shapely 1950s hip-to-waist ratio or &quot;wasp waist&quot; as he was about very large breasts. The six-pack abdominal muscles and built-up squarish appearance of modern Hollywood figures do not mesh with his pin-up aesthetic. Secondly, he required that even his most busty actresses looked good braless; &quot;gravity-defying&quot; and &quot;cantilevered&quot; became two of his favorite expressions.

In his films such as &quot;Vixen!&quot; and &quot;Cherry, Harry &amp; Raquel!&quot;, some of the actresses do not have large (by Russ Meyer standards) breasts yet their chests are always accentuated by use of camera angles and well-constructed bras. Reportedly, Erica Gavin was cast as the lead in &quot;Vixen!&quot; because her &quot;smaller&quot; bust would make the character &quot;more relatable to women.&quot;

He went on record numerous times to say that Anita Ekberg was the most beautiful woman he ever photographed and that her 39DD breasts were the biggest in A-list Hollywood history, dwarfing both Jayne Mansfield and Sabrina. Dolly Parton was the only modern Hollywood actress Meyer ever expressed interest in working with.

While he often referred to his actresses as &quot;Junoesque&quot; and &quot;Amazonian&quot;, this was probably more in their spirit than their actual physiques&quot; as Meyer rarely cast very tall or symmetrically built actresses with strong legs and large posteriors.

So while the general public could easily perceive Jane Russell or Sophia Loren as &quot;Russ Meyer material&quot;, their balanced bodies did not mesh with Meyer&#x27;s precise aesthetic preferences.&quot; And indeed, Meyer said many times that it was Gina Lollobrigida&#x27;s smaller-breasted figure that he preferred visually over her larger-breasted, taller and bigger-hipped rival, Sophia Loren. Thus, Meyer&#x27;s oeuvre shows the viewer that while his actresses could easily be described as voluptuous, buxom and curvaceous, it&#x27;s debatable to some if they were strapping, stately or even statuesque as Meyer readily proclaimed.

The tallest actress Meyer ever cast in a lead was the , slim-hipped, huge-breasted Lorna Maitland (working with whom he admitted he found intimidating). Nearly all the other women he featured were no taller than . Tura Satana&#x27;s performance as Varla in &quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; was Meyer&#x27;s only true portrayal of the large, strong and aggressive Amazonian archetype in the classic visual sense.

== Female empowerment ==
Film historian and Meyer biographer Jimmy McDonough posits that Russ Meyer&#x27;s usage of physically and sexually overwhelming female characters places him in his own separate genre. He argues that despite portraying women as sex objects, Meyer nonetheless depicts them as more powerful than men and is therefore an inadvertent feminist filmmaker.

In many of Meyer&#x27;s films, women eventually defeat men, winning sexual fulfillment as their reward, e.g., Super Vixen (&quot;Supervixens&quot;), Margo Winchester (&quot;Up!&quot;) and Lavonia Shedd (&quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot;). Even in the 1950s and 1960s, his films were sometimes centered on a woman&#x27;s need and struggle for sexual satisfaction (&quot;Lorna&quot;, &quot;Good Morning and... Goodbye!&quot; and &quot;Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens&quot;). Additionally, Russ Meyer&#x27;s female characters were often allowed to express anger and violence towards men (&quot;Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!&quot; and &quot;Supervixens&quot;).

Yet in his research, McDonough also notes that Meyer&#x27;s female characters were limited in how powerful they could appear; often the female lead is raped (&quot;Up!&quot; and &quot;Lorna&quot;) or brutally murdered (&quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot;, &quot;Supervixens&quot;, &quot;Lorna&quot; and &quot;Blacksnake&quot;). While Russ Meyer may have championed powerful woman characters, he also forced them into violent and terrifying situations, making them prove their physical and mental strength against tremendous odds. He also ensured that women&#x27;s breasts were at least semi-exposed during these ordeals for comic or erotic effect. Furthermore, according to frequent collaborator and longtime companion Kitten Natividad, Meyer&#x27;s love of dominant women extended to his personal life, and he was almost always in a tumultuous relationship.

== Personal and family life ==
During World War II, according to Meyer, he was in a French brothel with Ernest Hemingway who, upon finding out that Meyer was a virgin, offered him the prostitute of his choice. Meyer picked the one with the largest breasts.

Despite his reputation, Meyer never employed the casting couch during his career&#x27;s peak years (though that shifted during his post-1980 unfinished projects) and rarely had sex with any of his actresses. He had no children, though there were rumored unsuccessful pregnancies with his second wife Edy Williams and last serious girlfriend, Melissa Mounds, who also was found guilty of assaulting him in 1999. 

There is a longstanding rumor among his closest friends and at least one biographer that he had a son in 1964 with a secret lover who he would refer to only as &quot;Miss Mattress&quot; or &quot;Janet Buxton&quot;; this relationship commenced in 1963 (as Meyer&#x27;s first extramarital liaison during his relationship with Eve Meyer) at the Hollywood Players Motel on Vine Street and continued &quot;periodically over the years&quot; (with their &quot;strictly carnal&quot; meet-ups &quot;never extending beyond three hours at any one time&quot;) &quot;until he could no longer function,&quot; according to Jimmy McDonough.

Meyer was very upfront throughout his life about being too selfish to be a father or even a caring partner or husband. Yet he is also said to have been very generous with all his friends and acquaintances, and never isolated friends from one another. Biographers have attributed most of his brutish and eccentric nature to the fact that he was abandoned by his father, an Oakland police officer, and coddled by his mother, Lydia, who was married six times. Meyer had a half-sister, Lucinda, who was diagnosed in her 20s with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to California State mental institutions until her death in 1999. Mental illness ran in his family and was something he secretly feared. During his entire life, Russ Meyer always spoke of his mother and sister with the highest reverence.

Meyer was married to:
* Betty Valdovinos (born 1922, divorced)
* Eve Meyer (December 13, 1928 – March 27, 1977, died in the Tenerife airport disaster)
* Edy Williams (born July 9, 1942, divorced)

Contrary to some accounts, Meyer was never married to Kitten Natividad, his longtime companion and the star of his final two films.

== Final years ==

Meyer owned the rights to nearly all of his films and spent the majority of the 1980s and 1990s making millions reselling his films on the home video and DVD market. He worked out of his Los Angeles home and usually took telephone orders in person. A major retrospective of his work was given at the British Film Institute which Meyer attended in 1982. The Chicago Film Festival honored his work in 1985, for which he also made a personal appearance, and many revival movie houses booked his films for midnight movie marathons.

He also worked obsessively for over a decade on a massive three-volume autobiography, titled &quot;A Clean Breast&quot;. Finally printed in 2000, it features numerous excerpts of reviews, clever details of each of his films and countless photos and erotic musings.

Starting in the mid-1990s, Meyer had frequent fits and bouts of memory loss. By 2000, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and his health and well-being were thereafter looked after by Janice Cowart, his secretary and estate executor. That same year, with no wife or children to claim his wealth, Meyer willed that the majority of his money and estate would be sent to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in honor of his late mother.

Russ Meyer died at his home in the Hollywood Hills (from complications of pneumonia), on September 18, 2004, at the age of 82. Meyer&#x27;s grave is located at Stockton Rural Cemetery in San Joaquin County, California.

<text>Ardbraccan () is an ancient place of worship in County Meath, Ireland. It is the location of the former residence of the Roman Catholic, then, after the Reformation, the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath. it was also a place of prominence in pre-Christian Pagan history . It is approximately from Dublin via the M3 Motorway, and from Navan. Ardbraccan is in a civil parish of the same name.

==Origins==
The original name for Ardbraccan is said to have been Magh Tortain named after the Uí Tuirtri people of the Oirghalla. The area is said to have maintained strong druidic traditions until St. Brecan converted the local Uí Borthim tribe in the 6th century. It was home to 2 of Ireland&#x27;s sacred Celtic trees - &quot;Bile Tortain&quot; and the &quot;Mullyfaughan&quot; tree. There are many local druid wells in the area, 2 of which were dedicated to St. Ultan of Ardbraccan and St. Brigid after the introduction of Christianity.

The current name of Ardbraccan originates from the Irish placename &quot;Ard Breacáin&quot;, meaning the heights or hill of &quot;Breacán. St. Breacán&quot; (anglacised as &quot;Brecan or Braccan&quot;) was the founder of a Christian monastery in the locality. He is thought to have established a monastery on a high mound in the sixth or early seventh century. On this high point, a monastery and a succession of churches were built, each larger than the last to accommodate the growing number of religious worshippers. This included a large circular church known &quot;Daimhliag&quot; (&quot;stone house&quot;).

Ardbraccan is mentioned in Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib as the site of a victory of the Uí Néill over the Vikings sometime in the mid-9th century. However the accuracy of this medieval text is questionable and has been cited as propaganda.

==Raids on Ardbraccan==

The settlements and churches at Ardbraccan were raided and destroyed many times from at least 866. Known raids include:

* 886, 940, 949, 992 The area was attacked and plundered by the Danes.
* 1031 The Abbey was raided and burned down by the Danes of Dublin led by Sitric. It is said that 200 people were sheltering from the raid in the Daimhliag, and perished when the raisers set it alight. A further 200 people were taken into captivity The attack is referenced in The Annals of Tigernach. 
* 1035 Ardbraccan was again attacked by the Danes, which led to Conchobar Ua Máelshechlainn plundering and burning Swords in retaliation.
* 1069 attacked by an army led by Murchad. He is said to have burned down many buildings before receiving being mortally wounded.
* 1109 attacked by the Uí Briain&#x27;s of Munster. The Annals of Tigernach note the churches were destroyed and &quot;humans were burned &quot;alive&quot; and captives taken out of it&quot;.
* 1115 attacked by the Munster men and the Damliag was destroyed once again.
* 1133
* 1136 attacked by Dermot MacMurrough and the Danes, including the stealing of cattle.

==King John in Ardbraccan==

On 29 June 1210, King John of England, Lord of Ireland and his forces met with Cathal Crobhderg, King of Connacht and his men in Ardbraccan before proceeding north to attack the forces of Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster.

==The Diocese of Ardbraccan==
The early Irish church possessed many bishoprics or dioceses, each presided over by a bishop. For a period, Ardbraccan itself was a diocese, with a large urban centre attached. Under the Synod of Kells in 1152, Ardbraccan was united with the Sees of Clonard, Trim, Dunshaughlin, Slane and Fore, forming with other small dioceses the Diocese of Meath. Its central importance was shown in the fact that the newly merged diocese&#x27;s bishop lived in Ardbraccan.

==From Catholic to Protestant==

When, in the aftermath of the crisis over Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the Irish Church was ordered to formally break its link with the Roman Catholic Church to become the Church of Ireland. The Anglican or Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath continued to live in Ardbraccan in an estate attached to the main church. In this period, Ardbraccan possessed two churches; St. Mary&#x27;s (which was located in the Bishop&#x27;s residence) and St. Ultan&#x27;s, which was named after a local saint who had lived in St. Braccan&#x27;s day.

== New church ==
In 1777 a new Church of Ireland church was erected on the site of the earlier church of St. Ultan&#x27;s. The church, built to a design by Rev. Dr. Daniel Augustus Beaufort, remained in use until 1981 when it was deconsecrated due to the dwindling size of the Church of Ireland community in Ardbraccan. Although in 1868 the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of Ireland recorded that there were 267 members of the Church of Ireland living in Ardbraccan parish, by 1968, their number had dwindled to 10 and it ceased to be used for general worship in 1970. The church was finally offered for sale by the Church of Ireland in 2002. Its cemetery is used for burials by both the local Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic parishes.

==Bishop&#x27;s residence for one thousand years==
The Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath moved out of the 18th century bishop&#x27;s palace in 1885 to live in a smaller mansion nearby, &quot;Bishopscourt&quot;. In 1958, the Church of Ireland bishop moved away from Ardbraccan altogether, with Bishopscourt being bought by a Catholic religious order, the Holy Ghost Fathers, who renamed it &quot;An Tobar&quot; (Irish for &quot;The Well&quot;, linking it to an ancient well at Ardbraccan associated with St. Ultan). When the old church underwent some vandalism, its valuable stained glass windows were removed by the Church of Ireland and donated to &quot;An Tobar&quot;.

While the Church of Ireland community used the name &#x27;Ardbraccan&#x27; to refer to its parish, the nearby Roman Catholic parish in the 19th century opted to use a different name, Bohermeen, from the Irish &quot;An Bóthar Mín&quot;, meaning &#x27;the smooth road&#x27;, referring to a famous stretch of road that two thousand years before had passed through the neighbourhood and went to Tara, the seat of the High Kings of Ireland.

==Schools==

In 1747 the first Irish Charter School was opened in Ardbraccan. The Charter Schools admitted only Catholics, under the condition that they be educated as Protestants. These schools were intended, in the words of their programme, &quot;to rescue the souls of thousands of poor children from the dangers of Popish superstition and idolatry, and their bodies from the miseries of idleness and beggary.&quot; The Ardbraccan school, like the others, focused on training girls for domestic service in the houses of the gentry and aristocracy, while training boys in agriculture and gardening. As with the other schools, the charter school in Ardbraccan failed and eventually closed down.

==Ardbraccan stone==
Ardbraccan is also famous for its quarries that supplied cut stone for many Irish and British buildings. The most famous building built with Ardbraccan stone is Leinster House, once the Dublin residence of the Duke of Leinster, Ireland&#x27;s premier peer, and now the seat of the Irish parliament, Oireachtas Éireann. Ardbraccan limestone was also used on the restoration of The Custom House in Dublin after it was burned down by the IRA in 1921.

==Notable persons==
* St. Brecan, founded a monastery here.
* St. Ultan, founded a school and succeeded St. Brecan as the local abbott.
* Alexander de Balscot, Bishop of Meath, died here 1400.
* Edmund Oldhall, Bishop of Meath, died here 1459.
* George Montgomery, Bishop of Meath, buried here 1621.
* Richard Pococke, English prelate and anthropologist, and briefly Bishop of Meath - buried here 1765.
* John Cowley, actor, died here 1998.
* Contested: St. Cuthbert. A Durham Cathedral tradition names Ardbraccan as the potential birthplace of St. Cuthbert (under the name &quot;Hardbrecins&quot;). However this is contested as being the result of confusion St. Colomba of nearby Kells.

<text>Fedayeen ( &quot;fidāʼiyyīn&quot; &quot;self-sacrificers&quot;) is an Arabic term used to refer to various military groups willing to sacrifice themselves for a larger campaign.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;fedayi&quot; is derived from Arabic: &quot;fidā&#x27;īyūn&quot; , literally meaning: &quot;those who sacrifice themselves&quot;.

==Medieval usage==
===Order of Assassins===

Hassan-i-Sabbah (c. 1050–1124), who founded the Order of Assassins in Persia and Syria, used the term to refer to his fanatical devotees. &quot;Fidāʼīyīn&quot; is the plural of &quot;fidāʼī&quot;, which means &quot;sacrifice.&quot; It is widely understood as &quot;those willing to sacrifice themselves for God&quot;.

==Modern usage==
=== Armenia ===
Fedayi also known as the Armenian irregular units or Armenian militia, were Armenian civilians who voluntarily left their families to form self-defense units in reaction to the mass murder of Armenians and the pillage of Armenian villages by criminals, Turkish and Kurdish gangs, Ottoman forces, and Hamidian guards between the 19th and early 20th centuries. Their ultimate goal was to gain Armenian autonomy (Armenakans) or independence (Dashnaks, Hunchaks) depending on their ideology. Some of the key Fedayi figures also participated in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution that commenced during the same period, upon agreement of the ARF leaders. 

At the onset of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Armenians of Artsakh began forming small detachments of volunteers and often self-described themselves as &quot;Fedayeen&quot;, inheriting the name of the fighters who actively resisted the Ottoman Empire in the final decades of the nineteenth and early decades of the twentieth centuries. The Fedayeen during this period worked against attempts by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and OMON units of the Azerbaijan SSR to ethnically cleanse the region of Armenians. 

The term has also been used to refer to members of the Armenian militant group ASALA.

===Ottoman Empire and Turkey===
The Committee of Union and Progress conducted assassination campaigns and called its assassins &quot;fedai&quot;, which originated from &quot;feda,&quot; deriving from the first letters of &quot;filiyas elenikis desmos anton&quot; meaning &quot;this is the tie of Greek friendship&quot;. However, &quot;feda&quot; also means sacrifice in Turkish, representing the term&#x27;s evolution which came to represent those who swore allegiance to CUP. Within the context of Turkish history, the term &quot;fedailer&quot; is often associated with the Late Ottoman or Early Republican irregular forces, known as: Kuva-yi Milliye. Those most committed Unionists who would enforce the Central Committee&#x27;s regime were also known as &quot;fedailer&quot;.

===Egypt===
During the 1940s, groups of Egyptian civilians formed &quot;fedayeen&quot; groups to contest the British occupation of Egypt, which by then was limited to the region against the Suez Canal. British forces had established numerous military outposts around the canal zone, which many Egyptians viewed as a violation of their national sovereignty. This opposition was not supported by the Egyptian government, though these &quot;fedayeen&quot; groups held broad support among the general public in Egypt.

In 1951 &quot;mobs of &quot;irregular self-sacrificers, or fedayeen&quot;, some &quot;armed by the Muslim Brotherhood&quot;, attacked British military outposts located in the Suez Canal Zone.

===Eritrea===
Known by the same name, they operated inside the capital city, Asmara, during the last 15–20 years of the armed struggle in Eritrea against the Ethiopian government. They operated secretly and eliminated people who were considered dangerous to the struggle to gain Eritrean independence, which lasted from 1961 to 1991.

===Iran===
Two very different groups used the name Fedayeen in recent Iranian history. The &quot;Fadayan-e Islam&quot; has been described as &quot;one of the first real Islamic fundamentalist organizations in the Muslim world&quot;. It was founded by Navab Safavi in 1946 for the purpose of demanding strict application of the sharia and assassinating those it believed to be apostates and enemies of Islam. After several successful assassinations it was suppressed in 1956 and several leading members were executed.

A Marxist-leaning activist group known as the Fedayeen (Fedayân in Persian language) was founded in 1971 and based in Tehran. Operating between 1971 and 1983, the Fedayeen carried out a number of political assassinations in the course of the struggle against the Shah of Iran, after which the group was suppressed.

In 1979 the Iranian People&#x27;s Fedâi Guerrillas split from the Organization of Iranian People&#x27;s Fedaian (Majority).

===Iraq===

Beginning in 1995, Iraq established a paramilitary group known as the Fedayeen Saddam, loyal to the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. The name was chosen to imply a connection with the Palestinian Fedayeen. In July 2003, personnel records for the Fedayeen organization in Iraq were discovered in the basement of the former Fedayeen headquarters in east Baghdad near the Rasheed Air Base. At the time of the discovery, the Assyrian Democratic Movement occupied the building; after an extensive cataloging process, an operation was conducted in Baghdad resulting in several individuals being detained.

===Palestine===


Palestinian fedayeen are militants of a nationalist orientation from among the Palestinian people. The fedayeen made efforts to infiltrate territory in Israel in order to strike military as well as civilian targets in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

Members of these groups were living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank or in neighboring Lebanon and Syria. Prior to Israel&#x27;s seizure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War, these areas, originally destined for a Palestinian state, were under Jordanian and Egyptian occupation, respectively. After Israel&#x27;s Operation Black Arrow in 1955, the Palestinian fedayeen were incorporated into an Egyptian army unit.

During this time (1948 – c. 1980), the word entered international usage and was frequently used in the Arab media as a synonym for great militancy. In the Israeli Hebrew press of this time the term ( &quot;fada&#x27;iun&quot;) had highly negative connotations and was associated with terrorism. Since the mid-1960s and the rise of more organized and specific militant groups, such as the Palestine Liberation Organization, the word has fallen out of usage, but not in the historical context.

== Explanatory notes ==

Derives from the word &quot;fidāʼ&quot;, which means . Literally, someone who redeems himself by risking or sacrificing his life. The pronunciation varies for the first vowel, for example , hence the transcription difference.

<doc id="181688" wikidata="Q363800" url="?curid=181688" title="Arthur I, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Arthur I (; ) (29 March 1187 – presumably 1203) was 4th Earl of Richmond and Duke of Brittany between 1196 and 1203. He was the posthumous son of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, and Constance, Duchess of Brittany. Through Geoffrey, Arthur was the grandson of King Henry II of England and Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, and the nephew of King Richard I of England.

In 1190, Arthur, whose father had died, was arguably designated heir to the throne of England and its French territory, but as he was dying in 1199, Richard I named his youngest brother John heir to the throne, as Arthur was still just a child. Philip II of France thought to make use of a potential succession crisis in England and Brittany and for awhile Arthur joined him.

Nothing is recorded of Arthur after his imprisonment by John in Rouen Castle in 1203. While his precise fate is unknown, it is generally believed he was killed by John.

==Early life==
Arthur was born in 1187, the son of Duchess Constance and Duke Geoffrey II of Brittany. Geoffrey died before Arthur was born. As an infant, Arthur was thought by some to be second in line to the succession of his paternal grandfather, King Henry II of England, after his uncle Richard. Henry II however would not name official terms of succession, not even officially naming Richard as his heir until he was close to death. Primogeniture was not yet established, nor the pathway that the crown should take. King Henry died when Arthur was 2 years old, and Richard I became the new king in his place.

While Richard was away on the Third Crusade, Arthur&#x27;s mother Constance sought to make the Duchy of Brittany more independent. On 11 November 1190, Arthur was named as Richard&#x27;s heir presumptive and was betrothed to a daughter of King Tancred of Sicily as part of their treaty. However, Emperor Henry VI conquered the Kingdom of Sicily in 1194, so the betrothal of Arthur came to nothing.

A marriage plan, originally aiming to establish an alliance between King Richard and King Philip II of France to marry Arthur&#x27;s elder sister Eleanor to Philip&#x27;s son Louis also failed. In 1196, Constance had the young Arthur proclaimed Duke of Brittany and her co-ruler as a child of nine years. The same year, Richard summoned Arthur, as well as Arthur&#x27;s mother, Constance, to Normandy, but Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, stepfather of Arthur, abducted Constance. It is believed that this was completed under the agreement, and even prompting, of Richard to bring Constance and Arthur under his control, as it is extremely unlikely that Ranulf would have made such a move against Richard&#x27;s sister-in-law and nephew without such permission. Constance was captured, but Arthur was spirited away to the Court of Philip II of France, to be brought up with Louis.
When Richard died on 6 April 1199, on his deathbed he proclaimed his brother John as his heir, fearing Arthur was too young to look after the throne, but also under the influence of Philip II. Arthur was only twelve years old at the time. John immediately claimed the throne of England, but much of the Norman nobility were resentful, or concerned, at recognising him as their overlord based upon previous experiences and issues with him, such as when Richard was away on Crusade and John gave away Plantagenet lands to Philip II in an attempt to take control while Richard was absent. They preferred Arthur, who declared himself vassal of Philip, but also was the Duke of Brittany. Philip recognised Arthur&#x27;s right to Anjou, Maine, and Poitou. Upon Richard&#x27;s death Arthur led a force to Anjou and Maine. From 18 April, he styled himself as Duke of Brittany, Count of Anjou and Earl of Richmond.

On 18 September, John persuaded the seneschal of Anjou, William des Roches, to defect, claiming Arthur would be a Capetian puppet. Four days later William took Arthur and Constance prisoners to Le Mans. Viscount Aimery, the seneschal appointed by John, took Arthur and Constance and fled the court to Angers, and later the court of Philip II.

==Treaty of Le Goulet==
The Treaty of Le Goulet was signed by the kings John of England and Philip II of France in May 1200 and meant to settle once and for all the claims the Norman kings of England had as Norman dukes on French lands, including, at least for a time, Brittany. Under the terms of the treaty, Philip recognised John as King of England as heir of his brother Richard I and thus formally abandoned any support for Arthur. John, meanwhile, recognised Philip as the suzerain of continental possessions of the Angevin Empire.

Philip had previously recognised John as suzerain of Anjou and the Duchy of Brittany, but with this he extorted 20,000 marks sterling in payment for recognition of John&#x27;s sovereignty of Brittany.

==Battle against John of England==
After the signing of the Treaty of Le Goulet, and feeling offended by Philip, Arthur fled to John, his uncle, and was treated kindly, at least initially. However, he later became suspicious of John and fled back to Angers. Some unidentified source said that in April 1202, Arthur was again betrothed, this time to Marie of France, a daughter of Philip II and Agnes of Andechs-Merania.

After his return to France, and with the support of Philip II, Arthur embarked on a campaign in Normandy against John in 1202. Poitou revolted in support of Arthur. The Duke of Brittany besieged his grandmother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, John&#x27;s mother, in the Château de Mirebeau. John marched on Mirebeau, taking Arthur by surprise on 31 July 1202. Arthur was captured by John&#x27;s barons on 1 August, and imprisoned in the Château de Falaise in Falaise, Normandy.

==Imprisonment and disappearance==
Arthur was guarded by Hubert de Burgh at the Chateau de Falaise. According to contemporaneous chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, John ordered two of his servants to blind and castrate the duke. De Burgh could not bring himself to let Arthur be mutilated. Fearful of John, de Burgh leaked news that Arthur had died of natural causes. This news infuriated Brittany, who suspected that Arthur had been murdered. The following year Arthur was transferred to Rouen, under the charge of William de Braose. Arthur vanished in April 1203, in the background of several military victories by Philip II of France against King John.

Arthur&#x27;s disappearance gave rise to various stories. One account was that Arthur&#x27;s gaolers feared to harm him, and so he was murdered by John directly and his body dumped in the Seine. The &quot;Margam Annals&quot; provide the following account of Arthur&#x27;s death:

William de Braose is also rumoured to have murdered Arthur. After the young man&#x27;s disappearance, he rose high in John&#x27;s favour receiving new lands and titles in the Welsh Marches. Many years after Arthur&#x27;s disappearance, and just prior to a conflict with King John, de Braose&#x27;s wife Maud de Braose accused the king of murdering Arthur. 

Not only the Bretons, but even Philip II, were ignorant of what actually happened, and whether Arthur was alive or dead. Whatever his fate, Arthur left no known issue. William promised to direct the attack of Mirebeau on condition he was consulted on the fate of Arthur, but John broke the promise, causing him to leave John along with Aimeri of Thouars and siege Angers.

==Succession==
The mystery surrounding Arthur&#x27;s death complicated his succession. This succession was presumably influenced by both King John and King Philip II. There were no male heirs to the ducal crown and so his succession as duke was constrained to several choices among his sisters.

His sister Eleanor, the &#x27;Fair Maid of Brittany&#x27;, was also King John&#x27;s prisoner. Eleanor also presented a complicating factor, if not a threat, to John&#x27;s succession plans as King of England. While permitted by John to claim her rights to Brittany, she remained imprisoned for the rest of her life, through the reign of John&#x27;s actual successor, his son Henry III of England. While imprisoned, she never married and had no issue. Her imprisonment and the fact that she was located in England made it impossible for her to reign as hereditary Duchess of Brittany. John allowed her to succeed Richmond but gave her no lands of the Earldom.

Arthur I was succeeded by his half-sister, Alix of Thouars, the daughter of Constance and her third husband Guy of Thouars.

==Memorial==
In 1268, Henry III gave the manor of Melksham, Wiltshire, to Amesbury for the souls of Eleanor and Arthur, ordering the convent to commemorate them along with all kings and queens.

==Legacy==
===In literature===
The death of Arthur is a vital ingredient in Shakespeare&#x27;s history play &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot;, in which Arthur is portrayed as a child whose innocence dissuades Hubert de Burgh from committing the murder demanded by King John. However, Arthur soon dies after jumping from his place of confinement in an escape attempt.

In the 19th century, the Breton poet Auguste Brizeux wrote of Arthur in &quot;La chasse du Prince Arthur&quot;.

In the novel &quot;Saving Grace&quot; by Julie Garwood, the heroine finds documents relating to Arthur&#x27;s murder, committed under the orders of King John, by two of King John&#x27;s barons. She is married to a Scottish Laird, Gabriel MacBain, to escape England, but is harassed by both King John&#x27;s barons and the English faction hoping to take down King John, each party unsure of how much she knows.

In Randall Garrett&#x27;s alternative-history fantasy stories, the Lord Darcy series, King Richard survives. John Lackland never becomes king, and the Plantagenet line, descending from Arthur, continues down to the present day.

In &quot;The Devil and King John&quot; by the Australian novelist Philip Lindsay, Arthur is killed by John in a fit of temper, but he is shown as a rebellious adolescent who did provoke John to some extent, rather than the innocent child in some versions. In his introduction, Lindsay acknowledged that he had no evidence that this is what happened to Arthur, but he considered it to be as good a guess as any.

Other literary works featuring Arthur include:
* &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (c.1589) anonymous tragedy
* &quot;Below the Salt&quot; (1957) novel by Thomas B. Costain
* &quot;Jean sans Terre ou la mort d’Arthur&quot; (1791) tragedy by Jean-François Ducis

* &quot;Devil’s Brood&quot; (2008), &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2011) and &quot;A King’s Ransom&quot; (2014) novels by Sharon Kay Penman

===In music===
In 1912 the Breton composer Joseph-Guy Ropartz composed a symphonic poem, &quot;La Chasse du Prince Arthur&quot; (Prince Arthur&#x27;s Hunt) after the poem by Brizeux. The Breton folk-rock band Tri Yann&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Portraits&quot; includes a song about Arthur.

===On television===
Arthur and his mother Constance appear as characters in a number of episodes of the 1950s British TV series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Arthur is portrayed by actors Peter Asher (three episodes, seasons one and two), Richard O&#x27;Sullivan (one episode, season three) and Jonathan Bailey (one episode, season four). Simon Gipps-Kent portrayed Arthur&#x27;s life and torturous death in the 1978 BBC series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot;.

<doc id="181690" wikidata="Q3044828" url="?curid=181690" title="Names of China">
<text>The names of China include the many contemporary and historical designations given in various languages for the East Asian country known as in Standard Chinese, a form based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin.

The English name &quot;China&quot; was borrowed from Portuguese during the 16th century, and its direct cognates became common in the subsequent centuries in the West. It is believed to be a borrowing from Middle Persian, and some have traced it further back to the Sanskrit word () for the nation. It is also thought that the ultimate source of the name China is the Chinese word , the name of the Qin dynasty that ultimately unified China after existing as a state within the Zhou dynasty for many centuries prior. However, there are alternative suggestions for the etymology of this word.

Chinese names for China, aside from &quot;Zhongguo&quot;, include , , and . While official notions of Chinese nationality do not make any particular reference to ethnicity, common names for the largest ethnic group in China are and . The People&#x27;s Republic of China () and the Republic of China () are the official names of the two governments presently claiming sovereignty over &quot;China&quot;. The term &quot;mainland China&quot; refers to areas under the PRC&#x27;s jurisdiction, either including or excluding Hong Kong and Macau.

There are also names for China used around the world that are derived from the languages of ethnic groups other than Han Chinese: examples include &quot;Cathay&quot; from the Khitan language, and from Tuoba. The realm ruled by the Emperor of China is also referred to as Chinese Empire.

== Sinitic names ==

=== Zhongguo ===
==== Pre-Qing ====


 is the most common Chinese name for China in modern times. The earliest appearance of this two-character term is on the bronze vessel He &quot;zun&quot; (dating to 1038–), during the early Western Zhou period. The phrase &quot;zhong guo&quot; came into common usage in the Warring States period (475–221 BCE), when it referred to the &quot;Central States&quot;, the states of the Yellow River Valley of the Zhou era, as distinguished from the tribal periphery. In later periods, however, &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was not used in this sense. Dynastic names were used for the state in Imperial China, and concepts of the state aside from the ruling dynasty were little understood. Rather, the country was called by the name of the dynasty, such as &quot;Han&quot;, &quot;Tang&quot;, &quot;Great Ming&quot;, &quot;Great Qing&quot;, etc. Until the 19th century, when the international system began to require a common legal language, there was no need for a fixed or unique name.

As early as the Spring and Autumn period, &quot;Zhongguo&quot; could be understood as either the domain of the capital or used to refer to the Chinese civilization or , and the political and geographical domain that contained it, but Tianxia was the more common word for this idea. This developed into the usage of the Warring States period, when, other than the cultural community, it could be the geopolitical area of Chinese civilization, equivalent to Jiuzhou. In a more limited sense, it could also refer to the Central Plain or the states of Zhao, Wei, and Han, etc., geographically central among the Warring States. Although &quot;Zhongguo&quot; could be used before the Song dynasty period to mean the trans-dynastic Chinese culture or civilization to which Chinese people belonged, it was in the Song dynasty that writers used &quot;Zhongguo&quot; as a term to describe the trans-dynastic entity with different dynastic names over time but having a set territory and defined by common ancestry, culture, and language.

The term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was used differently in every period. It could refer to the capital of the emperor to distinguish it from the capitals of his vassals, as in Western Zhou. It could refer to the states of the Central Plain to distinguish them from states in the outer regions. The &quot;Shi Jing&quot; defines &quot;Zhongguo&quot; as the capital region, setting it in opposition to the capital city. During the Han dynasty, three usages of &quot;Zhongguo&quot; were common. The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; use &quot;Zhongguo&quot; to denote the capital and also use the concepts &quot;zhong&quot; (&quot;center, central&quot;) and &quot;zhongguo&quot; to indicate the center of civilization: &quot;There are eight famous mountains in the world: three in Man and Yi (the barbarian wilds), five in &quot;Zhōngguó&quot;.&quot; () In this sense, the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; is synonymous with and , names of China that were first authentically attested in the Warring States period and Eastern Jin period, respectively.

From the Qin to the Ming dynasty, literati discussed &quot;Zhongguo&quot; as both a historical place or territory and as a culture. Writers of the Ming period in particular used the term as a political tool to express opposition to expansionist policies that incorporated foreigners into the empire. In contrast, foreign conquerors typically avoided discussions of &quot;Zhongguo&quot; and instead defined membership in their empires to include both Han and non-Han peoples.

==== Qing ====
&quot;Zhongguo&quot; appeared in a formal international legal document for the first time during the Qing dynasty in the Treaty of Nerchinsk, 1689. The term was then used in communications with other states and in treaties. The Manchu rulers incorporated Inner Asian polities into their empire, and Wei Yuan, a statecraft scholar, distinguished the new territories from &quot;Zhongguo&quot;, which he defined as the 17 provinces of &quot;China proper&quot; plus the Manchu homelands in the Northeast. By the late 19th century, the term had emerged as a common name for the whole country. The empire was sometimes referred to as Great Qing but increasingly as &quot;Zhongguo&quot; (see the discussion below).

&quot;Dulimbai Gurun&quot; is the Manchu name for China, with &quot;Dulimbai&quot; meaning &quot;central&quot; or &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;Gurun&quot; meaning &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. The historian Zhao Gang writes that &quot;not long after the collapse of the Ming, China became the equivalent of Great Qing (Da Qing)—another official title of the Qing state,&quot; and &quot;Qing and China became interchangeable official titles, and the latter often appeared as a substitute for the former in official documents.&quot; The Qing dynasty referred to their realm as &quot;Dulimbai Gurun&quot; in Manchu. The Qing equated the lands of the Qing realm (including present-day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, and other areas) as &quot;China&quot; in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas; both Han and non-Han peoples were part of &quot;China&quot;.. Officials used &quot;China&quot; (though not exclusively) in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the &quot;Chinese language&quot; (Manchu: &quot;Dulimbai gurun i bithe&quot;) referred to Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term &quot;Chinese people&quot; (; Manchu: &quot;Dulimbai gurun i niyalma&quot;) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing. Ming loyalist Han literati held to defining the old Ming borders as China and using &quot;foreigner&quot; to describe minorities under Qing rule such as the Mongols and Tibetans, as part of their anti-Qing ideology.
When the Qing conquered Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land was absorbed into &quot;Dulimbai Gurun&quot; in a Manchu language memorial. The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the &quot;outer&quot; non-Han Chinese, like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans, together with the &quot;inner&quot; Han Chinese, into &quot;one family&quot; united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family. The Qing used the phrase &quot; () or &quot; (), to convey this idea of &quot;unification&quot; of the different peoples. A Manchu-language version of a treaty with the Russian Empire concerning criminal jurisdiction over bandits called people from the Qing &quot;people of the Central Kingdom (Dulimbai Gurun)&quot;. In the Manchu official Tulisen&#x27;s Manchu language account of his meeting with the Torghut Mongol leader Ayuki Khan, it was mentioned that while the Torghuts were unlike the Russians, the &quot;people of the Central Kingdom&quot; (&quot;dulimba-i gurun/&quot;) were like the Torghut Mongols, and the &quot;people of the Central Kingdom&quot; referred to the Manchus.

The geography textbooks published in the late Qing period gave detailed descriptions of China&#x27;s regional position and territorial space. They generally emphasized that China was a large country in Asia but not the center of the world. For example, the &quot;Elementary Chinese Geography Textbook&quot; (蒙學中國地理教科書) published in 1905 described the boundaries of China&#x27;s territory and neighboring countries as follows: &quot;The western border of China is located in the center of Asia, bordering the (overseas) territories of Britain and Russia. The terrain is humped, like a hat. So all mountains and rivers originate from here. To the east, it faces Japan across the East China Sea. To the south, it is adjacent to the South China Sea, and borders French Annam and British Burma. To the southwest, it is separated from British India by mountains. From the west to the north and the northeast, the three sides of China are all Russian territories. Only the southern border of the northeast is connected to Korea across the Yalu River.&quot; It further stated that &quot;There are about a dozen countries in Asia, but only China has a vast territory, a prosperous population, and dominates East Asia. It is a great and world-famous country.&quot;

The Qing enacted the first Chinese nationality law in 1909, which defined a Chinese national () as any person born to a Chinese father. Children born to a Chinese mother inherited her nationality only if the father was stateless or had unknown nationality status. These regulations were enacted in response to a 1907 statute passed in The Netherlands that retroactively treated all Chinese born in the Dutch East Indies as Dutch citizens. &quot;Jus sanguinis&quot; was chosen to define Chinese nationality so that the Qing could counter foreign claims on overseas Chinese populations and maintain the perpetual allegiance of its subjects living abroad through paternal lineage. A Chinese word called &quot;xuètǒng&quot; (), which means &quot;bloodline&quot; as a literal translation, is used to explain the descent relationship that would characterize someone as being of Chinese descent and therefore eligible under the Qing laws and beyond, for Chinese citizenship.

Mark Elliott noted that it was under the Qing that &quot;China&quot; transformed into a definition of referring to lands where the &quot;state claimed sovereignty&quot; rather than only the Central Plains area and its people by the end of the 18th century.

Elena Barabantseva also noted that the Manchu referred to all subjects of the Qing empire regardless of ethnicity as &quot;Chinese&quot; (), and used the term () as a synonym for the entire Qing empire while using ) to refer only to the core area of the empire, with the entire empire viewed as multiethnic.

Rowe wrote that the name &quot;China&quot; () was apparently understood to refer to the political realm of the Han Chinese during the Ming dynasty, and this understanding persisted among the Han Chinese into the early Qing dynasty, and the understanding was also shared by Aisin Gioro rulers before the Ming–Qing transition. The Qing, however, &quot;came to refer to their more expansive empire not only as the Great Qing but also, nearly interchangeably, as China&quot; within a few decades of this development. Instead of the earlier (Ming) idea of an ethnic Han Chinese state, this new Qing China was a &quot;self-consciously multi-ethnic state&quot;.. Han Chinese scholars had some time to adapt this, but by the 19th century, the notion of China as a multinational state with new, significantly extended borders had become the standard terminology for Han Chinese writers. Rowe noted that &quot;these were the origins of the China we know today.&quot;. He added that while the early Qing rulers viewed themselves as multi-hatted emperors who ruled several nationalities &quot;separately but simultaneously&quot;, by the mid-19th century, the Qing Empire had become part of a European-style community of sovereign states and entered into a series of treaties with the West, and such treaties and documents consistently referred to Qing rulers as the &quot;Emperor of China&quot; and his administration as the &quot;Government of China&quot;.

Joseph W. Esherick noted that while the Qing Emperors governed frontier non-Han areas in a different, separate system under the Lifanyuan and kept them separate from Han areas and administration, it was the Manchu Qing Emperors who expanded the definition of &quot;Zhongguo&quot; and made it &quot;flexible&quot; by using that term to refer to the entire Empire and using that term to other countries in diplomatic correspondence, while some Han Chinese subjects criticized their usage of the term and the Han literati Wei Yuan used &quot;Zhongguo&quot; only to refer to the seventeen provinces of China and three provinces of the east (Manchuria), excluding other frontier areas. Due to Qing using treaties clarifying the international borders of the Qing state, it was able to inculcate in the Chinese people a sense that China included areas such as Mongolia and Tibet due to education reforms in geography, which made it clear where the borders of the Qing state were, even if they didn&#x27;t understand how the Chinese identity included Tibetans and Mongolians or what the connotations of being Chinese were. The English version of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking refers to &quot;His Majesty the Emperor of China&quot; while the Chinese refers both to &quot;The Great Qing Emperor&quot; (&quot;Da Qing Huangdi&quot;) and to &quot;Zhongguo&quot; as well. The 1858 Treaty of Tientsin has similar language.

In the late 19th century, the reformer Liang Qichao argued in a famous passage that &quot;our greatest shame is that our country has no name. The names that people ordinarily think of, such as Xia, Han, or Tang, are all the titles of bygone dynasties.&quot; He argued that the other countries of the world &quot;all boast of their own state names, such as England and France, the only exception being the Central States&quot;, and that the concept of &quot;tianxia&quot; had to be abandoned in favor of &quot;guojia&quot;, that is, &quot;nation&quot;, for which he accepted the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot;. On the other hand, American Protestant missionary John Livingstone Nevius, who had been in China for 40 years, wrote in his 1868 book that the most common name which the Chinese used in speaking of their country was &quot;Zhongguo&quot;, followed by &quot;Zhonghuaguo&quot; (中華國) and other names such as &quot;Tianchao&quot; (天朝) and the particular title of the reigning dynasty. Also, the Chinese geography textbook published in 1907 stated that &quot;Chinese citizens call their country &quot;Zhongguo&quot; or &quot;Zhonghua&quot;, and noted that China (&quot;Zhongguo&quot;) was one of the few independent monarchical countries in the whole Asia at that time, along with countries like Japan. The Japanese term &quot;Shina&quot;&quot; was once proposed by some as a basically neutral Western-influenced equivalent for &quot;China&quot;. But after the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was also adopted as the abbreviation of &quot;Zhonghua minguo&quot;, and most Chinese considered &quot;Shina&quot; foreign and demanded that even the Japanese replace it with &quot;Zhonghua minguo&quot;, or simply &quot;Zhongguo&quot;.

Before the signing of the Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty in 1871, the first treaty between Qing China and the Empire of Japan, Japanese representatives once raised objections to China&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; in the treaty (partly in response to China&#x27;s earlier objections for the term &quot;Tennō&quot; or Emperor of Japan to be used in the treaty), declaring that the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was &quot;meant to compare with the frontier areas of the country&quot; and insisted that only &quot;Great Qing&quot; be used for the Qing in the Chinese version of the treaty. However, this was firmly rejected by the Qing representatives: &quot;Our country China has been called &quot;Zhongguo&quot; for a long time since ancient times. We have signed treaties with various countries, and while &quot;Great Qing&quot; did appear in the first lines of such treaties, in the body of the treaties &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was always being used. There has never been a precedent for changing the country name&quot; (我中華之稱中國，自上古迄今，由來已久。即與各國立約，首書寫大清國字樣，其條款內皆稱中國，從無寫改國號之例). The Chinese representatives believed that &quot;Zhongguo&quot; (China) as a country name equivalent to &quot;Great Qing&quot; could naturally be used internationally, which could not be changed. In the end, both sides agreed that while in the first lines &quot;Great Qing&quot; would be used, whether the Chinese text in the body of the treaty would use the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; in the same manner as &quot;Great Qing&quot; would be up to China&#x27;s discretion.
Qing official Zhang Deyi once objected to the western European name &quot;China&quot; and said that China referred to itself as &quot;Zhonghua&quot;. However, the Qing established legations and consulates known as the &quot;Chinese Legation&quot;, &quot;Imperial Consulate of China&quot;, &quot;Imperial Chinese Consulate (General)&quot; or similar names in various countries with diplomatic relations, such as the United Kingdom and United States. Both English and Chinese terms, such as &quot;China&quot; and &quot;Zhongguo&quot;, were frequently used by Qing legations and consulates there to refer to the Qing state during their diplomatic correspondences with foreign states. Moreover, the English name &quot;China&quot; was also used domestically by the Qing, such as in its officially released stamps since Qing set up a modern postal system in 1878. The postage stamps (known as in Chinese) had a design of a large dragon in the centre, surrounded by a boxed frame with a bilingual inscription of &quot;CHINA&quot; (corresponding to the Great Qing Empire in Chinese) and the local denomination &quot;CANDARINS&quot;.

During the late Qing dynasty, various textbooks with the name &quot;Chinese history&quot; (中國歷史) had emerged by the early 20th century. For example, the late Qing textbook &quot;Chinese History of the Present Dynasty&quot; published in 1910 stated that &quot;the history of our present dynasty is part of the history of China, that is, the most recent history in its whole history. China was founded as a country 5,000 years ago and has the longest history in the world. And its culture is the best among all the Eastern countries since ancient times. Its territory covers about 90% of East Asia, and its rise and fall can affect the general trend of the countries in Asia...&quot;. After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, educated students began to spread the concept of &quot;Zhonghua&quot;, which represented the people, including 55 minority ethnic groups and the Han Chinese, with a single culture identifying themselves as &quot;Chinese&quot;. The Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China both used &quot;Zhonghua&quot; in their official names. Thus, &quot;Zhongguo&quot; became the common name for both governments and for their citizens. Overseas Chinese are referred to as , or , i.e. Chinese children born overseas.

==== Middle Kingdom ====
The English translation of &quot;Zhongyuan&quot; as the &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; entered European languages through the Portuguese in the 16th century and became popular in the mid-19th century. By the mid-20th century, the term was thoroughly entrenched in the English language, reflecting the Western view of China as the inward-looking Middle Kingdom, or more accurately, the &quot;Central Kingdom&quot; or &quot;Central State&quot;. Endymion Wilkinson points out that the Chinese were not unique in thinking of their country as central, although China was the only culture to use the concept for its name. However, the term &quot;Zhongguo&quot; was not initially used as a name for China. It did not have the same meaning throughout the course of history (see above).

During the 19th century, China was alternatively (although less commonly) referred to in the west as the &quot;Middle Flowery Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Central Flowery Kingdom&quot;, or &quot;Central Flowery State&quot;, translated from &quot;Zhōnghuáguó&quot; (中華國; 中华国), or simply the &quot;&quot;, translated from &quot;Huáguó&quot; (華國; 华国). However, some have since argued that such a translation (fairly commonly seen at that time) was perhaps caused by misunderstanding the Huá (華; 华) that means &quot;China&quot; (or &quot;magnificent, splendid&quot;) for the Huā (花) that means &quot;flower&quot;.

=== Huaxia ===
The name is generally used as a sobriquet in Chinese text. Under traditional interpretations, it is the combination of two words that originally referred to the elegance of traditional Han attire and the Confucian concept of rites.
* &quot;Hua,&quot; which means &quot;flowery beauty&quot; (i.e., having beauty of dress and personal adornment ).
* &quot;Xia,&quot; which means greatness or grandeur (i.e., having greatness in social customs, courtesy, polite manners and rites/ceremony ).

In the original sense, Huaxia refers to a confederation of tribes—living along the Yellow River—who were the ancestors of what later became the Han ethnic group in China. During the Warring States (475–221 BCE), the self-awareness of the Huaxia identity developed and took hold in ancient China.

=== Zhonghua minzu ===
&quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; is a term meaning &quot;Chinese nation&quot; in the sense of a multi-ethnic national identity. Though originally rejected by the PRC, it has been used officially since the 1980s for nationalist politics.

=== Tianchao and Tianxia ===

&quot;Tianchao&quot; (; ), translated as &#x27;heavenly dynasty&#x27; or &#x27;Celestial Empire&#x27;, and &quot;Tianxia&quot; (; ) translated as &#x27;All under heaven&#x27;, have both been used to refer to China. These terms were usually used in the context of civil wars or periods of division, with the term &quot;Tianchao&quot; evoking the idea that the realm&#x27;s ruling dynasty was appointed by heaven, or that whoever ends up reunifying China is said to have ruled &quot;Tianxia&quot;, or everything under heaven. This fits with the traditional Chinese theory of rulership, in which the emperor was nominally the political leader of the entire world and not merely the leader of a nation-state within the world. Historically, the term was connected to the later Zhou dynasty (), especially the Spring and Autumn period (eighth to fourth century BCE) and the Warring States period (from there to 221 BCE, when China was reunified by Qin). The phrase &quot;Tianchao&quot; continues to see use on Chinese internet discussion boards, in reference to China.

The phrase &quot;Tianchao&quot; was first translated into English and French in the early 19th century, appearing in foreign publications and diplomatic correspondences, with the translated phrase &quot;Celestial Empire&quot; occasionally used to refer to China. During this period, the term &quot;celestial&quot; was used by some to refer to the subjects of the Qing in a non-prejudicial manner, derived from the term &quot;Celestial Empire&quot;. However, the term &quot;celestial&quot; was also used in a pejorative manner during the 19th century, in reference to Chinese immigrants in Australasia and North America. The translated phrase has largely fallen into disuse in the 20th century.

=== Jiangshan and Shanhe ===
The two names and , both literally &#x27;rivers and mountains&#x27;, quite similar in usage to &quot;Tianxia&quot;, simply referring to the entire world, the most prominent features of which being rivers and mountains. The use of this term is also common as part of the idiom , in a suggestion of the need to implement good governance.

=== Jiuzhou ===
The name means &#x27;nine provinces&#x27;. Widely used in pre-modern Chinese text, the word originated during the middle of the Warring States period. During that time, the Yellow River region was divided into nine geographical regions; thus this name was coined. Some people also attribute this word to the mythical hero and king Yu the Great, who, in the legend, divided China into nine provinces during his reign.

=== Han ===
The name &quot;Han&quot; () derives from the Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 220), which presided over China&#x27;s first &quot;golden age&quot;.. The Han dynasty collapsed in 220 and was followed by a long period of disorder, including Three Kingdoms, Sixteen Kingdoms, and Southern and Northern dynasties periods. During these periods, various non-Han ethnic groups established various dynasties in northern China. It was during this period that people began to use the term &quot;Han&quot; to refer to the natives of North China, who (unlike the minorities) were the descendants of the subjects of the Han dynasty.

During the Yuan dynasty, subjects of the empire were divided into four classes: Mongols, Semu, Han, and &quot;Southerns&quot;. Northern Chinese were called Han, which was considered to be the highest class of Chinese. This class, &quot;Han,&quot; includes all ethnic groups in northern China, including Khitan and Jurchen who have, for the most part, sinicized during the last two hundreds years. The name &quot;Han&quot; became popularly accepted.

During the Qing, the Manchu rulers also used the name Han to distinguish the natives of the Central Plains from the Manchus. After the fall of the Qing government, the Han became the name of a nationality within China. Today, the term &quot;Han persons&quot;, often rendered in English as &quot;Han Chinese&quot;, is used by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to refer to the most populous of the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China.

=== Tang ===
The name &quot;Tang&quot; () comes from the Tang dynasty (618–907) that presided over China&#x27;s second golden age. It was during the Tang dynasty that South China was finally and fully sinicized; Tang would become synonymous with China in Southern China, and it is usually Southern Chinese who refer to themselves as &quot;People of Tang&quot; (, ). For example, the sinicization and rapid development of Guangdong during the Tang period would lead the Cantonese to refer to themselves as &quot;Tong-yan&quot; () in Cantonese, while China is called &quot;Tong-saan&quot; (; ). Chinatowns worldwide, often dominated by Southern Chinese, also became referred to as &quot;Tang People&#x27;s Street&quot; (, Cantonese: Tong-yan-gaai; ). The Cantonese term &quot;Tongsan&quot; (Tang mountain) is recorded in Old Malay as one of the local terms for China, along with the Sanskrit-derived &quot;Cina&quot;. It is still used in Malaysia today, usually in a derogatory sense.

Among Taiwanese, &quot;Tang mountain&quot; (Min-Nan: Tng-soa) has been used, for example, in the saying, &quot;has Tangshan father, no Tangshan mother&quot; (; ). This refers to how the Han people crossing the Taiwan Strait in the 17th and 18th centuries were mostly men, and that many of their offspring would be through intermarriage with Taiwanese aborigine women.

In Ryukyuan, karate was originally called &quot;tii&quot; (, hand) or &quot;karatii&quot; (, Tang hand) because &quot;too-nu-kuku&quot; or &quot;kara-nu-kuku&quot; () was a common Ryukyuan name for China; it was changed to &quot;karate&quot; (, open hand) to appeal to Japanese people after the First Sino-Japanese War.

Zhu Yu, who wrote during the Northern Song dynasty, noted that the name &quot;Han&quot; was first used by the northwestern &#x27;barbarians&#x27; to refer to China, while the name &quot;Tang&quot; was first used by the southeastern &#x27;barbarians&#x27; to refer to China, and these terms subsequently influenced the local Chinese terminology. During the Mongol invasions of Japan, the Japanese distinguished between the &quot;Han&quot; of northern China, who, like the Mongols and Koreans, were not to be taken prisoner, and the Newly Submitted Army of southern China, whom they called &quot;Tang&quot;, who would be enslaved instead.

=== Dalu and Neidi ===
&quot;Dàlù&quot; (/; ), literally &quot;big continent&quot; or &quot;mainland&quot; in this context, is used as a short form of &quot;Zhōnggúo Dàlù&quot; (/, mainland China), excluding (depending on the context) Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. This term is used in official contexts on both the mainland and Taiwan when referring to the mainland as opposed to Taiwan. In certain contexts, it is equivalent to the term &quot;Neidi&quot; (; , literally &quot;the inner land&quot;). While &quot;Neidi&quot; generally refers to the interior as opposed to a particular coastal or border location, or the coastal or border regions generally, it is used in Hong Kong specifically to mean mainland China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. , for example, in reference to the separate judicial and customs jurisdictions of mainland China on the one hand and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan on the other.

The term &quot;Neidi&quot; is also often used in Xinjiang and Tibet to distinguish the eastern provinces of China from the minority-populated, autonomous regions of the west.

== Official names ==
=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
The name New China has been frequently applied to China by the Chinese Communist Party as a positive political and social term contrasting pre-1949 China (the establishment of the PRC) and the new name of the socialist state, Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó (in the older postal romanization, Chunghwa Jenmin Konghokuo), or the &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; in English, which was adapted from the CCP&#x27;s short-lived Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931. This term is also sometimes used by writers outside of mainland China. The PRC was known to many in the West during the Cold War as &quot;Communist China&quot; or &quot;Red China&quot; to distinguish it from the Republic of China which is commonly called &quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Nationalist China&quot;, or &quot;Free China&quot;. In some contexts, particularly in economics, trade, and sports, &quot;China&quot; is often used to refer to mainland China to the exclusion of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

=== Republic of China ===
In 1912, China adopted its official name, Chunghwa Minkuo (rendered in pinyin Zhōnghuá Mínguó) or in English as the &quot;Republic of China&quot;, which has also sometimes been referred to as &quot;Republican China&quot; or the &quot;Republican Era&quot; (), in contrast to the Qing dynasty it replaced, or as &quot;Nationalist China&quot;, after the ruling Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang). (&quot;Chunghwa&quot;) is a term that pertains to &quot;China&quot;, while (&quot;Minkuo&quot;), literally &quot;People&#x27;s State&quot; or &quot;Peopledom&quot;, stands for &quot;republic&quot;.. The name stems from the party manifesto of Tongmenghui in 1905, which says the four goals of the Chinese revolution were &quot;to expel the Manchu rulers, to revive &quot;Chunghwa&quot;, to establish a Republic, and to distribute land equally among the people. The convener of Tongmenghui and Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen proposed the name &quot;Chunghwa Minkuo&quot; as the assumed name of the new country when the revolution succeeded.

Since the separation from mainland China in 1949 as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the territory of the Republic of China has largely been confined to the island of Taiwan and some other small islands. Thus, the country is often simply referred to as simply &quot;Taiwan&quot;, although this may not be perceived as politically neutral. Amid the hostile rhetoric of the Cold War, the government and its supporters sometimes referred to themselves as &quot;Free China&quot; or &quot;Liberal China&quot;, in contrast to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which was historically called the &quot;Bandit-occupied Area&quot; () by the ROC. In addition, the ROC, due to pressure from the PRC, uses the name &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot; () whenever it participates in international forums or most sporting events such as the Olympic Games.

Taiwanese politician Mei Feng had criticised the official English name of the state, &quot;Republic of China&quot;, for failing to translate the Chinese character &quot;Min&quot; (; English: people) according to Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s original interpretations, while the name should instead be translated as &quot;the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;, which confuses with the current official name of China under communist control. To avoid confusion, the Chen Shui-ban led DPP administration began to add &quot;Taiwan&quot; next to the nation&#x27;s official name since 2005.

== Names in non-Sinic records ==
Names used in the parts of Asia, especially East and Southeast Asia, are usually derived directly from words in one of the languages of China. Those languages belonging to a former dependency (tributary) or Chinese-influenced country have an especially similar pronunciation to that of Chinese. Those used in Indo-European languages, however, have indirect names that came via other routes and may bear little resemblance to what is used in China.

=== China ===
English, most Indo-European languages, and many others use various forms of the name &quot;China&quot; and the prefix &quot;Sino-&quot; or &quot;Sin-&quot; from the Latin &quot;Sina&quot;. Europeans had knowledge of a country known in Greek as &quot;Thina&quot; or &quot;Sina&quot; from the early period; the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; from perhaps the first century AD recorded a country known as &quot;Thin&quot; (&quot;θίν&quot;). The English name for &quot;China&quot; itself is derived from Middle Persian (&quot;Chīnī&quot; ). This modern word &quot;China&quot; was first used by Europeans starting with Portuguese explorers of the 16th century – it was first recorded in 1516 in the journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. The journal was translated and published in England in 1555.

The traditional etymology, proposed in the 17th century by Martin Martini and supported by later scholars such as Paul Pelliot and Berthold Laufer, is that the word &quot;China&quot; and its related terms are ultimately derived from the polity known as Qin that unified China to form the Qin dynasty (Old Chinese: &quot;*dzin&quot;) in the 3rd century BC, but existed as a state on the furthest west of China since the 9th century BC. This is still the most commonly held theory, although the etymology is still a matter of debate according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and many other suggestions have been mooted.

The existence of the word &quot;Cīna&quot; in ancient Indian texts was noted by the Sanskrit scholar Hermann Jacobi who pointed out its use in the Book 2 of &quot;Arthashastra&quot; with reference to silk and woven cloth produced by the country of &quot;Cīna&quot;, although textual analysis suggests that Book 2 may not have been written long before 150 AD. The word is also found in other Sanskrit texts such as the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Laws of Manu&quot;. The Indologist Patrick Olivelle argued that the word &quot;Cīnā&quot; may not have been known in India before the first century BC, nevertheless he agreed that it probably referred to Qin but thought that the word itself was derived from a Central Asian language. Some Chinese and Indian scholars argued for the state of Jing (, another name for Chu) as the likely origin of the name. Another suggestion, made by Geoff Wade, is that the &quot; Cīnāh&quot; in Sanskrit texts refers to an ancient kingdom centered in present-day Guizhou, called Yelang, in the south Tibeto-Burman highlands. The inhabitants referred to themselves as &quot;Zina&quot; according to Wade.

The term &quot;China&quot; can also be used to refer to:
* a modern state, indicating the PRC or ROC;
* &quot;Mainland China&quot; (, which is the territory of the PRC minus the two regions of Hong Kong and Macau;
* &quot;China proper&quot;, a term used to refer to the historical heartlands of China without peripheral areas like Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang

In economic contexts, &quot;Greater China&quot; () is intended to be a neutral and non-political way to refer to mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

Sinologists usually use &quot;Chinese&quot; in a more restricted sense, akin to the classical usage of &quot;Zhongguo&quot;, to the Han ethnic group, which makes up the bulk of the population in China and of the overseas Chinese.

=== Seres, Ser, Serica ===
 () was the Ancient Greek and Roman name for the northwestern part of China and its inhabitants. It meant &#x27;of silk&#x27;, or &#x27;land where silk comes from&#x27;. The name is thought to derive from the Chinese word for silk, ; Middle Chinese , Old Chinese , per Zhengzhang). It is itself at the origin of the Latin for &#x27;silk&#x27;, .

This may be a back formation from (), &#x27;made of silk&#x27;, from (), &#x27;silkworm&#x27;, in which case is &#x27;the land where silk comes from&#x27;.

=== Sinae, Sin ===
 was an ancient Greek and Roman name for some people who dwelt south of Serica in the eastern extremity of the habitable world. References to the Sinae include mention of a city that the Romans called , which may be modern Chang&#x27;an. The Latin prefix as well as words such as , which are traditionally used to refer to China, came from . It is generally thought that , and are variants that ultimately derived from &quot;Qin&quot;, the western Zhou-era state that eventually founded the Qin dynasty. There are other opinions on its etymology: Henry Yule thought that this term may have come to Europe through the Arabs, who made the China of the farther east into &quot;Sin&quot;, and perhaps sometimes into . Hence the &quot;Thin&quot; of the author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, who appears to be the first extant writer to employ the name in this form; hence also the Sinae and Thinae of Ptolemy.

Some denied that Ptolemy&#x27;s Sinae really represented the Chinese as Ptolemy called the country &quot;Sērice&quot; and the capital &quot;Sēra&quot;, but regarded them as distinct from . Marcian of Heraclea, a condenser of Ptolemy, tells us that the &quot;nations of the Sinae lie at the extremity of the habitable world, and adjoin the eastern Terra incognita&quot;. The 6th century Cosmas Indicopleustes refers to a &quot;country of silk&quot; called &quot;Tzinista&quot;, which is understood as referring to China, beyond which &quot;there is neither navigation nor any land to inhabit&quot;. It seems probable that the same region is meant by both. According to Henry Yule, Ptolemy&#x27;s misrendering of the Indian Sea as a closed basin meant that Ptolemy must also have misplaced the Chinese coast, leading to the misconception of Serica and Sina as separate countries.

In the Hebrew Bible, there is a mention of the faraway country &quot;Sinim&quot; in the Book of Isaiah 49:12 which some had assumed to be a reference to China. In Genesis 10:17, a tribes called the &quot;Sinites&quot; were said to be the descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham, but they are usually considered to be a different people, probably from the northern part of Lebanon.

=== Cathay or Kitay ===
These names derive from the Khitan people that originated in Manchuria and conquered parts of northern China during the early 10th century to form the Liao dynasty, and dominated Central Asia during the 12th century as the Kara Khitan Khanate. Due to the long period of political relevance, the name &quot;Khitan&quot; become associated with China. Muslim historians referred to the Kara Khitan state as &quot;Khitay&quot; or &quot;Khitai&quot;; they may have adopted this form of &quot;Khitan&quot; via the Uyghurs of Qocho, in whose language the final 
&quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-ń&quot; became &quot;-y&quot;. The name was then introduced to medieval and early modern Europe through Islamic and Russian sources. In English and in several other European languages, the name &quot;Cathay&quot; was used in the translations of the adventures of Marco Polo, which used this word for northern China. Words related to Khitay are still used in many Turkic and Slavic languages to refer to China. However, its use by Turkic speakers within China, such as the Uyghurs, is considered pejorative by the Chinese authority who tried to ban it.

There is no evidence that either in the 13th or 14th century, Cathayans, &quot;i.e.&quot; Chinese, travelled officially to Europe, but it is possible that some did, in unofficial capacities, at least in the 13th century. During the campaigns of Hulagu (the grandson of Genghis Khan) in Persia (1256–65), and the reigns of his successors, Chinese engineers were employed on the banks of the Tigris, and Chinese astrologers and physicians could be consulted. Many diplomatic communications passed between the Hulaguid Ilkhans and Christian princes. The former, as the great khan&#x27;s liegemen, still received from him their seals of state; and two of their letters which survive in the archives of France exhibit the vermilion impressions of those seals in Chinese characters—perhaps affording the earliest specimen of those characters to reach western Europe.

=== Tabgach ===
The word &quot;Tabgach&quot; came from the metatheses of &quot;Tuoba&quot; (&quot;*t&#x27;akbat&quot;), a dominant tribe of the Xianbei and the surname of the Northern Wei emperors in the 5th century before sinicisation. It referred to Northern China, which was dominated by part-Xianbei, part-Han people.

This name is re-translated back into Chinese as &quot;Taohuashi&quot; (). This name has been used in China in recent years to promote ethnic unity.

=== Taugast ===
In the works of Byzantine Historian Theophylact Simocatta, written in the early 7th Century, Tang China was referred to as &quot;Taugast&quot; (Byzantine Greek: Ταυγάστ). This name is likely related to Tabgach.

=== Nikan ===
&quot;Nikan&quot; (Manchu: ) was a Manchu ethnonym of unknown origin that referred specifically to the Han Chinese; the stem of this word was also conjugated as a verb, , which meant &#x27;to speak the Chinese language&#x27;. Since &quot;Nikan&quot; was essentially an ethnonym and referred to a group of people rather than to a political body, the correct translation of &quot;China&quot; into Manchu is &quot;Nikan gurun&quot;, &#x27;country of the Han&#x27;. 

This exonym for the Han Chinese is also used in the Daur language, in which it appears as &quot;Niaken&quot; ( or ). As in the case of the Manchu language, the Daur word &quot;Niaken&quot; is essentially an ethnonym, and the proper way to refer to the country of the Han Chinese (i.e., &quot;China&quot; in a cultural sense) is &quot;Niaken gurun&quot;, while &quot;niakendaaci-&quot; is a verb meaning &quot;to talk in Chinese&quot;.

=== Kara ===
Japanese: &quot;Kara&quot; (; variously written as or ). An identical name was used by the ancient and medieval Japanese to refer to the country that is now known as Korea, and many Japanese historians and linguists believe that the word &quot;Kara&quot; referring to China and/or Korea may have derived from a metonymic extension of the appellation of the ancient city-states of Gaya.

The Japanese word &quot;karate&quot; (, lit. &quot;empty hand&quot;) is derived from the Okinawan word &quot;karatii&quot; (, lit. &quot;Chinese/Asian/foreign hand/trick/means/method/style&quot;) and refers to Okinawan martial arts; the character for &quot;kara&quot; was changed to remove the connotation of the style originating in China.

=== Morokoshi ===
Japanese: &quot;Morokoshi&quot; (; variously written as or ). This obsolete Japanese name for China is believed to have derived from a &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; reading of the Chinese compound &quot;Zhūyuè&quot; or 
&quot;Baiyue&quot; as &quot;all the Yue&quot; or &quot;the hundred (i.e., myriad, various, or numerous) Yue,&quot; which was an ancient Chinese name for the societies of the regions that are now southern China.

The Japanese common noun &quot;tōmorokoshi&quot; (, ), which refers to maize, appears to contain an element cognate with the proper noun formerly used in reference to China. Although &quot;tōmorokoshi&quot; is traditionally written with Chinese characters that literally mean &quot;jade Shu millet&quot;, the etymology of the Japanese word appears to go back to &quot;Tang morokoshi&quot;, in which &quot;morokoshi&quot; was the obsolete Japanese name for China as well as the Japanese word for sorghum, which seems to have been introduced into Japan from China.

=== Mangi ===

From Chinese &quot;Manzi&quot; (southern barbarians). The division of north and south China under the Jin dynasty and Song dynasty weakened the idea of a unified China, and it was common for non-Han peoples to refer to the politically disparate North and South by different names for some time. While Northern China was called Cathay, Southern China was referred to as Mangi. Manzi often appears in documents of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty as a disparaging term for Southern China. The Mongols also called Southern Chinese &quot;Nangkiyas&quot; or &quot;Nangkiyad&quot;, and considered them ethnically distinct from North Chinese. The word &quot;Manzi&quot; reached the Western world as (as used by Marco Polo), which is a name commonly found on medieval maps. Note however that the Chinese themselves considered &quot;Manzi&quot; to be derogatory and never used it as a self-appellation. Some early scholars believed to be a corruption of the Persian &quot;Machin&quot; () and Arabic (), which may be a mistake as these two forms are derived from the Sanskrit &quot;Maha Chin&quot; meaning Great China.

===Sungsong===
In some Philippine languages, Sungsong or Sungsung was a historical and archaic name for China. In Tiruray, the name meant specifically for Hong Kong. The name comes from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *suŋsuŋ, which meant &quot;to go against wind or current&quot;. Its application to China in Philippine languages presumably is connected with sailing problems in reaching mainland China from the Philippines.

== Sign names ==
The name for China in Chinese Sign Language is performed by trailing the tip of one&#x27;s fingertip horizontally across the upper end of the chest, from the non-dominant side to the dominant one, and then vertically downwards. Many sign languages have adopted the Chinese sign as a loanword; this includes American Sign Language, in which this has happened across dialects, from Canada to California, replacing previous signs indicating East Asian people&#x27;s typical epicanthic fold, now considered offensive.

Multiple other languages have borrowed the sign as well, with some modifications. In Estonian Sign Language, the index finger moves diagonally to the non-dominant side instead of vertically downwards, and in French and Israeli Sign Language, the thumb is used instead. Some other languages use unrelated signs. For example, in Hong Kong Sign Language, the extended dominant index and middle fingers, held together, tap twice the non-dominant ones in the same handshape, palm downwards, in front of the signer&#x27;s chest; in Taiwanese Sign Language, both hands are flat, with extended thumbs and other fingers held together and pointing sideways, palms towards the signer, move up and down together repeatedly in front of the signer&#x27;s chest.

<text>The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a proposal by the United Nations to partition Mandatory Palestine at the end of the British Mandate. Drafted by the U.N. Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) on 3 September 1947, the Plan was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 29 November 1947 as Resolution 181 (II). The resolution recommended the creation of independent but economically linked Arab and Jewish States and an extraterritorial &quot;Special International Regime&quot; for the city of Jerusalem and its surroundings.

The Partition Plan, a four-part document attached to the resolution, provided for the termination of the Mandate; the gradual withdrawal of British armed forces by no later than 1 August 1948; and the delineation of boundaries between the two States and Jerusalem at least two months after the withdrawal, but no later than 1 October 1948. The Arab state was to have a territory of 11,592 square kilometres, or 42.88 percent of the Mandate&#x27;s territory, and the Jewish state a territory of 15,264 square kilometres, or 56.47 percent; the remaining 0.65 percent or 176 square kilometres—comprising Jerusalem, Bethlehem and the adjoining area—would become an international zone. The Plan also called for an economic union between the proposed states and for the protection of religious and minority rights.

The Plan sought to address the conflicting objectives and claims of two competing movements: Palestinian nationalism and Jewish nationalism in the form of Zionism. Jewish organizations collaborated with UNSCOP during the deliberations, while Palestinian Arab leadership boycotted it. The Plan&#x27;s detractors considered the proposal to be pro-Zionist, as it allocated most land to the Jewish state despite Palestinian Arabs numbering twice the Jewish population. The Plan was celebrated by most Jews in Palestine and reluctantly accepted by the Jewish Agency for Palestine with misgivings. Zionist leaders, in particular David Ben-Gurion, viewed the acceptance of the plan as a tactical step and a steppingstone to future territorial expansion.

The Arab Higher Committee, the Arab League and other Arab leaders and governments rejected the Plan, as aside from Arabs forming a two-thirds majority, they owned most of the territory. They also indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division, arguing that it violated the principles of national self-determination in the UN Charter that granted people the right to decide their own destiny. They announced their intention to take all necessary measures to prevent the implementation of the resolution. A civil war broke out in Palestine, and the plan was not implemented. In 1948, 85% of the Palestinians living in the areas that became the state of Israel became refugees.

==Background==
The British administration was formalized by the League of Nations under the Palestine Mandate in 1923, as part of the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire following World War I. The Mandate reaffirmed the 1917 British commitment to the Balfour Declaration, for the establishment in Palestine of a &quot;National Home&quot; for the Jewish people, with the prerogative to carry it out. A British census of 1918 estimated 700,000 Arabs and 56,000 Jews.

In 1937, following a six-month-long Arab General Strike and armed insurrection which aimed to pursue national independence and secure the country from foreign control, the British established the Peel Commission. The Commission concluded that the Mandate had become unworkable, and recommended partition into an Arab state linked to Transjordan; a small Jewish state; and a mandatory zone. To address problems arising from the presence of national minorities in each area, it suggested a land and population transfer involving the transfer of some 225,000 Arabs living in the envisaged Jewish state and 1,250 Jews living in a future Arab state, a measure deemed compulsory &quot;in the last resort&quot;. To address any economic problems, the Plan proposed avoiding interfering with Jewish immigration, since any interference would be liable to produce an &quot;economic crisis&quot;, most of Palestine&#x27;s wealth coming from the Jewish community. To solve the predicted annual budget deficit of the Arab State and reduction in public services due to loss of tax from the Jewish state, it was proposed that the Jewish state pay an annual subsidy to the Arab state and take on half of the latter&#x27;s deficit. The Palestinian Arab leadership rejected partition as unacceptable, given the inequality in the proposed population exchange and the transfer of one-third of Palestine, including most of its best agricultural land, to recent immigrants. The Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, persuaded the Zionist Congress to lend provisional approval to the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiations. In a letter to his son in October 1937, Ben-Gurion explained that partition would be a first step to &quot;possession of the land as a whole&quot;. The same sentiment, that acceptance of partition was a temporary measure beyond which the Palestine would be &quot;redeemed ... in its entirety,&quot; was recorded by Ben-Gurion on other occasions, such as at a meeting of the Jewish Agency executive in June 1938, as well as by Chaim Weizmann.

The British Woodhead Commission was set up to examine the practicality of partition. The Peel plan was rejected and two possible alternatives were considered. In 1938, the British government issued a policy statement declaring that &quot;the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable&quot;. Representatives of Arabs and Jews were invited to London for the St. James Conference, which proved unsuccessful.

With World War II looming, British policies were influenced by a desire to win Arab world support and could ill afford to engage with another Arab uprising. The MacDonald White Paper of May 1939 declared that it was &quot;not part of [the British government&#x27;s] policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State&quot;, sought to limit Jewish immigration to Palestine and restricted Arab land sales to Jews. However, the League of Nations commission held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations. The Jewish Agency hoped to persuade the British to restore Jewish immigration rights, and cooperated with the British in the war against Fascism. Aliyah Bet was organized to spirit Jews out of Nazi controlled Europe, despite the British prohibitions. The White Paper also led to the formation of Lehi, a small Jewish organization which opposed the British.

After World War II, in August 1945 President Truman asked for the admission of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine but the British maintained limits on Jewish immigration in line with the 1939 White Paper. The Jewish community rejected the restriction on immigration and organized an armed resistance. These actions and United States pressure to end the anti-immigration policy led to the establishment of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In April 1946, the Committee reached a unanimous decision for the immediate admission of 100,000 Jewish refugees from Europe into Palestine, rescission of the White Paper restrictions of land sale to Jews, that the country be neither Arab nor Jewish, and the extension of U.N. Trusteeship. The U.S. endorsed the Commission&#x27;s findings concerning Jewish immigration and land purchase restrictions, while the British made their agreement to implementation conditional on U.S. assistance in case of another Arab revolt. In effect, the British continued to carry out their White Paper policy. The recommendations triggered violent demonstrations in the Arab states, and calls for a Jihad and an annihilation of all European Jews in Palestine.

==United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)==
Under the terms of League of Nations A-class mandates each such mandatory territory was to become a sovereign state on termination of its mandate. By the end of World War II, this occurred with all such mandates except Palestine; however, the League of Nations itself lapsed in 1946, leading to a legal quandary.
In February 1947, Britain announced its intent to terminate the Mandate for Palestine, referring the matter of the future of Palestine to the United Nations. According to William Roger Louis, British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin&#x27;s policy was premised on the idea that an Arab majority would carry the day, which met difficulties with Harry S. Truman who, sensitive to Zionist electoral pressures in the United States, pressed for a British-Zionist compromise. In May, the UN formed the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) to prepare a report on recommendations for Palestine. The Jewish Agency pressed for Jewish representation and the exclusion of both Britain and Arab countries on the Committee, sought visits to camps where Holocaust survivors were interned in Europe as part of UNSCOP&#x27;s brief, and in May won representation on the Political Committee. The Arab states, convinced statehood had been subverted, and that the transition of authority from the League of Nations to the UN was questionable in law, wished the issues to be brought before an International Court, and refused to collaborate with UNSCOP, which had extended an invitation for liaison also to the Arab Higher Committee. In August, after three months of conducting hearings and a general survey of the situation in Palestine, a majority report of the committee recommended that the region be partitioned into an Arab state and a Jewish state, which should retain an economic union. An international regime was envisioned for Jerusalem.

The Arab delegations at the UN had sought to keep separate the issue of Palestine from the issue of Jewish refugees in Europe. During their visit, UNSCOP members were shocked by the extent of Lehi and Irgun violence, then at its apogee, and by the elaborate military presence attested by endemic barb-wire, searchlights, and armoured-car patrols. Committee members also witnessed the SS &quot;Exodus&quot; affair in Haifa and could hardly have remained unaffected by it. On concluding their mission, they dispatched a subcommittee to investigate Jewish refugee camps in Europe. The incident is mentioned in the report in relation to Jewish distrust and resentment concerning the British enforcement of the 1939 White Paper.

===UNSCOP report===
On 3 September 1947, the Committee reported to the General Assembly. &quot;CHAPTER V: PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS (I)&quot;, Section A of the Report contained eleven proposed recommendations (I – XI) approved unanimously. Section B contained one proposed recommendation approved by a substantial majority dealing with the Jewish problem in general (XI). &quot;CHAPTER VI: PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS (II)&quot; contained a &quot;Plan of Partition with Economic Union&quot; to which seven members of the Committee (Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden and Uruguay), expressed themselves in favour. &quot;CHAPTER VII RECOMMENDATIONS (III)&quot; contained a comprehensive proposal that was voted upon and supported by three members (India, Iran, and Yugoslavia) for a &quot;Federal State of Palestine&quot;. Australia abstained. In &quot;CHAPTER VIII&quot; a number of members of the Committee expressed certain reservations and observations.

===Proposed partition===

The report of the majority of the Committee () envisaged the division of Palestine into three parts: an Arab State, a Jewish State and the City of Jerusalem, linked by extraterritorial crossroads. The proposed Arab State would include the central and part of western Galilee, with the town of Acre, the hill country of Samaria and Judea, an enclave at Jaffa, and the southern coast stretching from north of Isdud (now Ashdod) and encompassing what is now the Gaza Strip, with a section of desert along the Egyptian border. The proposed Jewish State would include the fertile Eastern Galilee, the Coastal Plain, stretching from Haifa to Rehovot and most of the Negev desert, including the southern outpost of Umm Rashrash (now Eilat). The Jerusalem Corpus Separatum included Bethlehem and the surrounding areas.

The primary objectives of the majority of the Committee were political division and economic unity between the two groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;undocs.org/A/364&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan tried its best to accommodate as many Jews as possible into the Jewish State. In many specific cases, this meant including areas of Arab majority (but with a significant Jewish minority) in the Jewish state. Thus the Jewish State would have an overall large Arab minority. Areas that were sparsely populated (like the Negev desert), were also included in the Jewish state to create room for immigration. According to the plan, Jews and Arabs living in the Jewish state would become citizens of the Jewish state and Jews and Arabs living in the Arab state would become citizens of the Arab state.

By virtue of Chapter 3, Palestinian citizens residing in Palestine outside the City of Jerusalem, as well as Arabs and Jews who, not holding Palestinian citizenship, resided in Palestine outside the City of Jerusalem would, upon the recognition of independence, become citizens of the State in which they were resident and enjoy full civil and political rights.

Population of Palestine by religions in 1946: Moslems — 1,076,783; Jews — 608,225; Christians — 145,063; Others — 15,488; Total — 1,845,559.

On this basis, the population at the end of 1946 was estimated as follows: Arabs — 1,203,000; Jews — 608,000; others — 35,000; Total — 1,846,000.

At the time the UN passed its decision to partition the country, the arable land was owned as follows: 93 per cent by Arabs, and 7 per cent by Jews.

The Plan would have had the following demographics (data based on 1945).

In addition there would be in the Jewish State about 90,000 Bedouins, cultivators and stock
owners who seek grazing further afield in dry seasons.

The land allocated to the Arab State in the final plan included about 43% of Mandatory Palestine and consisted of all of the highlands, except for Jerusalem, plus one-third of the coastline. The highlands contain the major aquifers of Palestine, which supplied water to the coastal cities of central Palestine, including Tel Aviv. The Jewish State allocated to the Jews, who constituted a third of the population and owned about 7% of the land, was to receive 56% of Mandatory Palestine, a slightly larger area to accommodate the increasing numbers of Jews who would immigrate there. The Jewish State included three fertile lowland plains – the Sharon on the coast, the Jezreel Valley and the upper Jordan Valley. The bulk of the proposed Jewish State&#x27;s territory, however, consisted of the Negev Desert, which was mostly not suitable for agriculture, nor for urban development at that time. The Jewish State would also be given sole access to the Sea of Galilee, crucial for its water supply, and the economically important Red Sea.

The committee voted for the plan, 25 to 13 (with 17 abstentions and 2 absentees) on 25 November 1947 and the General Assembly was called back into a special session to vote on the proposal. Various sources noted that this was one vote short of the two-thirds majority required in the General Assembly.

== &quot;Ad hoc&quot; Committee ==
On 23 September 1947 the General Assembly established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question to consider the UNSCOP report. Representatives of the Arab Higher Committee and Jewish Agency were invited and attended.

During the committee&#x27;s deliberations, the British government endorsed the report&#x27;s recommendations concerning the end of the mandate, independence, and Jewish immigration. However, the British did &quot;not feel able to implement&quot; any agreement unless it was acceptable to both the Arabs and the Jews, and asked that the General Assembly provide an alternative implementing authority if such acceptance proved not to be the case.

The Arab Higher Committee rejected both the majority and minority recommendations within the UNSCOP report. They &quot;concluded from a survey of Palestine history that Zionist claims to that country had no legal or moral basis&quot;. The Arab Higher Committee argued that only an Arab State in the whole of Palestine would be consistent with the UN Charter.

The Jewish Agency expressed support for most of the UNSCOP recommendations, but emphasized the &quot;intense urge&quot; of the overwhelming majority of Jewish displaced persons to proceed to Palestine. The Jewish Agency criticized the proposed boundaries, especially in the Western Galilee and Western Jerusalem (outside of the old city), arguing that these should be included in the Jewish state. However, they agreed to accept the plan if &quot;it would make possible the immediate re-establishment of the Jewish State with sovereign control of its own immigration.&quot;

Arab states requested representation on the UN ad hoc subcommittees of October 1947, but were excluded from Subcommittee One, which had been delegated the specific task of studying and, if thought necessary, modifying the boundaries of the proposed partition.

=== Sub-Committee 2 ===
The Sub-Committee 2, set up on 23 October 1947 to draw up a detailed plan based on proposals of Arab states presented its report within a few weeks.

Based on a reproduced British report, the Sub-Committee 2 criticised the UNSCOP report for using inaccurate population figures, especially concerning the Bedouin population. The British report, dated 1 November 1947, used the results of a new census in Beersheba in 1946 with additional use of aerial photographs, and an estimate of the population in other districts. It found that the size of the Bedouin population was greatly understated in former enumerations. In Beersheba, 3,389 Bedouin houses and 8,722 tents were counted. The total Bedouin population was estimated at approximately 127,000; only 22,000 of them normally resident in the Arab state under the UNSCOP majority plan. The British report stated:the term Beersheba Bedouin has a meaning more definite than one would expect in the case of a nomad population. These tribes, wherever they are found in Palestine, will always describe themselves as Beersheba tribes. &quot;Their attachment to the area arises from their land rights there and their historic association with it&quot;.In respect of the UNSCOP report, the Sub-Committee concluded that the earlier population &quot;estimates must, however, be corrected in the light of the information furnished to the Sub-Committee by the representative of the United Kingdom regarding the Bedouin population. According to the statement, 22,000 Bedouins may be taken as normally residing in the areas allocated to the Arab State under the UNSCOP&#x27;s majority plan, and the balance of 105,000 as resident in the proposed Jewish State. It will thus be seen that the proposed Jewish State will contain a total population of 1,008,800, consisting of 509,780 Arabs and 499,020 Jews. In other words, at the outset, the Arabs will have a majority in the proposed Jewish State.&quot;

The Sub-Committee 2 recommended to put the question of the Partition Plan before the International Court of Justice (Resolution No. I
). In respect of the Jewish refugees due to World War II, the Sub-Committee recommended to request the countries of which the refugees belonged to take them back as much as possible (Resolution No. II). The Sub-Committee proposed to establish a unitary state (Resolution No. III).

===Boundary changes===
The &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee made a number of boundary changes to the UNSCOP recommendations before they were voted on by the General Assembly.

The predominantly Arab city of Jaffa, previously located within the Jewish state, was constituted as an enclave of the Arab State. The boundary of the Arab state was modified to include Beersheba and a strip of the Negev desert along the Egyptian border, while a section of the Dead Sea shore and other additions were made to the Jewish State. The Jewish population in the revised Jewish State would be about half a million, compared to 450,000 Arabs.

The proposed boundaries would also have placed 54 Arab villages on the opposite side of the border from their farm land. In response, the United Nations Palestine Commission established in 1948 was empowered to modify the boundaries &quot;in such a way that village areas as a rule will not be divided by state boundaries unless pressing reasons make that necessary&quot;. These modifications never occurred.

==The vote==

Passage of the resolution required a two-thirds majority of the valid votes, not counting abstaining and absent members, of the UN&#x27;s then 57 member states. On 26 November, after filibustering by the Zionist delegation, the vote was postponed by three days. According to multiple sources, had the vote been held on the original set date, it would have received a majority, but less than the required two-thirds. Various compromise proposals and variations on a single state, including federations and cantonal systems were debated (including those previously rejected in committee). The delay was used by supporters of Zionism in New York to put extra pressure on states not supporting the resolution. 

===Reports of pressure for and against the Plan===

====Reports of pressure for the Plan====
Zionists launched an intense White House lobby to have the UNSCOP plan endorsed, and the effects were not trivial. The Democratic Party, a large part of whose contributions came from Jews, informed Truman that failure to live up to promises to support the Jews in Palestine would constitute a danger to the party. The defection of Jewish votes in congressional elections in 1946 had contributed to electoral losses. Truman was, according to Roger Cohen, embittered by feelings of being a hostage to the lobby and its &#x27;unwarranted interference&#x27;, which he blamed for the contemporary impasse. When a formal American declaration in favour of partition was given on 11 October, a public relations authority declared to the Zionist Emergency Council in a closed meeting: &#x27;under no circumstances should any of us believe or think we had won because of the devotion of the American Government to our cause. We had won because of the sheer pressure of political logistics that was applied by the Jewish leadership in the United States&#x27;. State Department advice critical of the controversial UNSCOP recommendation to give the overwhelmingly Arab town of Jaffa, and the Negev, to the Jews was overturned by an urgent and secret late meeting organized for Chaim Weizman with Truman, which immediately countermanded the recommendation. The United States initially refrained from pressuring smaller states to vote either way, but Robert A. Lovett reported that America&#x27;s U.N. delegation&#x27;s case suffered impediments from high pressure by Jewish groups, and that indications existed that bribes and threats were being used, even of American sanctions against Liberia and Nicaragua. When the UNSCOP plan failed to achieve the necessary majority on 25 November, the lobby &#x27;moved into high gear&#x27; and induced the President to overrule the State Department, and let wavering governments know that the U.S. strongly desired partition.

Proponents of the Plan reportedly put pressure on nations to vote yes to the Partition Plan. A telegram signed by 26 US Senators with influence on foreign aid bills was sent to wavering countries, seeking their support for the partition plan. The US Senate was considering a large aid package at the time, including 60 million dollars to China. Many nations reported pressure directed specifically at them:
* (Vote: For): President Truman later noted, &quot;The facts were that not only were there pressure movements around the United Nations unlike anything that had been seen there before, but that the White House, too, was subjected to a constant barrage. I do not think I ever had as much pressure and propaganda aimed at the White House as I had in this instance. The persistence of a few of the extreme Zionist leaders—actuated by political motives and engaging in political threats—disturbed and annoyed me.&quot;
* (Vote: Against): Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru spoke with anger and contempt for the way the UN vote had been lined up. He said the Zionists had tried to bribe India with millions and at the same time his sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the Indian ambassador to the UN, had received daily warnings that her life was in danger unless &quot;she voted right&quot;. Pandit occasionally hinted that something might change in favour of the Zionists. But another Indian delegate, Kavallam Pannikar, said that India would vote for the Arab side, because of their large Muslim minority, although they knew that the Jews had a case.
* (Vote: For): Liberia&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States complained that the US delegation threatened aid cuts to several countries. Harvey S. Firestone Jr., President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company, with major holdings in the country, also pressured the Liberian government
* Philippines (Vote: For): In the days before the vote, Philippines representative General Carlos P. Romulo stated &quot;We hold that the issue is primarily moral. The issue is whether the United Nations should accept responsibility for the enforcement of a policy which is clearly repugnant to the valid nationalist aspirations of the people of Palestine. The Philippines Government holds that the United Nations ought not to accept such responsibility.&quot; After a phone call from Washington, the representative was recalled and the Philippines&#x27; vote changed.
* (Vote: For): The promise of a five million dollar loan may or may not have secured Haiti&#x27;s vote for partition.
* (Vote: For): Shortly before the vote, France&#x27;s delegate to the United Nations was visited by Bernard Baruch, a long-term Jewish supporter of the Democratic Party who, during the recent world war, had been an economic adviser to President Roosevelt, and had latterly been appointed by President Truman as United States ambassador to the newly created UN Atomic Energy Commission. He was, privately, a supporter of the Irgun and its front organization, the American League for a Free Palestine. Baruch implied that a French failure to support the resolution might block planned American aid to France, which was badly needed for reconstruction, French currency reserves being exhausted and its balance of payments heavily in deficit. Previously, to avoid antagonising its Arab colonies, France had not publicly supported the resolution. After considering the danger of American aid being withheld, France finally voted in favour of it. So, too, did France&#x27;s neighbours, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. 
* Venezuela (Vote: For): Carlos Eduardo Stolk, Chairman of the Delegation of Venezuela, voted in favor of Resolution 181 .
* (Vote: Against): The Cuban delegation stated they would vote against partition &quot;in spite of pressure being brought to bear against us&quot; because they could not be party to coercing the majority in Palestine.
* (Absent): The credentials of the Siamese delegations were cancelled after Siam voted against partition in committee on 25 November.

There is also some evidence that Sam Zemurray put pressure on several &quot;banana republics&quot; to change their votes.

====Reports of pressure against the Plan====
According to Benny Morris, Wasif Kamal, an Arab Higher Committee official, tried to bribe a delegate to the United Nations, perhaps a Russian.

A number of Arab leaders argued against the partition proposal on the grounds that it endangered the Jews of Arab countries.

*A few months before the UN vote on partition of Palestine, Iraq&#x27;s prime minister Nuri al-Said told British diplomat Douglas Busk that he had nothing against the Iraqi Jews, who were a long established and useful community. However, if the United Nations solution was not satisfactory, the Arab League might decide on severe measures against the Jews in Arab countries, and he would be unable to resist the proposal.
* At the 30th Meeting of the UN Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine on 24 November 1947, the head of the Egyptian delegate, Heykal Pasha, said that although there was no animosity against the Jews in Arab countries, nobody could prevent disorders if a Jewish state was established. Riots could break out which governments could not control, endangering the lives of Jews and creating an antisemitism difficult to root out. The UN, in Heykal&#x27;s view, should consider the welfare of all Jews and not just the wishes of the Zionists.
*In a speech at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq’s Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, included the following statement: &quot;Partition imposed against the will of the majority of the people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab-Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred.&quot;

The Arab states warned the Western Powers that endorsement of the partition plan might be met by either or both an oil embargo and realignment of the Arab states with the Soviet Bloc.

===Final vote===

On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly voted 33 to 13, with 10 abstentions and 1 absent, in favour of the modified Partition Plan. The final vote, consolidated here by modern United Nations Regional Groups rather than contemporary groupings, was as follows:
==== In favour (33 countries, 72% of total votes) ====
&quot;Latin American and Caribbean (13 countries):&quot;

&quot;Western European and Others (8 countries):&quot;

&quot;Eastern European (5 countries):&quot;

&quot;African (2 countries):&quot;
*

&quot;Asia-Pacific (3 countries)&quot;
*

&quot;North America (2 countries)&quot;
*

==== Against (13 countries, 28% of total votes) ====
&quot;Asia-Pacific (9 countries, primarily Middle East sub-area):&quot;

&quot;Western European and Others (2 countries):&quot;
*

&quot;African (1 country):&quot;

&quot;Latin American and Caribbean (1 country):&quot;

==== Abstentions (10 countries) ====
&quot;Latin American and Caribbean (6 countries):&quot;

&quot;Asia-Pacific (1 country):&quot;

&quot;African (1 country):&quot;

&quot;Western European and Others (1 country):&quot;

&quot;Eastern European (1 country):&quot;

==== Absent (1 country) ====
&quot;Asia-Pacific (1 country):&quot;

===Votes by modern region===
If analysed by the modern composition of what later came to be known as the United Nations Regional Groups showed relatively aligned voting styles in the final vote. This, however, does not reflect the regional grouping at the time, as a major reshuffle of regional grouping occurred in 1966. All Western nations voted for the resolution, with the exception of the United Kingdom (the Mandate holder), Greece and Turkey. The Soviet bloc also voted for partition, with the exception of Yugoslavia, which was to be expelled from Cominform the following year. The majority of Latin American nations following Brazilian leadership, voted for partition, with a sizeable minority abstaining. Asian countries (primarily Middle Eastern countries) voted against partition, with the exception of the Philippines.

==Reactions==

===Jews===
Jews gathered in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to celebrate the U.N. resolution during the whole night after the vote. Great bonfires blazed at Jewish collective farms in the north. Many big cafes in Tel Aviv served free champagne. Mainstream Zionist leaders emphasized the &quot;heavy responsibility&quot; of building a modern Jewish State, and committed to working towards a peaceful coexistence with the region&#x27;s other inhabitants: Jewish groups in the United States hailed the action by the United Nations. Most welcomed the Palestine Plan but some felt it did not settle the problem.

Some Revisionist Zionists rejected the partition plan as a renunciation of legitimately Jewish national territory. The Irgun Tsvai Leumi, led by Menachem Begin, and the Lehi (also known as the Stern Group or Gang), the two Revisionist-affiliated underground organisations which had been fighting against both the British and Arabs, stated their opposition. Begin warned that the partition would not bring peace because the Arabs would also attack the small state and that &quot;in the war ahead we&#x27;ll have to stand on our own, it will be a war on our existence and future.&quot; He also stated that &quot;the bisection of our homeland is illegal. It will never be recognized.&quot; Begin was sure that the creation of a Jewish state would make territorial expansion possible, &quot;after the shedding of much blood.&quot;

Some Post-Zionist scholars endorse Simha Flapan&#x27;s view that it is a myth that Zionists accepted the partition as a compromise by which the Jewish community abandoned ambitions for the whole of Palestine and recognized the rights of the Arab Palestinians to their own state. Rather, Flapan argued, acceptance was only a tactical move that aimed to thwart the creation of an Arab Palestinian state and, concomitantly, expand the territory that had been assigned by the UN to the Jewish state. Baruch Kimmerling has said that Zionists &quot;officially accepted the partition plan, but invested all their efforts towards improving its terms and maximally expanding their boundaries while reducing the number of Arabs in them.&quot; Many Zionist leaders viewed the acceptance of the plan as a tactical step and a stepping stone to future territorial expansion over all of Palestine.

Addressing the Central Committee of the Histadrut (the Eretz Israel Workers Party) days after the UN vote to partition Palestine, Ben-Gurion expressed his apprehension, stating:the total population of the Jewish State at the time of its establishment will be about one million, including almost 40% non-Jews. Such a [population] composition does not provide a stable basis for a Jewish State. This [demographic] fact must be viewed in all its clarity and acuteness. With such a [population] composition, there cannot even be absolute certainty that control will remain in the hands of the Jewish majority... There can be no stable and strong Jewish state so long as it has a Jewish majority of only 60%.Despite these reservations, Ben-Gurion also recognized the plan&#x27;s many accomplishments, stating &quot;I know of no greater achievement by the Jewish people ... in its long history since it became a people.&quot;

===Arabs===
Arab leaders and governments rejected the plan of partition in the resolution and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition. The Arab states&#x27; delegations declared immediately after the vote for partition that they would not be bound by the decision, and walked out accompanied by the Indian and Pakistani delegates.

They argued that it violated the principles of national self-determination in the UN charter which granted people the right to decide their own destiny. The Arab delegations to the UN issued a joint statement the day after that vote that stated: &quot;the vote in regard to the Partition of Palestine has been given under great pressure and duress, and that this makes it doubly invalid.&quot;

On 16 February 1948, the UN Palestine Commission reported to the Security Council that: &quot;Powerful Arab interests, both inside and outside Palestine, are defying the resolution of the General Assembly and are engaged in a deliberate effort to alter by force the settlement envisaged therein.&quot;

====Arab states====
A few weeks after UNSCOP released its report, Azzam Pasha, the General Secretary of the Arab League, told an Egyptian newspaper &quot;Personally I hope the Jews do not force us into this war because it will be a war of elimination and it will be a dangerous massacre which history will record similarly to the Mongol massacre or the wars of the Crusades.&quot; (This statement from October 1947 has often been incorrectly reported as having been made much later on 15 May 1948.) Azzam told Alec Kirkbride &quot;We will sweep them [the Jews] into the sea.&quot; Syrian president Shukri al-Quwatli told his people: &quot;We shall eradicate Zionism.&quot;

King Farouk of Egypt told the American ambassador to Egypt that in the long run the Arabs would soundly defeat the Jews and drive them out of Palestine.

While Azzam Pasha repeated his threats of forceful prevention of partition, the first important Arab voice to support partition was the influential Egyptian daily &quot;&quot;: &quot;We stand for partition because we believe that it is the best final solution for the problem of Palestine... rejection of partition... will lead to further complications and will give the Zionists another space of time to complete their plans of defense and attack... a delay of one more year which would not benefit the Arabs but would benefit the Jews, especially after the British evacuation.&quot;

On 20 May 1948, Azzam told reporters &quot;We are fighting for an Arab Palestine. Whatever the outcome the Arabs will stick to their offer of equal citizenship for Jews in Arab Palestine and let them be as Jewish as they like. In areas where they predominate they will have complete autonomy.&quot; He reportedly said that the armies of the Arab League states had entered Palestine “not only to protect Arab territory, but to fight the Jewish state”.

The Arab League said that some of the Jews would have to be expelled from a Palestinian Arab state.

Abdullah appointed Ibrahim Hashem Pasha as Military Governor of the Arab areas occupied by troops of the Transjordan Army. He was a former prime minister of Transjordan who supported partition of Palestine as proposed by the Peel Commission and the United Nations.

====Arabs in Palestine====
Haj Amin al-Husseini said in March 1948 to an interviewer from the Jaffa daily &quot;Al Sarih&quot; that the Arabs did not intend merely to prevent partition but &quot;would continue fighting until the Zionists were annihilated.&quot; Jamal al-Husayni warned the Jews that &quot;The blood will flow like rivers in the Middle East&quot;.

Zionists attributed Arab rejection of the plan to mere intransigence. Palestinian Arabs opposed the very idea of partition but reiterated that this partition plan was unfair: the majority of the land (56%) would go to a Jewish state, when Jews at that stage legally owned only 6–7% of it and remained a minority of the population (33% in 1946). There were also disproportionate allocations under the plan and the area under Jewish control contained 45% of the Palestinian population. The proposed Arab state was only given 45% of the land, much of which was unfit for agriculture. Jaffa, though geographically separated, was to be part of the Arab state. However, most of the proposed Jewish state was the Negev desert. The Negev desert land was sparsely populated and unsuitable for agriculture but also a &quot;vital land bridge protecting British interests from the Suez Canal to Iraq&quot;

Few Palestinian Arabs joined the Arab Liberation Army because they suspected that the other Arab States did not plan on an independent Palestinian state. According to Ian Bickerton, for that reason many of them favored partition and indicated a willingness to live alongside a Jewish state. He also mentions that the Nashashibi family backed King Abdullah and union with Transjordan.

The Arab Higher Committee demanded that in a Palestinian Arab state, the majority of the Jews should not be citizens (those who had not lived in Palestine before the British Mandate).

According to Musa Alami, the mufti would agree to partition if he were promised that he would rule the future Arab state.

The Arab Higher Committee responded to the partition resolution and declared a three-day general strike in Palestine to begin the following day.

===British government===
When Bevin received the partition proposal, he promptly ordered for it not to be imposed on the Arabs. The plan was vigorously debated in the British parliament.

In a British cabinet meeting at 4 December 1947, it was decided that the Mandate would end at midnight 14 May 1948, the complete withdrawal by 1 August 1948, and Britain would not enforce the UN partition plan. On 11 December 1947, the British government publicly announced these plans. During the period in which the British withdrawal was completed, Britain refused to share the administration of Palestine with a proposed UN transition regime, to allow the UN Palestine Commission to establish a presence in Palestine earlier than a fortnight before the end of the Mandate, to allow the creation of official Jewish and Arab militias or to assist in smoothly handing over territory or authority to any successor.

===United States government===
The United States declined to recognize the All-Palestine government in Gaza by explaining that it had accepted the UN Mediator&#x27;s proposal. The Mediator had recommended that Palestine, as defined in the original Mandate including Transjordan, might form a union. Bernadotte&#x27;s diary said the Mufti had lost credibility on account of his unrealistic predictions regarding the defeat of the Jewish militias. Bernadotte noted &quot;It would seem as though in existing circumstances most of the Palestinian Arabs would be quite content to be incorporated in Transjordan.&quot;

==Subsequent events==

The Partition Plan with Economic Union was not realized in the days following 29 November 1947 resolution as envisaged by the General Assembly. It was followed by outbreaks of violence in Mandatory Palestine between Palestinian Jews and Arabs known as the 1947–48 Civil War. After Alan Cunningham, the High Commissioner of Palestine, left Jerusalem, on the morning of 14 May the British army left the city as well. The British left a power vacuum in Jerusalem and made no measures to establish the international regime in Jerusalem. At midnight on 14 May 1948, the British Mandate expired, and Britain disengaged its forces. Earlier in the evening, the Jewish People&#x27;s Council had gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum (today known as Independence Hall), and approved a proclamation, declaring &quot;the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel&quot;. The 1948 Arab–Israeli War began with the invasion of, or intervention in, Palestine by the Arab States on 15 May 1948.

===Resolution 181 as a legal basis for Palestinian statehood===
In 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization published the Palestinian Declaration of Independence relying on Resolution 181, arguing that the resolution continues to provide international legitimacy for the right of the Palestinian people to sovereignty and national independence. A number of scholars have written in support of this view.

A General Assembly request for an advisory opinion, Resolution ES-10/14 (2004), specifically cited Resolution 181(II) as a &quot;relevant resolution&quot;, and asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) what are the legal consequences of the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Judge Abdul Koroma explained the majority opinion: &quot;The Court has also held that the right of self-determination as an established and recognized right under international law applies to the territory and to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, the exercise of such right entitles the Palestinian people to a State of their own as originally envisaged in Resolution 181 (II) and subsequently confirmed.&quot; In response, Prof. Paul De Waart said that the Court put the legality of the 1922 League of Nations Palestine Mandate and the 1947 UN Plan of Partition beyond doubt once and for all.

===Retrospect===
In 2011, Mahmoud Abbas stated that the 1947 Arab rejection of United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was a mistake he hoped to rectify.

===Commemoration===

A street in the Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem is named &quot;Kaf-tet benovember&quot; (29 November Street). On 29 November 2022, a monument designed and executed by sculptor Sam Philipe was unveiled on a hilltop in Netanya to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN Partition Plan for Palestine. The date also marks the annual International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.

<text>The 1949 Armistice Agreements were signed between Israel and Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. They formally ended the hostilities of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and also demarcated the Green Line, which separated Arab-controlled territory (i.e., the Jordanian-annexed West Bank and the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip) from Israel until the latter&#x27;s victory in the 1967 Six-Day War.

To monitor the agreed-upon border, the United Nations (UN) established supervising and reporting agencies; discussions related to the ceasefire&#x27;s enforcement led to the signing of the separate Tripartite Declaration of 1950, in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and France pledged to take action within and outside of the UN in order to prevent violations of the frontiers. It also outlined their commitment to peace and stability in the area, their opposition to the use or threat of force, and reiterated their opposition to the development of an arms race between Arab countries and Israel.

== Agreements ==

=== With Egypt ===
On 6 January 1949, Ralph Bunche announced that Egypt had finally consented to start talks with Israel on an armistice. The talks began on the Greek island of Rhodes on 12 January. Shortly after their commencement, Israel agreed to the release of a besieged Egyptian brigade in Faluja, but soon rescinded their agreement. At the end of the month, the talks floundered. Israel demanded that Egypt withdraw all its forces from the former area of Mandate Palestine. Egypt insisted that Arab forces withdraw to the positions which they held on 14 October 1948, as per the Security Council Resolution S/1070 of 4 November 1948, and that the Israeli forces withdraw to positions north of the Majdal–Hebron road.

The deadlock culminated on 12 February 1949 with the murder of Hassan al-Banna, leader of the Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood. Israel threatened to abandon the talks, whereupon the United States appealed to the parties to bring them to a successful conclusion.

On 24 February the &quot;Israel–Egypt Armistice Agreement&quot; was signed in Rhodes. The main points of the armistice agreement were:
* The Armistice Demarcation Line is not to be construed in any sense as a political or territorial boundary, and is delineated without prejudice to rights, claims and positions of either Party to the Armistice as regards ultimate &quot;settlement of the Palestine question&quot;.
* The armistice demarcation line was drawn for the most part along the 1922 international border between Egypt and Mandatory Palestine, except near the Mediterranean Sea, where Egypt remained in control of a strip of land along the coast, which became known as the Gaza Strip.
* The Egyptian forces besieged in the &quot;Faluja Pocket&quot; were allowed to return to Egypt with their weapons, and the area was handed over to Israeli military control.
* A zone on both sides of the border around &#x27;Uja al-Hafeer was to be demilitarized, and became the seat of the bilateral armistice committee.

=== With Lebanon ===

The agreement with Lebanon was signed on 23 March 1949. The main points were:
* The provisions of this agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations.
* The armistice line (&quot;Green Line&quot;, see also Blue Line [Lebanon]) was drawn along the international boundary between Lebanon and Mandatory Palestine.
* Israel withdrew its forces from 13 villages in Lebanese territory, which were occupied during the war.

=== With Jordan ===

These armistice talks began on 4 March, and were conducted on Jordanian territory. Despite the insistence by Ralph Bunche that in all four talks, the ceasefire be strictly observed, while negotiating with Jordan Israel engaged in military operations to occupy extensive swathes of territory in both the central and southern Negev desert. It also managed to secure further land by using the threat of military intervention unless some claims were accepted.
The agreement with Jordan was signed on 3 April 1949. The main points:
* No provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question, the provisions of this Agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations.
* Jordanian forces remained in most positions held by them, particularly East Jerusalem which included the Old City.
* Jordan withdrew its forces from their front posts overlooking the Plain of Sharon. In return, Israel agreed to allow Jordanian forces to take over positions previously held by Iraqi forces.
* Exchange of territorial control: Israel received control in the area known as Wadi Ara and the Little Triangle in exchange for territory in the southern hills of Hebron.

In March 1949 as the Iraqi forces withdrew from Palestine and handed over their positions to the smaller Jordanian legion, 3 Israeli brigades maneuvered into positions of advantage in Operation &quot;Shin-Tav-Shin&quot; and Operation Uvda. The operations allowed Israel to renegotiate the cease fire line in the southern Negev (giving access to the Red Sea) and the Wadi Ara area in a secret agreement reached on 23 March 1949 and incorporated into the General Armistice Agreement. The Green Line was then redrawn in blue ink on the southern map to give the impression that a shift of the Green Line had been made. The events that led to a change in the Green Line was an exchange of fertile land in the Bethlehem area to Israeli control and the village of Wadi Fukin being given to Jordanian control. On 15 July when the Israeli Army expelled the population of Wadi Fukin after the village had been transferred to the Israeli-occupied area under the terms of the Armistice Agreement concluded between Israel and the Jordan Kingdom the Mixed Armistice Commission decided on 31 August, by a majority vote, that Israel had violated the Armistice Agreement by expelling villagers across the demarcation line and decided that the villagers should be allowed to return to their homes. However, when the villagers returned to Wadi Fukin under the supervision of the United Nations observers on September 6, they found most of their houses destroyed and were again compelled by the Israeli Army to return to Jordanian controlled territory.

The United Nations Chairman of the Mixed Commission, Colonel Garrison B. Coverdale (US), pressed for a solution of this issue to be found in the Mixed Armistice Commission, in an amicable and UN spirit. After some hesitation, this procedure was accepted and finally an agreement was reached whereby the Armistice Demarcation Line was changed to place Wadi Fukin under Jordanian authority who, in turn, agreed to transfer of some uninhabited, but fertile territory south of Bethlehem to Israel control.

* A Special Committee was to be formed to make arrangements for safe movement of traffic between Jerusalem and Mount Scopus campus of Hebrew University, along the Latrun-Jerusalem Highway, free access to the Holy Places, and other matters.

=== With Syria ===

Armistice talks with Syria started at Gesher B&#x27;not Yaacov, on the River Jordan, in April 1949, after the other armistice agreements had been concluded. The agreement with Syria was signed on 20 July 1949.

Syria withdrew its forces from most of the territories it controlled west of the international border, which became demilitarized zones. The territory retained by Syria that lay west of the 1923 Palestinian Mandate border and which had been allocated to the Jewish state under the UN partition plan comprised 66 square kilometers in the Jordan Valley. These territories were designated demilitarized zones (DMZs) and remained under Syrian control. It was emphasised that the armistice line was &quot;not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements.&quot; (Article V)

==Iraq==
Iraq, whose forces took an active part in the war (although it has no common border with Israel), withdrew its forces from the region in March 1949. The front occupied by Iraqi forces was covered by the armistice agreement between Israel and Jordan, and there was no separate agreement with Iraq.

== Cease-fire line vs. permanent border ==
The new military frontiers for Israel, as set by the agreements, encompassed about 78% of mandatory Palestine as it stood after the independence of Transjordan (now Jordan) in 1946. The Arab populated areas not controlled by Israel prior to 1967 were the Jordanian ruled West Bank and the Egyptian occupied Gaza Strip.

The armistice agreements were intended to serve only as interim agreements until replaced by permanent peace treaties. However, it took three decades to achieve a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, and it took another 15 years after that to achieve a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. To this day, no peace treaty has been signed between Israel and Lebanon nor between Israel and Syria.

The armistice agreements were clear (at Arab insistence) that they were not creating permanent borders. The Egyptian-Israeli agreement stated &quot;The Armistice Demarcation Line is not to be construed in any sense as a political or territorial boundary, and is delineated without prejudice to rights, claims and positions of either Party to the Armistice as regards ultimate settlement of the Palestine question.&quot;

The Jordanian-Israeli agreement stated: &quot;... no provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims, and positions of either Party hereto in the peaceful settlement of the Palestine questions, the provisions of this Agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations&quot; (Art. II.2), &quot;The Armistice Demarcation Lines defined in articles V and VI of this Agreement are agreed upon by the Parties without prejudice to future territorial settlements or boundary lines or to claims of either Party relating thereto.&quot; (Art. VI.9)

As the Armistice Demarcation Lines were technically not borders, the Arabs considered that Israel was restricted in its rights to develop the DMZ and exploitation of the water resources. Further that as a state of war still existed with the Arab nations, the Arab League was not hindered in their right to deny Israel the freedom of navigation through the Arab League waters. Also it was argued that the Palestinians had the right of return and that the Israeli use of abandoned property was therefore not legitimate.

In the Knesset then Foreign Minister and future Prime Minister Moshe Sharett called the armistice lines &quot;provisional boundaries&quot; and the old international borders which the armistice lines, except with Jordan, were based on, &quot;natural boundaries&quot;. Israel did not lay claim to territory beyond them and proposed them, with minor modifications except at Gaza, as the basis of permanent political frontiers at the Lausanne Conference of 1949.

After the 1967 Six-Day War several Israeli leaders argued against turning the Armistice Demarcation Lines into permanent borders on the grounds of Israeli security:
* Prime Minister Golda Meir said the pre-1967 borders were so dangerous that it &quot;would be treasonable&quot; for an Israeli leader to accept them (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, December 23, 1969).
* The Foreign Minister Abba Eban said the pre-1967 borders have &quot;a memory of Auschwitz&quot; (, November 5, 1969).
* Prime Minister Menachem Begin described a proposal for a retreat to the pre-1967 borders as &quot;national suicide for Israel.&quot;

The internationally recognized border between Egypt and Israel was eventually demarcated as part of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. The border between Israel and Jordan (except for Jordan&#x27;s border with the post-1967 West Bank) was demarcated as part of the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. This occurred after Jordan had recognized Palestine, which had not declared its borders at the time. In its application for membership to the United Nations, Palestine declared its territory to consist of the West Bank and Gaza, implying that some of Jordan&#x27;s previous border with Israel is now with Palestine.

== Violations ==
In each case Mixed Armistice Commissions (MACs) were formed under the auspices of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, (UNTSO) which investigated complaints by all parties and made regular reports to the UN Security Council.

As part of its dispute with Syria over use of the Demilitarized Zone created by the Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement, Israel from 1951 refused to attend meetings of the Israel/Syria Mixed Armistice Commission. The U.N. Security Council, in its resolution of 18 May 1951, criticized Israel&#x27;s refusal to participate in Mixed Armistice Commission meetings as being &quot;inconsistent with the objectives and intent of the Armistice Agreement&quot;.

The discussion of complaints by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission during the year 1952 resulted in:

* 1. Jordan being condemned for 19 violations of the General Armistice Agreement;
* 2. Israel being condemned for 12 violations of the General Armistice Agreement;

Statistics Taken from The Official Records of The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission Period from 1 January 1953 Through 15 October 1953:

* The discussion of the 171 Israeli complaints by the Mixed Armistice Commission resulted in Jordan being condemned for 20 violations of the General Armistice Agreement.
* The discussion of the 161 Jordanian complaints by the Mixed Armistice Commission resulted in Israel being condemned for 21 violations of the General Armistice Agreement.

===Specific incidents===

On 28–29 January 1953 Israeli military forces estimated at 120 to 150 men, using mortars, 3-inch mortars, PIAT weapons, bangalore torpedoes, machine-guns, grenades and small arms, crossed the demarcation line and attacked the Arab villages of Falameh (Falāma, Falamya) and Rantis. At Falameh the mukhtar was killed, seven other villagers were wounded, and three houses were demolished. The attack lasted four and a half hours. Israel was condemned for this act by the Mixed Armistice Commission.

22 April 1953, firing broke out at sunset within Jerusalem along the demarcation line on a length of about 4 kilometres. It lasted two hours, until the cease-fire arranged by United Nations observers came into effect. On the following day, there were isolated shots in the early morning and in the afternoon. There were twenty Jordanian casualties—ten killed and ten wounded. Six Israelis were wounded. The Jerusalem incident was investigated by United Nations observers. After studying the evidence collected, General Riley, in a report to the Security Council on the violation of the cease-fire [S/3607], stated that it appeared impossible to determine who fired the first shot.

On 25, 26, and 27 May, the two parties submitted complaints alleging violation of the General Armistice Agreement by civilians and military personnel in the Al-Dawayima area. In an emergency meeting of the Mixed Armistice Commission, both parties agreed to a mixed investigation. United Nations observers accompanied the representatives to the demarcation line to establish the facts. Despite the cease-fire which had been previously arranged, heavy firing broke out during the investigation. Israel troops had fired across the demarcation line at Jordanians in Jordan territory in response to illegal border trespassing by Jordanian farmers and Israeli soldiers were suspected to have burned crops in Jordan territory. The origin of the incident was the illegal cultivation by Jordanians of land in Israel territory. Armed Jordanians had penetrated Israel territory to harvest crops, and other Jordanians had fired across the demarcation line to protect the harvesters. The Jordanian government took no action to encourage or prevent the actions taken, though later considerations were made.

During the latter part of May 1953, incidents took place which cost the lives of three persons and in which six others were wounded. On the night of 25–26 May, an armed group from Jordan attacked two homes in Beit Arif, wounding two women. The same night, armed Jordanians attacked a home in Beit Nabala, killing a woman and wounding her husband and two children. Jordan was condemned for all three of these attacks. On the night of 9 June, armed Jordanians blew up a house in Tirat Yehuda, killing one man, and two nights later an armed band struck at a house in Kfar Hess, killing a woman and seriously wounding her husband. Jordan was again condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission for these attacks. Both governments were greatly concerned over the happenings during this fortnight, and a great effort was made to stop the work of these groups, which seemed bent on creating tension along the border.

11 August 1953, Israel military forces using demolition mines, bangalore torpedoes, 2-inch mortars, machine-guns and small arms attacked the villages of Idna, Surif and Wadi Fukin, inflicting casualties among the inhabitants and destroying dwellings. The body of an Israel soldier in full uniform with identification tag was found in the village of Idna after the attack. The Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israel for these attacks.

2 September 1953: Arabs, infiltrated from Jordan, reached the neighbourhood of Katamon, in the heart of Jerusalem where they threw hand grenades in all directions. Miraculously, no one was hurt.

3 September 1953: Sovereignty over the DMZ (Demarcation Zone) between Syria Israel is questioned when Israel start a creeping border attempt by using a water diversion in DMZ; USA threatens to end aid channelled to Israel by the Foreign Operations Administration. Israel moves intake out of DMZ.

In September 1953 the General Headquarters orders Unit 101 to drive Bedouins out from the Negev and push them southward to Sinai. Unit 101 soldiers act aggressively: they raid the Bedouin camp, shooting aimlessly, confiscating arms and burning tents. The Bedouins run away, leaving many wounded behind. For a few days Unit 101 pursuits the Bedouins until they are out of the Negev.

2 October 1953: The explosion of a land mine on the Israel railway north of Eyal derailed an Israel freight train. The Mixed Armistice Commission has held Jordan responsible for this act of violence which fortunately caused no loss of life and relatively little damage, as the train was made up of empty tank cars.

14 October 1953: Qibya massacre – 130 Israeli troops crossed the demarcation line into Qibya village, attacking the inhabitants by firing from automatic weapons and explosives. Forty-one dwelling houses and a school building were destroyed. Resulting in the murder of forty-two lives and the wounding of fifteen persons and the damage of a police car, and at the same time, the crossing of a part of the same group into Shuqba village, breaching article III, paragraph 2 of the General Armistice Agreement. A number of unexploded hand grenades, marked with Hebrew letters and three bags of TNT were found in and about the village.

24 November 1953: Resolution 101 the Security Council is passed which &quot;took note of the fact that there is substantial evidence of crossing of the demarcation line by unauthorized persons, ten resulting in acts of violence and requests the Government of Jordan to continue and strengthen the measures which they are already taking to prevent such crossing.&quot; The Security Council condemned Israel for the operation in Qibya.

December 1953: The Jordanian authorities carried out the following measures:-

*(a) Increase of the number of Jordanian police assigned to the border area;
*(b) Increase of the number of patrols of the Jordanian border by Jordanian forces;
*(c) Replacement of village mukhtars and area commanders, where laxity of border control was suspected;
*(d) Removal from the border area of suspected infiltrators and imposing of heavy sentences on known infiltrators;

16 December 1953, two Israeli soldiers were killed while on patrol inside Israel territory (approximate M. R. 1433–1097). On 21 December, the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Jordan for this incident.

18 December 1953, a car was ambushed on the Hebron road (approximate M.R. 1658–1221) inside Jordan and an Arab Legion medical officer was killed. Israel was condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission for this incident (21 December).

21 December 1953, an armed group attacked a Bedouin camp near Tarqumyia (approximate M.R. 1512–1092) wounding one man. Israel was condemned by the Mixed Armistice Commission for this incident (23 December).

21 December, an armed group, using explosives and automatic weapons, attacked a house near Hebron (approximate M.R. 1591–1066) killing one pregnant woman and two men, and wounding another man. Israel was condemned for this incident (24 December).
The last three incidents were apparently reprisal attacks for the killing of the two Israeli soldiers on 16 December. Two Arabs responsible for this crime were arrested by the Jordan police a few days later.

14 February 1954, an Israeli villager on guard duty at Mahasyia, near Deiraban, (approximate M. R. 1510–1282) in the central area, was killed. No evidence was introduced to indicate that Jordanians were guilty of this crime and on 18 February the chairman voted against the Israeli draft resolution condemning Jordan.

17 February 1954: the Israel delegation complained that five armed persons dressed in khaki crossed the demarcation line during the night and, on the morning of 16 February, stole a flock of 260 sheep belonging to an Israeli kibbutz. According to the complaint, the Israeli shepherd and his flock were taken into caves and kept there till 5.30 p.m. when the shepherd was released and the marauders returned to the Gaza Strip with the flock crossing the demarcation line at M.R. 1067–1024. The Israel delegation considered that &quot;the above was a carefully planned action ordered by the Egyptian authorities and carried out by a well-trained military unit.&quot;

17 February 1954: the Israel delegation complained that two Arabs crossed the demarcation line into Israel at M.R. 1018–0992, on 16 February. According to the complaint, they started to escape when challenged by Israeli guards, and fire having been opened on them, one was hit and was dragged over the demarcation line by the second.

18 February, the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israel and Jordan for firing across the demarcation line on 14 February near Deir el Ghusun (approximate M. R. 1575–1955) in the northern area. This firing resulted in the killing, of one Jordanian.

18 February: the Israel delegation complained that on 18 February at 1 p.m. two armed Egyptian soldiers crossed the demarcation line at M.R. 10884–10486. According to the complaint, the Egyptian soldiers refused to stop, when challenged by an Israeli patrol; two warning shots were fired; one of the Egyptian soldieries escaped, and the other was killed 15 meters inside Israel territory

18 February: the Israel delegation complained that on 18 February four armed infiltrators crossed the demarcation line into Israel and that when challenged by an Israel patrol at M.R. 1023–1123 they started to escape while firing on the patrol. During the exchange of fire one of the infiltrators was killed.

19 February: the Egyptian delegation complained that on 18 February, at M.R. 1087–1050, a patrol of two Egyptian soldiers in Egyptian territory was attacked by armed Israelis hiding in ambush. One of the Egyptian soldiers was kidnapped and killed inside Israel-controlled territory, close to the demarcation line (Cf. sub-paragraph (c) above summarizing an Israeli complaint dated 18 February).

19 February: the Egyptian delegation complained that on 19 February armed Israelis opened automatic fire across the demarcation line at an Arab working in his field at M.R. 0952–0931. The Arab was seriously injured.

24 February One Arab was reported killed and another wounded by the Egyptian delegation.

16 March 1954, Israelis of the Ein Gev colony began ploughing 130 dunums of land situated near the colony and belonging to the Arab population of demilitarised Nuqeib, in violation of the verbal agreement concluded at Samara in 1950 to the effect that the two parties should retain and work the said land until the problem was settled.

17 March 1954: Ma&#x27;ale Akrabim massacre [Scorpion Pass]. Terrorists ambushed a bus traveling from Eilat to Tel Aviv, and opened fire at short range when the bus reached the area of Maale Akrabim in the northern Negev. In the initial ambush, the terrorists killed the driver and wounded most of the passengers. The terrorists then boarded the bus, and shot each passenger, one by one. Eleven passengers were murdered. Survivors recounted how the murderers spat on the bodies and abused them. The Israeli claimed that the terrorists could clearly be traced back to the Jordanian border, some 20 km from the site of the terrorist attack. The MAC investigation found that the claim could not be substantiated and that the attack was more likely to have been by Bedu tribesman from within Israel and the Israeli complaint was not upheld.

23 March 1954: The Israel Government has severed all connections with the Mixed Armistice Commission. It has also discontinued attendance at the local commanders&#x27; meetings provided for under a separate Israel-Jordan agreement. Israel communications referring to alleged violations by Jordan of the General Armistice Agreement have been addressed to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, with the request that they should be circulated to the members of the Security Council. The Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization in Jerusalem has been informed of such alleged violations of the General Armistice Agreement only on receiving from New York a copy of the Security Council document. The non-co-operation of the Israel Government has prevented the investigation of such alleged violations in conformity with the provisions of the General Armistice Agreement.

On 29 March 1954, at 07.00 hours, local time, the Jordanian delegation presented to the Chairman of the Mixed Armistice Commission a verbal complaint dealing with an incident which had occurred on 29 March 1954 at 07.00 hours, local time, at Nahhalin village, some 35 kilometers from the demarcation line &quot;an Israel armed force, well equipped, surrounded the village from three directions and penetrated inside the village and opened fire from different automatic weapons, threw hand-grenades and placed mines at some houses, including the mosque of the village. As a result of this brutal attack, 9 persons—8 men and 1 woman—were killed, and 14 others were injured and taken to hospital. Fire lasted for about one hour and a half, and was returned by the village guards. Then the aggressors withdrew. Mines, grenades and other warlike materials bearing Hebrew markings were found on the spot. This complaint was upheld by the Mixed Armistice Commission

30 June 1954, two Israeli armoured launchers attacked the Syrian post of El Koursi, situated on Syrian soil, with their 20-mm. and 57-mm. guns, this time with the support of Israel field artillery sited in the defensive area. This artillery continued firing for approximately one hour and 45 minutes, causing material damage to the post.

5 December 1954, at approximately 16.30 hours, a group of 8 armed Israel State policemen stationed approximately at MR 209600 233400 opened fire on two Arab farmers at approximately MR 209600 233450 in the southern demilitarised zone (Tawafiq). The fire was returned by the two Arabs. One of them was hit by a bullet and immediately taken to hospital. The MAC Decided that the presence of a regular Israel police force in the southern demilitarised zone is a flagrant violation of article V of the General Armistice Agreement and requested that the Israel authorities to pay to the wounded Arab civilian an appropriate compensation.

A list of 29 complaints are alleged in the 27 October 1953 Report by the Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization. See appendix I, II and II for a tabulated list of Israel and Jordanian complaints to the MAC the number of condemnations given to each country as a result of MAC investigations infractions of the agreement by Jordan was submitted on April 6, 1954. These alleged infractions included alleged Jordanian attacks on an Israeli civilian bus, killing 11 people (see 17 March above), attacks on Israeli farmers and Bedouin shepherds, sniping at Israeli civilians from the Old City of Jerusalem, kidnappings, shooting at civilian aircraft, ambushing roads and laying mines. In violation of the agreements, the Jordanians denied Jewish access to the holy places in Jerusalem, prohibited visits to Rachel&#x27;s Tomb and vandalized the Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives, using tombstones for construction of pavements and latrines. The &#x27;Uja al-Hafeer demilitarized zone on the Israeli-Egyptian border was the site of numerous border incidents and armistice violations. In September 1955, Ariel Sharon&#x27;s paratroopers entered the United Nation sector of the demilitarized zone. Benny Morris writes that Sharon &quot;didn&#x27;t realize that the UN area was off limits for his men.&quot;
On May 28, 1958, Israel reported a shooting incident in the demilitarized zone on Mount Scopus in which 4 Israel police officers patrolling the botanical gardens of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, along with the United Nations observer sent to extricate them, were killed by Jordanian fire from Issawiya. Israel sent soldiers into Jordanian territory to conduct raids in retaliation for incursions by armed persons into Israel. From their positions on the Golan Heights Syrian forces shelled Israeli settlements in the demilitarized zone, attacked fishing boats on the Kinneret and fired on agricultural workers.

<doc id="181718" wikidata="Q6862049" url="?curid=181718" title="Mimer SQL">
<text>Mimer SQL is a proprietary SQL-based relational database management system produced by the Swedish company &quot;Mimer Information Technology AB&quot; (Mimer AB), formerly known as &quot;Upright Database Technology AB&quot;. It was originally developed as a research project at the Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden in the 1970s before being developed into a commercial product.

The database has been deployed in a wide range of application situations, including the National Health Service &quot;Pulse&quot; blood transfusion service in the UK, Volvo Cars production line in Sweden and automotive dealers in Australia. It has sometimes been one of the limited options available in realtime critical applications and resource restricted situations such as mobile devices.

==History==
Mimer SQL originated from a project from the ITC service center supporting Uppsala University and some other institutions to leverage the relational database capabilities proposed by Codd and others. The initial release in about 1975 was designated &quot;RAPID&quot; and was written in IBM assembler language. The name was changed to &quot;Mimer&quot; in 1977 to avoid a trademark issue. Other universities were interested in the project on a number of machine architectures and Mimer was rewritten in Fortran to achieve portability. Further models were developed for Mimer with the Mimer/QL implementing the QUEL query languages.

The emergence of SQL in the 1980s as the standard query language resulted in Mimers&#x27; developers choosing to adopt it with the product becoming &quot;Mimer SQL&quot;.

In 1984 Mimer was transferred to the newly established company &quot;Mimer Information Systems&quot;.

==Versions==
 the Mimer SQL database server is currently supported on the main platforms of Windows, MacOS, Linux, and OpenVMS (Itanium and x86-64). Previous versions of the database engine was supported on other operating systems including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Tru 64, SCO and DNIX. Versions of Mimer SQL are available for download and free for development.

The Enterprise product is a standards based SQL database server based upon the Mimer SQL Experience database server. This product is highly configurable and components can be added, removed or replacing in the foundation product to achieve a derived product suitable for embedded, real-time or small footprint application.

The &quot;Mimer SQL Realtime&quot; database server is a replacement database engine specifically designed for applications where real-time aspects are paramount. This is sometimes marketed as the &quot;Automotive approach&quot;. For resource limited environments the &quot;Mimer SQL Mobile&quot; database server is a replacement runtime environment without a SQL compiler. This is used for portable and certain custom devices and is termed the &quot;Mobile Approach&quot;.

Custom embedded approaches can be applied to multiple hardware and operating system combinations.

These options enable Mimer SQL to be deployed to a wide variety of additional target platforms, such as Android, and real-time operating systems including VxWorks.

The database is available in real-time, embedded and automotive specialist versions requiring no maintenance, with the intention to make the product suitable for mission-critical , process automation and telecommunication systems.

==Features==
Mimer SQL provides support for multiple database application programming interfaces (APIs): ODBC, JDBC, ADO.NET, Embedded SQL (C/C++, Cobol and Fortran), Module SQL (C/C++, Cobol, Fortran and Pascal), and the native API&#x27;s Mimer SQL C API, Mimer SQL Real-Time API, and Mimer SQL Micro C API.

MimerPy is an adapter for Mimer SQL in Python.

The Mimer Provider Manager is an ADO.NET provider dispatcher that uses different plugins to access different underlying ADO.NET providers. The Mimer Provider Manager makes it possible to write database independent ADO.NET applications.

Mimer SQL mainly uses optimistic concurrency control (OCC) to manage concurrent transactions.

Mimer SQL is assigned port 1360 in the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) registry.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mimer&quot; is taken from the Norse mythology, where Mimer was the giant guarding the well of wisdom, also known as &quot;Mímisbrunnr&quot;. Metaphorically this is what a database system is doing managing data.

<text>Châlus (; ) is a commune in the Haute-Vienne department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in western France.

==History==

Richard I, King of England was besieging Châlus in 1199 when Pierre Basile wounded him with a crossbow bolt; Richard died of the wound.

In 1275-1280, Géraud de Maumont built a second castle, Châlus Maulmont, in front of Châlus Chabrol. Chateau Châlus Maulmont was damaged extensively during the French Revolution, and was dismantled in 1790, then used as a prison. The tower of Châlus Maulmont collapsed on 20 March 1994.

By 1745, the first map, in the 1/8628th, of Châlus is established to appear in the atlas of Trudaine for the majority of Limoges, with the portion of road at the level of La-Ribière going to Châlus of the Big road from Limoges to Périgueux and with the portion of road reaching the majority of Périgord.

During the First World War, in 1917, American troops stationed in Chalus and maintained contacts with the population. Tradition reports that the American soldiers dynamited the rock of Richard Heart of Lion in order to bring back a portion in the United States. She also reports that an Alsatian refugee provoked a public scandal by addressing the one who had just attempted her reputation: Dare once to repeat that you saw me beat by an American!

T. E. Lawrence, who would later be known as Lawrence of Arabia, celebrated his 20th birthday at the former &quot;Grand Hôtel du Midi, Place de la Fountain&quot;, on 16 August 1908, whilst tracing the route of Richard I of England, on a cycling tour of France in preparation for his thesis: &quot;The Influence of the crusades on the European military architecture at the end of the XIIth century&quot;.

Châlus constitutes the framework or the geographical reference of novels and essays, such as &quot;Women who fall&quot; from Pierre Desproges, or &quot;Quadrille on the tower&quot; of Georges-Emmanuel Clancier. She is also quoted in Robert Margerit&#x27;s &quot;Land of Wolves&quot;, as well as in &quot;Volume 7, When a King Loses France, Cursed Kings&quot; of Maurice Druon or in the &quot;Richard Lionheart&quot; of Walter Scott.
Twice, in 1976 and 2010, the Hollywood cinema evokes Chalus. The film &quot;La Rose et la Flèche / Robin and Marian&quot; (1976), with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn, opens on the siege of Châlus by Richard Cœur de Lion, played by Richard Harris. The first few minutes of Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, with Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett, opening the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, restore the battle of Châlus.

==Regional Nature Park Périgord-Limousin==

Châlus is located in the Périgord-Limousin Regional Nature Park, a public establishment created in 1998 to protect and develop a large rural area with 50,500 inhabitants over 180,000 hectares and which includes 78 municipalities (More than one &quot;associated territory&quot;, the lakes of Haute-Charente), two départements (Dordogne and Haute-Vienne), and formerly two regions, Aquitaine and Limousin, merged into one in 2016: Nouvelle-Aquitaine.
According to its two fundamental principles &quot;Better living on a quality territory&quot; and &quot;Better living through controlled development&quot;, the park aims to protect and enhance the natural, cultural and human heritage of its territory by implementing a policy Development and economic, social and cultural development.
Its actions are also aimed at enhancing local resources with a view to sustainable development, improving the quality of water and hydrosystems at the level of the three headlands of the Périgord-Limousin watersheds, preserving the Biodiversity and the fight against global warming.
The headquarters of this public establishment, which endeavors to boost the identity and social ties of the Périgord-Limousin region, is located in the Mas-Nadaud castle in Pageas.

==Sights==
Châlus has a castle named Château de Châlus-Chabrol and a ruined castle named Château de Châlus-Maulmont.

Richard&#x27;s entrails are still preserved in the chapel, and there is a medieval garden. Other attractions of the village include a museum dedicated to the chestnut.

The biggest Giant sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) in Europe, with a circumference of 13.3 m, is in a private garden.

Inhabitants are known as &quot;Chalusiens&quot;.

<text>Autograph Records was an American record label in the 1920s owned by Marsh Laboratories of Chicago, Illinois, which was owned by Orlando R. Marsh, an electrical engineer.

Marsh made recordings by his own experimental methods. Autograph was the first U.S. record label to release recordings made electrically with microphones, as opposed to the acoustical or mechanical method that was more commonly used. According to author Brian Rust, Marsh&#x27;s first electrical records were made in 1924.

==Organ music==
It was reported in &quot;Time&quot; on April 28, 1923, that a device invented by Marsh was successfully used to make a recording of organ music, until then considered impossible. The article stated that Pietro Yon from New York City played his organ composition &quot;Jesu Bambino&quot; in Marsh&#x27;s Chicago laboratory, and that the reproduction was described as excellent. The article went on to say that this accomplishment appeared to open a new area for the phonograph.

Brian Rust also reported that there was a note in the &quot;Talking Machine Journal&quot; for October 1924 indicating that &quot;Orlando B. Marsh&quot; had just moved to 78 East Jackson Boulevard. Marsh Laboratories became established on the seventh floor of the Lyon &amp; Healy Building. This location attracted customers. Lyon &amp; Healy sold sheet music, records, and musical instruments.

==Discs==
Autograph is best known for some of the fine jazz by artists in Chicago which was recorded on the label. The most famous of all are the duets by King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton. Autograph&#x27;s bestselling records, however, were the series of pipe organ solos by Jesse Crawford. Marsh&#x27;s electrical process was the first to be able to capture an approximation of the range of the organ, but it lacked bass in the tone mix.

About the time that the Autograph records of Crawford were made, Jesse Crawford accepted an offer to be organist at the Paramount Theatre in New York City. Once there, the Victor became interested in having Crawford make recordings for them, first by the acoustical process. Later, Victor recorded Crawford by the Western Electric-licensed process first used by them in 1925.

Milton Charles succeeded Jesse Crawford as organist at the Chicago Theatre and also as the organist used by Orlando Marsh. Charles was recorded by Marsh Laboratories at the Tivoli Theatre (Chicago) with releases on Paramount Records. The Paramount recordings were technically superior to those made at the Chicago Theatre.

The last Autograph records seem to have been recorded in 1926.

Although no longer releasing sides under his own label, Marsh continued to make recordings in Chicago for other labels (including Paramount, Gennett, and Black Patti) through the end of the 1920s.

==Radio==
Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy was the first radio program to be distributed by recorded syndication, and Marsh Laboratories played a role in this. Elizabeth McLeod indicated in an e-mail of December 27, 2002, that recordings by Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll were made in advance of the live airing of the Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy radio shows on WMAQ (AM), Chicago, in the 1928–1929 period at Marsh Laboratories. These were pressed for distribution to other radio stations as 12&quot; shellac 78 rpm discs. She indicated that a speed around 80 rpm was sometimes more accurate. On April 29, 1929, the recording contract went to Brunswick-Balke-Collender (Brunswick Corporation) and the audio quality of the discs improved substantially.

<text>The Caribbean Series (Spanish: &quot;Serie del Caribe&quot;) is an annual club tournament contested by professional baseball teams in Latin America. It is organized by the Caribbean Professional Baseball Confederation. The series is normally played in February, after the various winter leagues have ended their national tournaments.

The Dominican Republic has won the most Caribbean Series championships (23), with Tigres del Licey being the most successful team in the tournament&#x27;s history. The series has been won by 29 teams from seven different countries. Only two teams have won the tournament two consecutive years, the most recent being Criollos de Caguas from Puerto Rico in 2017 and 2018.

==History==
The competition was the brainchild of Venezuelan baseball entrepreneur Pablo Morales and Oscar Prieto Ortiz, who devised the idea after seeing the success of the Serie Interamericana in 1946, which featured the clubs Brooklyn Bushwicks from the United States, Cervecería Caracas from Venezuela, Sultanes de Monterrey from Mexico, and an All-Star team composed of Cuban players.
Inspired by the Interamerican Series and his experience as a former president of the International Baseball Federation, Morales joined Prieto and presented the idea to baseball representatives of Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico during a meeting held in Havana on August 21, 1948. The representatives then agreed to stage a four-country, round-robin tournament 12-game to be known as the &quot;Serie del Caribe&quot;, to be launched in Cuba from February 20–25 of 1949.

The Series ran annually from 1949 through 1960, with Cuba winning seven times. However, the event was suspended in 1961, as a result of the Cuban Revolution. Fidel Castro dissolved all professional baseball in Cuba, and MLB Commissioner Ford Frick ruled that American major leaguers were barred from playing in Havana, where the 1961 series had been scheduled.

It was not until 1970 that the Caribbean Series was revived. Moreover, the 1981 Caribbean Series was not held due to a Venezuelan League player&#x27;s strike.

The tournament featured the champions of the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela for over 40 years. Cuba returned in 2014. Panama returned to host the 2019 edition. Colombia was added for the 2020 edition, replacing Cuba who could not participate due to visa issues. Curaçao was invited as a guest in 2023.

==Series==
== Championship games ==
Starting with the 2013 Caribbean Series, a championship game was introduced where the two teams with the best win–loss record from the round-robin first stage would meet to determine the champion. In 2013 the first round consisted of 12 games and each team faced the other teams twice, one as home club and the other as an away team; from 2014 on, with the return of Cuban teams to the tournament, the first stage was changed to a round robin of 10 games where each team faced the other teams once.

<text>Eid is a former municipality in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. It was located in the traditional district of Nordfjord. The village of Nordfjordeid was the administrative center of the municipality. Other larger villages in Eid included Mogrenda, Stårheim, Haugen, Kjølsdalen, Heggjabygda, and Lote.

At the time of its dissolution in 2020, the municipality is the 215th largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Eid is the 168th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 6,157. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 5.2% over the last decade.

Eid was known for its opera, fjord horses, shopping, and hiking opportunities. As in the rest of the region, agriculture was very important here, but trade and industry were also important. &quot;Frislid Konfeksjon&quot; (textiles) and the Hellesøy Nordfjord shipyard among others are located in Eid.

Nordfjordeid&#x27;s schools include the folk high school, which offers courses linked to Fjord horses and provides the only circus education in Norway. There is also the Norwegian Fjord Horse Centre &quot;(Norsk Fjordhestsenter)&quot; in Eid. Its focus is in boosting the breed&#x27;s standing in Norway and elsewhere.

==General information==

Eid was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The original municipality was identical to the Eid parish &quot;(prestegjeld)&quot; with the sub-parishes () of Hornindal, Eid, and Stårheim. On 1 January 1867, the eastern district of Hornindal was separated from Eid to form its own municipality. This split left the two remaining sub-parishes of the municipality of Eid with a population of 2,918.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the neighboring Davik Municipality and Hornindal Municipality were dissolved and split up among their neighbors. Eid Municipality gained all of Davik that was north of the Nordfjorden and east of and including the village of Lefdal. (Population in that area was 654.) All of Hornindal municipality west of and including the villages of Navelsaker and Holmøyvik (population: 310) was also merged into Eid. After this merger, Eid&#x27;s total population was 4,532. At this point, Eid gained a third sub-parish from the former municipality of Davik: Kjølsdalen. Then on 1 January 1992, the village of Lote and its surrounding area (population: 152) was transferred from Gloppen Municipality to Eid.

On 1 January 2020, Eid Municipality ceased to exist when it was merged with the neighboring Selje Municipality and the Bryggja-Totland area of Vågsøy Municipality to form the new Stad Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Eidsfjorden () since it is a central geographical feature of the area. The fjord is a branch off the main Nordfjorden. The fjord name likely comes from an old river name (now called &quot;Eidselva&quot;). The name of the river was probably derived from the word or which both mean &quot;turned the wrong way&quot; or &quot;backwards&quot;. This is likely because the river Eidselva meanders back and forth and from certain points it can seem to run backwards. Over the centuries, the name was corrupted so that it became more like the word which is a Norwegian word that is derived from which means &quot;isthmus&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 26 April 1986 and they were in use until 1 January 2020 when the municipality ceased to exist. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a horse head couped Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is the head of a fjord horse (&quot;Fjording&quot;), cut cleanly at the neck. The charge has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The region is well known for its own breed of horses, called the Fjording, that are very common and popular in the area. The Fjording is characterised by its white and black mane. The arms were designed by Inge Rotevatn. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had three parishes () within the municipality of Eid. It is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality was under the jurisdiction of the Sogn og Fjordane District Court and the Gulating Court of Appeal.

<text>Cameo Records was an American record label that flourished in the 1920s. It was owned by the Cameo Record Corporation in New York City.

Cameo released a disc by Lucille Hegamin every two months from 1921 to 1926. Cameo records are also noted for dance music. The catalogue also included the Original Memphis Five and the Varsity Eight. Musicians such as Red Nichols, Miff Mole, Adrian Rollini, and Frank Signorelli made trips to the Cameo studios. In 1926, Cameo started recording using a microphone-electrical process. An interesting blues number is 583, &quot;Crazy Blues&quot;, by Salt &amp; Pepper.

The Cameo Record Corporation started Lincoln Records (1924) and Romeo Records (1926). In 1928 it merged with Pathé Records, and then the American Record Corporation. The resulting company stopped using the Cameo name in the 1930s.

This label is not affiliated with Cameo-Parkway Records which was active in the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>Locris (; ; ) was a region of ancient Greece, the homeland of the Locrians, made up of three distinct districts.

==Locrian tribe==
The city of Locri in Calabria (Italy), also known in antiquity as &quot;Epizephyrian Locris&quot;, was a colony founded by the Locrians in Magna Graecia. There is some disagreement over whether it was those from Opuntian Locris or from Ozolian Locris who were responsible.

==Ancient Locris==
The territory of the Locrians was divided into three by Doris and Phocis, perhaps due to an early invasion of a contiguous Locrian state. This fact, combined with the region&#x27;s infertility, meant that the Locrians tended to be dominated by their neighbours, and played little part in Greek history.

To the south-west of Phocis was Ozolian Locris, situated on the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth, between Naupactus and Crisa. The main cities of Ozolian Locris were Amphissa and Naupactus which was its seaport. To the north east of Phocis was Opuntian Locris, named after its main city, Opus. Finally, to the north of Phocis was Epicnemidian Locris, situated near the pass of Thermopylae.

The Opuntian Locris and the Epicnemidian Locris are often regarded as one people, separate in customs and integration to the Hellenic culture from the Ozolian Locris, considered as the less civilised of the two. The territories of the Opuntian Locris and the Epicnemidian Locris were not a continuous unit but were separated from one another by Phocis and Doris.

===Ozolian Locris===

The main towns of Ozolian Locris were Amphissa and Naupactus. Today, the area is part of Aetolia-Acarnania and Phocis.

===Opuntian Locris===
The main towns of Opuntia Locris were Opus and Larymna. Today, Opuntian Locris is part of modern Phthiotis.

===Epicnemidian Locris===
The main towns of Epicnemidian Locris were Nicaea and Thronium. Today, Epicnemidian Locris is part of modern Phthiotis.

==Province==

The province of Locris () was one of the provinces of the Phthiotis Prefecture. Its capital was the town Atalanti. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Amfikleia-Elateia, Lokroi, and Kamena Vourla. It was abolished in 2006.

<text>The Academy Honorary Award – instituted in 1950 for the 23rd Academy Awards (previously called the Special Award, which was first presented at the 1st Academy Awards in 1929) – is given annually by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Since 2009, it has been presented at the separate annual Governors Awards rather than at the regular Academy Awards ceremony. The Honorary Award celebrates motion picture achievements that are not covered by existing Academy Awards, although prior winners of competitive Academy Awards are not excluded from receiving the award.

Unless otherwise specified, Honorary Award recipients receive the same gold Oscar statuettes received by winners of the competitive Academy Awards. Unlike the Special Achievement Award instituted in 1972, those on whom the Academy confers its Honorary Award do not have to meet &quot;the Academy&#x27;s eligibility year and deadline requirements&quot;.

Like the Special Achievement Award, the Special Award and Honorary Award have been used to reward significant achievements of the year that did not fit in existing categories, subsequently leading the Academy to establish several new categories, and to honor exceptional career achievements, contributions to the motion picture industry, and service to the Academy.

==Recipients==

<doc id="181778" wikidata="Q36811" url="?curid=181778" title="Central Kurdish">
<text>Central Kurdish, also known as Sorani Kurdish, is a Kurdish dialect or a language spoken in Iraq, mainly in Iraqi Kurdistan, as well as the provinces of Kurdistan, Kermanshah, and West Azerbaijan in western Iran. Central Kurdish is one of the two official languages of Iraq, along with Arabic, and is in administrative documents simply referred to as &quot;Kurdish&quot;.

The term Sorani, named after the Soran Emirate, refers to a variety of Central Kurdish based on the dialect spoken in Slemani. Central Kurdish is written in the Kurdo-Arabic alphabet, an adaptation of the Arabic script developed in the 1920s by Sa’ed Sidqi Kaban and Taufiq Wahby.

==History==
Tracing back the historical changes of Central Kurdish is difficult. No predecessors of Kurdish are yet known from Old and Middle Iranian times. The extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE. Cebtral Kurdish originates from the Silêmanî region.

=== 1700s–1918 ===
The oldest written literature in Central Kurdish is reported to have been &quot;Mehdîname&quot; (the book of Mahdi) from 1762 by Mulla Muhammed ibn ul Haj. Central Kurdish thus only emerged as a written language after the decline of the Gorani vernacular, the Ardalan state and the rise of Baban around Silêmanî. During the Baban era, Sorani emerged as an important literary vernacular and many poets such as Nalî wrote in Sorani despite being proficient in Arabic and Persian. Nalî mentioned that he wrote in Kurdish knowing his poetry might not receive the same dissemination as it might have done in the more prestigious Arabic or Persian. Contemporaries of Nalî like Salim and Mustefa Bêgî Kurdî also wrote in Sorani and their writings would become the foundation for the standard variety of Central Kurdish. When the Baban dynasty was overthrown in 1850, the golden era of Sorani ended and poets including Nalî left the Silêmanî region. Hacî Qadirî Koyî continued the tradition of writing in Sorani and lamented the lack of promotion of Sorani among the Kurdish clergy and called those who did not do so &#x27;bastards&#x27;. Beside Koyi, Riza Talebanî also promoted Sorani as a literary language.

Prior to the 20th century, only three non-poetic Central Kurdish works are known to exist being &quot;Mewlûdname&quot; by Şêx Husên Qazî (1793-1871), a glossary of Arabic-Kurdish by Ehmedî from 1795 and a translation of the introduction to Gulistan by Saadi Shirazi.

The language of these works heavily relied on Arabic and Persian, which prevented Central Kurdish from enjoying further progress besides being a literary language. Only after World War I did this change.

Besides poetry and the few other texts mentioned above, linguistic works on Central Kurdish also existed. Leonard Chodźko wrote a sketch of the Silêmanî variety (Soran)i in 1857; de Morgan wrote his &quot;Etudea linguistiques: Dialectee Kurdea&quot; in 1904, in which he compared eleven varieties of Kurdish to each other and with Persian and Sanskrit. Later, in 1903, Ely Bannister Soane published a learner textbook and vocabulary list on Sorani for British personnel in Kurdistan, while Oskar Mann wrote &quot;Die Mundart der Mukri Kurden&quot; containing a grammar sketch of the Central Kurdish variety of Mukriyan in 1906. Lastly, Ludvig Olsen Fossum published a grammar book in 1919 based on the Central Kurdish variety spoken around Mahabad.

=== 1918–1930s ===

After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, much of the Central Kurdish-speaking region came under British rule in present-day Iraq. Central Kurdish subsequently became the language for prose, media, and journalism, and a distinct alphabet was created for the vernacular. Sorani also gained a kurdified vocabulary by the 1950s. The British began publishing periodicals in the language to mobilize Kurds, since the Central Kurdish-speaking contingent of Iraq was more urbanized, better educated, and more inclined towards Kurdish nationalism than the Kurmanji-speaking population around Duhok. Such nationalism was promoted to prevent any Turkish takeover of Kirkuk and Mosul. To this end, the first government press in Sorani was established in Sulaymaniyah in 1920, which propelled Central Kurdish into becoming a language of media, education, and administration. The government press had by 1923 published six books, 118 issues of the weekly publication &quot;Pêşkewtin&quot; (Progress), fourteen issues of &quot;Bangî Kurdistan&quot; (The Call of Kurdistan), and sixteen issues of &quot;Rojî Kurdistan&quot; (The Day of Kurdistan). The period also saw the publication of Central Kurdish works for schools, and courts began using the language as well. In 1923, Taufiq Wahby was instructed to produce school books in Central Kurdish by the Iraqi government, and his modified orthography for the language would be implemented as the official Central Kurdish script in school textbooks two decades later. His orthography included purging the Arabic letters () and creating the new letters (). Wahby also supported switching to the Latin alphabet, but this idea was not accepted by the literary society or the state.

In the 1930s, the League of Nations urged Iraq to draft a law guaranteeing the use of the Kurdish language. The authorities reluctantly agreed, but the British knew the law would not be implemented once they left Iraq. This pushed the British to implement the law themselves in May 1931, which made Kurdish an official language in the governorates of Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk, and Erbil. Kurds were, however, dissatisfied, since Kurdish was only allowed to be used in elementary schools and Iraq had fully arabized the education and administration systems in Kirkuk and Mosul. In subsequent years, linguistic rights for Kurds were either ignored or reluctantly implemented.

The development of Central Kurdish was slow in Iran and faced many challenges. The earliest use of the language was during the Simko Shikak revolt of 1918 to 1922, which saw the use of Central Kurdish side by side with Kurmanji as official languages in the area controlled by the rebels. After the defeat of the revolt, formal use of Central Kurdish ceased until 1946. During the rule of Reza Shah from 1925 to 1941, Iran was extremely centralist and Persian was dominant to the detriment of other languages. A decree issued by the government in 1935 suppressed Kurdish and marked its end as a written language. Only a dozen handwritten poetic manuscripts in Central Kurdish exist from this period, including works by Hassan Saifulquzzat, Said Kamil Imani, and Khalamin Barzanji.

=== 1940s–1950s ===
By the 1940s, the Silêmanî variant of the dialect had become the standard variant of Central Kurdish and even Kurds in Iran accepted this. The 1940s also saw the use of Sorani in radio broadcasting which elevated its prestige but also the urgency in proficiency since it was linked to current events.

;Iraq

The 1940s experienced an intermittent suppression of Kurdish but Central Kurdish still succeeded in becoming considerably standardized by the end of the period. By the time the 14 July Revolution took place in 1958, Central Kurdish had incorporated the norms of a standard language which had given it legitimacy. During the new Iraqi Republic from 1958 to 1968, the number of journals in Central Kurdish increased fast and a Kurdish department was established at the University of Baghdad and moreover a Directorate General of Kurdish Studies was established to answer the growing Kurdish demands for mother tongue education.

In 1960, the first Central Kurdish-Arabic dictionary was published.

;Iran

After the ousting of Reza Shah in 1941 and the Anglo-Soviet occupation of Iran, nationalist movements among Kurds gained strength and Central Kurdish became the formal language again, especially in Mukriyan where the &quot;Komeley Jiyanewey Kurd&quot; (KJK) used it as their official language. Central Kurdish was also introduced in schools, administration and in mosques. Kurds in Iraq aided with this, for example by exporting school books to Iran. Language planning was also in the works but rudimentary. When the Republic of Mahabad fell, formal use of Central Kurdish also ceased in Iran, however the new Pahlavi state under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi would become more tolerant than that of Reza Shah. Researcher Hassanpour argues that the reason for this was the vulnerability of the new central government which had to approach the Kurds more relaxed. For this, some developments did take place including the publication of periodicals in Central Kurdish but also state-sponsored radio broadcasting and teaching Kurdish at the University of Tehran.

In the 1950s, the Iranian authorities began restricting and controlling the tolerance towards Kurdish which continued towards the Iranian Revolution in 1979. No positive rights were given and any written use was controlled. However, the restrictions had to be loosen since Kurds in Iran were receiving radio broadcasting from Iraq and Soviet Armenia. Iran thus allowed for limited radio broadcasting in Mahabad, Sanandaj and Kermanshah which legitimized and popularized Central Kurdish further.

=== 1960s–1980s ===

;Iraq

The Kurdish Scientific Academy was established in Baghdad in 1968 which devoted a significant part of their job to develop neologisms, grammar books, writing style guide-lines, a modified orthography and research in linguistics subjects. The Kurdistan Democratic Party and its media also used Central Kurdish as their official language despite its leader Mustefa Barzanî being a Kurmanji-speaker. Despite the deterioration of relations between the Kurds and Iraq in the 1970s, the state still sponsored the implementation of Central Kurdish as language in secondary schools. However, this ended by 1978 when the Iraqi authorities embarked on an Arabization to quell Kurdish nationalism. On this, Hassanpour wrote in 1992 that:

 Central Kurdish continued as the main language in elementary and secondary schools in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the 1980s, the state sponsored publications in Central Kurdish despite warring with the Kurds.

;Iran

In the 1960s, schooling in Kurdish or teaching Kurdish was unthinkable, even in private. However, the University of Tehran began offering two courses in Kurdish even though one had to refrain from discussing Kurdish and had to call it a &#x27;dialect&#x27;. The policy of the Pahlavi state in regard to Kurdish was like that of safety valve where rights were restricted when the state felt threatened. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the new Iranian constitution was ambiguous towards Kurdish but the new regime discouraged the use of Central Kurdish both in private and in public. Limited media in Central Kurdish was allowed in the subsequent years. The policy of safety valve continued throughout the 1980s.

=== 1990s ===

;Iraq

Kurdistan Region Parliament passed a provisional constitution in 1992 making Kurdish the official language of Kurdistan Region. &#x27;Kurdish&#x27; would refer to Central Kurdish which also became the language of instruction in Kurmanji– and Gorani–speaking areas until these linguistic communities demanded education in Kurmanji and Gorani, respectively. Central Kurdish ceased as language of instruction in these areas in the mid-2000s. In 1997, the Kurdistan Sciency Academy was established in Erbil with the goal of creating a unitary language in the autonomous region.

;Iran

More leniency was given towards Kurdish, especially Central Kurdish in the 1990s, but use of Central Kurdish in administration and education was still not allowed. The debate on mother tongue education entered the public sphere in the 2000s.

=== 2000s–2010s ===
World Wide Web has had a significant impact on Central Kurdish as thousands of Central Kurdish-speakers have gotten free access to literature. It also became easier to listen to radio and watch television. The Internet moreover fostered the use of Central Kurdish in Iran and the diaspora, where the language had no official status.

Orthography remains a challenge for Central Kurdish. In Iraq, Central Kurdish orthography is moving towards being based on a single morpheme while Sorani-speakers in Iran make longer words. An example is the word &quot;to review&quot; which can be spelled both &quot;pêdaçûnewe and&quot; &quot;pê da çûnewe.&quot;

Arabic and Persian words continue to be purged from written Central Kurdish and are getting replaced by neologisms. Conversely, Central Kurdish is borrowing words from the English language.

;Iraq

After the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq declared Kurdish as the official language of the country beside Arabic. The first section of Article 4 secures this. In 2006, Duhok began using Kurmanji as their official language as a way of resisting Central Kurdish. Fearing the loss of hegemony, 53 academics, writers and poets pushed the Kurdish Parliament to declare Central Kurdish as the official language of the autonomous region. This attempt failed multiple times and Kurmanji remains the official Kurdish language in Duhok. In the 2010s, criticism arose due to the quality of the Sorani school textbooks, media texts and signage. In 2011, two journalism professors from Salahaddin University criticized the state of Central Kurdish in Kurdistan Region which could affect its use among the people. They also expressed dismay over the method of the Parliament in using the language, since the institution wrote their bills and laws in Arabic and then translated to Central Kurdish.

;Iran

More flexibility was shown to Kurdish in the mid-2000s by the reformists, likely to win the Kurdish vote. Kurds used the opportunity and began publishing more in Central Kurdish, set up private language learning courses and also advocated for the implementation of Article 15 of the Constitution which would allow the use of regional languages. The use of Central Kurdish in Iran has since then been revitalized by Kurdish book publishers like &quot;Mang&quot;. Nonetheless, the use of Central Kurdish in the public school system is not supported by Iranian nationalists and conservatives who believe it could damage the unity of the nation-state.

==Writing system==
Central Kurdish is mostly written with a modified version of the Arabic alphabet. The Latin-based Hawar Alphabet is also used increasingly, and there have been discussions about its adoption.

In the Central Kurdish writing system almost all vowels are always written as separate letters. This is in contrast to the original Arabic writing system and most other writing systems developed from it, in which certain vowels (usually &quot;short&quot; vowels) are shown by diacritics above and under the letters, and usually omitted.

The other major point of departure of the Central Kurdish writing system from other Arabic-based systems is that the Arabic letters that represent sounds that are non-existent in Kurdish are usually (but not always) replaced by letters that better represent their Kurdish pronunciation.

==Media and education==
Iraq is the only country in which a Kurdish language has enjoyed official or semi-official rights during the last few decades. Kurdish media outlets in Iraq mushroomed during the 1990s, spurred by the semi-autonomous status the region has enjoyed since the uprising against the Saddam regime in 1991. The use of Kurdish in media and education is prevalent in Iraqi Kurdistan. Seven of the top 10 TV stations viewed by Iraqi Kurds are Kurdish-language stations, and the use of Arabic in Kurdistan schools has decreased to the extent that the number of Iraqi Kurds who speak Arabic fluently has dropped significantly over the past decades.

Some Kurdish media in Iraq seem to be aiming for constructing a cross-border Kurdish identity. The Kurdish-language satellite channel Kurdistan TV (KTV), owned by the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), for example, employs techniques that expose audiences to more than one Kurdish variety in the same show or program. It has been suggested that continuous exposure to different Kurdish varieties on KTV and other satellite television stations might make Kurdish varieties increasingly mutually intelligible.

In Iran, state-sponsored regional TV stations air programs in both Kurdish and Persian. Kurdish press are legally allowed in Iran, but there have been many reports of a policy of banning Kurdish newspapers and arresting Kurdish activists.

== Phonology ==
Central Kurdish has 9 phonemic vowels and 26 to 28 phonemic consonants (depending on whether the pharyngeal sounds /ħ/ and /ʕ/ are counted or not).
=== Vowels ===

Vowels in parentheses are not phonemic, but have been included in the table below because of their ubiquity in the language. Letters in the Central Kurdish alphabet take various forms depending on where they occur in the word. Forms given below are letters in isolation.
==== Some vowel alternations and notes ====
The vowel [æ] is sometimes pronounced as [ə] (the sound found in the first syllable of the English word &quot;above&quot;). This sound change takes place when [æ] directly precedes [w] or when it is followed by the sound [j] (like English &quot;y&quot;) in the same syllable. If it, instead, precedes [j] in a context where [j] is a part of another syllable it is pronounced [ɛ] (as in English &quot;bet&quot;).

The vowels [o] and [e], both of which have slight off-glides in English, do not possess these off-glides in Sorani.

=== Consonants ===
Letters in the Central Kurdish alphabet take various forms depending on where they occur in the word. Forms given below are letters in isolation.
An important allophonic variation concerns the two velar sounds /k/ and /g/. Similar to certain other languages of the region (e.g. Turkish and Persian), these consonants are strongly palatalized before the close and mid front vowels (/i/ and /e/) in Central Kurdish.

=== Syllable ===
Central Kurdish allows both complex onsets (e.g. spî: &quot;white&quot;, kwêr: &quot;blind&quot;) and complex codas (e.g. ferş: &quot;carpet&quot;). However, the two members of the clusters are arranged in such a way that, in all cases, the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) is preserved. In many loanwords, an epenthetic vowel is inserted to resyllabify the word, omitting syllables that have codas that violate SSP. Originally mono-syllabic words such as /hazm/ (&quot;digestion&quot;) and /zabt/ (&quot;record&quot;) therefore become /hɛ.zɪm/ and /zɛ.bɪt/ respectively.

Primary stress always falls on the last syllable in nouns, but in verbs its position differs depending on tense and aspect. Some have suggested the existence of an alternating pattern of secondary stress in syllables in Central Kurdish words.

==Grammar==

===Absolute state===
A noun in the absolute state occurs without any suffix, as it would occur in a vocabulary list or dictionary entry. Absolute state nouns receive a generic interpretation, as in &quot;qawe reş e.&quot; (&quot;Coffee is black.&quot;) and &quot;befr spî ye.&quot; (&quot;Snow is white&quot;).

=== Indefinite state ===
Indefinite nouns receive an interpretation like English nouns preceded by &quot;a, an&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, or &quot;any&quot;.

Several modifiers may only modify nouns in the indefinite state. This list of modifiers includes: 
* &quot;çend&quot; [ʧɛnd] &quot;a few&quot;
* &quot;hemû&quot; [hɛmu] &quot;every&quot;
* çî [ʧi] &quot;what&quot;
* her [hɛɾ] &quot;each&quot;
* ... i zor [ɪ zoɾ] &quot;many&quot;
Nouns in the indefinite state take the following endings:

A few examples are given below showing how nouns are made indefinite:
* پیاو piyaw &#x27;man&#x27; &gt; پیاوێک piyawêk &#x27;a man&#x27;
* نامه name &#x27;letter&#x27; &gt; نامه‌یه‌ک nameyek &#x27;a letter&#x27;
* پیاو piyaw &#x27;man&#x27; &gt; پیاوان piyawan &#x27;(some) men&#x27;
* ده‌رگا derga &#x27;door&#x27; &gt; ده‌رگایان dergayan &#x27;(some) doors&#x27;

==== Definite state ====
Definite nouns receive an interpretation like English nouns preceded by &quot;the&quot;.

Nouns in the definite state take the following endings:

When a noun stem ending with [i] is combined with the definite state suffix the result is pronounced [ekɛ] ( i + eke → ekɛ)

=== Verbs ===
Like many other Iranian languages, verbs have a present stem and a past stem in Sorani. The present simple tense, for example, is composed of the aspect marker &quot;de&quot; (&quot;e&quot; in Sulaymaniyah dialect) followed by the present stem followed by a suffixed personal ending. This is shown in the example below with the verb نووسین / nûsîn (&quot;to write&quot;), the present stem of which is نووس / nûs.

Note that the personal endings are identical for the second person plural (Plural &quot;you&quot;) and third person plural (&quot;they&quot;).

Similarly, the simple past verb is created using the past stem of the verb. The following example shows the conjugation of the intransitive verb هاتن hatin (&quot;to come&quot;) in the simple past tense. The past stem of &quot;hatin&quot; is &quot;hat&quot;.

Central Kurdish is claimed by some to have split ergativity, with an ergative-absolutive arrangement in the past tense for transitive verbs. Others, however, have cast doubt on this claim, noting that the Central Kurdish past may be different in important ways from a typical ergative-absolutive arrangement. In any case, the transitive past tense in Central Kurdish is special in that the agent affix looks like the possessive pronouns and usually precedes the verb stem (similar to how accusative pronouns in other tenses). In the following example, the transitive verb نووسین / nûsîn (&quot;to write&quot;) is conjugated in the past tense, with the object &quot;name&quot; (&quot;letter&quot;). The past stem of the verb is &quot;nûsî&quot;.

Note in the example above that the clitics attaching to the objects are otherwise interpreted as possessive pronouns. The combination &quot;name-m&quot; therefore is translated as &quot;my letter&quot; in isolation, &quot;name-t&quot; as &quot;your letter&quot;, and so on.

The agent affix is a clitic that must attach to a preceding word/morpheme. If the verb phrase has words other than the verb itself (as in the above example), it attaches to first word in the verb phrase. If no such pre-verbal matter exists, it attaches to the first morpheme of the verb. In the progressive past, for example, where the aspect marker &quot;de&quot; precedes the verb stem, the clitic attaches to &quot;de&quot;.

==Hewlêrî Kurdish==
Hewlêrî Kurdish or Hawleri () is a regional dialect of Kurdish spoken primarily in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region, and in some of its surrounding areas. Hewlêrî is spoken not only by its Kurdish inhabitants but also by other ethnic communities residing in the city, including Turkmen and Assyrians. Hewlêrî has many characteristics that distinguish it from other Kurdish dialects and has had an impact on shaping the standard Sorani dialect.

===Pronunciation and Phonology===
Differing from standard Central Kurdish, Hewlêrî displays several noteworthy phonetic differences. One prominent contrast is observed in the pronunciation of the letter &quot;ڵ/ll&quot;. While in most Central Kurdish dialects, this sound is pronounced as /ɫ/, in Hewlêrî it is typically pronounced as /ɾ/ or /l/.

In the Hewlêrî Kurdish spoken in Erbil, further phonetic changes are evident. Notably, there&#x27;s a shift observed from &quot;û&quot; to &quot;î&quot; and &quot;w&quot; to &quot;f&quot;. For instance, &quot;șûtî&quot; transforms into &quot;şiftî,&quot; while &quot;mizgewt&quot; changes to &quot;mizgeft.&quot; These phonetic alterations are commonly found in both Hewlêrî and the Kurmanji dialect.

===Grammar and Syntax===
Apart from its phonetic distinctions, the subdialect encompasses several unique grammatical and syntactic characteristics. Unlike standard Sorani but similar to Kurmanji, Hewlêrî Kurdish employs oblique case and utilizes different personal pronouns. Another feature of the dialect is the use of the suffix &quot;ek/ەک&quot; instead of the standard &quot;êk\ێک.&quot;

<text>The Mid-Atlantic is a region of the United States located in the overlap between the nation&#x27;s Northeastern and Southeastern states. According the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the Mid-Atlantic includes six U.S. states, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the national capital of Washington, D.C. 

The region was founded in the 17th century as the Middle Colonies during the colonial era, initially including four colonial provinces, the Delaware Colony and the Provinces of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, each of which were among the Thirteen Colonies in pre-revolutionary British America. As of the 2020 census, the region had a population of 60,783,913, representing slightly over 18% of the nation&#x27;s population. 

The Mid-Atlantic region played an instrumental and historic role in the nation&#x27;s founding and the development of the nation. Six of the seven states were members of the Thirteen Colonies that sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress, which assembled in Philadelphia and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, and formalized the Continental Army under George Washington&#x27;s command during the American Revolutionary War. Following independence, the states again gathered in Philadelphia at the Constitutional Convention, in 1788, where they ratified the United States Constitution, which remains the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world.

The Mid-Atlantic region was settled during the colonial era between the early 17th century and the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 by European Americans of primarily Dutch, German, Swedish, English, and other Western European ethnicities. Religious pluralism and freedoms existed in the original Thirteen Colonies and were particularly prevalent in Province of Pennsylvania and the geographic region that ultimately broke from Pennsylvania to form the Delaware Colony. Among the 13 colonies, the Province of Maryland was the only colony with a substantial Catholic population.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the Mid-Atlantic region hosted each of the historic capitals of the United States. The nation&#x27;s capital was constructed in Washington, D.C. in the late 18th century, and relocated there from Philadelphia in 1800. 

In the early part of the 19th century, New York and Pennsylvania overtook Virginia as the nation&#x27;s two most populous states, and the Mid-Atlantic region overtook New England as the most important trading and industrial center in the nation. During this period, large numbers of German, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Polish, and other immigrants arrived in the region&#x27;s coastal cities, including Baltimore, Newark, New York City, Philadelphia, and interior cities such as Pittsburgh, and Rochester, Albany, and Buffalo, with their skyscrapers and subways, which emerged as icons of modernity and American economic and cultural power in the 20th century.

In the late 19th century, the region played a vital and historic role in the development of American culture, commerce, trade, and industry sectors. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner labeled it &quot;typically American.&quot;

The Northeast Corridor and Interstate 95 in the region link an almost contiguous urban region, which includes large and small cities and their respective suburbs and forms the Northeast megalopolis, one of the world&#x27;s most important concentrations of finance, media, communications, education, medicine, and technology. The Mid-Atlantic is a relatively affluent region of the nation; nearly half of the nation&#x27;s 100 highest-income counties based on median household income are located in the Mid-Atlantic, and 33 of the nation&#x27;s top 100 counties based on per capita income are in the region. Most of the Mid-Atlantic states rank among the 15 highest-income states in the nation by both median household income and per capita income.

The region is home to eight of the top 25 ranked universities in the nation: Cornell University in Ithaca, New York; Columbia University and NYU in New York City; Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey; the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia; Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh; Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.; and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges Ranking.

==Composition==
Definitions of the geographic components of the Mid-Atlantic region differ slightly among sources. Generally speaking, the region is inclusive of the states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, and the federal district of the District of Columbia, with some additional sources including or excluding other areas in parts of the Northeast region and the South Atlantic states, for practical reasons.

The United States Census Bureau defines the Mid-Atlantic as a sub-region of the Northeast and only includes New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Bureau of Labor Statistics excludes New York; the Environmental Protection Agency excludes New York and New Jersey; and the U.S. Department of Transportation - United States Maritime Administration includes North Carolina. In 2004, the United States Geological Survey within the context of Ground-Water Vulnerability to Nitrate Contamination, defined the region as including Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., and parts of New Jersey, New York, and North Carolina. 

West Virginia and Virginia are atypical of this region in a few ways. These states both primarily lie within the Southern American dialect region, and the major religious tradition is largely Evangelical Christian, with 30% in Virginia and 39% in West Virginia identifying as evangelicals. Although a few of West Virginia&#x27;s eastern panhandle counties are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area, the major portion of the state is rural and there are no major or even large cities.

==History==
Shipping and trade have been important to the Mid-Atlantic economy since the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to see the region in 1524. Henry Hudson later extensively explored that region in 1611 and claimed it for the Dutch, who then created a fur-trading post in Albany in 1614. Jamestown, Virginia was the first permanent English colony in North America, it was established seven years earlier in 1607.

From early colonial times, the Mid-Atlantic region was settled by a wider range of European people than in New England or the South. The Dutch New Netherland settlement along the Hudson River in New York City and New Jersey, and for a time, New Sweden along the Delaware River in Delaware, divided the two great bulwarks of English settlement from each other. The original English settlements in the region notably provided refuge to religious minorities, Maryland to Roman Catholics and Pennsylvania to Quakers and Anabaptist Pennsylvania Dutch. In time, all these settlements fell under English colonial control, but the region continued to be a magnet for people of diverse nationalities.

The area that came to be known as the Middle Colonies served as a strategic bridge between the North and South. The New York and New Jersey campaign during the American Revolutionary War saw more battles than any other theater of the conflict. Philadelphia, midway between the northern and southern colonies, was home to the Continental Congress, the convention of delegates who organized the American Revolution. Philadelphia also was the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the United States Constitution in 1787, while the United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified and the first Supreme Court of the United States sat for the first time, in the first capital under the Constitution of New York.

While early settlers were mostly farmers, traders, and fishermen, the Mid-Atlantic states provided the young United States with heavy industry and served as the &quot;melting pot&quot; of new immigrants from Europe. Cities grew along major ports, shipping routes, and waterways, including New York City and Newark on opposite sides of the Hudson River, Philadelphia on the Delaware River, Allentown on the Lehigh River, and Baltimore on the Chesapeake Bay.

===Sports===
The Mid-Atlantic is home to 33 professional sports franchises in the five major leagues and the two most prominent women&#x27;s professional leagues:


Notable golf tournaments in the Mid-Atlantic include the Barclays, Quicken Loans National and Atlantic City LPGA Classic.

Two high-level professional tennis tournaments are held in the region. The US Open, held in New York, is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, whereas the Washington Open is part of the ATP Tour 500 series and WTA 250 series.

Notable motorsports tracks include Watkins Glen International, Dover Motor Speedway and Pocono Raceway, which have hosted Formula One, IndyCar, NASCAR, World Sportscar Championship and IMSA races. Also, the Englishtown and Reading drag strips such have hosted NHRA national events. Pimlico Race Course at Baltimore and Belmont Park at New York host the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes horse races, which are part of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.

==Economy==
With a GDP nominal of over $5.2 trillion, the Mid-Atlantic economy would be third-largest in the world if calculated separately, only behind the remaining United States and China and nearly $1 trillion larger than next place Japan. This economic prosperity is buoyed by a significant financial services and banking sector, healthcare and chemicals industry, and telecommunications and entertainment conglomerates.

According to the Global Financial Centres Index, the Mid-Atlantic region is home to the leading financial center in the world (New York) at #1, with Washington also present at #15.

Notable companies (over $100 billion market cap) headquartered in the region include:

<doc id="181786" wikidata="Q161205" url="?curid=181786" title="Safavid dynasty">
<text>The Safavid dynasty (; , ) was one of Iran&#x27;s most significant ruling dynasties reigning from 1501 to 1736. Their rule is often considered the beginning of modern Iranian history, as well as one of the gunpowder empires. The Safavid Shāh Ismā&#x27;īl I established the Twelver denomination of Shīʿa Islam as the official religion of the Persian Empire, marking one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam. The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Iranian Azerbaijan region. It was an Iranian dynasty of Kurdish origin, but during their rule they intermarried with Turkoman, Georgian, Circassian, and Pontic Greek dignitaries, nevertheless, for practical purposes, they were Turkish-speaking and Turkified. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.

The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736 and 1750 to 1773) and, at their height, controlled all of what is now Iran, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Armenia, eastern Georgia, parts of the North Caucasus including Russia, Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Despite their demise in 1736, the legacy that they left behind was the revival of Iran as an economic stronghold between East and West, the establishment of an efficient state and bureaucracy based upon &quot;checks and balances&quot;, their architectural innovations, and patronage for fine arts. The Safavids have also left their mark down to the present era by establishing Twelver Shīʿīsm as the state religion of Iran, as well as spreading Shīʿa Islam in major parts of the Middle East, Central Asia, Caucasus, Anatolia, the Persian Gulf, and Mesopotamia.

==Genealogy and identity==
The Safavid Kings themselves claimed to be sayyids, family descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although many scholars have cast doubt on this claim. There seems now to be a consensus among scholars that the Safavid family hailed from Iranian Kurdistan, and later moved to Iranian Azerbaijan, finally settling in the 11th century CE at Ardabil. Traditional pre-1501 Safavid manuscripts trace the lineage of the Safavids to the Kurdish dignitary, Firuz-Shah Zarrin-Kolah.

According to historians, including Vladimir Minorsky and Roger Savory, the Safavids were Turkish speakers of Iranian origin:

By the time of the establishment of the Safavid empire, the members of the family were Turkicized and Turkish-speaking, and some of the Shahs composed poems in their then-native Turkish language. Concurrently, the Shahs themselves also supported Persian literature, poetry and art projects including the grand &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Shah Tahmasp, while members of the family and some Shahs composed Persian poetry as well.

The authority of the Safavids was religiously based, and their claim to legitimacy was founded on being direct male descendants of Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, and regarded by the Shiʻa as the first Imam.

Furthermore, the dynasty was from the very start thoroughly intermarried with both Pontic Greek as well as Georgian lines. In addition, from the official establishment of the dynasty in 1501, the dynasty would continue to have many intermarriages with both Circassian as well as again Georgian dignitaries, especially with the accession of Tahmasp I.

==Safavid Shahs of Iran==
*Ismail I 1501–1524
*Tahmasp I 1524–1576
*Ismail II 1576–1578
*Mohammad Khodabanda 1578–1587
*Abbas I 1587–1629
*Safi 1629–1642
*Abbas II 1642–1666
*Suleiman I 1666–1694
*Soltan Hoseyn 1694–1722
*Tahmasp II 1722–1732
*Abbas III 1732–1736

==Mothers of Safavid Shahs==
==Culture==
The Safavid family was a literate family from its early origin. There are extant Tati and Persian poetry from Shaykh Safi ad-din Ardabili as well as extant Persian poetry from Shaykh Sadr ad-din. Most of the extant poetry of Shah Ismail I is in Azerbaijani pen-name of Khatai. Sam Mirza, the son of Shah Ismail as well as some later authors assert that Ismail composed poems both in Turkish and Persian but only a few specimens of his Persian verse have survived. A collection of his poems in Azeri were published as a Divan. Shah Tahmasp who has composed poetry in Persian was also a painter, while Shah Abbas II was known as a poet, writing Azerbaijani verses. Sam Mirza, the son of Ismail I was himself a poet and composed his poetry in Persian. He also compiled an anthology of contemporary poetry.

<doc id="181796" wikidata="Q890530" url="?curid=181796" title="Amesbury Archer">
<text>The Amesbury Archer ( 2340 BC - 2300 BC) is an early Bronze Age (Bell Beaker) man whose grave was discovered during excavations at the site of a new housing development () in Amesbury near Stonehenge. The grave was uncovered in May 2002. The man was middle aged when he died, estimated between 35 and 45, around 2300 BC. He is nicknamed &quot;the Archer&quot; because of the many arrowheads buried with him. The grave contained more artefacts than any other early British Bronze Age burial, including the earliest known gold objects ever found in England. It was the first evidence of a very high status and wealth expressed in a burial from that time. Previously, Bronze Age society had been assumed not to have been particularly hierarchical.

The calibrated radiocarbon dates for his grave, and dating of Stonehenge, suggest the sarsens and trilithons at Stonehenge may have been raised by the time he was born, although a new bluestone circle may have been raised around the time of his birth.

==Burial==
The Archer&#x27;s grave yielded the greatest number of artefacts ever found in a British burial from the Early Bronze Age. Among those discovered were: five funerary pots of the type associated with the Beaker culture; three tiny copper knives; sixteen barbed flint arrowheads; a kit of flint-knapping and metalworking tools, including cushion stones that functioned as a kind of portable anvil, which suggests he was a coppersmith; and some boar tusks. A piece of iron pyrite, which sparks when struck by flint to start a fire, had been well used with grooves worn along its sides. On his forearm was a black stone wrist-guard. A similar red wrist-guard was by his knees. With the second wrist-guard was a shale belt ring and a pair of gold hair ornaments, the oldest gold objects known from England.

The anatomy of the Archer has been well documented, with several unusual features including os acromiale whereby the acromion at the tip of the scapula was not fused as is usual, spina bifida occulta (&#x27;hidden&#x27; spina bifida) and a missing left patella. Research using oxygen isotope analysis in the Archer&#x27;s tooth enamel has suggested that he originated from an alpine region of central Europe. An eroded hole in his jaw showed that he had had an abscess, and his missing left kneecap suggests that he had an injury that left him with a painful lingering bone infection.

His skeleton is now on display at the Salisbury Museum in Salisbury.

==Second burial==
A male skeleton found interred nearby is believed to be that of a younger man related to the Archer, as they shared a rare hereditary anomaly, calcaneonavicular coalition, fusing of the calcaneus and of the navicular tarsal (foot bones). This younger man, sometimes called the Archer&#x27;s Companion, appears to have been raised in a more local climate. The Archer was estimated to be about forty at the time of his death, while his companion was in his early twenties. The graves were discovered a short distance from the Boscombe Bowmen, whose bones were excavated the following year.

==Importance of the burials==
The Archer was quickly dubbed the &quot;King of Stonehenge&quot; in the British press due to the proximity of the famous monument and some even suggested that he could have been involved in its construction. However, such speculations have been rejected by archaeologists.

His is just one high-profile burial that dates from around the time of the stones&#x27; erection, but given the lavish nature of the grave his mourners clearly considered him important enough to be buried near to (if not in the immediate area of) Stonehenge. Tim Darvill regards the skeleton as possibly that of a pilgrim visiting Stonehenge to draw on the &#x27;healing properties&#x27; of the bluestones.

His grave is of particular importance because of its connections with Continental Europe and early copper smelting technology. He is believed to be one of the earliest gold metalworkers in Britain, and he provides an example of a person bringing Bell Beaker culture and its pottery directly from continental Europe.

==DNA analysis==

The DNA of the Archer&#x27;s skeleton was difficult to analyse at first and had to be omitted from a 2018 study of 226 Bell Beaker burials from across Europe, although DNA from the nearby &#x27;Companion&#x27; was included in the study. Later, a successful sample was taken from the Archer and analysed. It appears that both the Archer and the Companion in the male line (Y-chromosome) had Steppe ancestry, the Archer being classified as R1b1a1b1a1a (haplogroup R-L151) and the Companion as R1b1a1b1a1a2c1 (haplogroup R-L21). The two men were not related in the 1st or 2nd degree, although a more distant relationship, such as great-grandfather / great-grandson, is possible.
A further finding was that the Archer had a greater amount of Early European Farmer ancestry (%) than the Companion (%).

It had already been shown from strontium and oxygen isotope analysis of the Archer&#x27;s 2nd premolar and 3rd molar teeth (which mineralise at different ages) that the Archer spent his childhood in Central Europe, probably in the Western Alps. By contrast the Companion appears to have been born in Wessex, but spent part of his childhood in Europe, perhaps in the same region of the Western Alps.

Although the Archer may have spoken an Indo-European language, it does not follow that he spoke an early form of Irish or Welsh. The authors of a 2021 study of large-scale migration into Britain favour the view that Celtic languages were introduced by a much later influx of people from continental Europe which occurred in the Late Bronze Age between 1000 and 875 BC.

==In popular culture==
The character of Arthmael in Mark Patton&#x27;s novel &quot;Undreamed Shores&quot; is based on the Archer.

<text>The early written records of the history of Montenegro begin with Illyria and its various kingdoms until the Roman Republic incorporated the region into the province of Illyricum (later Dalmatia and Praevalitana) after the Illyro-Roman Wars.

In the Early Middle Ages, Slavic migration led to several Slavic states. In the 9th century, there were three principalities on the territory of Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half, Travunia, the west, and Rascia, the north. In 1042, Stefan Vojislav led a revolt that resulted in the independence of Duklja and the establishment of the Vojislavljević dynasty. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav&#x27;s son, Mihailo (1046–81), and his grandson Bodin (1081–1101). By the 13th century, &quot;Zeta&quot; had replaced &quot;Duklja&quot; when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as &quot;Crna Gora&quot; (Venetian: &quot;&quot;).

Large portions fell under the control of the Ottoman Empire from 1496 to 1878. Parts were controlled by the Republic of Venice. From 1516 until 1852 the prince-bishops (vladikas) of Cetinje were the rulers. The House of Petrović-Njegoš ruled until 1918. From 1918, it was a part of Yugoslavia. On the basis of an independence referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence on 3 June of that year.

==Early history==

Before the arrival of the Slavonic peoples in the Balkans during the 6th century AD, the area now known as Montenegro was inhabited principally by the Illyrians.
During the Bronze Age, the Illirii, probably the southernmost Illyrian tribe of that time, that gave their name to the entire group were living near Skadar lake on the border of Albania and Montenegro and neighboring with the Greek tribes south. Along the seaboard of the Adriatic, the movement of peoples that was typical of the ancient Mediterranean world ensured the settlement of a mixture of colonists, traders, and those in search of territorial conquest. Substantial Greek colonies were established on the 6th and 7th centuries BC and Celts are known to have settled there in the 4th century BC. During the 3rd century BC, an indigenous Illyrian kingdom emerged with its capital at Scutari. The Romans mounted several punitive expeditions against local pirates and finally conquered the Illyrian kingdom in the 2nd century BC, annexing it to the province of Illyricum.

The division of the Roman Empire between Roman and Byzantine rule – and subsequently between the Latin and Greek churches – was marked by a line that ran northward from Shkodra through modern Montenegro, symbolizing the status of this region as a perpetual marginal zone between the economic, cultural, and political worlds of the Mediterranean. As Roman power declined, this part of the Dalmatian coast suffered from intermittent ravages by various semi-nomadic invaders, especially the Goths in the late 5th century and the Avars during the 6th century. These soon were supplanted by the Slavs, who became widely established in Dalmatia by the middle of the 7th century. Because the terrain was extremely rugged and lacked any major sources of wealth such as mineral riches, the area that is now Montenegro became a haven for residual groups of earlier settlers, including some tribes who had escaped Romanisation.

==Middle Ages==


In the second half of the 6th century, Slavs migrated from the Bay of Kotor to the River of Bojana and the hinterland of it as well as surround the Skadar lake. They formed the Principality of Doclea. Under the following missions of Cyril and Methodius, the population was Christianised. The Slavic tribes organised into a semi-independent dukedom of Duklja (Doclea) by the 9th century.

After facing subsequent Bulgarian domination, the people were split as the Doclean brother-archonts split the lands among each other after 900. Prince Časlav Klonimirović of the Serbian Vlastimirović dynasty extended his influence over Doclea in the 10th century. After the fall of the Serbian Realm in 960, the Docleans faced a renewed Byzantine occupation through to the 11th century. The local ruler, Jovan Vladimir Dukljanski, whose cult still remains in the Orthodox Christian tradition, was at the time struggling to ensure independence.

Stefan Vojislav started an uprising against the Byzantine domination and gained a huge victory against the army of several Byzantine strategoi in Tudjemili (Bar) in 1042, which put to an end the Byzantine influence over the Doclea. In the 1054 Great Schism, the Doclea fell on the side of the Catholic Church. Bar became a Bishopric in 1067. In 1077, Pope Gregory VII recognised Duklja as an independent state, acknowledging its King Mihailo (Michael, of the Vojislavljević dynasty founded by nobleman Stefan Vojislav) as Rex Doclea (King of Duklja). Later on Mihailo sent his troops, led by his son Bodin, in 1072 to assist the uprising of Slavs in Macedonia. In 1082, after numerous pleas the Bar Bishopric of Bar was upgraded to an Archbishopric.

The expansions of the Kings of the Vojislavljević dynasty led to the control over the other Slavic lands, including Zahumlje, Bosnia and Rascia. The might of the Doclea declined and they generally became subjected to the Grand Princes of Rascia in the 12th century. Stefan Nemanja was born in 1117 in Ribnica (today Podgorica). In 1168, as the Serbian Grand Zhupan, Stefan Nemanja took Doclea. In charters of Vranjina Monastery during the 14th century the ethnic groups which are mentioned were Albanians (Arbanas), Vlahs, Latins (Catholic citizen) and Serbs.

===Duklja (Zeta) within the Nemanjić State (1186–1360)===

The region of Duklja (Zeta) was ruled by the Nemanjić dynasty from c. 1186 until c. 1360. In this period Zeta was administered by members of the Serbian royalty as a crown land.

===Zeta under the Balšići (1360–1421)===


The Principality of Zeta was ruled by the house of Balšić from c. 1356 until 1421.

===Zeta within the Serbian Despotate (1421–1451)===

After the death of Balša III, last representative of House of Balšić, Zeta joined the Serbian Despotate in 1421.

===Zeta under the Crnojevići (1451–1496)===

The Principality of Zeta was ruled by the house of Crnojević Dynasty from c. 1451 until 1496. It is believed that the name &quot;Crna Gora&quot; (Montenegro) originated during their rule. The Crnojevići were driven out from Zeta by the Ottomans and forced to retreat above the Gulf of Kotor where they built a monastery and a royal court in Cetinje, the future royal capital of Montenegro, before eventually fleeing to Venice. In 1496, Ottomans conquered Zeta and consolidated it into the newly established Sanjak of Montenegro, thereby ending its principality.

===The Venetian coastal Montenegro===
After the dramatic fall of the Western Roman Empire (476), the romanised Illyrians of the coast of Dalmatia survived the barbarian invasions of the Avars in the 6th century and were only nominally under the influence of the Slavs in the 7th and 8th centuries. In the last centuries of the first millennium, these Romanised Illyrians started to develop their own neo-Latin language, called Dalmatian language, around their small coastal villages that were growing with maritime commerce.

Venice started to take control of the southern Dalmatia around the 10th century, quickly assimilating the Dalmatian language with Venetian. By the 14th century the Republic of Venice was able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor (Cattaro).

==Early modern period==

The Republic of Venice dominated the coasts of today&#x27;s Montenegro from 1420 to 1797. In those four centuries the area around the Cattaro (Kotor) became part of Venetian Albania.
===Struggle for maintaining independence (1496–1878)===

Part of today&#x27;s Montenegro, called Sandžak (which was not historically part of Montenegro until 1912), was under direct Ottoman control from 1498 to 1912, while westernmost part of coastal Montenegro was under Venetian control and the rest of Montenegro was autonomous from 1516, when &quot;Vladika&quot; Vavila was elected as ruler of Montenegro by its clans, and licensed by the Ottoman Empire it became a theocratic state and not secular. Only small town centers like Cetinje and Njegusi were controlled by Ottomans, but mountains and rural area were autonomous and controlled by several Montenegrin clans, which were warrior societies, but paying a special tax to the Ottoman Empire.

In 1514, the Ottoman territory of Montenegro was proclaimed as a separate Sanjak of Montenegro, by the order of Sultan Beyazid II. The first Sanjak-beg (governor) who was chosen was Ivan Crnojević&#x27;s son Staniša (Skenderbeg Crnojević), who converted to Islam, and governed until his death in 1528. Despite Skenderbeg&#x27;s emphasized cruelty, the Ottomans did not have effective power in Montenegro. &quot;Vladika&quot; Vavil was elected in 1516 as Montenegrin prince-bishop by the Montenegrin people and the patriarch of Belgrade. 
==== Elective Vladikas (1516–1696) ====
For 180 years after their first appointment, the Vladikas were elected by the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and the clans — an arrangement which was ultimately abandoned in favour of the hereditary system in 1696. For most of this period the Montenegrin people were in constant struggle for its autonomy inside of the Ottoman Empire .

A pretender to Montenegrin throne, one of the Crnojević family who had converted to Islam, invaded Montenegro just as Staniša, thirty years before, and with the same result. Vukotić, the civil governor, repulsed the attack of Turks. Montenegrins, encouraged by the victory, besieged Jajce in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Hungarian garrison was closely hemmed in by the Ottoman army. The Turks were too much occupied with the Hungarian war to take revenge. The next Ottoman invasion of Montenegro took place in 1570.

The national historians are silent upon the subject of the Haraç (tax in Ottoman Empire), which the invaders are said to have exacted from the inhabitants of the free mountains. The refusal of high-spirited Montenegrin clans to pay tax any longer was the cause of the Pasha&#x27;s invasion during the reign of the Hadjuk Bishop Rufim, when the Turks were driven back with heavy loss in Battle of Lješkopolje in 1604. About 1500 Montenegrin warriors attacked the Turkish camp on Lješkopolje field during the night, which counted 10.000 Ottoman soldiers.

In 1613, Arslan Pasha gathered army of over 40,000 men to attack part of Old Montenegro. Ottoman soldiers were twice as numerous as whole population of Old Montenegro. On 10 September the Montenegrins met the Turkish army, on the same spot Skenderbeg Crnojević was defeated nearly a century ago . The Montenegrins, although assisted by some neighbouring tribes, counted 4000 and were completely outnumbered. However, the Montenegrins managed to defeat the Turks. Arslan Pasha was wounded, and the heads of his second-in-command and a hundred other Turkish officers were carried off and stuck on the ramparts of Cetinje. The Ottoman troops retreated in disorder; many were drowned in the waters of the Morača. Others were killed by Montenegrin pursuers.

Much light is thrown upon the condition of Montenegro at this period and the causes of its invariable success in war even against fearful odds are explained by the accounts of a contemporary writer, Mariano Bolizza. This author, a patrician of Venice, residing at Kotor in the early part of the seventeenth century, spent a considerable time in the Old Montenegro, and published in 1614 a description of Cetinje. At the time, the whole male population of Cetinje available for war consisted of 8,027 persons, distributed among ninety-three villages.

The condition of the country at this period was naturally unsettled. War was the chief occupation of its inhabitants from sheer necessity, and the arts of peace languished. The printing-press, so active a century earlier, had ceased to exist; the control of the Prince-Bishop over the five &quot;nahije&quot; (, from the Turkish &quot;nahiyah&quot;, i.e. &quot;district&quot;), which then composed the principality, was weak; the capital itself consisted of only a few houses. Still, there was a system of local government. Each &quot;nahija&quot; was divided into tribes (), each presided over by a chief (), who acted as a judge in disputes between the tribesmen.

==Modern history==

Petar Petrović Njegoš, an influential &quot;vladika&quot;, reigned in the first half of the 19th century. In 1851 Danilo Petrović Njegoš became &quot;vladika&quot;, but in 1852 he married and renounced his ecclesiastical character, assuming the title of &quot;knjaz&quot; (Prince) Danilo I, and transformed his land into a secular principality.

Following the assassination of Danilo by Todor Kadić in Kotor, in 1860, the Montenegrins proclaimed Nicholas I as his successor on August 14 of that year. In 1861–1862, Nicholas engaged in an unsuccessful war against the Ottoman Empire.

Following the Herzegovinian Uprising, partly initiated by his clandestine activities, he yet again declared war on Turkey. The Serbia joined Montenegro, but it was defeated by Turkish forces that same year. Russia now joined in and decisively routed the Turks in 1877–78. The Treaty of San Stefano (March 1878) was highly advantageous to Montenegro, as well as Russia, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. However, the gains were somewhat trimmed by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). In the end Montenegro was internationally recognized as an independent state, its territory was effectively doubled by the addition of , the port of Bar and all the waters of Montenegro were closed to warships of all nations; and the administration of the maritime and sanitary police on the coast was placed in the hands of Austria.

Under Nicholas I the country was also granted its first constitution (1905) and was elevated to the rank of kingdom in 1910.

In the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), Montenegro did make further territorial gains by splitting Sanjak with Serbia. However, the captured city of Skadar had to be given up to the new state of Albania at the insistence of the Great Powers despite the Montenegrins having invested 10,000 lives for the conquest of the town from the Ottoman-Albanian forces of Essad Pasha Toptani.

===World War I===

Montenegro suffered severely in World War I. Shortly after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia (28 July 1914), Montenegro lost little time in declaring war on the Central Powers – on Austria-Hungary in the first instance – on 6 August 1914, despite Austrian diplomacy promising to cede Shkoder to Montenegro if it remained neutral. For purposes of coordination in the fight against the enemy army, Serbian General Božidar Janković was named head of High Command of both Serbian and Montenegrin armies. Montenegro received 30 artillery pieces and financial help of 17 million dinars from Serbia. France contributed a colonial detachment of 200 men located in Cetinje at the beginning of war, as well as two radio-stations – located on top of Mount Lovćen and in Podgorica. Until 1915 France supplied Montenegro with necessary war material and food through the port of Bar, which was blockaded by Austrian battleships and submarines. In 1915 Italy took over this role, running supplies unsuccessfully and irregularly across the line Shengjin-Bojana-Lake Skadar, an unsecured route because of constant attacks by Albanian irregulars organised by Austrian agents. Lack of vital materials eventually led Montenegro to surrender.

Austria-Hungary dispatched a separate army to invade Montenegro and to prevent a junction of the Serbian and Montenegrin armies. This force, however, was repulsed, and from the top of the strongly fortified Lovćen, the Montenegrins carried on the bombardment of Kotor held by the enemy. The Austro-Hungarian army managed to capture the town of Pljevlja while on the other hand the Montenegrins took Budva, then under Austrian control. The Serbian victory at the Battle of Cer (15–24 August 1914) diverted enemy forces from Sandžak, and Pljevlja came into Montenegrin hands again. On August 10, 1914, the Montenegrin infantry delivered a strong attack against the Austrian garrisons, but they did not succeed in making good the advantage they first gained. They successfully resisted the Austrians in the second invasion of Serbia (September 1914) and almost succeeded in seizing Sarajevo. With the beginning of the third Austro-Hungarian invasion, however, the Montenegrin army had to retire before greatly superior numbers, and Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and German armies finally overran Serbia (December 1915). However, the Serbian army survived, and led by King Peter I of Serbia, started retreating across Albania. In order to support the Serbian retreat, the Montenegrin army, led by Janko Vukotić, engaged in the Battle of Mojkovac (6–7 January 1916). Montenegro also suffered a large scale invasion (January 1916) and for the remainder of the war remained in the possession of the Central Powers. See Serbian Campaign (World War I) for details. The Austrian officer Viktor Weber Edler von Webenau served as the military governor of Montenegro between 1916 and 1917. Afterwards Heinrich Clam-Martinic filled this position.

King Nicholas fled to Italy (January 1916) and then to Antibes, France; the government transferred its operations to Bordeaux. Eventually the Allies liberated Montenegro from the Austrians. A newly convened National Assembly of Podgorica (&quot;Podgorička skupština&quot;, &quot;Подгоричка скупштина&quot;), accused the King of seeking a separate peace with the enemy and consequently deposed him, banned his return and decided that Montenegro should join the Kingdom of Serbia on December 1, 1918. A part of the former Montenegrin military forces still loyal to the King started a rebellion against the amalgamation, the Christmas Uprising (7 January 1919).

===Yugoslavia===

In the period between the two World Wars, Nikola&#x27;s grandson, King Alexander I dominated the Yugoslav government. In 1922 Montenegro became part of Zeta area and later Zeta Banate. The administrative seat of banate became former Montenegrin capital Cetinje. During this period, Montenegrin people were still divided between politics of Greens and Whites. The dominant political parties in Montenegro were Democratic Party, People&#x27;s Radical Party, Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Alliance of Agrarians, Montenegrin Federalist Party, and the Yugoslav Republican Party. During this period, two main problems in Montenegro were lost sovereignty and bad economic situation. All of the parties except Federalists had the same attitude towards the first question, favoring centralism to federalism. The other question was more complex, but the fact on which all of the parties agreed is that the situation was far from good and that the government did nothing to improve the life in area. Devastated by war, Montenegro was never paid the reparations to which it had right as one of the Allies in the Great War. Most of the population lived in rural areas, but the smaller population of citizens had better standards of life. There was no infrastructure and industry was formed of few companies.

===The puppet &quot;Kingdom of Montenegro&quot; and World War II===

During World War II, Italy under Benito Mussolini occupied Montenegro in 1941 and annexed it to the Kingdom of Italy in the area of Kotor (Cattaro), where there was a small Venetian speaking population. (The Queen of Italy – Elena of Montenegro – was daughter of the former king of Montenegro and was born in Cetinje.)

The English historian Denis Mack Smith wrote that the Queen of Italy (considered the most influential Montenegrin woman in history) convinced her husband the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III to impose on Mussolini the creation of an independent Montenegro, against the wishes of the fascist Croats and Albanians (who wanted to enlarge their countries with the Montenegrin territories). Her nephew Prince Michael of Montenegro never accepted the offered crown, pledging loyalty to his nephew King Peter II of Yugoslavia.

The puppet Kingdom of Montenegro was created under fascist control while Krsto Zrnov Popović returned from his exile in Rome in 1941 to attempt to lead the Zelenaši (&quot;Green&quot; party), who supported the reinstatement of the Montenegrin monarchy. This militia was called the Lovćen Brigade. Montenegro was ravaged by a terrible guerrilla war, mainly after Nazi Germany replaced the defeated Italians in September 1943.

During World War II, as was the case in many other parts of Yugoslavia, Montenegro was involved in some sort of civil war. Besides Montenegrin Greens, the two main factions were the Chetnik Yugoslav army, who swore allegiance to the government in exile and consisted mainly of Montenegrins who declared themselves as Serbs (many of its members were Montenegrin Whites) and Yugoslav Partisans, whose aim was the creation of a Socialist Yugoslavia after the war. Since both factions shared some similarities in their goals, particularly those relating to a unified Yugoslavia and anti-Axis resistance, the two sides joined hands and in 1941 started the 13th July uprising, the first organised uprising in occupied Europe. This occurred just two months after Yugoslavia capitulated, and liberated most of Montenegrin territory, but the rebels were unable to regain control of major towns and cities. After the failed attempts to liberate the towns of Pljevlja and Kolasin, the Italians, reinforced by Germans, recaptured all insurgent territory. At the leadership level, disagreements regarding state policy (Centralist monarchy vs. Federal Socialist republic) eventually led to a split between the two sides; they then became enemies from thereon. Constantly, both factions were trying to gain support among the population. The monarchist Chetniks had influential scholars and revolutionaries among their supporters, such as Blažo Đukanović, Zaharije Ostojić, Radojica Perišić, Petar Baćović, Mirko Lalatovic, and Bajo Stanišić, the hero of the anti-fascist uprising. However, eventually the Chetniks in Montenegro lost support among the population, as did other Chetnik factions within Yugoslavia. The &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Chetniks in Montenegro, Pavle Djurisic, along with other prominent figures of the movement like Dusan Arsovic and Đorđe Lašić, were held responsible for massacres of Muslim population in eastern Bosnia and Sandzak during 1944. Their ideology of a homogeneous Serbia within Yugoslavia proved to be a major obstacle in recruiting liberals, minorities, and Montenegrins who regarded Montenegro as a nation with its own identity. These factors, in addition to the fact that some Chetniks were negotiating with the Axis, led to the Chetnik Yugoslav army losing support among the Allies in 1943. In the same year, Italy, who was until then in charge of the occupied zone, capitulated and was replaced by Germany, and the fighting continued.

Podgorica was liberated by the socialist Partisans on 19 December 1944, and the war of liberation had been won. Josip Broz Tito acknowledged Montenegro&#x27;s massive contribution to the war against the Axis powers by establishing it as one of the six republics of Yugoslavia.

===Montenegro within Socialist Yugoslavia===

From 1945 to 1992, Montenegro became a constituent republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; it was the smallest republic in the federation and had the lowest population. Montenegro became economically stronger than ever, since it gained help from federal funds as an under-developed Republic, and it became a tourist destination as well. After war years proved turbulent and were marked by political eliminations. Krsto Zrnov Popović, the leader of Greens was assassinated in 1947, and 10 years later, in 1957, the last Montenegrin Chetnik Vladimir Šipčić was also murdered. During this period Montenegrin Communists such as Veljko Vlahović, Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo, Vladimir Popović and Jovo Kapicić held key positions in the federal government of Yugoslavia. In 1948 Yugoslavia faced the Tito–Stalin split, a period of high tensions between Yugoslavia and the USSR caused by disagreements about each country&#x27;s influences on its neighbours, and the resolution of Informbiro. Political turmoil began within both the communist party and the nation. Pro-Soviet communists faced prosecution and imprisonment in various prisons across Yugoslavia, notably Goli Otok. Many Montenegrins, due to their traditional allegiance with Russia, declared themselves as Soviet-orientated. This political split in the communist party saw the downfall of many important communist leaders, including Montenegrins Arso Jovanović and Vlado Dapčević. Many of the people imprisoned during this period, regardless of nationality, were innocent – this was later recognised by the Yugoslav government. 1954 saw the expulsion of prominent Montenegrin politician Milovan Đilas from the communist party for criticising party leaders for forming a &quot;new ruling class&quot; within, Yugoslavia along with Peko Dapčević.

Through the second half of the 1940s and the whole of the 1950s, the country underwent infrastructural rejuvenation thanks to federal funding. Montenegro&#x27;s historic capital Cetinje was replaced with Podgorica, which in the inter-war period became the biggest city in the Republic – although it was practically in ruins due to heavy bombing in the last stages of WW II. Podgorica had a more favorable geographical position within Montenegro, and in 1947 the seat of the Republic was moved to the city, now named Titograd in honor to Marshal Tito. Cetinje received the title of &#x27;hero city&#x27; within Yugoslavia. Youth work actions built a railway between the two biggest cities of Titograd and Nikšić, as well as an embankment over Skadar lake linking the capital with the major port of Bar. The port of Bar was also rebuilt after being mined during the German retreat in 1944. Other ports that faced infrastructural improvement were Kotor, Risan and Tivat. In 1947 Jugopetrol Kotor was founded. Montenegro&#x27;s industrialisation was demonstrated through the founding of the electronic company Obod in Cetinje, a steel mill and Trebjesa brewery in Nikšić, and the Podgorica Aluminium Plant in 1969.

===Breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars===
The breakup of communist Yugoslavia (1991–1992) and the introduction of a multi-party political system found Montenegro with a young leadership that had risen to office only a few years earlier in the late 1980s.

In effect, three men ran the republic: Milo Đukanović, Momir Bulatović and Svetozar Marović; all swept into power during the anti-bureaucratic revolution — an administrative coup of sorts within the Yugoslav Communist party, orchestrated by younger party members close to Slobodan Milošević.

All three appeared devout communists on the surface, but they also had sufficient skills and adaptability to understand the dangers of clinging to traditional rigid old-guard tactics in changing times. So when the old Yugoslavia effectively ceased to exist and the multi-party political system replaced it, they quickly repackaged the Montenegrin branch of the old Communist party and renamed it the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS).

The inheritance of the entire infrastructure, resources and membership of the old Communist party gave the DPS a sizable head start on their opponents in the newly formed parties. It allowed them to win the first multi-party parliamentary election held on 9 and 16 December 1990, and presidential elections held on 9 and 23 December 1990. The party has ruled Montenegro (either alone or as a leading member of different ruling coalitions).

During the early-to-mid-1990s Montenegro&#x27;s leadership gave considerable support to Milošević&#x27;s war-effort. Montenegrin reservists fought on the Dubrovnik front line, where Prime Minister Milo Đukanović visited them frequently.

In April 1992, following a referendum, Montenegro decided to join Serbia in forming the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), which officially put the Second Yugoslavia to rest.

During the 1991–1995 Bosnian War and Croatian War, Montenegro participated with its police and military forces in the attacks on Dubrovnik, Croatia and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops, aggressive acts aimed at acquiring more territories by force,
characterized by a consistent pattern of gross and systematic violations of
human rights. Montenegrin General Pavle Strugar has since been convicted for his part in the bombing of Dubrovnik.
Bosnian refugees were arrested by Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Foča, where they were subjected to systematic torture and executed.

In May 1992, the United Nations imposed an embargo on FRY: this affected many aspects of life in the country.

Due to its favourable geographical location (access to the Adriatic Sea and a water-link to Albania across Lake Skadar) Montenegro became a hub for smuggling activity. The entire Montenegrin industrial production had stopped, and the republic&#x27;s main economic activity became the smuggling of user goods – especially those in short supply like petrol and cigarettes, both of which skyrocketed in price. It became a &quot;de facto&quot; legalized practice and it went on for years. At best, the Montenegrin government turned a blind eye to the illegal activity, but mostly it took an active part in it. Smuggling made millionaires out of all sorts of shady individuals, including senior government officials. Milo Đukanović continues to face actions in various Italian courts over his role in widespread smuggling during the 1990s and in providing safe haven in Montenegro for different Italian Mafia figures who also allegedly took part in the smuggling distribution chain.

===Recent history (1996–present)===

In 1997 a bitter dispute over presidential election results took place. It ended with Milo Đukanović winning over Momir Bulatović in a second-round run-off plagued with irregularities. Nonetheless, the authorities allowed the results to stand. Former close allies had by this time become bitter foes, which resulted in a near-warlike atmosphere in Montenegro for months during the autumn of 1997. It also split the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro. Bulatović and his followers broke away to form the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro (SNP), staying loyal to Milošević, whereas Đukanović began to distance himself from Serbia. This distance from the policies of Milošević played a role in sparing Montenegro from the heavy bombing that Serbia endured in the spring of 1999 during the NATO air-campaign.

Đukanović came out a clear winner from this political fight, as he never lost power for even a day. Bulatović, on the other hand, never held office again in Montenegro after 1997 and eventually retired from politics in 2001.

During the Kosovo War, ethnic Albanians took refuge in Montenegro, but were still under threat by Serbian soldiers, who were able to take refugees back into Serbian controlled areas and imprison them.

In the spring of 1999, at the height of the NATO offensives, 21 Albanians died in several separate and unexplained incidents in Montenegro, according to the republic&#x27;s prosecutor. Another group of around 60 Albanian refugees was fired upon in Kaludjerski Laz by Yugoslav Army members, leading to the death of six people, including a woman aged 80 and a child, killed in crossfire that allegedly came from three machine-gun posts of the then Yugoslav Army.
In all, 23 Albanians were killed in Kaludjerski Laz, and Montenegrin prosecutors have charged 8 soldiers, among which is Predrag Strugar, son of convicted Montenegrin war criminal General Pavle Strugar, with &quot;inhuman treatment against civilians&quot;. During the war Montenegro was bombed as part of NATO operations against Yugoslavia, though not as heavily as Serbia. The targets were mostly military ones such as Golubovci Airbase.

In 2003, after years of wrangling and outside assistance, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia renamed itself as &quot;Serbia and Montenegro&quot; and officially reconstituted itself as a loose union. The State Union had a parliament and an army in common, and for three years (until 2006), neither Serbia nor Montenegro held a referendum on the break-up of the union. However, a referendum was announced in Montenegro to decide the future of the republic. The ballots cast in the controversial 2006 independence referendum resulted in a 55.5% victory for independence supporters, just above the 55% borderline mark set by the EU. Montenegro declared independence on 3 June 2006.

==== Independent Montenegro ====

On 28 June 2006, Montenegro joined the United Nations as its 192nd member state.

For 16 October 2016, the day of the parliamentary election, a coup d&#x27;état against the government of Milo Đukanović had been prepared, according to the Montenegrin Special Prosecutor. Fourteen people, including two Russian nationals and two Montenegrin opposition leaders, Andrija Mandić and Milan Knežević, were indicted for their alleged roles in the coup attempt on charges such as &quot;preparing a conspiracy against the constitutional order and the security of Montenegro&quot; and an &quot;attempted terrorist act.&quot;

In June 2017, Montenegro formally became a member of NATO, an eventuality that had been rejected by about half of the country&#x27;s population and had triggered a promise of retaliatory actions on the part of Russia&#x27;s government.

In April 2018, Đukanović, the leader of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS), won Montenegro’s presidential election. The veteran politician had served as Prime Minister six times and as President once before. He had dominated Montenegrin politics since 1991.

In September 2020, Đukanović&#x27;s pro-Western Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) narrowly lost the parliamentary election after having led the country for 30 years. The opposition, For the Future of Montenegro (ZBCG) bloc, was composed mainly of Serb nationalist parties. The new pro-serbian government was formed by Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapić. However, Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic&#x27;s government was toppled in no-confidence vote after only 14 months in power. In April 2022, a new minority government, comprising moderate parties that are both pro-European and pro-Serb, was formed. The new government was led by Prime Minister Dritan Abazovic.

On 12 August 2022, a mass shooting occurred in Cetinje, which left ten people dead and six others injured. The gunman, identified as 34-year-old Vučko Borilović, was then shot and killed by an armed civilian after engaging in a gun battle with responding officers. It is the deadliest mass shooting in the history of Montenegro.

In March 2023, Jakov Milatović, a pro-western candidate of the Europe Now movement, won the presidential election run-off over incumbent Milo Đukanović to succeed him as the next President of Montenegro. On 20 May 2023, Milatović was sworn in as President of Montenegro. In June 2023, Europe Now movement won a snap parliamentary election. On 31 October 2023, Milojko Spajic of the Europe Now Movement became Montenegro&#x27;s new prime minister, leading a coalition of both pro-European and pro-Serb parties.

<doc id="181805" wikidata="Q492514" url="?curid=181805" title="Menarche">
<text>Menarche ( ; ) is the first menstrual cycle, or first menstrual bleeding, in female humans. From both social and medical perspectives, it is often considered the central event of female puberty, as it signals the possibility of fertility. Girls experience menarche at different ages, but the most common age is 12. Having menarche occur between the ages of 9–14 in the West is considered normal. 

The timing of menarche is influenced by female biology, as well as genetic, environmental factors, and nutritional factors. The mean age of menarche has declined over the last century, but the magnitude of the decline and the factors responsible remain subjects of contention. The worldwide average age of menarche is very difficult to estimate accurately, and it varies significantly by geographical region, race, ethnicity and other characteristics, and occurs mostly during a span of ages from 8 to 16, with a small percentage of girls having menarche by age 10, and the vast majority having it by the time they were 14.
There is a later age of onset in Asian populations compared to the West, but it too is changing with time. For example a Korean study in 2011 showed an overall average age of 12.7, with around 20% before age 12, and more than 90% by age 14. A Chinese study from 2014 published in &quot;Acta Paediatrica&quot; showed similar results (overall average of age 12.8 in 2005 down to age 12.3 in 2014) and a similar trend in time, but also similar findings about ethnic, cultural, and environmental effects. The average age of menarche was about 12.7 years in Canada in 2001, and 12.9 in the United Kingdom. A study of girls in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011 found the median age at menarche to be 12.7 years. In the United States, an analysis of 10,590 women aged 15–44 taken from the 2013–2017 round of the CDC&#x27;s National Survey of Family Growth
found a median age of 11.9 years (down from 12.1 in 1995), with a mean of 12.5 years (down from 12.6).

==Physiology==
===Puberty===
Menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty:
* Attainment of a sufficient body fat percentage (typically around 17% of total body mass).
* Disinhibition of the GnRH pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
* Secretion of estrogen by the ovaries in response to pituitary hormones.
* Over an interval of about 2 to 3 years, estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus and breasts, as well as an increase in height, widening of the pelvis, and increased regional adipose tissue.
* Estrogen stimulates growth and vascularity of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus.
* Fluctuations of hormone levels can result in changes of adequacy of blood supply to parts of the endometrium.
* Death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to &quot;deciduation&quot;, a sloughing off of part of the lining with some blood, which together flows from the vagina, i.e. menstrual flow.

Menarche is not painful and occurs without warning.

The &quot;menstruum&quot;, or &quot;flow&quot;, consists of a combination of fresh and clotted blood with endometrial tissue. Menarche is not painful and occurs without warning. Flow may be scanty in amount and might be as little as a single instance of &quot;spotting&quot;. Like other menses, menarche may be accompanied by lower abdominal cramps.

===Relation to fertility===
For most girls, menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred. In post-menarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third, and 10% in the sixth year. Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., heaviness or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat percentage of at least 22%.

Not every girl follows the typical pattern. Some girls ovulate prior to their first menstruation. Although unlikely, it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant (delaying her menarche until after the end of her pregnancy, if she carries to full term).

Younger age of menarche is not correlated with a younger age of first sexual intercourse.

===Onset===
When menarche occurs, it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus, especially the endometrium, and that the &quot;outflow tract&quot; from the uterus, through the cervix to the vagina, is open.

When experiencing menarche, the blood flow (colloquially described as having one&#x27;s &quot;period&quot;) can vary from a slow and spotty discharge to a consistent blood flow for 3–7 days. The color of the blood ranges from bright red to brown in color; this is normal. Periods may be light or heavy.

In very rare instances, menarche may occur at an unusually early age, preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty. This is termed &quot;isolated premature menarche&quot;, but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded. Isolated premature menarche is rarely the first manifestation of precocious puberty.

When menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche, or beyond 15 years of age, the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea.

===Timing===
====Chronic illness====
Certain systemic or chronic illness can delay menarche, such as diabetes mellitus type 1, cystic fibrosis, asthma, inflammatory diseases, and untreated celiac disease, among others. Sometimes, lab tests do not return determinative results, so that underlying pathologies are not identified and the girl is diagnosed with constitutional growth delay.

====Conditions and disease states====
Studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases. Some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease, although the mechanism of the association is not well understood. A systematic review has concluded that early onset of menarche is a risk factor for insulin resistance and breast cancer risk.

There is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association.

====Effects of stress and social environment====
Some of the aspects of family structure and function reported to be independently associated with earlier menarche [antenatal and early childhood]
* Being non-white (in the UK)
* Having experienced pre-eclampsia in the womb
* Being a singleton, i.e. not a twin or triplet
* Low birthweight
* Not having been breast-fed
* Exposure to smoking
* High-conflict family relationships
* Lack of exercise in childhood

Other research has focused on the effect of childhood stress on timing of puberty, especially female. Stress is a vague term and studies have examined conditions ranging from family tensions or conflict to wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival. The more dire social conditions have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that is compounded by inadequate diet and nutrition. There is mixed evidence if milder degrees of stress can accelerate puberty in girls as would be predicted by life history theory and demonstrated in non-human mammals.

The understanding of these environmental effects is incomplete and the following cautions are relevant:
* Most of these &quot;effects&quot; are statistical associations revealed by epidemiologic surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and secondary variables and alternative explanations can be possible instead. Effects of small size studies can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child.
* Despite the small magnitude of effect, interpretations of the studies are politically controversial because this type of research is often be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.
* Correlation does not imply causation. While correlation can be objectively measured, causation is statistically inferred. For example, some suggest that childhood stress is caused by precocious puberty recognized later, rather than being the cause of it.

====Changes in time of average age====
There were few systematic studies of timing of menarche before the second half of the 20th century. Most older estimates of average onset of menarche were based on observation of a small, homogeneous, non-representative sample of the larger population, or based on recall by adult women, which is susceptible to error. Most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined, though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of study. 

From the sixth to the 15th centuries in Europe, most women reached menarche at about 14, between the ages of 12 and 15. The average age of menarche dropped from 14-15 years in the early 20th century to 12-13 years in the present, but girls in the 19th century had a later age of menarche (16 to 18 years) compared to girls in earlier centuries. A large North American survey reported a 2–3 month decline from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. A 2011 study found that each 1 kg/m2 increase in childhood body-mass index (BMI) can be expected to result in a 6.5% higher absolute risk of early menarche (before age 12 years). This is called the secular trend.

Fewer than 10% of U.S. girls start to menstruate before 11 years of age, and 90% of all U.S. girls are menstruating by 13.8 years of age, with a median age of 12.4 years. This age at menarche is not much different (0.3 years earlier) than that reported for U.S. girls in 1973. Age at menarche for non-Hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls, whereas non-white Mexican American girls were only slightly earlier than white girls .

== Society and culture==

Menstruation is a cultural as well as scientific phenomenon as many societies have rituals, social norms, and religious laws associated with it. These typically begin at menarche and may be enacted during each menstruation cycle. Menarche is important in determining a status change for girls. Upon menarche and completion of the ritual, they have become a woman as defined by their culture.

Canadian psychological researcher Niva Piran claims that menarche or the perceived average age of puberty is used in many cultures to separate girls from activity with boys, and to begin transition into womanhood. For example, post-menarche, young women compete in field hockey while young men play ice hockey.

=== Celebratory ceremonies ===
Some cultures have observed rites of passage such as a party or other celebration, for a girl experiencing menarche, in the past and the present.

==== Past ====
In ancient Japan, when a Japanese girl had her first period, the family sometimes celebrated by eating red-colored rice and beans &quot;(sekihan)&quot;. Although both blood and sekihan rice are red, this was not of symbolic significance. All rice in ancient Japan was red; it was also rare and precious. (At most other times, millet was eaten instead.) The celebration was kept a secret from extended family until the rice was served.

==== Present ====
In South Indian Hindu communities, young women are given a special menarche ceremony called Ruthu Sadangu; at that time, they begin to were two-piece saris.

In Morocco, the girl is thrown a celebration. All of her family members are invited and the girl is showered with money and gifts. Quinceañera in Latin America, is similar, except that the specific age of 15 marks the transition rather than menarche.

The Mescalero Apaches place high importance on their menarche ceremony and it is regarded as the most important ritual in their tribe. Each year, there is an eight-day event celebrating all of the girls who have menstruated in the past year. The days are split between feasting and private ceremonies reflecting on their new womanly status.

In the United States, public schools have a sex education program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche; this takes place between the fifth and eight grades. Like most of the modern industrialized world, menstruation is a private matter and a girl&#x27;s menarche is not a community phenomenon.

=== Rituals of purification ===
The Ulithi tribe of Micronesia call a girl&#x27;s menarche &quot;kufar&quot;. She goes to a menstrual house, where the women bathe her and recite spells. She will have to return to the menstruation hut every time she menstruates. Her parents build her a private hut that she will live in until she is married.

In Sri Lanka, an astrologer is contacted to study the alignment of stars when the girl experiences menarche because it is believed that her future can be predicted. The women of the family then gather in her home and scrub her in a ritual bathing ceremony. Her family then throws a familial party at which the girl wears white and may receive gifts.

In Ethiopia, Beta Jewish women were separated from male society and sent to menstruation huts during menarche and every menstruation following as the blood associated with menstruation in the Beta Jewish culture was believed to be impure. The Beta Jews built their villages surrounding and near bodies of water specifically for their women to have a place to clean themselves. The menstruation huts were built close to these bodies of water.

In India, purdah is practiced by some Hindu and Muslim communities. Women, starting at menarche and continuing with each subsequent period, are separated from men, and also wear different garments to conceal their skin during menstruation. 

In Australia, the Aboriginals treat a girl to &quot;love magic&quot;. She is taught the ways of womanhood by the other women in her tribe. Her mother builds her a menstruation hut to which she confines herself for the remainder of her menses. The hut is burned and she is bathed in the river at the end of menstruation. When she returns to the village, she is paired with a man who will be her husband.

In Nigeria, the Tiv ethnic group cut four lines into the abdomen of their girls during menarche. The lines are supposed to represent fertility.

=== Rituals of strength ===
The Navajo have a celebration called &quot;kinaalda&quot; (kinn-all-duh). Girls are expected to demonstrate their strength through footraces. The girls make a cornmeal pudding for the tribe to taste. The girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the Navajo goddess &quot;Changing Woman&quot;.

The Nuu-chah-nulth (also known as the Nootka) believe that physical endurance is the most important quality in young women. At menarche the girl is taken out to sea and left there to swim back.

== Movies, TV, and novels ==
Girls experiencing their first periods are part of many movies, particularly ones that include coming-of-age plot lines, such as &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; (1980), &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; (1984), &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1990), &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991), &quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon&quot; (1991), &quot;Eve’s Bayou&quot; (1997), and &quot;A Walk on the Moon&quot; (1999). Menarche is also discussed in an episode of the animated series &quot;Baymax!&quot; (2022) in which the eponymous healthcare robot helps a girl deal with her first period.

In the horror movie &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name, protagonist Carrie White experiences menarche as she showers after the school gym class. Unaware of what is happening to her, she panics and pleads for help, but the other girls respond by bullying her. Menarche unleashes Carrie&#x27;s telekinetic powers which are key to her wild transformation that causes death and destruction. This theme is common to horror movies, another example being the Canadian horror movie &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; (2000), where the protagonist&#x27;s first period is central to her gradual transformation into a werewolf. The theme of transformation around menarche is similarly present in &quot;Turning Red&quot; (2022), although the film also explores other aspects of puberty and the protagonist does not yet have her first period.

One of the better-known middle reader (8 to 12 year old) novels in the U.S. and Canada about the year leading up to menarche in the 1970s to 1990s is &quot;Are You There God? It&#x27;s Me, Margaret&quot; (1970) by Judy Blume.

<text>The M6 motorway is the longest motorway in the United Kingdom. It is located entirely within England, running for just over from the Midlands to the border with Scotland. It begins at Junction 19 of the M1 and the western end of the A14 at the Catthorpe Interchange, near Rugby before heading north-west. It passes Coventry, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Preston, Lancaster and Carlisle before terminating at Junction 45 near Gretna. Here, just short of the Scottish border it becomes the A74(M) which continues to Glasgow as the M74. Its busiest sections are between junctions 4 and 10a in the West Midlands, and junctions 16 to 19 in Cheshire; these sections have now been converted to smart motorways.

It incorporated the Preston By-pass, the first length of motorway opened in the UK and forms part of a motorway &quot;Backbone of Britain&quot;, running north–south between London and Glasgow via the industrial North of England. It is also part of the east–west route between the Midlands and the east-coast ports. The section from the M1 to the M6 Toll split near Birmingham forms part of the unsigned E-road E 24 and the section from the M6 Toll and the M42 forms part of E 05.

==Route==
The M6 motorway runs from junction 19 of the M1 and the A14 in Catthorpe near Rugby in central England. It passes Coventry, Birmingham, Stafford, Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent. The motorway has major junctions with the M56 and M62 near Warrington, giving access to Chester, Manchester and Liverpool. It also meets the M65 at Junction 29, south of Preston, which connects Blackburn and Burnley, and the M55 at junction 32, north of Preston which links it to Blackpool. The M6 then heads north past Wigan, Preston and Lancaster. After the latter two cities it passes through Cumbria with some parts very close to the edge of the Lake District with a short stretch within the national park boundaries and then passes Carlisle on its way to Gretna, before the motorway becomes the A74(M) a few hundred metres short of the Scottish border.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
The first section of the motorway and the first motorway in the country was the Preston By-pass. It was built by Tarmac Construction and opened by the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 5 December 1958. In January 1959 the Preston by-pass was closed because of rapid surface deterioration over a stretch of &quot;due to water freezing and then thawing&quot;. Motorists were diverted to the old road while the UK road research laboratory at Harmondsworth pondered the importance of surface water drainage.

The second phase of construction was completed in 1960, forming the Lancaster by-pass. Some south, the Stafford by-pass was completed in 1962. By 1965, the remaining sections of motorway Stafford–Preston and Preston–Lancaster had been completed. 1966 saw junction 11 to 13 completed. 1968 saw the completion of the Walsall to Stafford link as well as the Penrith by-pass some north in Cumberland. In 1970, the Lancaster–Penrith link was completed, along with a short section of motorway by-passing the south of Walsall. The most northerly section of the motorway also opened in 1970, running to the designated terminus north of Carlisle. By 1971 the full route was completed between the junction with the M1 motorway at Rugby and the A38 road several miles north-east of Birmingham city centre, including Bromford Viaduct between Castle Bromwich (J5) and Gravelly Hill (J6), which at is the longest viaduct in Great Britain.

Junction 6 in Birmingham, which opened in May 1972, is widely known as Spaghetti Junction because of its complexity and round and curvy-like design. On the elevated ground between Shap and Tebay, the north and south-bound carriages split apart. At this point a local road (to Scout Green) runs between the two carriageways without a link to the motorway.

The section of the M6 that runs over Shap Fell in Cumbria at Shap Summit is above sea level, one of the highest points on any motorway in the UK (Junction 22 of the M62 on Moss Moor is higher). The motorway engineers here chose to follow the route of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway engineered by Joseph Locke (now part of the West Coast Main Line) where the motorway runs in a split-level cutting above the railway in the descent from Shap Fell through the Lune Gorge into southern Cumbria.

The northbound entry slip road at Lancaster (Junction 34) was unusually short, presenting problems for traffic joining the motorway. The M6 crosses the River Lune at this point and unless the bridge had been made wider, there was no space to build a longer slip road. This junction was upgraded from an earlier emergency-vehicles-only access point, which explains the substandard design. The construction of the Heysham to M6 Link Road (The Bay Gateway) has completely re-modelled this junction with a wide additional bridge over the River Lune and other works repositioning slip roads with new acceleration lanes to modern standards.

The route was originally intended to replace the old A6, which it does along the northern section starting with the Preston Bypass. However, a much closer approximation to the overall actual route of the M6 (heading north from its southern terminus) is provided by following the A45, A34, A50, A49, then the A6. South of Preston, the A6 route is instead supplemented by the M61 as far as Manchester, with the M60 acting as a bypass around the city. South of Manchester, there is no true motorway replacement for the old road. The M1 acts as a bypass for long-distance traffic in the south, from the Kegworth junction near Nottingham, to Luton and St. Albans near London; but, it is not an alternative for local traffic as the routes diverge by more than while passing through Northamptonshire. Across the Pennines, the old road remains the main local through-route, and long-distance fast traffic between Derby and Manchester must instead take either the A50 and M6, or M1 and M62.

Once all sections of the motorway were constructed, and it was finally all linked together, the result was an uninterrupted motorway length of .

===Operational===
In July 1972, the Minister for Transport Industries, John Peyton, announced that of UK motorway particularly prone to fog would benefit from lighting in a project which &quot;should be&quot; completed by 1973. Sections to be illuminated included the M6 between junctions 10 and 11, and between junctions 20 and 27.

In March 2006, after 15 years of debate, the government authorised the construction of a extension of the M6 from its then northern terminus near Carlisle to the Anglo-Scottish border at Gretna (the so-called &quot;Cumberland Gap&quot;), where it links into the existing A74(M). The road opened on 5 December 2008, the 50th anniversary of the M6 Preston By-pass. The project, which was a mixture of new road and upgrade of the existing A74, crosses the West Coast Main Line and had an estimated costs of £174 million. It completed an uninterrupted motorway from just south of Dunblane (via the M9, the recently opened M80 section near Cumbernauld and the M73) in the north to Exeter (via the M5) and to London (via both the M42/M40 and the M1) in the south.
The M6 Toll, Britain&#x27;s first toll motorway, which bypasses the West Midlands conurbation to the east and north of Birmingham and Walsall and was built to alleviate traffic congestion through the West Midlands, opened in December 2003. Before the opening of the toll motorway, this section of the M6 carried 180,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point near Wolverhampton (between the junctions with the M54 and M5 motorways), compared with a design capacity of only 72,000 vehicles. Usage, at about 50,000 vehicles, was lower than expected and traffic levels on the M6 were only slightly reduced as a result. The high toll prices, which were set by the operating company and over which the UK Government has no influence until 2054, were blamed for the low usage. Much traffic continues to use the M6 or the continued on the M1 and took the A50 or A52. the road between Junctions 3A and 11A now carries 120,000 motor vehicles every day.

A proposed extension to the M6 Toll known as the &#x27;M6 Expressway&#x27;, which would have continued from the M6 Toll as far as Knutsford, at which point much of the existing M6 traffic leaves the M6 for Manchester, was abandoned in 2006 due to excessive costs, anticipated construction problems and disappointing levels of use of the M6 Toll.

In October 2007, following a successful trial on the M42 in the West Midlands, the government announced that two stretches of the M6 would be upgraded to allow the hard shoulder to be used as a normal running lane during busy conditions under a scheme called active traffic management. The two stretches, between junctions 4 and 5 and between junctions 10a and 8, are two of the busiest sections on the entire motorway. It was then proposed that the system could be extended onto other stretches of the M6 while the government undertook a feasibility study to determine other likely locations for this technology to be used. The stretch between junctions 4 and 5 was completed during December 2009 while the stretch between junctions 10a and 8 was completed during March 2011. This was then followed by a stretch between junctions 5 and 8 which started construction in April 2012 and was completed in October 2014.

After plans of the government to improve reliability and capacity between Junctions 11 by Cannock and Junction 19 near Knutsford it favoured a new motorway in 2004, &#x27;The Expressway&#x27; following a roughly parallel course to the existing M6. In July 2006, the government announced its decision to abandon the Expressway proposal, and favoured widening accompanied by demand-management measures, and launched a study to consider options for providing additional capacity. After the stretch between junction 10a and 13 was upgraded to a managed motorway in February 2016, it was then proposed to introduce a managed motorway between junction 13 and 19, later divided into two separate stretches, between junctions 16 and 19 and junctions 13 and 15. The stretch between junctions 16 and 19 started construction in December 2015 and was completed in March 2019 while construction on the stretch between junctions 13 and 15 commenced in March 2018 and was completed in August 2022.

In April 2021, the M6 gained the first motorway service station to be built for thirteen years. Located off Junction 1 at Rugby and opened on 30 April 2021, the facility, run by Moto Hospitality, includes the largest electric vehicle charging facility in the UK, run by Ecotricity and Gridserve.

==Current developments==
===J10 improvements===
Work started in 2020 to reconstruct the bridges above the motorway at junction 10, due to frequent congestion at peak times, due to be completed in 2024 at a cost of £78,000,000.

===J4 to J10A Dynamic Hard Shoulder enhancements===
Work started in March 2022 to upgrade the existing Dynamic Hard Shoulder smart motorway to add newer safety features to the motorway, such as a concrete central reservation, new emergency areas and drainage improvements. Currently, this work does not have an end date proposed.

===J21A to J26 smart motorway===
Work started in early 2021 to upgrade the M6 from junction J21A to J26 to the all lane running standard of smart motorway, with an estimated cost of between £100 million - £250 million. The smart motorway was originally due to be fully open in 2023, but is now delayed until 2025.

<text>Joseph Jean-Pierre Marc Garneau (born February 23, 1949) is a retired Canadian Member of Parliament, retired Royal Canadian Navy officer and former astronaut who served as a Cabinet minister from 2015 to 2021. A member of the Liberal Party, Garneau was the minister of foreign affairs from January to October 2021 and minister of transport from November 2015 to January 2021. He was an MP in Westmount, Montreal for 15 years.

Prior to entering politics, Garneau served as a naval officer and was selected as an astronaut as part of the 1983 NRC Group. On October 5, 1984, he became the first Canadian in space as part of STS-41-G and served on two subsequent Space Shuttle missions: STS-77 and STS-97.

==Early life==
Joseph Jean-Pierre Marc Garneau was born on February 23, 1949, in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. He attended primary and secondary schools in Quebec City and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. He also has a brother, Philippe Garneau.

==Education and military career==
Garneau graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in 1970 with a bachelor of science in engineering physics and began his career in the Canadian Forces Maritime Command.

In 1973 he received a PhD in electrical engineering from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, England. His thesis was entitled &quot;The Perception of Facial Images&quot;. The Photofit analogue computer was used by him to discriminate facial features.

In 1974, Garneau served as a naval combat systems engineer aboard .

From 1982 to 1983, he attended the Canadian Forces Command and Staff College in Toronto. While there, he was promoted to the rank of commander and was transferred to Ottawa in 1983. In January 1986, he was promoted to captain(N). Garneau retired from the Canadian Forces in 1989.

==Space career==
Garneau was one of six first Canadian Astronauts and he became the first Canadian in outer space on October 5, 1984. In 1984, he was seconded to the new Canadian Astronaut Program (CAP), one of six chosen from over 4,000 applicants; of these six he was the only military officer.

Garneau flew on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, STS-41-G from October 5 to 13, 1984, as payload specialist. He was promoted to captain(N) in 1986, and left the Canadian Forces in 1989, to become deputy director of the CAP. In 1992–93, he underwent further training to become a mission specialist. He worked as CAPCOM for a number of shuttle flights and was on two further flights himself: STS-77 (May 19 to 29, 1996) and STS-97 (to the ISS, November 30 to December 11, 2000). He has logged over 677 hours in space.

On February 1, 2001, Garneau was appointed executive vice-president of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). On September 28, 2001, the government announced his appointment as president of the CSA, replacing Mac Evans in that position on November 22, 2001.

==Political career==
Garneau served as the member of Parliament (MP) for the Montreal riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount, and its predecessor Westmount—Ville-Marie since the 2008 federal election, winning by over 9,000 votes. He was re-elected to the House of Commons in the 2011 federal election by 642 votes, and in the 2015 federal election with a majority of over 18,000. Previously, he unsuccessfully stood in the riding of Vaudreuil—Soulanges at the 2006 federal election.

On November 28, 2012, Garneau announced his candidacy for the leadership of the Liberal Party to be decided in April 2013. On March 13, 2013, Garneau formally withdrew his bid for the party leadership. On November 4, 2015, Garneau was appointed as Minister of Transport in the 29th Canadian Ministry. He became Minister of Foreign Affairs on January 12, 2021 after a cabinet reshuffle.

=== Initial steps (2006–2008) ===
Garneau resigned as the president of the Canadian Space Agency to run for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Vaudreuil—Soulanges, which was then held by Meili Faille of the Bloc Québécois. The Liberal Party&#x27;s support dropped off considerably in Quebec after the Sponsorship scandal and though considered a star candidate, Garneau lost to Faille by over nine thousand votes.

In the 2006 Liberal Party leadership election Garneau announced his support for perceived front-runner Michael Ignatieff, who lost to Stéphane Dion on the final ballot. With the resignation of Liberal MP Jean Lapierre in 2007, Garneau expressed interest in being the party&#x27;s candidate in Lapierre&#x27;s former riding of Outremont. Dion instead appointed Jocelyn Coulon as the party&#x27;s candidate, who went on to be defeated by the New Democratic Party&#x27;s Thomas Mulcair in the by-election.

In May 2007, Garneau filed nomination papers to be the party&#x27;s candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie, after former Liberal Party deputy leader Lucienne Robillard announced she would not be seeking re-election. However, a week after filing his nomination papers Dion announced that he had hand-picked a candidate for the riding. Garneau later withdrew his nomination papers and announced he no longer had an interest in politics. In October 2007, Garneau and Dion held a joint news conference where they announced that Garneau would be the Liberal Party candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie. Robillard announced her resignation as Member of Parliament in January and a by-election was later scheduled for September 8, 2008. However, the by-election was cancelled during the campaign when Prime Minister Stephen Harper called a general election for October 14, 2008. Though some pundits predicted a close race between Garneau and NDP candidate Anne Lagacé-Dowson, Garneau went on to win the riding by over 9,000 votes.

===Member of 40th Parliament===
Garneau was a member of the Industry, Science and Technology committee of the 40th Parliament. He also served on the Canada-Japan interparliamentary group.

===41st Parliament and leadership campaign===

Garneau was narrowly re-elected in the 2011 election where he beat New Democratic Party candidate Joanne Corbeil. He was Liberal House leader and served from 2013 as Liberal foreign affairs critic. He was a candidate for interim leadership of the Liberal Party, but was ultimately defeated by Bob Rae. Garneau announced later that year that he was considering a bid for the permanent leadership of the party. In the summer of 2012, he announced that he was looking for a &quot;dream team&quot; to run his leadership bid and that he would only run if he could find the right people.

On November 21, 2012, Garneau was named his party&#x27;s natural resources critic after David McGuinty resigned the post.

On November 28, 2012, Garneau announced his bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party, placing a heavy focus on the economy. While fellow leadership candidate Justin Trudeau was widely seen as the front-runner in the race, Garneau was thought to be his main challenger among the candidates. With his entrance into the leadership race he resigned his post as Liberal House leader, while remaining the party&#x27;s critic for natural resources.

At the press conference announcing his candidacy Garneau ruled out any form of co-operation with the Green Party or New Democratic Party to help defeat the Conservative Party in the next election, which was proposed by leadership candidate Joyce Murray.

On January 30, 2013, Garneau was replaced as natural resources critic by Ted Hsu. Garneau had been serving in the position on an interim basis. On March 13, 2013 Garneau announced his withdrawal from the race, and threw his support to front-runner Justin Trudeau. On September 18, 2013, Garneau was named co-chair of the Liberal International Affairs Council of Advisors, providing advice on foreign and defence issues to Liberal Party of Canada leader Justin Trudeau.

=== Minister of Transport in the 42nd Parliament ===
In the 2015 elections held on October 19, 2015, Garneau was re-elected as MP in the newly created riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Westmount. Two weeks later, on November 4, 2015, Garneau was appointed the minister of transport by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

In May 2017, Garneau introduced an airline passenger bill of rights to standardize how passengers can be treated by airlines which operate any flights in and out of Canada. The legislation would create minimum compensation rates for overbooking, lost or damaged luggage, and bumping passengers off flights. It would also prohibit airlines from removing people from the flight if they have purchased a ticket and set the standard for tarmac delays and airline treatment of passengers when flights are delayed or cancelled over events in the airline&#x27;s control, or because of weather conditions.
In March 2019, after days of initial refusal to take actions following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, Garneau who had even gone so far as to say on 11 March that he would board 737 MAX 8 &quot;without hesitation&quot; as an apparent show of support for the Boeing Company, finally agreed on 13 March to ground and prohibit all Boeing 737 Max aircraft from flying in Canadian airspace. The Trump administration followed suit later that day. This stood in contrast to the ministry&#x27;s previous stance, where Garneau insisted the plane was safe to fly, thus making Canada one of the only two nations still flying a substantial number of Boeing 737 Max planes at the time.

=== Minister of Foreign Affairs in the 43rd Parliament===
Garneau continued to serve as Minister of Transport after the elections to the 43rd Parliament held in October 2019. He was at Transport for the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, and thus he was responsible to enforce the &quot;Quarantine Act&quot; as lieutenant to the Minister of Health Patty Hajdu; during this time he made many decisions that would affect the lives of travellers in co-ordination with Hadju.

Garneau then served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 12, 2021 until October 26, 2021. On January 12, 2021, following the resignation of Navdeep Bains as minister of innovation, science and industry, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shuffled the Cabinet, with Garneau becoming Minister of Foreign Affairs and Omar Alghabra taking his place at Transport. Garneau was described as one of the most qualified and capable members of Cabinet.

===Member of 44th Parliament and retirement===
Following the cabinet reshuffle stemming from the election in October 2021, Garneau was dropped from Cabinet on October 26, despite being re-elected to his seat in the House. Some have speculated that Garneau did not remain in cabinet due to his age, being sacrificed in the name of gender parity, and that he reportedly refused to be subservient to the Prime Minister’s Office.

On March 8, 2023, Garneau announced that he would resign his seat and retire from politics. He gave his farewell speech in the House of Commons the same day. The by-election to replace him in parliament occurred June 19, 2023. Liberal Anna Gainey succeeded him, with almost as big a majority of votes as Garneau had won previously.

==Awards and honours==
Garneau was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1984 in recognition of his role as the first Canadian astronaut. He was promoted the rank of Companion within the order in 2003 for his extensive work with Canada&#x27;s space program.

He was awarded the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration for 12 years of honourable service with the Canadian Forces.

He is honoured with a high school named after him, Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute in Toronto and É.S.P. Marc-Garneau in Trenton, Ontario.

Garneau is the Honorary Captain of the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets. In addition, no 599 Royal Canadian Air Cadets squadron is named in his honour.

Garneau was awarded the Key to the City of Ottawa from Marion Dewar the Mayor of Ottawa on December 10, 1984.

He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1992.

<text>Watling Street is a historic route in England, running from Dover and London in the southeast, via St Albans to Wroxeter. The road crosses the River Thames at London and was used in Classical Antiquity, Late Antiquity, and throughout the Middle Ages. It was used by the ancient Britons and paved as one of the main Roman roads in Britannia (Roman-governed Great Britain during the Roman Empire). The line of the road was later the southwestern border of the Danelaw with Wessex and Mercia, and Watling Street was numbered as one of the major highways of medieval England.

First used by the ancient Britons, mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and using a natural ford near Westminster, the road was later paved by the Romans. It connected the ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough Castle), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) in Kent to the Roman bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The route continued northwest through Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter). Watling Street is traditionally cited as having been the location of the Romans&#x27; defeat of Boudica, though precisely where on the route is disputed.

The Roman &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot; lists sites along the route of Watling Street as part of a longer route of 500 Roman miles connecting Richborough with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall via Wroxeter. The continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens, Dumfriesshire) beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in modern Scotland may have been part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg.

In the early 18th century, England&#x27;s first turnpike trust was established to pave the route through Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the Channel was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. 

The route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road. The route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road. At various points along the historic route, the name Watling Street remains in modern use.

==Name==
The original Celtic and Roman name for the road is unknown, and the Romans may not have viewed it as a single path at all, since parts of it were assigned to two separate itineraries in one 2nd-century list. The modern name instead derives from the Old English &#x27;, from a time when &quot;street&quot; referred to any paved road and had no particular association with urban thoroughfares. The &#x27; (&quot;people of &quot;) were a tribe in the St Albans area in the early medieval period with an early name of their city being &quot;Waetlingacaester&quot;, which would translate into modern English as &quot;Watlingchester&quot;.

The original Anglo-Saxon name for the section of the route between Canterbury and London was &quot;&quot; or Key Street, a name still borne by a hamlet on the road near Sittingbourne. This section only later became considered part of Watling Street.

==Used as a boundary==
Watling Street has been used as a boundary of many historic administrative units, and some of these are still in existence today, either through continuity or the adoption of these as by successor areas.
Examples include:
* Watling Street was used as a boundary in the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum and it is often inferred that this made the road the SW boundary of the Danelaw.
* It is the boundary of Leicestershire and Warwickshire, this may be a legacy of the treaty described above.
* Watling Street forms part of the boundary of four London Boroughs (Harrow, Brent, Camden and Barnet) and is sometimes described as the boundary of West and North London.

==History==
===British===
The broad, grassy trackway found by the Romans had already been used by the Britons for centuries. The main path led from Richborough on the English Channel to a natural ford in the Thames at Thorney Island, Westminster, to a site near Wroxeter, where it split. The western continuation went on to Holyhead while the northern ran to Chester and on to the Picts in Scotland.

===Westminster ford===
There is a longstanding tradition that a natural ford once crossed the Thames between Thorney Island (present-day Westminster) and the Lambeth/Wandsworth boundary. Its location means that it is possible that Watling Street crossed it.

Several factors may have slowed the river here, leading to the depositing of enough sediments to create a usable ford: 
* The bend in the Thames near Vauxhall Bridge.
* The two arms of the River Effra joining in that vicinity, depositing their own load, with the cross-flow causing the Thames to eddy and slow.
* Similarly the southern arm of the Tyburn, once joined the Thames at this point, on the northern bank.
* These factors mean the area is likely to have been the tidal head for some of the historic period.

===Roman===

The Romans began constructing paved roads shortly after their invasion in AD 43. The London portion of Watling Street was rediscovered during Christopher Wren&#x27;s rebuilding of St Mary-le-Bow in 1671–73, following the Great Fire. Modern excavations date its construction to the winter from AD 47 to 48. Around London, it was wide and paved with gravel. It was repeatedly redone, including at least twice before the sack of London by Boudica&#x27;s troops in 60 or 61. The road ran straight from the bridgehead on the Thames to what would become Newgate on the London Wall before passing over Ludgate Hill and the Fleet and dividing into Watling Street and the Devil&#x27;s Highway west to Calleva (Silchester). Some of this route is preserved beneath Old Kent Road.

The 2nd-century &quot;Antonine Itinerary&quot; gives the course of Watling Street from &quot;Urioconium&quot; (Wroxeter) to &quot;Portus Ritupis&quot; (Richborough) as a part of its Second Route (&quot;&quot;), which runs for 501 MP from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to Richborough:

====Battle of Watling Street====

Some site in the middle section of this route is supposed by most historians to have been the location of G. Suetonius Paulinus&#x27;s decisive victory over Boudica&#x27;s Iceni in AD 61.

====Subsidiary routes====
The two routes of the Antonine Itinerary immediately following (&#x27; &amp; &#x27;) list the stations from Londinium to &quot;Portus Dubris&quot; (Dover) and to &quot;Portus Lemanis&quot; (Lympne) at the north eastern edge of the Romney Marsh, suggesting that they may have been considered interchangeable terminuses. They only differ in the distance to Durovernum: 14 and 17 Roman miles, respectively. The route to Lemanis was sometimes distinguished by the name ; it now forms most of the B2068 road that runs from the M20 motorway to Canterbury. The route between Durovernum and the fortress and port at Regulbium (Reculver) on Kent&#x27;s northern shore is not given in these itineraries but was also paved and is sometimes taken as a fourth terminus for Watling Street. The Sixth Route (&quot;&quot;) also recorded an alternate path stopping at Tripontium (Newton and Biggin) between Venonis (High Cross) and Bannaventa (Norton); it is listed as taking 24 Roman miles rather than 17.

The more direct route north from Londinium (London) to Eboracum (York) was Ermine Street. The stations between Eboracum and Cataractonium (Catterick) were shared with Dere Street, which then branched off to the northeast. Durocobrivis (Dunstable) was the site of the path&#x27;s intersection with the Icknield Way. The Maiden Way ran from Bravoniacum (Kirkby Thore) to the fort at Epiacum (Whitley Castle) with its remarkable ramparts, and on to the Hadrian&#x27;s Wall fort of Magnis (Carvoran).

===Saxon===
By the time of the Saxon invasions, the Roman bridge across the Thames had presumably fallen into disrepair or been destroyed. The Saxons abandoned the walled Roman site in favour of Lundenwic to its west, presumably because of its more convenient access to the ford on the Thames. They did not return to Lundenburh (the City of London) until forced to do so by the Vikings in the late 9th century. Over time, the graveling and paving itself fell into disrepair, although the road&#x27;s course continued to be used in many places as a public right of way. &quot;Watlingestrate&quot; was one of the four roads protected by the king&#x27;s peace in the Laws of Edward the Confessor.

A number of Old English names testify to route of Watling Street at this time: Boughton Street in Kent; Colney Street in Hertfordshire; Fenny Stratford and Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire; Old Stratford in Northamptonshire; Stretton-under-Fosse and Stretton Baskerville in Warwickshire. (The three adjacent settlements of All Stretton, Church Stretton, and Little Stretton in Shropshire; and Stretton Sugwas in Herefordshire have a Watling Street but they are not on the route).

===Viking===

Following the Viking invasions, the 9th-century Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum mentions Watling Street as a boundary.

===Norman===
It is assumed that the pilgrims in Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; used the southeastern stretch of Watling Street when journeying from Southwark to Canterbury.

===Modernity===
The first turnpike trust in England was established over Watling Street northwest of London by an Act of Parliament on 4 March 1707 in order to provide a return on the investment required to once more pave the road. The section from Fourne Hill north of Hockliffe to Stony Stratford was paved at a cost of £7000 over the next two years. Revenue was below expectations; in 1709, the trust succeeded in getting a new act extending the term of their monopoly but not permitting their tolls to be increased. In 1711, the trust&#x27;s debts had not been discharged and the creditors took over receivership of the tolls. In 1716, a new act restored the authority of the trust under the supervision of another group appointed by the Buckinghamshire justices of the peace. The trust failed to receive a further extension of their rights in 1736 and their authority ended at the close of 1738. In 1740, a new act named new trustees to oversee the road, which the residents of Buckinghamshire described as being &quot;ruined&quot;.

The road was again paved in the early 19th century at the expense of Thomas Telford. He operated it as a turnpike road for mail coaches from Ireland. To this purpose, he extended it to the port of Holyhead on Anglesey in Wales. During this time, the section southeast of London became known as the Great Dover Road. The tolls ended in 1875.

Much of the road is still in use today, apart from a few sections where it has been diverted. The A2 road between Dover and London runs over or parallel to the old path. A section of Watling Street still exists in the City of London close to Mansion House underground station on the route of the original Roman road which traversed the River Thames via the first London Bridge and ran through the City in a straight line from London Bridge to Newgate. The sections of the road in Central London possess a variety of names, including Edgware Road and Maida Vale. At Blackheath, the Roman road ran along Old Dover Road, turning and running through the area of present-day Greenwich Park to a location perhaps a little north of the current Deptford Bridge. North of London, the road is designated mainly as the A5 between London and Shrewsbury. At various points along the route, the A5 leaves the Roman road to bypass settlements, but its historic route invariably remains evident even where motor traffic is restricted or banned.

The name Watling Street is still used along the ancient road in many places, for instance in Bexleyheath in southeast London and in Canterbury, Gillingham, Strood, Gravesend, and Dartford in Kent. North of London, the name Watling Street still occurs in Hertfordshire (including St Albans), Bedfordshire (Dunstable), Buckinghamshire (Milton Keynes), Northamptonshire (Towcester), Leicestershire (Hinckley), Warwickshire (Nuneaton and Atherstone) and in Staffordshire (Cannock, Wall, Tamworth and Lichfield). (There are Watling Streets in Shropshire (Church Stretton) and in Gwynedd (Llanrwst), but neither is on the original route.)

==Other Watling Streets==
Dere Street, the Roman road from Cataractonium (Catterick in Yorkshire) to Corstopitum (now Corbridge, Northumberland) to the Antonine Wall, was also sometimes known as Watling Street. A third Watling Street was the Roman road from Mamucium (Manchester) to Bremetennacum (Ribchester) to Cumbria. Preston, Lancashire, preserved a Watling Street Road between Ribbleton and Fulwood, passing the Sharoe Green Hospital. Both of these may preserve a separate derivation from the Old English &quot;wealhas&quot; (&quot;foreigner&quot;) or may have preserved the memory of the long Roman road while misattributing its upper stages to better-preserved roads. The Roman road between Deva Victrix (Chester) and Condate (Northwich) is also known locally as Watling Street.
