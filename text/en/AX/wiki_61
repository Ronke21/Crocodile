<text>In archaeology, cave paintings are a type of parietal art (which category also includes petroglyphs, or engravings), found on the wall or ceilings of caves. The term usually implies prehistoric origin. These paintings were often created by Homo sapiens, but also Denisovans and Neanderthals; other species in the same Homo genus. Discussion around prehistoric art is important in understanding the history of the Homo sapiens species and how Homo sapiens have come to have unique abstract thoughts. Some point to these prehistoric paintings as possible examples of creativity, spirituality, and sentimental thinking in prehistoric humans. 

The oldest known are more than 40,000 years old (art of the Upper Paleolithic) and found in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia). The oldest are often constructed from hand stencils and simple geometric shapes.
More recently, in 2021, cave art of a pig found in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and dated to over 45,500 years ago, has been reported.

A 2018 study claimed an age of 64,000 years for the oldest examples of non-figurative cave art in the Iberian Peninsula. Represented by three red non-figurative symbols found in the caves of Maltravieso, Ardales and La Pasiega, Spain, these predate the appearance of modern humans in Europe by at least 20,000 years and thus must have been made by Neanderthals rather than modern humans.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo. In December 2019, cave paintings portraying pig hunting within the Maros-Pangkep karst region in Sulawesi were discovered to be even older, with an estimated age of at least 51,200 years. This finding was recognized as &quot;the oldest known depiction of storytelling and the earliest instance of figurative art in human history.&quot; On July 3, 2024, the journal &quot;Nature&quot; published research findings indicating that the cave paintings which depict anthropomorphic figures interacting with a pig and measure in Leang Karampuang are approximately 51,200 years old, establishing them as the oldest known figurative art paintings in the world.

==Dating==
Nearly 350 caves have now been discovered in France and Spain that contain art from prehistoric times. Initially, the age of the paintings had been a contentious issue, since methods like radiocarbon dating can produce misleading results if contaminated by other samples, and caves and rocky overhangs (where parietal art is found) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. But subsequent technology has made it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself, torch marks on the walls, or the formation of carbonate deposits on top of the paintings. The subject matter can also indicate chronology: for instance, the reindeer depicted in the Spanish cave of Cueva de las Monedas places the drawings in the last Ice Age.

The oldest known cave painting is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave, Cáceres, Spain. It has been dated using the uranium-thorium method to older than 64,000 years and was made by a Neanderthal. The oldest date given to an animal cave painting is now a depiction of several human figures hunting pigs in the caves in the Maros-Pangkep karst of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, dated to be over 43,900 years old. Before this, the oldest known figurative cave paintings were that of a bull dated to 40,000 years, at Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, and a depiction of a pig with a minimum age of 35,400 years at Timpuseng cave in Sulawesi.

The earliest known European figurative cave paintings are those of Chauvet Cave in France, dating to earlier than 30,000 BC in the Upper Paleolithic according to radiocarbon dating. Some researchers believe the drawings are too advanced for this era and question this age. More than 80 radiocarbon dates had been obtained by 2011, with samples taken from torch marks and from the paintings themselves, as well as from animal bones and charcoal found on the cave floor. The radiocarbon dates from these samples show that there were two periods of creation in Chauvet: 35,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago. One of the surprises was that many of the paintings were modified repeatedly over thousands of years, possibly explaining the confusion about finer paintings that seemed to date earlier than cruder ones.

In 2009, cavers discovered drawings in Coliboaia Cave in Romania, stylistically comparable to those at Chauvet. An initial dating puts the age of an image in the same range as Chauvet: about 32,000 years old.

In Australia, cave paintings have been found on the Arnhem Land plateau showing megafauna which are thought to have been extinct for over 40,000 years, making this site another candidate for oldest known painting; however, the proposed age is dependent on the estimate of the extinction of the species seemingly depicted. Another Australian site, Nawarla Gabarnmang, has charcoal drawings that have been radiocarbon-dated to 28,000 years, making it the oldest site in Australia and among the oldest in the world for which reliable date evidence has been obtained.

Other examples may date as late as the Early Bronze Age, but the well-known Magdalenian style seen at Lascaux in France (c.15,000 BC) and Altamira in Spain died out about 10,000BC, coinciding with the advent of the Neolithic period. Some caves probably continued to be painted over a period of several thousands of years.

The next phase of surviving European prehistoric painting, the rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, was very different, concentrating on large assemblies of smaller and much less detailed figures, with at least as many humans as animals. This was created roughly between 10,000 and 5,500 years ago, and painted in rock shelters under cliffs or shallow caves, in contrast to the recesses of deep caves used in the earlier (and much colder) period. Although individual figures are less naturalistic, they are grouped in coherent grouped compositions to a much greater degree. Over a long period of time, the cave art has become less naturalistic and has graduated from beautiful, naturalistic animal drawings to simple ones, and then to abstract shapes.

== Subjects, themes, and patterns in cave painting ==
Cave artists use a variety of techniques such as finger tracing, modeling in clay, engravings, bas-relief sculpture, hand stencils, and paintings done in two or three colors. Scholars classify cave art as &quot;Signs&quot; or abstract marks. 
 The most common subjects in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as bison, horses, aurochs, and deer, and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called finger flutings. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example, the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where equine species are the most common. Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic as opposed to the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. Kieran D. O&#x27;Hara, geologist, suggests in his book &quot;Cave Art and Climate Change&quot; that climate controlled the themes depicted.
Pigments used include red and yellow ochre, hematite, manganese oxide and charcoal. Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first, and in some caves all or many of the images are only engraved in this fashion, taking them somewhat out of a strict definition of &quot;cave painting&quot;.

Similarly, large animals are also the most common subjects in the many small carved and engraved bone or ivory (less often stone) pieces dating from the same periods. But these include the group of Venus figurines, which with a few incomplete exceptions have no real equivalent in Paleolithic cave paintings. One counterexample is a feminine figure in the Chauvet Cave, as described in an interview with Dominique Baffier in &quot;Cave of Forgotten Dreams&quot;.
Hand stencils, formed by placing a hand against the wall and covering the surrounding area in pigment result in the characteristic image of a roughly round area of solid pigment with the negative shape of the hand in the centre, these may then be decorated with dots, dashes, and patterns. Often, these are found in the same caves as other paintings, or may be the only form of painting in a location. Some walls contain many hand stencils. Similar hands are also painted in the usual fashion. A number of hands show a finger wholly or partly missing, for which a number of explanations have been given. Hand images are found in similar forms in Europe, Eastern Asia, Australia, and South America. One site in Baja California features handprints as a prominent motif in its rock art. Archaeological study of this site revealed that, based on the size of the handprints, they most likely belonged to the women of the community. In addition to this, they were likely used during initiation rituals in Chinigchinich religious practices, which were commonly practiced in the Luiseño territory where this site is located.

=== Theories and interpretations ===

In the early 20th century, following the work of Walter Baldwin Spencer and Francis James Gillen, scholars such as Salomon Reinach, Henri Breuil and interpreted the paintings as &#x27;utilitarian&#x27; hunting magic to increase the abundance of prey. Jacob Bronowski states, &quot;I think that the power that we see expressed here for the first time is the power of anticipation: the forward-looking imagination. In these paintings the hunter was made familiar with dangers which he knew he had to face but to which he had not yet come.&quot;

Another theory, developed by David Lewis-Williams and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic shamans. The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state, then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing out power from the cave walls themselves.

R. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and age among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the Venus figurines) are the work of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the human population at the time. However, in analyzing hand prints and stencils in French and Spanish caves, Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University has proposed that a proportion of them, including those around the spotted horses in Pech Merle, were of female hands.

Analysis in 2022, led by Bennett Bacon, an amateur archaeologist, along with a team of professional archeologists and psychologists at the University of Durham, including Paul Pettitt and Robert William Kentridge, suggested that lines and dots (and a commonly seen, if curious, &quot;Y&quot; symbol, which was proposed to mean &quot;to give birth&quot;) on upper palaeolithic cave paintings correlated with the mating cycle of animals in a lunar calendar, potentially making them the earliest known evidence of a proto-writing system and explaining one object of many cave paintings.

Other sites include Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England (~14,500 ys old cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), Peștera Coliboaia in Romania (~29,000 y.o. art?).

Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces; but fewer of those have survived because of erosion. One example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (3,000–2,500 BC) in the Saimaa area of Finland.

When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Cave of Altamira in Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry and symbolism of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.
=== East and Southeast Asia ===
In Indonesia the caves in the district of Maros in Sulawesi are famous for their hand prints. About 1,500 negative handprints have also been found in 30 painted caves in the Sangkulirang area of Kalimantan; preliminary dating analysis as of 2005 put their age in the range of 10,000 years old. A 2014 study based on uranium–thorium dating dated a Maros hand stencil to a minimum age of 39,900 years. A painting of a babirusa was dated to at least 35.4 ka, placing it among the oldest known figurative depictions worldwide.

In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the Indonesian island of Borneo.

And more recently, in 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of cave art at least 45,500 years old in Leang Tedongnge cave, Indonesia. According to the journal &quot;Science Advances&quot;, the cave painting of a warty pig is the earliest evidence of human settlement of the region. It has been reported that it is rapidly deteriorating as a result of climate change in the region.

Originating in the Paleolithic period, the rock art found in Khoit Tsenkher Cave, Mongolia, includes symbols and animal forms painted from the walls up to the ceiling. Stags, buffalo, oxen, ibex, lions, Argali sheep, antelopes, camels, elephants, ostriches, and other animal pictorials are present, often forming a palimpsest of overlapping images. The paintings appear brown or red in color, and are stylistically similar to other Paleolithic rock art from around the world but are unlike any other examples in Mongolia.

The Padah-Lin Caves of Burma contain 11,000-year-old paintings and many rock tools.

=== India ===
The Ambadevi rock shelters have the oldest cave paintings in India, dating back to 25,000 years. The Bhimbetka rock shelters are dated to about 8,000 BC. Similar paintings are found in other parts of India as well. In Tamil Nadu, ancient Paleolithic Cave paintings are found in Kombaikadu, Kilvalai, Settavarai and Nehanurpatti. In Odisha they are found in Yogimatha and Gudahandi. In Karnataka, these paintings are found in Hiregudda near Badami. The most recent painting, consisting of geometric figures, date to the medieval period.
Executed mainly in red and white with the occasional use of green and yellow, the paintings depict the lives and times of the people who lived in the caves, including scenes of childbirth, communal dancing and drinking, religious rites and burials, as well as indigenous animals.

===Southern Africa===
Cave paintings found at the Apollo 11 Cave in Namibia are estimated to date from approximately 25,500–27,500 years ago.

In 2011, archaeologists found a small rock fragment at Blombos Cave, about east of Cape Town on the southern cape coastline in South Africa, among spear points and other excavated material. After extensive testing for seven years, it was revealed that the lines drawn on the rock were handmade and from an ochre crayon dating back 73,000 years. This makes it the oldest known rock painting.

=== Australia ===

Significant early cave paintings, executed in ochre, have been found in Kimberley and Kakadu, Australia. Ochre is not an organic material, so carbon dating of these pictures is often impossible. The oldest so far dated at 17,300 years is an ochre painting of a kangaroo in the Kimberley region, which was dated by carbon dating wasp nest material underlying and overlying the painting. Sometimes the approximate date, or at least, an epoch, can be surmised from the painting content, contextual artifacts, or organic material intentionally or inadvertently mixed with the inorganic ochre paint, including torch soot.

A red ochre painting, discovered at the centre of the Arnhem Land Plateau, depicts two emu-like birds with their necks outstretched. They have been identified by a palaeontologist as depicting the megafauna species &quot;Genyornis&quot;, giant birds thought to have become extinct more than 40,000 years ago; however, this evidence is inconclusive for dating. It may suggest that Genyornis became extinct at a later date than previously determined.

Hook Island in the Whitsunday Islands is also home to a number of cave paintings created by the seafaring Ngaro people.

==Holocene cave art==
===Asia===
In the Philippines at Tabon Caves the oldest artwork may be a relief of a shark above the cave entrance. It was partially disfigured by a later jar burial scene.

The Edakkal Caves of Kerala, India, contain drawings that range over periods from the Neolithic as early as 5,000 BC to 1,000 BC.

=== Horn of Africa ===
Rock art near Qohaito appears to indicate habitation in the area since the fifth millennium BC, while the town is known to have survived to the sixth century AD. Mount Emba Soira, Eritrea&#x27;s highest mountain, lies near the site, as does a small successor village. Much of the rock art sites are found together with evidence of prehistoric stone tools, suggesting that the art could predate the widely presumed pastoralist and domestication events that occurred 5,000– 4,000 years ago.

In 2002, a French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel cave paintings on the outskirts of Hargeisa in Somaliland. Dating back around 5,000 years, the paintings depict both wild animals and decorated cows. They also feature herders, who are believed to be the creators of the rock art. In 2008, Somali archaeologists announced the discovery of other cave paintings in Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is dated to 1000 to 3000 BC.

Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in Karinhegane is a site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old. Karihegane&#x27;s rock art is in the same distinctive style as the Laas Geel and Dhambalin cave paintings. Around 25 miles from Las Khorey is found Gelweita, another key rock art site.

In Djibouti, rock art of what appear to be antelopes and a giraffe are also found at Dorra and Balho.

=== North Africa ===

Many cave paintings are found in the Tassili n&#x27;Ajjer mountains in southeast Algeria. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the rock art was first discovered in 1933 and has since yielded 15,000 engravings and drawings that keep a record of the various animal migrations, climatic shifts, and change in human inhabitation patterns in this part of the Sahara from 6000 BC to the late classical period. Other cave paintings are also found at the Akakus, Mesak Settafet and Tadrart in Libya and other Sahara regions including: Ayr mountains, Niger and Tibesti, Chad.

The Cave of Swimmers and the Cave of Beasts in southwest Egypt, near the border with Libya, in the mountainous Gilf Kebir region of the Sahara Desert. The Cave of Swimmers was discovered in October 1933 by the Hungarian explorer László Almásy. The site contains rock painting images of people swimming, which are estimated to have been created 10,000 years ago during the time of the most recent Ice Age.

In 2020, limestone cave decorated with scenes of animals such as donkeys, camels, deer, mule and mountain goats was uncovered in the area of Wadi Al-Zulma by the archaeological mission from the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry. Rock art cave is 15 meters deep and 20 meters high.

=== Southern Africa ===

At uKhahlamba / Drakensberg Park, South Africa, now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the San people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs. Human figures are much more common in the rock art of Africa than in Europe.

=== North America ===

Distinctive monochrome and polychrome cave paintings and murals exist in the mid-peninsula regions of southern Baja California and northern Baja California Sur, consisting of Pre-Columbian paintings of humans, land animals, sea creatures, and abstract designs. These paintings are mostly confined to the sierras of this region, but can also be found in outlying mesas and rock shelters. According to recent radiocarbon studies of the area, of materials recovered from archaeological deposits in the rock shelters and on materials in the paintings themselves, suggest that the Great Murals may have a time range extending as far back as 7,500 years ago.

California

Native artists in the Chumash tribes created cave paintings that are located in present-day Santa Barbara, Ventura, and San Luis Obispo Counties in Southern California in the United States. They include examples at Burro Flats Painted Cave and Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park.

There are also Native American pictogram examples in caves of the Southwestern United States. Cave art that is 6,000 years old was found in the Cumberland Plateau region of Tennessee.

Native American tribes have contributed to the makings of Californian cave art, whether it be in Northern or Baja California. The Chumash people of Southern and Baja California made paintings in Swordfish Cave. It was given its name after the swordfish that are painted on its walls and is a sacred site for religious and cultural practices of the Chumash tribe. It was under attack of demolition, which prompted the start of its conservation with cooperation between the Vandenberg Air Force Base and the Tribal Elders Council of the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash. These two parties were able to stabilize and conserve the cave and its art. When previously studied, there were many conclusions about how the paintings were made but not a lot of conclusions about the symbolic value of the rock art and what its meaning to the Chumash tribe. The excavation of the inside of the cave became a viewing area for archaeologists and anthropologists, specifically Clayton Lebow, Douglas Harrow, and Rebecca McKim, to find out the symbolic meaning of the art. Some of the tools that were used to make the pictographs were found in the site and were connected to the two early occupations that were in the area. This pushed back the general knowledge of understood antiquity of rock art on California&#x27;s Central Coast by more than 2,000 years.

==== Northern and Baja California ====
The National Institution of Anthropology and History (INAH) established in Mexico recorded over 1,500 rock art related archaeological monuments in Baja California. A little under 300 of the sites were connected to Native American Tribes. Throughout these 300 sites, 65% have paintings, 24% have petroglyphs, 10% have both paintings and petroglyphs, and 1% have geoglyphs. Five of these sites located in Baja California show hand designs or paintings, and they all spread out in that area. These sites include Milagro de Guadalupe (23 imprints), Corral de Queno (6 imprints), Rancho Viejo (1 drawing), Piedras Gordas (5 imprints), and finally Valle Seco (3 imprints).

=== South America ===

Serra da Capivara National Park is a national park in the north east of Brazil with many prehistoric paintings; the park was created to protect the prehistoric artifacts and paintings found there. It became a World Heritage Site in 1991. Its best known archaeological site is Pedra Furada.

It is located in northeast state of Piauí, between latitudes 8° 26&#x27; 50&quot; and 8° 54&#x27; 23&quot; south and longitudes 42° 19&#x27; 47&quot; and 42° 45&#x27; 51&quot; west. It falls within the municipal areas of São Raimundo Nonato, São João do Piauí, Coronel José Dias and Canto do Buriti. It has an area of 1291.4 square kilometres (319,000 acres). The area has the largest concentration of prehistoric small farms on the American continents. Scientific studies confirm that the Capivara mountain range was densely populated in prehistoric periods.

Cueva de las Manos (Spanish for &quot;Cave of the Hands&quot;) is a cave located in the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina, 163 km (101 mi) south of the town of Perito Moreno, within the borders of the Francisco P. Moreno National Park, which includes many sites of archaeological and paleontological importance.

The hand images are often negative (stencilled). Besides these there are also depictions of human beings, guanacos, rheas, felines and other animals, as well as geometric shapes, zigzag patterns, representations of the sun, and hunting scenes. Similar paintings, though in smaller numbers, can be found in nearby caves. There are also red dots on the ceilings, probably made by submerging their hunting bolas in ink, and then throwing them up. The colours of the paintings vary from red (made from hematite) to white, black or yellow. The negative hand impressions date to around 550 BC, the positive impressions from 180 BC, while the hunting drawings are calculated to more than 10,000 years old. Most of the hands are &quot;left hands&quot; (that is, with thumb on the right, even though this pattern can be obtained as easily with both right and left hands, depending on whether the back or front is used) which has been used as an argument to suggest that painters held the spraying pipe with their right hand.

=== Southeast Asia ===

There are rock paintings in caves in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Burma. In Thailand, caves and scarps along the Thai-Burmese border, in the Petchabun Range of Central Thailand, and overlooking the Mekong River in Nakorn Sawan Province, all contain galleries of rock paintings. In Malaysia, the Tambun rock art is dated at 2000 years, and those in the Painted Cave at Niah Caves National Park are 1200 years old. The anthropologist Ivor Hugh Norman Evans visited Malaysia in the early 1920s and found that some of the tribes (especially Negritos) were still producing cave paintings and had added depictions of modern objects including what are believed to be automobiles. (See prehistoric Malaysia.)

In Indonesia, rock paintings can be found in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Flores, Timor, Maluku and Papua.

<text>Georges Joseph Christian Simenon (; 12/13 February 1903 – 4 September 1989) was a Belgian writer, most famous for his fictional detective Jules Maigret. One of the most popular authors of the 20th century, he published around 400 novels (including 192 under his own name), 21 volumes of memoirs and many short stories, selling over 500 million copies.

Apart from his detective fiction, he achieved critical acclaim for his literary novels, which he called &quot;romans durs&quot; (hard novels). Among his literary admirers were Max Jacob, François Mauriac and André Gide. Gide wrote, “I consider Simenon a great novelist, perhaps the greatest, and the most genuine novelist that we have had in contemporary French literature.”

Born and raised in Liège, Belgium, Simenon lived for extended periods in France (1922–1945), the United States (1946–1955) and finally Switzerland (1957–1989). Much of his work is semi-autobiographical, inspired by his childhood and youth in Liège, extensive travels in Europe and the world, wartime experiences, troubled marriages, and numerous love affairs.

Critics such as John Banville have praised Simenon&#x27;s novels for their psychological insights and vivid evocation of time and place. Among his most notable works are &quot;The Saint-Fiacre Affair&quot; (1932), &quot;Monsieur Hire&#x27;s Engagement&quot; (1933), &quot;Act of Passion&quot; (1947), &quot;The Snow was Dirty&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Cat&quot; (1967).

==Early life and education==
Simenon was born at 26 Rue Léopold (Liège) (now number 24) to Désiré Simenon and his wife Henriette Brüll. Désiré Simenon worked in an accounting office at an insurance company and had married Henriette in April 1902. Simenon was born either at 11.30 pm on Thursday 12 February 1903 (according to the birth certificate) or just after midnight on Friday 13th (the date possibly being falsified on the certificate due to superstition).

The Simenon family was of Walloon and Flemish ancestry, settling in the Belgian Limburg in the seventeenth century. His mother&#x27;s family was of Flemish, Dutch and German descent. One of his mother&#x27;s most notorious ancestors was Gabriel Brühl, a criminal who preyed on Limburg from the 1720s until he was hanged in 1743. Later Simenon would use Brühl as one of his many pen names.

In April 1905, two years after Simenon&#x27;s birth, the family moved to 3 rue Pasteur (now 25 rue Georges Simenon) in Liège&#x27;s neighbourhood. Simenon&#x27;s brother Christian was born in September 1906 and eventually became their mother&#x27;s favourite child, which Simenon resented. The young Simenon, however, idolised his father and later claimed to have partly modelled Maigret&#x27;s temperament on him.

At the age of three, Simenon learned to read at the Ecole Guardienne run by the Sisters of Notre Dame. Then, between 1908 and 1914, he attended the Institut Saint-André, run by the Christian Brothers.

In 1911 the Simenons moved to 53 rue de la Loi, where they took in lodgers, many of them students from Eastern Europe, Jews and political refugees. This gave the young Simenon an introduction to the wider world, which was later reflected his novels, notably &quot;Pedigree&quot; (published 1948) and &quot;Le Locataire&quot; (&quot;The Lodger&quot;) (1938).

Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Liège was occupied by the German army. Henriette took in German officers as lodgers, much to Désiré&#x27;s disapproval. Simenon later said that the war years provided some of the happiest times of his life. They were also memorable for a child because &quot;my father cheated, my mother cheated, everyone cheated.&quot;

In October 1914 Simenon began his studies at the Collège Saint-Louis, a Jesuit high school. After a year he switched to Collège St Servais, where he studied for three years. He excelled at French, but his marks in other subjects declined. He read widely in the Russian, French and English classics, frequently played truant, and turned to petty theft in order to buy pastries and other war-time luxuries.

In 1917 the Simenon family moved to a former post-office building in the rue des Maraîchers. Using his father&#x27;s heart condition as a pretext, Simenon left school in June 1918 without taking his end-of-year exams. After brief periods working in a pâtisserie and a bookshop, Simenon found himself unemployed when the war ended in November 1918. He witnessed scenes of violent retribution against residents of Liège accused of collaboration, which stayed with him for the rest of his life. He described these scenes in &quot;Pedigree&quot; and &quot;Les trois crimes de mes amis&quot; (My Friends&#x27; Three Crimes) (1938).

== Early career, 1919–1922 ==
In January 1919 the 15-year-old Simenon took a job as a junior reporter at the &quot;Gazette de Liège&quot;, a right-wing Catholic newspaper edited by Joseph Demarteau. Within a few months he was promoted to crime reporting, signing his articles &quot;Georges Sim&quot;. By April he was given his own opinion and gossip column, which he signed &quot;Monsieur Le Coq&quot;. He was also assigned interviews with leading international figures such as Hirohito, Crown Prince of Japan, and French war hero Marshal Foch. In 1920-21 he enrolled on a course in forensic science at the University of Liège in order to improve his knowledge of the latest police methods.

In May 1920 Simenon began publishing short fiction in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. In September he completed his first novel, &quot;Au Pont des Arches&quot;, which he self-published in 1921. He wrote two other novels while working at the &quot;Gazette&quot;, but these were never published.

In June 1919 Simenon had been introduced into a group of young artists and bohemians that called itself &quot;Le Caque&quot; (herring barrel). The group met at night to drink, discuss art and philosophy, and experiment with drugs such as morphine and cocaine. In early 1922 one of the members of the group, Joseph Kleine, hanged himself at the doors of the St Pholien church of Liège after a night of excess with &quot;Le Caque&quot;. Simenon was one of the last people to see Kleine alive and was deeply affected by his suicide, later referring to the incident in &quot;Les trois crimes de mes amis&quot; and &quot;Le pendu de St Pholien&quot; (&quot;The Hanged Man of Saint Pholien&quot;) (1931).

Through &quot;Le Caque,&quot; Simenon met a young painter, Régine Renchon, and in early 1921 they began a relationship. They soon became engaged and agreed that Simenon should complete his year of compulsory military service before they married.

Simenon&#x27;s father died in November 1921, an event that Simenon called &quot;the most important day in a man&#x27;s life.&quot; Soon after, he began his military service. After a brief posting with the allied occupation forces in Germany, he was transferred to the cavalry barracks in Liège and was soon given permission to resume writing for the &quot;Gazette.&quot;

When Simenon&#x27;s military service ended in December 1922, he resigned from the &quot;Gazette&quot; and moved to Paris to establish a base for himself and his future wife, Régine, whom he preferred to call Tigy.

==France, 1922–1945==

=== Literary apprenticeship, 19221928 ===
Now in Paris, Simenon found a menial job with a far-right political group headed by the writer Binet-Valmer. In March 1923 he returned to Liège to marry Régine. Although neither Simenon nor Régine were religious, they were married in a Catholic church to please Simenon&#x27;s mother, who was devout.

The newly-weds moved to Paris where Régine tried to establish herself as a painter while Simenon resumed work for Binet-Valmer and sent articles to the &quot;Revue Sincère&quot; of Brussels for which he was the Paris correspondent. He also wrote short stories for popular magazines, but sales were sporadic.

In the summer of 1923, Simenon was engaged by the Marquis de Tracy as his private secretary, which obliged him to spend nine months of the year at the aristocrat&#x27;s various rural properties. Régine soon moved to a village near the Marquis&#x27;s principal estate at Paray-le-Frésil, near Moulins.

While working for the Marquis, Simenon began submitting stories to &quot;Le Matin&quot; whose literary editor was Colette. Colette advised him to make his work &quot;less literary&quot; which Simenon took to mean that he should use simple descriptions and a limited stock of common words. Simenon followed her advice and within a year became one of the paper&#x27;s regular contributors.

Now with a steady income from his writing, Simenon left the Marquis&#x27; employ in 1924 and returned to Paris where he and Régine found an apartment in the fashionable Place des Vosges. Simenon was writing and selling short stories at the rate of 80 typed pages a day, and now turned his hand to pulp novels. His first, &quot;Le roman d&#x27;une dactylo&quot; (The Story of a Typist) was quickly sold and two more appeared in 1924 under the pseudonyms &quot;Jean du Perry&quot; and &quot;Georges Simm&quot;. From 1921 to 1934 he used a total of 17 pen names while writing 358 novels and short stories.

In the summer of 1925, the Simenons took a holiday in Normandy where they met Henriette Liberge, the 18-year-old daughter of a fisherman. Régine offered her a job as their housekeeper in Paris and the young woman accepted. Simenon began calling her &quot;Boule&quot;, and she was to become his lover and part of the Simenon household under that name for the next 39 years.

Simenon began an affair with Josephine Baker in 1926 or 1927, and became her part-time assistant and editor of &quot;Josephine Baker&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. However, the Simenons were tiring of their hectic life in Paris, and in April 1928 they set out with Boule for a six-month tour of the rivers and canals of France in a small boat, the &quot;Ginette&quot;. Without the distractions provided by Josephine Baker, Simenon&#x27;s tally of published popular novels increased from 11 in 1927 to 44 in 1928.

=== Birth and retirement of Maigret, 19291939 ===
In the spring of 1929, the Simenons and Boule set off for a tour of northern France, Belgium and Holland in a larger, custom-built boat, the &quot;Ostrogoth&quot;. Simenon had begun contributing detective stories to a new magazine called &quot;Détective&quot; and continued to publish popular novels, mainly with the publishers Fayard.During his northern tour, Simenon wrote three popular novels featuring a police inspector named Maigret, but only one, &quot;Train de nuit&quot; (Night Train) was accepted by Fayard. Simenon began working on the latter novel (or possibly its successor &quot;Pietr-le-Letton (Pietr the Latvian)&quot;) in September 1929 when the Ostrogoth was undergoing repairs in the Dutch city of Delfzijl, and the city is now celebrated as the birthplace of Simenon&#x27;s most famous character.

On his return to Paris in April 1930, Simenon completed &quot;Pietr-le-Letton,&quot; the first novel in which commissioner Maigret of the Paris mobile crime brigade was a fully developed character. The novel was serialised in Fayard&#x27;s magazine &quot;Ric et Rac&quot; later that year, and was the first fictional work to appear under Simenon&#x27;s real name.

The first Maigret novels were launched in book form by Fayard in February 1931 at the fancy dress &quot;bal anthropométrique&quot; which had a police and criminals theme. The launching party was widely reported and the novels received positive reviews. Simenon wrote 19 Maigret novels by the end of 1933, and the series eventually sold 500 million copies.

In April 1932, the Simenons and Boule moved to La Rochelle in south-west France. Soon after, they left for Africa where Simenon visited his brother, who was a colonial administrator in the Belgian Congo. Simenon also visited other African colonies and wrote a series of articles highly critical of colonialism. He drew on his African experience in novels such as &quot;Le&quot; &quot;Coup de Lune&quot; (&quot;Tropic Moon&quot;) (1933) and &quot;450 à l&#x27;ombre&quot; (&quot;Aboard the Aquitaine&quot;) (1936).

In 1933, the Simenons visited Germany and Eastern Europe, and Simenon secured an interview with Leon Trotsky in exile in Turkey for &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;. On his return, he announced that he would write no more Maigret novels, and signed a contract with the prestigious publisher Gallimard for his new work.

&quot;Maigret&quot;, written in June 1933, was intended to be the last of the series and ended with the detective in retirement. Simenon called the Maigret novels &quot;semi-literary&quot; and he wanted to establish himself as a serious writer. He stated his aim was to win the Nobel Prize for Literature by 1947.

Simenon&#x27;s notable novels of the 1930s, written after the temporary retirement of Maigret, include &quot;Le testament Donadieu&quot; (&quot;The Shadow Falls&quot;) (1937), &quot;L&#x27;homme qui regardait passer les trains&quot; (&quot;The Man who Watched the Trains Go By&quot;) (1938) and &quot;Le bourgmestre de Furnes&quot; (&quot;The Burgomaster of Furnes&quot;) (1939). André Gide and François Mauriac were among Simenon&#x27;s greatest literary admirers at the time.

In 1935, the Simenons undertook a world tour which included the Americas, the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Australia and India. They then moved back to Paris, to the fashionable Neuilly district, where they lived a life of luxury that Simenon later described as &quot;too sumptuous&quot;.

They moved home to La Rochelle in 1938 because, as Simenon later explained, &quot;I was sickened by the life I was leading.&quot; In April the following year Simenon&#x27;s first child, Marc, was born.

=== Second World War, 19391945 ===
Simenon was in a café in La Rochelle when France declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. In May 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, and La Rochelle became the reception centre for Belgian refugees. The Belgian government appointed Simenon Commissioner for Refugees, and he organised the reception, accommodation, and food and health needs for some 55,000 war refugees before the armistice of 22 June. By August, all Belgian refugees had been repatriated and Simenon resumed civilian life in his new home at Fontenay-le-Compte in the Vendée.

Later in 1940, a local doctor examined Simenon and diagnosed a serious heart illness, advising him to cut back on his favourite pastimes of pipe smoking, excessive eating, alcohol, and sex. Simenon began working on his memoirs &quot;Je me souviens&quot; (I remember), intended as a letter to his son from a father who would soon be dead. A second medical opinion was later sought, and Simenon was assured his heart was sound.

Simenon returned to writing Maigret stories and novels, completing two in 1940 and three in 1941. He also wrote longer novels such as &quot;Pedigree,&quot; a fictionalised reworking of &quot;Je me souviens&quot;. As a popular, non-Jewish author who avoided war themes and anti-German sentiments, Simenon had few problems in having his works published at a time of censorship and paper restrictions.

Among his major works written during the war years are &quot;La veuve Couderc&quot; (&quot;The Widow Couderc&quot;) (1942), &quot;Le fuite de M. Monde (Monsieur Monde Vanishes&quot;) (published 1945), and &quot;Pedigree&quot; (published 1948)&quot;.&quot; Simenon also conducted correspondence, most notably with André Gide. Gide considered &quot;La veuve Couderc&quot; superior to Camus&#x27; &quot;The Stranger&quot; which was published around the same time and has a similar main character and themes.

During the war, Simenon sold the film rights to five of his novels to Continental Films, which was funded by the German government and banned the participation of Jews. The Continental production of Simenon&#x27;s &quot;Les inconnus dans la maison&quot; (&quot;Strangers in the House&quot;) had exaggerated anti-Semitic themes which are not in the novel. Resistance underground newspapers began attacking Continental Films and anyone who took their money.

In 1942, the French &quot;Commissariat-Géneral aux Questions Juives&quot; notified Simenon that they suspected him of being Jewish and gave him one month to prove he wasn&#x27;t. Simenon was able to obtain the necessary certificates of birth and baptism through his mother, and soon after the Simenons moved to a more remote village in the Vendée.

In 1944, Régine discovered Simenon&#x27;s long-term affair with Boule, and Simenon also confessed to his numerous other affairs. The couple agreed to remain married for the sake of their child, but to give each other their sexual freedom.

In November 1944, following the German retreat, Simenon, Marc and Boule moved to a hotel in the resort town of Les Sables d&#x27;Olonne, while Régine returned to their house near La Rochelle which had now been evacuated by the Germans. In January 1945, Simenon was placed under house arrest by the police and the French Forces of the Interior on suspicion of collaboration. After three months of investigations, he was cleared of all charges.

Simenon went to Paris in May 1945 while Marc and Boule returned to their house near La Rochelle with Régine. Simenon, possibly out of concern that the French Communist Party might take over France, had decided to move to America. The rest of the family soon joined him in Paris and Simenon used his contacts to secure the required travel documents for America. Régine, however, refused to travel to America with Marc unless Boule stayed behind in France. Simenon reluctantly agreed to Régine&#x27;s demand.

==United States and Canada, 1945–1955==
The Simenons arrived in New York in October 1945 and soon moved to Canada, where they set up home at Ste-Marguerite du Lac Masson, north of Montreal. In November, Simenon met Denyse Ouimet, a 25-year-old French-Canadian, with whom he started an affair and hired as his secretary. Denyse moved into the Simenon home in January 1946, and several weeks later told Régine that she was his new lover. Simenon fictionalised his affair with Denyse in his novels &quot;Trois chambres à Manhattan&quot; (&quot;Three Bedrooms in Manhattan&quot;) (1947) and &quot;Lettre à mon juge&quot; (&quot;Act of Passion&quot;) (1947).

The Simenons and Denyse drove to Florida in the summer of 1946, and then visited Cuba in order to arrange for permanent residence visas for the United States. It was in Florida that Simenon wrote &quot;Lettre à mon juge&quot;, widely considered one of his major works.

In June 1947, the Simenons moved to Arizona. Boule joined them there in 1948, after Régine dropped her objections to Simenon&#x27;s desire to have a wife and two lovers in his household. Simenon continued to write quickly, working from 6 am to 9 am daily, and averaging 4,500 words a day. While in Arizona, Simenon wrote two Maigret novels and several &quot;romans durs&quot; (hard novels) including &quot;La neige était sale&quot; (&quot;The Snow Was Dirty&quot;) (1948), one of his major works. The 1951 American paperback edition of this novel sold 2 million copies.

Denyse became pregnant in early 1949, and Simenon asked Régine for a divorce. Denyse gave birth to Jean Dennis Chrétien Simenon (known as John) on 29 September. Régine had moved to California with Marc and Boule, and Simenon, Denyse and the baby soon moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea where they would be close to Marc. The divorce was granted in Nevada on 21 June 1950. Simenon married Denyse the following day.

The newly-weds moved to Lakeville, Connecticut and also rented a house in nearby Salmon Creek for Régine, Marc and Boule. In the five years he lived in Connecticut, Simenon wrote 13 Maigret novels and 14 &quot;romans durs&quot; including the major works &quot;La mort de Belle&quot; (&quot;Belle&quot;) (1952) and &quot;L&#x27;horloger d&#x27;Everton&quot; (&quot;The Watchmaker of Everton&quot;) (1954).

While living in Connecticut, Simenon&#x27;s book sales increased to an estimated 3 million a year, and he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America. Simenon and Denyse made two trips to Europe, in 1952 and 1954. On the 1952 trip, Simenon was admitted to the Royal Belgian Academy. In February 1953, Denyse gave birth to a daughter, Marie-Georges Simenon (known as Marie-Jo). By this time, Boule had moved in with Denyse and Simenon and had resumed her position as his lover.

By 1955, Simenon had become disillusioned with America and concerned that Denyse, who wanted to live in Europe, was becoming more distant from him. In March, Simenon, Denyse and Boule left for a European holiday and were never to return to live in America.

==Return to Europe, 1955–1989==
The Simenons took up residence in France at Mougins, near Cannes, while Régine and Marc lived in a hotel nearby. Simenon wrote two Maigret novels and two &quot;romans durs&quot; during his first six months on the French Riviera, but was still searching for a permanent home. In July 1957, the Simenons and Boule moved to the Château d&#x27;Echandens near Lausanne, Switzerland, and were to remain there for seven years.

In May 1959, Denyse gave birth to a son, Pierre, who soon became seriously ill but survived a difficult first year. In December 1961, Simenon and Denyse employed Teresa Sburelin, a young Italian woman, as a maid. Teresa soon became Simenon&#x27;s lover and was to remain his companion for the rest of his life.

Simenon continued to produce novels at a rate of three to five a year at Enchandens, including two of his most notable, &quot;Le président&quot; (&quot;The Premier&quot;) (1958) and &quot;Les anneaux de Bicêtre&quot; (&quot;The Patient&quot;) (1963).

However, the relationship between Denyse and Simenon was deteriorating. They were both drinking heavily and Simenon admitted that he had hit her. In June 1962 Denyse was persuaded to admit herself to a mental health clinic for several months. In 1961 the Simenons had decided to build a new house at Epalinges in the heights above Lausanne. The house was completed in December 1963, but Denyse lived there for only a few months before returning to the clinic.

Denyse left Epalinges for the last time in April 1964. In November Simenon dismissed Boule, who went to live with Marc, who was now married with children.

Although Simenon never divorced Denyse, he was now living with his companion, Teresa, and three of his children: John, Marie-Jo, and Pierre. He continued to work steadily, completing three to four books a year from 1965 to 1971, including the important works &quot;Le petit saint&quot; (The Little Saint) (1965) and &quot;Le chat&quot; (The Cat) (1967).

In February 1973 Simenon announced that he was retiring from writing. A few months later he and Teresa moved into a small house in Lausanne. He produced no new fiction from that date, but he dictated 21 volumes of memoirs.

In May 1978 Simenon&#x27;s daughter, Marie-Jo, killed herself in Paris at the age of 25. In his final volume of memoirs, &quot;Mémoires intimes&quot; (&quot;Intimate memoirs&quot;) (1981), he wrote, &quot;One never recovers from the loss of a daughter one has cherished. It leaves a void that nothing can fill.&quot;

Simenon underwent a brain operation in 1984 but made a full recovery. From late 1988 he was confined to a wheelchair. He died on 4 September 1989, following a fall.

==Works and critical reception==
Simenon&#x27;s published works include 192 novels written under his own name, over 200 novels written under various pseudonyms, four autobiographies and 21 volumes of memoirs. He also wrote a large quantity of short fiction. His novels had sold over 500 million copies by the time of his death, making him one of the highest selling novelists in history. In 2008, The Times named Simenon the second greatest crime writer of all time after Patricia Highsmith.

Simenon&#x27;s fiction is often classified into his early pseudonymous popular novels, the last of which was written in 1933; his fiction featuring police commissioner Jules Maigret (75 novels and 28 short stories); and his 117 literary novels which he called &quot;romans durs&quot; (&quot;hard novels&quot;).

=== Maigret novels ===

The first Maigret novel published under Simenon&#x27;s name was &quot;Pietr-le-Letton&quot; (&quot;Pietr the Latvian&quot;) which was serialised in 1930. The last Maigret novel was &quot;Maigret et M. Charles&quot; (&quot;Maigret and Monsieur Charles&quot;) published in 1972.

The early Maigret novels generally received positive reviews and were acknowledged as an attempt to raise the standard of the French crime novel. Several critics, however, made fun of the speed with which they were written. &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot; told its readers, &quot;Monsieur Georges Simenon makes his living by killing someone every month and then discovering the murderer.&quot;The Maigret stories are short and characterised by their simple writing style and a deliberately restricted vocabulary (which Simenon estimated was limited to 2000 words). Simenon stated that his Maigret novels were designed to be read by people of average education in a single sitting.

Patrick Marnham, Scott Bradfield and others state that the early Maigrets were innovative because the detective doesn&#x27;t hunt for clues or use deduction to find the guilty party, but rather immerses himself in the life and environment of the victim and suspected criminal. In most cases, Maigret seeks to understand the criminal rather than judge him.

Simenon stated that his Maigret stories often deal with more serious themes than those of his other novels. Recurrent themes include political influence over the justice system, snobbery and class divisions, and the role of social background and pure chance in determining whether an individual becomes a criminal or a respected member of society.

Marnham, Fenton Besler and others have pointed out that the plots of the Maigret novels are often implausible and internally inconsistent. However critics have praised Simenon&#x27;s ability to evoke concisely the atmosphere of a particular place and to provide insights into human psychology. Referring to &quot;The Saint-Fiacre Affair&quot;, John Banville wrote, &quot;The story is silly, as usual, but the evocation of the little town and its people makes such considerations irrelevant.&quot;

=== &quot;Romans durs&quot; (&quot;hard novels&quot;) ===
Simenon suspended his writing of Maigret stories in 1933 in order to concentrate on the literary novels he called &quot;romans durs&quot;. In 1937 he stated that his aim was to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1947.

Simenon defined the novel as, &quot;a passion which completely possesses and enslaves the writer and permits him to exorcise his demons by giving them form and casting them out into the world.&quot; His novels were about &quot;the naked man, the one who looks at himself in the mirror while shaving and has no illusions about himself.&quot;

Michel Lemoine has elaborated on this, stating, &quot;There is hardly a character in all the Simenon canon who does not ask, &#x27;Who am I? What have I done with my life?&quot;Biographer Fenton Besler described the &quot;roman durs&quot; as &quot;psychological thrillers...in which he explores the darkest corners of the human mind and, in tautly written prose, creates an atmosphere which is sinister and entirely his own.&quot; According to Besler, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether Simenon&#x27;s novels are set in France, Africa, Tahiti or America, the characters live the same traumas and despair, only &quot;with their problems and anxieties accentuated by the local setting.&quot;

Biographer Patrick Marnham states that Simenon&#x27;s earliest &quot;romans durs&quot; contain many of Simenon&#x27;s typical themes: the street life of Paris, prostitution, the drudgery of domestic servants and shop assistants, police corruption and the hope of escape represented by railway stations. He compares Simenon&#x27;s preoccupation with the &quot;little people&quot; with that of Balzac. According to Marnham, there is also a strong autobiographical strain in his fiction, where events which Simenon had experienced were lightly fictionalised and then taken to a social, criminal or psychological extreme.

Simenon&#x27;s &quot;romans durs&quot; soon gained a high reputation among other writers, with Max Jacob, François Mauriac and André Gide among his admirers. Nevertheless, the academic and critical reception of his novels in France and the United States was mixed, which Ralph Ingersoll, Brendan Gill and Gilbert Sigaux have attributed to suspicion about their popularity and the speed with which they were written.

Simenon&#x27;s most acclaimed novels include &quot;Monsieur Hire&#x27;s Engagement&quot; (1933), &quot;The Man who Watched the Trains Go By&quot; (1938), &quot;Monsieur Monde Vanishes (1945), Act of Passion (1947),&quot; &quot;The Snow was Dirty&quot; (1948), &quot;Red Lights&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Little Saint&quot; (1967).

The novels were selected by Professor Jacques Dubois, President of the Centre for Georges Simenon Studies at the Université de Liège, and his assistant Benoît Denis, both experts on Simenon.

<text>François Marcellin Certain de Canrobert (; born François Certain Canrobert; 27 June 1809 – 28 January 1895) was a French Marshal. He demonstrated ability during the Second French Empire while participating in the Battle of Alma, the Battle of Magenta, the Battle of Solferino and the Battle of Gravelotte. A staunch supporter of Napoleon III, he became, under the French Third Republic, one of the leading figures in the Bonapartist party () and chairman, from 1876 to 1894, of the Senate () within the French parliamentary group &quot;Call upon the people&quot; ().

== Biography ==
=== Family background ===
François Certain de Canrobert was born in Saint-Céré in Lot, where a statue (1897) in his effigy was erected in &quot;place de la République&quot; due to Alfred Lenoir.

At his birth, his father, Antoine Certain Canrobert, a former captain, was already 55 years old. This officer of the Ancien Regime had emigrated in 1791 and served against the French republic in the Armée de Condé (). His half-brother, Antoine, a brilliant officer and graduate of Saint-Cyr, was killed by a cannonball at the Battle of Ligny () on 16 June 1815, while fighting for Emperor Napoleon I.

Through his father’s sister, Marie-Louise, François Certain de Canrobert was the cousin of Adolphe and Marcellin Marbot, who became respectively maréchal de camp (général de brigade) and lieutenant-général (général de division) during the July Monarchy of 1830–1848.

=== Early military career ===
On 19 November 1826, aged 17, Canrobert entered the École Royale spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr where he was designated as a caporal (corporal) on 18 May 1828. At his graduation, he was posted to the 47th Line Infantry Regiment () (RIL), with the rank of Sous-lieutenant starting 1 October. He served until 1840 and was promoted to lieutenant on 20 January 1832.

=== North Africa ===
In 1835 he arrived with his unit in Algeria, where he engaged in combat on the edges of Oued Sig and Habra. In 1836 he fought in actions at Dar el Achen, Tafna, Sidi Yacoub, La Silal and Bet el Laham.

He was designated as Lieutenant Adjudant Major on 28 September 1836. On 26 April 1837 he was promoted to captain and occupied the function of Captain Adjudant Major. He took part in the combat of Medjeoly-Amar and the Siege of Constantine () where, as an assistant to colonel Michel Combes (), he was wounded; at the age of 27, Canrobert earned the Knight Cross of the Legion d&#x27;honneur.

He was assigned to the 6th Chasseurs Battalion à Pied (), on 17 October 1840. He took part in the battle of col de Mouzaïa in 1840 (). In the following year, he participated in actions at de Nador, de Moursia and confronted the Flittas. Designated as chef de bataillon (commandant – major) on 22 May 1842, he joined the 13th Light Infantry Regiment (). On 16 October he transferred to the 5th Chasseurs Battalion à Pied (), where he gained the Officer Order of the Legion d&#x27;honneur while demonstrating combat capability at Gontas, Baal, Tadjena, Battle of Sidi Brahim (), then near Oued Lemig, during the combat Isly and at Riou.

Promoted lieutenant-colonel on 26 October 1845, he was assigned to the 16th Line Infantry Regiment () on 4 September. On 8 June 1847 he was assigned to the 2nd Line Infantry Regiment () and commanded the subdivision of Batna.

=== Transfer to the Legion ===
Promoted to colonel, on 8 November, he was assigned to the 78th Line Infantry Regiment (), which he left on 31 March 1848 to take up the functions of regimental commander of the 2nd Foreign Legion Regiment 2ème R.E.L.E, while simultaneously maintaining the subdivision of Batna. With this unit, he took on Ahmed Bey ().

In June he substituted for colonel Jean-François de Cariés de Senilhes () and took command of the 3rd Zouaves Regiment () and the subdivision of Sour El-Ghozlane. In 1849 he was in Beni Mélikech, Sameur, Al Amri. Then he commanded at the battle of Zaatcha (), earning the Commander Neck Order of the Legion d&#x27;honneur on 10 December.

=== General of the Second Empire ===
Recalled to France by the Prince-President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, he was designated as maréchal de camp (général de brigade) starting 12 January 1850. He was nominated as commandant of the infantry brigade of the 1st Division of Paris, on 8 March 1850, then to the command of the 3rd Brigade on 9 February 1851; he contributed to the success in Paris of the French coup d&#x27;état of 1851. In the afternoon of 4 December 1851, on the Boulevards Montmarte and Poissonnière, the soldiers of the Division commanded by Canrobert came into contact with a crowd formed of the curious and protestors. In a certain confusion, the soldiers opened fire, causing 100–300 deaths and hundreds of wounded. On the night of 4 December the Parisian resistance to the coup collapsed, with 300 to 400 civilians killed. While two-thirds of the protestors comprised workers, amongst them also featured the innocent and curious, victims of the division of Canrobert on the grand boulevards. In all France, 26,884 people were arrested, essentially in the South-East, the South-West and a couple of departments in the Center. Almost 21,000 people were condemned by mixed commissions (composed in each department by prefects, a general, and a magistrate) out of which 9,530 ended in transportation to Algeria and 239 were sent to Cayenne in Guiana. On the other hand and quite quickly, all pronounced repression measures declared by the 82 mixed commissions worried President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who delegated in extraordinary mission, generals Canrobert, Espinasse, and State Council Quentin Bauchart, in order to revise the arrest decisions taken and to prepare acts of &quot;grâce&quot; (forgiving the condemned by mercy). Espinasse and Canrobert, placed in charge of the South-West and Languedoc, showed little indulgence towards the condemned, they both accorded a little more than a thousand acts of forgiveness, while State Counselor Quentin-Bauchart, charged with the South-East, accorded alone 3,400 forgiveness sentences, while Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in his own right forgave numerous condemnations.

Following these events Canrobert gained the function of aide de camp to the Prince-President, and later to the Emperor. Promoted Général de division on 14 January 1853, he commanded the infantry division at camp Helfaut-Saint Omer, as of 27 April. In May he became the inspector general of the 5th Infantry Arrondissement for the year 1853 before being designated to the infantry division of the Orient Army on 23 February 1854.

=== Crimea ===
As Général de division, he participated to the Crimean War of 1853–1856 and became commander in chief after Marshal Saint-Arnaud, who died in September 1854. He took part in action at Dobruja (July 1854) and in the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854), where he was slightly wounded. He was elevated to the Grand Officer Order of the Legion d&#x27;honneur on 1 October. Present at the Battle of Balaclava (25 October 1854) and the Battle of Inkerman, he was wounded during the course of the latter, on 5 November 1854. He was accordingly promoted to the Order of the Grand-Croix of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. On 13 January 1855, he received the Medaille Militaire.

Judged too timorous, he was relieved by general Aimable Pélissier (16 May 1855). He accordingly reassumed command of his former division, which became the 1st Infantry Division of the 2nd Corps. This situation having become difficult, Napoleon III insisted that Canrobert return to France. After several refusals, in August 1855 Canrobert returned to Paris to take up his functions as aide de camp.

His disputes with Lord Raglan, general of the British Army, obliged him to relinquish his command. On 18 March 1856, he was elevated to the dignity of Marshal of France.

=== Italy ===
In February 1858 he commanded the division of the East at Nancy, then the Camp de Châlons, starting from 1 June 1858. On 22 April 1859 he received the command of the 3rd Army Corps of the Alpes and participated in the campaign of Italy from April to July, passing by Turin, Dorial, Balba, Magenta and Solferino. He distinguished himself during the Battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) and was a major contributor to the victory at the Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859.

=== France ===
He then joined the garrison at Nancy with his army corps. He became commandant of the 3rd Military Arrondissement at Nancy, on 27 August. In 1862 he commanded the troops of the Camp de Châlons, then took command of the 4th Army Corps at Lyon, starting in October. On 22 June 1856 he commanded the 1st Army Corps of the 1st Military Division of Paris.

=== 1870–1871 ===
Following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War on 19 July 1870, on 12 August 1870, Canrobert declined to take command of the Army of the Rhine, petrified by the responsibilities which would ensue. Abandoning the post to Bazaine, Canrobert became an obedient subordinate. He took part in the battles of Sainte-Barbe, Noisseville and Landonchamps. On 16/18 August, he commanded the 6th Army Corps and demonstrated distinguished capability at Saint-Privat where he shook three corps of Général von Steinmetz and decimated the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Prussian Guard (). However, due to a mistake in the supply of ammunition and reinforcements, he abandoned his position. He was made prisoner – with Marshal Bazaine – during the surrender of Metz on 28 October 1870. Following several months in captivity, he was liberated and returned to France in March 1871.

== End of his military career and political career ==
He was then named President of the infantry promotion commission, a member of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre in 1872, and a member of the defense committee in 1873. He led a political career in the Bonapartist &quot;Call upon the people&quot; group (), being elected Senator for Lot in 1876 and for Charente in 1879, a function which he held until 1894. His senate colleague Victor Hugo would not be tender for him: J&#x27;ai vu Canrobert au Sénat. Caboche de reître. Méchant, mais bête (Victor Hugo: &quot;I saw Canrobert in the Senate. Roughneck soldier&#x27;s head. Mean, but thick).

Close to President-Marshal Duke de Mac Mahon, he voted for the June 1877 dissolution of the Chamber and supported the short-lived Government of Albert de Broglie (). In 1873, he represented the French Government at the funeral of King Victor Emmanuel II. A well-known figure of the Bonapartist Party, his participation in the political debates was mainly focused on military issues. He generally voted on the conservative side, most notably against bills on education, against judicial reforms, against the expulsion of the princes and against divorce, abstaining on the return to voting by district and on the press freedom restriction bill.

&quot;&quot; of the Marshals of France of his time, he attended the funeral of President-Marshal Duke de Mac-Mahon and was saluted by Russian Admiral Avellane on behalf of the Russian Emperor (). This was his last public official appearance. He died in his Parisian home, on 28 January 1895. His funeral was celebrated on Sunday, 3 February 1895, at the Church of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides where he was buried. Amiral Henri Rieunier, Ministère de la Marine, was designated to hold one of the five cordons of the funeral chariot.

He owned the Eglantine Castle in Jouy-en-Josas, which since 1991 houses the Musée de la toile de Jouy.

<text>Leonardo Torres Quevedo (; 28 December 1852 – 18 December 1936) was a Spanish civil engineer, mathematician and inventor, known for his numerous engineering innovations, including aerial trams, airships, catamarans, and remote control. He was also a pioneer in the field of computing and robotics. Torres was a member of several scientific and cultural institutions and held such important positions as the seat &quot;N&quot; of the Real Academia Española (1920–1936) and the presidency of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences (1928–1934). In 1927 he became a foreign associate of the French Academy of Sciences.

His first groundbreaking invention was a cable car system patented in 1887 for the safe transportation of people, an activity that culminated in 1916 when the Whirlpool Aero Car was opened in Niagara Falls. In the 1890s, Torres focused his efforts on analog computation. He published &quot;Sur les machines algébriques&quot; (1895) and &quot;Machines à calculer&quot; (1901), technical studies that gave him recognition in France for his construction of machines to solve real and complex roots of polynomials. He made significant aeronautical contributions at the beginning of the 20th century, becoming the inventor of the non-rigid Astra-Torres airships, a trilobed structure that helped the British and French armies counter Germany&#x27;s submarine warfare during World War I. These tasks in dirigible engineering led him to be a key figure in the development of radio control systems in 1901–05 with the &quot;Telekine&quot;, which he laid down modern wireless remote-control operation principles.

From his Laboratory of Automation created in 1907, Torres invented one of his greatest technological achievements, El Ajedrecista (The Chess Player) of 1912, an electromagnetic device capable of playing a limited form of chess that demonstrated the capability of machines to be programmed to follow specified rules (heuristics) and marked the beginnings of research into the development of artificial intelligence. He advanced beyond the work of Charles Babbage in his 1914 paper &quot;Essays on Automatics&quot;, where he speculated about thinking machines and included the design of a special-purpose electromechanical calculator, introducing concepts still relevant like floating-point arithmetic. British historian Brian Randell called it &quot;a fascinating work which well repays reading even today&quot;. Subsequently, Torres demonstrated the feasibility of an electromechanical analytical engine by successfully producing a typewriter-controlled calculating machine in 1920.

He conceived other original designs before his retirement in 1930, some of the most notable were in naval architecture projects, such as the &quot;Buque campamento&quot; (Camp-Vessel, 1913), a balloon carrier for transporting airships attached to a mooring mast of his creation, and the &quot;Binave&quot; (Twin Ship, 1916), a multihull steel vessel driven by two propellers powered by marine engines. In addition to his interests in engineering, Torres also stood out in the field of letters and was a prominent speaker and supporter of Esperanto.

==Early life and education==

Torres was born on 28 December 1852, on the Feast of the Holy Innocents, in Santa Cruz de Iguña, Cantabria, Spain. His father, Luis Torres Vildósola y Urquijo (1818–1891), was a civil engineer in Bilbao, where he worked as a railway engineer. His mother was Valentina Quevedo de la Maza (1825–1891). He had two siblings, Joaquina (b. 1851) and Luis (b. 1855). The family resided for the most part in Bilbao, although they also spent long periods in his mother&#x27;s family home in Cantabria&#x27;s mountain region. During his childhood, he spent long periods of time separated from his parents due to work trips. As a result, he was cared by relatives of his father, the Barrenechea sisters, who declared him heir to their property, which facilitated his future independence.

He studied high school in Bilbao and later went to Paris, to the college of the Christian Brothers, to complete studies for two years (1868 and 1869), where he met French culture, customs, and language and that in later years it would help him in his scientific-technical relationships with personalities, and scientific institutions. In 1870, his father was transferred, bringing his family to Madrid. The following year, Torres began his higher studies in the . He temporarily suspended his studies in 1873 to volunteer along with his brother Luis for the defense of Bilbao, which had been surrounded by Carlist troops during the Third Carlist War. Once the siege of Bilbao was lifted in 1874, he returned to Madrid and completed his studies in 1876, graduating fourth in his class.

==Career==

Torres began to work as a civil engineer for a few months on railway projects as his father did, but his curiosity and desire to learn led him to give up joining the Corps to dedicate himself in &quot;thinking about my things&quot;. As a young entrepreneur who had inherited a considerable family fortune, he immediately set out on a long trip through Europe in 1877, visiting Italy, France and Switzerland, to know the scientific and technical advances of the day, especially in the incipient area of electricity. Returning to Spain, he settled in Santander, where he continued his self-supported research activities.

===Cableways===
Torres&#x27; experimentation in the field of cableways and cable cars began very early during his residence in the town of his birth, Molledo. There, in 1885, he constructed the first cableway to span a depression of some . The cableway was about across and transported a single person who was sitting in a chair hanging from a cable and had another traction cable. The engine used to move the human load was a pair of cows. Later, in 1887, he would build a cableway over the Río León in , much bigger and motorized, but which was intended only for transporting materials.

These experiments were the basis for his first patent application on 17 September 1887, in Spain, &quot;&quot; (&quot;A multi-wire suspended aerial system&quot;), for a cable car with which he obtained a level of safety suitable for the transport of people, not only cargo. The patent was extended to other countries: United States, Austria, Germany, France, United Kingdom, and Italy. His cable car used a novel multi-cable support system, in which one end of a cable is anchored to fixed counterweights and the other (through a system of pulleys) to mobile counterweights. With this system the axial force of the cables via is constant and equal to the weight of the counterweight, regardless of the load in the shuttle. What will vary with this load is the deflection of the via cables, which will increase by raising the counterweight. Thus, the safety coefficient of these cables is perfectly known, and is independent of the shuttle load. The resulting design is very strong and remains safe in case of a support cable failure.

In April 1889 Torres presented his cableway in Switzerland, a place very interested in this means of transport due to its geography, between Pilatus-Kulm and Pilatus-Klimsenhorn (Mount Pilatus). It was an aerial funicular with a length of 2 km and a gradient of 300 m. In 1890 he traveled to that country to convince different authorities of its construction. He failed to convince the Swiss, who did not grant any reliability to the work of a Spanish engineer, and even the newspapers &quot;Nebelspalter&quot; and &quot;Eulm Spiegel&quot; published articles and satirical drawings about the project. This disappointment, known as the &quot;Swiss failure&quot;, led him to focus on other fields for several years. On 30 September 1907, Torres put into operation a pioneer cableway suitable for public transportation, the in San Sebastián. The journey was 280 meters, with a drop of 28 meters, lasted for just over three minutes, and the gondola had the capacity to board up to 18 people on each trip. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which was established in 1906 by Valentín Gorbeña Ayarragaray, one of his closest friends, with the sole purpose of developing or marketing Torres&#x27; patents. The Ulia cable car transported passengers until its closure in 1917.

The successful result of this type of cable car gave him the opportunity to design the Spanish Aerocar based on J. Enoch Thompson&#x27;s idea at Niagara Falls in Canada. The cableway of 550 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side. It travels at about . The load per cable via is , with a safety coefficient for the cables of 4.6. and carries 35 standing passengers over a one-kilometre trip. It was constructed between 1914 and 1916. For its construction and assembly, the Niagara Spanish Aerocar Company Limited was set up from the Society of Engineering Studies and Works, with a capital of $110,000 (roughly $ million in ), and a planned concession of 20 years. The construction was directed by Torres&#x27; son, Gonzalo Torres Polanco. It completed its first tests on 15 February in 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August, opening to the public the following day. The cableway, with small modifications, runs to this day with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.

The Aero Car is believed to be the sole remaining example of Torres&#x27; design for an aerial ferry. Although constructed and operated in Canada, it was a Spanish project from beginning to end: designed by a Spaniard and constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital. In 1991, the Niagara Parks Commission received the on the 75th anniversary of the Aero Car, in recognition of its commitment to preserving Torres&#x27; design. A plaque, mounted on a boulder in front of Aero Car Gift Shop recalls this fact: &quot;International Historic Civil Engineering Site. The Niagara Spanish Aerocar.

===Analogue calculating machines===

Since the middle of the 19th century, several mechanical devices were known, including integrators, multipliers, etc. The work of Torres in this matter is framed within this tradition, which began in 1893 with the presentation of the &quot;Memória sobre las máquinas algébricas&quot; (&quot;Memory about algebraic machines&quot;) at the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid. This paper was commented in a report by Eduardo Saavedra in 1894 and published in the . Saavedra, who considered Torres&#x27; calculating machine as &quot;an extraordinary event in the course of Spanish scientific production&quot;, recommended that the final project of the device be financed.

In 1895 Torres presented &quot;Sur les machines algébriques&quot;, accompanied by a demonstration model, at the Bordeaux Congress of the &quot;Association pour l&#x27;Avancement des Sciences&quot;, and in Paris in the &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot;. Later on, in 1900, he presented a more detailed work, &quot;Machines à calculer&quot; (&quot;Calculating machines&quot;) at the Paris Academy of Sciences. The commission formed by Marcel Deprez, Henri Poincaré and Paul Appell, asked the academy for its publication, where they reported favorably: &quot;In Mécanique analytique, Joseph-Louis Lagrange considers material systems whose connections are expressed by relationships between the coordinates or parameters used to define the position of the system. We can, and this is what Mr. Torres does, take the opposite point of view.&quot; Concluding: &quot;In short, Mr. Torres has given a theoretical, general and complete solution to the problem of the construction of algebraic and transcendental relations by means of machines; moreover, he has effectively constructed machines that are easy to use for the solution of certains types of algebraic equations that are frequently encountered in applications.&quot;

These works examined mathematical and physical analogies that underlay analogue calculation or continuous quantities, and how to establish mechanically the relationships between them, expressed in mathematical formulae. The study included complex variables and used the logarithmic scale. From a practical standpoint, it showed that mechanisms such as turning disks could be used endlessly with precision, so that changes in variables were unlimited in both directions. Torres developed a whole series of analogue mechanical calculating machines that used certain elements known as &quot;arithmophores&quot;, which consisted of a moving part and an index that made it possible to read the quantity according to the position shown thereon. The aforesaid moving part was a graduated disk or a drum turning on an axis. The angular movements were proportional to the logarithms of the magnitudes to be represented. Between 1910 and 1920, using a number of such elements, Torres built a machine that was able to compute the roots of arbitrary polynomials of order eight, including the complex ones, with a precision down to thousandths. This machine could calculated the equation:
formula_1 where &quot;X&quot; is the variable and &quot;A1&quot; ... &quot;A8&quot; is the coefficient of each term. Considering the case of α = 1, it becomes the following formula, and the root of the algebraic equation can be obtained:
formula_2

By calculated each term on a logarithmic scale, they can be calculated only by sums and products like &quot;A1&quot; + &quot;a&quot; × log(&quot;X&quot;), which can handle a very wide range of values, and the relative error during calculation is constant regardless of the size of the value. However, to calculate the sum of each term, it is necessary to accurately obtain log(u + v) from the calculated values log(u) and log(v) on a logarithmic scale. For this calculation, Torres invented a unique mechanism called the &quot;endless spindle&quot; (&quot;fusee sans fin&quot;), a complex differential gear using a helical gear shaped like a wine bottle, which allowed the mechanical expression of the relation formula_3. Putting log(u) – log(v) = log(u/v) = V, then u/v = 10 V, and the following formula is used to calculate log(u + v): 
formula_4, the same technique which is the basis of the modern electronic logarithmic number system.

Torres devised another machine around 1900 with a small computing using gears and linkages to obtain the complex number solution of the quadratic equation X2 – pX + q = 0. Nowadays, all these machines are kept in the Torres Quevedo Museum at the School of Civil Engineering of the Technical University of Madrid.

===Aerostatics===
In 1902, Torres started the project of a new type of dirigible that would solve the serious problem of suspending the gondola. He applied for a patent in France wrote &quot;Note sur le calcul d’un ballon dirigeable a quille et suspentes interieures&quot; (&quot;Note on the calculus of a dirigible balloon with interior suspension and keel&quot;), and presented both to Madrid and Paris’ Academies of Science. By the end of that year the report at Paris&#x27;s Academy of Science was included in the French journal &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot;, and an English-language summary was published in the British &quot;The Aeronautical Journal&quot;.

In 1904, Torres was appointed director of the Centre for Aeronautical Research in Madrid, a civil institution created by the government of Spain &quot;for the technical and experimental study of the air navigation problem and the management of remote engine maneuvers.&quot; From March 1905, with Army Engineer Captain Alfredo Kindelán as Technical Assistant, he supervised the construction of the first Spanish dirigible in the Army Military Aerostatics Service, located in Guadalajara, which was completed in June 1908. The new airship, named &quot;Torres Quevedo&quot; in his honour, made successful test flights with passengers in the gondola. Despite this, in 1907 and 1909 he had requested an improved patent for his airship in France. He moved all the material to a rented hangar in Sartrouville (Paris), beginning a collaboration with the Société Astra, a new Aeronautical Society integrated in the conglomerate of French petroleum businessman Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe and directed by Édouard Surcouf, who had been familiar with Torres&#x27; work since 1901. The Astra company managed to buy the patent with a cession of rights extended to all countries except Spain, making the use of said system free in the country. In 1911, the construction of dirigibles known as the Astra-Torres airships was begun and Torres would receive royalties of 3 francs for every m3 of each airship sold. 
In 1910, Torres also drew up designs for a ‘docking station’ to find a solution to the slew of problems faced by airship engineers in docking dirigibles. He proposed the idea of attaching an airship&#x27;s nose to a mooring mast and allowing the airship to weathervane with changes of wind direction. The use of a metal column erected on the ground, the top of which the bow or stem would be directly attached to (by a cable) would allow a dirigible to be moored at any time, in the open, regardless of wind speeds. Torres&#x27; design also called for the improvement and accessibility of temporary landing sites, where airships were to be moored for the purpose of disembarkation of passengers. The patent was presented in February 1911 in Belgium, and later to France and the United Kingdom in 1912, which he named &quot;Improvements in Mooring Arrengements for Airships&quot;. Mooring mast structure following his design became widely utilised as it allowed an unprecedented accessibility to dirigibles, eliminating the manhandling required when placing an airship in its hangar.

In Issy-les-Moulineaux (south-west of Paris) in February 1911, the trials of ‘Astra-Torres no.1’ were successful, with a volume of 1590m³ and a speed of up to 53 km/h. Other Astra-Torres dirigibles followed, including the Astra-Torres XIV (HMA.No 3 to the Royal Naval Air Service), which broke the then world speed record for airships in September 1913 by reaching 83.2 km/h, and the &quot;Pilâtre de Rozier&quot; (Astra-Torres XV) named after the aerostier Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier, which at 24,300 m3 was the same size of the German ‘Zeppelins’ and could reach speeds of around 85 km/h. The distinctive trilobed design was also employed in the United Kingdom in the Coastal, C Star, and North Sea airships. The Entente powers used these dirigibles during the First World War (1914–1918) for diverse tasks, principally to the escort of convoys, the continuous surveillance of coasts and the search, from bases in Marseille, Tunisia and Algeria, for German submarines in the Bay of Biscay, the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea.

In 1919, Torres designed, based on a proposal from engineer Emilio Herrera Linares, a transatlantic dirigible, which was named &quot;Hispania&quot;, aiming to claim the honour of the first transatlantic flight for Spain. Owing to financial problems, the project was finally not carried out. The success of the trilobed blimps during the war even drew the attention of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1922, who acquired the Nieuport AT-2 with almost 263 ft long, maximum diameter 54 ft and with a hydrogen capacity of 363,950 ft 3. This type of non-rigid airship continued to be manufactured in various countries during the post war era, especially those by the French Zodiac Company which influenced the design of most later dirigibles.

===Radio control: the &quot;Telekino&quot;===

Torres was a pioneer in remote control technology. He began to develop a radio control system around 1901 or 1902, as a way of testing his airships without risking human lives. Between 1902 and 1903, he applied for patents in France, Spain, and Great Britain, under the name &quot;Systéme dit Télékine pour commander à distance un mouvement mécanique&quot; (&quot;Means or method for directing mechanical movements at or from a distance&quot;).

On 3 August 1903, he presented the &quot;Telekino&quot; at the French Academy of Sciences, together with a detailed memory, and making a practical demonstration to its members. For the construction of this first model, Torres received help from Gabriel Koenigs, director of the Mechanics Laboratory of the Sorbonne, and Octave Rochefort, who collaborated by providing wireless telegraphy devices.

In 1904 Torres chose to conduct initial &quot;Telekino&quot; testings in the Beti Jai fronton of Madrid, which became the temporary headquarters of the Centre for Aeronautical Research, first in an electric three-wheeled land vehicle with an effective range of just 20 to 30 meters, which has been considered the first known example of a radio-controlled unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In 1905, Torres tested a second model of the &quot;Telekino&quot; remotely controlling the maneuvers of the electrically powered boat &quot;Vizcaya&quot; in the pond of the Casa de Campo in Madrid, achieving distances of up to about 250 m from the terrace of the Club Marítimo del Abra, and with the assistance of the president of the Provincial Council and other authorities. Witness to the success of these tests, José Echegaray highlighted how &quot;no one moves&quot; the Telekino, &quot;it moves automatically.&quot; It was an automaton of &quot;a certain intelligence, not conscious, but disciplined&quot;; &quot;a material device, without intelligence, interpreting, as if it were intelligent, the instructions communicated to it in a succession of Hertzian waves.&quot; These feats were also echoed in the international press.

On 25 September 1906, in the presence of the king Alfonso XIII and before a great crowd, Torres successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding the boat &quot;Vizcaya&quot; from the shore with people on board, demonstrating a standoff range of 2 km. By applying the &quot;Telekino&quot; to electrically powered vessels, he was able to select different positions for the steering engine and different velocities for the propelling engine independently. He was also able to act over other mechanisms such a light, for switching on or off, and a flag, for raising or dropping it, at the same time. Specifically, Torres was able to do up to 19 different actions with his prototypes. The positive results of those experiences encouraged Torres to apply the Spanish government for the financial aid required to use his &quot;Telekino&quot; to steer submarine torpedoes, a technological field which was just starting out. His application was denied, which caused him to abandon the improvement of the &quot;Telekino&quot;.

On 15 March 2007, the prestigious Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) dedicated a Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing to the &quot;Telekino&quot;, based on the research work developed at Technical University of Madrid by Prof. Antonio Pérez Yuste, who was the driving force behind the Milestone nomination.

===Formal language===

In 1907, Torres introduced a formal language for the description of mechanical drawings, and thus for mechanical devices, in Vienna. He previously published &quot;Sobre un sistema de notaciones y símbolos destinados a facilitar la descripción de las máquinas&quot; (&quot;System of notations and symbols intended to facilitate the description of the machines&quot;) in the &quot;Revista de Obras Públicas&quot;. According to the Austrian computer scientist Heinz Zemanek, this was equivalent to a programming language for the numerical control of machine tools. He defined a table of symbols, a collection of rules and, as usual in his works, applied them to an example. This symbolic language reveals Torres&#x27; main capacities, both his ability to detect a problem, in this case a social problem of origin and its technical consequences, as well as his capacity for creation – invention – to give a rational, properly technical response. In the words of Torres: &quot;Charles Babbage and Franz Reuleaux – and I suppose others as well, although I don&#x27;t have news of them – have tried, without any success, to put remedy to this inconvenience; but although these eminent authors have failed, should not be a sufficient reason to abandon such an important effort&quot;. Babbage, Reuleaux and Torres failed. The world of machines continues without any other symbolic language than descriptive geometry.

===Laboratory of Automation===

As a member of the steering committee of the (JAE) established in 1907 in Madrid to promote research and scientific education in Spain, Torres played a leading role in the creation of three key state agencies that were the models for the JAE&#x27;s support to research, regardless of the discipline: the Laboratory of Automation (1907) – of which he was named director, the construction of instruments – the Laboratories Association (1910) – the union of state laboratories and workshops – and the Institute of Science Materials (1911) – the budget allocation.

The Laboratory of Automation produced the most varied instruments; it not only built its own inventions, but also provided services and support to universities and researchers of the JAE. Torres, the physicist Blas Cabrera, and Juan Costa, the head of the workshop, jointly designed several scientific instruments (Weiss-type electromagnet, an X-ray spectrometer, a mechanism to handle through remote control a Bunge scale, a reservoir of variable height with micrometer movements for magnetic-chemical measurements, and some on). , head of the Spectroscopy Section of the Laboratory of Physical Research and Miguel A. Catalán’s teacher, ordered Torres&#x27;s workshop a spectrographic equipment; requested an interferometer for a variable distance, Michelson- type; Juan Negrín requested a stalagmometer, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal commissioned a microtome and panmicrotome, and a projector for film screenings.

The development of the Laboratory of Automation reached its peak with the reform of the , to house the School of Industrial Engineers and the JAE, and the National Museum of Natural Sciences, also expanding the own Laboratory. In 1939 the Laboratory of Automation gave rise to the Torres Quevedo Institute of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC).

===Chess automaton: &quot;El Ajedrecista&quot;===

By the beginning of 1910 Torres commenced his work to make a chess-playing automaton, which he dubbed El Ajedrecista (The Chess Player). As opposed to The Turk and Ajeeb, &quot;El Ajedrecista&quot; was an electromechanical machine with true integrated automation that could automatically play a king and rook endgame against the king from any position, without any human intervention.

The pieces had a metallic mesh at their base, which closed an electric circuit that encoded their position in the board. When the black king was moved by hand, an algorithm calculated and performed the next best move for the white player. If an illegal move was made by the opposite player, the automaton would signal it by turning on a light. If the opposing player made three illegal moves, the automaton would stop playing. The automaton does not deliver checkmate in the minimum number of moves, nor always within the 50 moves allotted by the fifty-move rule, because of the simple algorithm that calculates the moves. It did, however, checkmate the opponent every time. Claude Shannon noted in his work &quot;Programming a Computer for Playing Chess&quot; (1950) that Torres&#x27; machine was quite advanced for that period. The device has been considered the first computer game in history.

This example recorded in portable game notation shows how White checkmates the black King, following Torres&#x27; algorithm:

It created great excitement when it made its public debut at the University of Paris in 1914. Its internal construction was published by Henri Vigneron in the French magazine &quot;La Nature&quot;. On 6 November 1915 &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine in their Supplement 2079 pp. 296–298 published an illustrated article entitled &quot;Torres and His Remarkable Automatic Devices. He Would Substitute Machinery for the Human Mind&quot;. It was summarized as follows:

In November 1922, about to turn 70, Torres finished the construction designs of the second chess player, in which, under his direction, his son Gonzalo had introduced various improvements. The mechanical arms to move pieces were replaced for electromagnets located under the board, sliding the pieces from one square to another. This version included a gramophone, with a voice recording announcing checkmate when the computer won the game. Torres initially presented it in 1923 in Paris. His son later exposed the advanced machine at several international meetings, introducing it to a wider audience at the 1951 Paris conference on computers and human thinking. Norbert Wiener played on 12 or 13 January. &quot;El Ajedrecista&quot; defeated Savielly Tartakower at the conference, being the first Grandmaster to lose against a machine. It was also demonstrated at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, Heinz Zemanek, who played against that device, described it as &quot;a historical witness of automaton artistry that was far ahead of its time. Torres created a prefect algorithm with 6 subrules which he realized with the technological means of that time, essentially with levers, gearwheels, and relays.&quot;

===Essays on Automatics===
 
On 19 November 1914, Torres published &quot;Ensayos sobre Automática. Su definición. Extensión teórica de sus aplicaciones&quot; (Essays on Automatics. Its Definition – Theoretical Extent of Its Applications) in the &quot;Revista de Obras Públicas&quot;. It was translated into French with the title &quot;Essais sur l&#x27;Automatique&quot; in the &quot;Revue Générale des Sciences Pures et Appliquées&quot;, 1915, vol. 2, pp. 601–611.

This paper is Torres&#x27; major written work on the subject he called &quot;Automatics&quot;, &quot;another type of automaton of great interest: those that imitate, not the simple gestures, but the thoughtful actions of a man, and which can sometimes replace him&quot;. He drew a distinction between the simpler sort of automaton, which has invariable mechanical relationships and the more complicated, interesting kind, whose relationships between operating parts alter &quot;suddenly when necessary circumstances arise&quot;. Such an automaton must have sense organs, that is, &quot;thermometers, magnetic compasses, dynamometers, manometers&quot;, and limbs, as Torres called them, mechanisms capable of executing the instructions that would come from the sense organs. The automaton postulated by Torres would be able to make decisions so long as &quot;the rules the automaton must follow are known precisely&quot;.

The paper provides the main link between Torres and Babbage. He gives a brief history of Babbage&#x27;s efforts at constructing a mechanical Difference engine and Analytical engine. He described the Analytical Engine as exemplifying his theories as to the potential power of machines, and takes the problem of designing such an engine as a challenge to his skills as an inventor of electromechanical devices. Contains a complete design (albeit one that Torres regarded as theoretical rather than practical) for a machine capable of calculating completely automatically the value of the formula formula_5, for a sequence of sets of values of the variables involved. It demonstrates cunning electromechanical gadgets for storing decimal digits, for performing arithmetic operations using built-in function tables, and for comparing the values of two quantities. The whole machine was to be controlled from a read-only program (complete with provisions for conditional branching), represented by a pattern of conducting areas mounted around the surface of a rotating cylinder. It also introduced the idea of floating-point arithmetic, which historian Randell says was described &quot;almost casually&quot;, apparently without recognizing the significance of the discovery. Torres proposed a format that showed he understood the need for a fixed-size significand as is presently used for floating-point data. He did it in the following way:

The paper ends with a comparison of the advantages of electromechanical devices that were all that were available to Babbage. It establishes that Torres would have been quite capable of building a general-purpose electromechanical computer more than 20 years ahead of its time, had the practical need, motivation, and financing been present.

====Analytical machines====


Torres went ahead to prove his theories with a series of working prototypes. He demonstrated twice, in 1914 and in 1920, that all of the cogwheel mechanisms of a calculating machine like that of Babbage could be implemented using electromechanical parts. His 1914 analytical machine used a small memory built with electromagnets, capable of evaluating p × q – b.

In 1920, during a conference in Paris, commemorating the centenary of the invention of the mechanical arithmometer, Torres surprised attendees with the demonstration of the &quot;Arithmomètre Electroméchanique&quot; (Electromechanical Arithmometer). It consisted of an arithmetic unit connected to a (possibly remote) typewriter, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically (e.g. &quot;532 × 257&quot; and &quot;= &quot; from the typewriter). This calculator was not programmable, but was able to print the numerical value of the answer. From the user interface point of view, this machine can be regarded as the predecessor of current computers that use a keyboard as an input interface. In terms of usage, it was also assumed that calculations could be performed remotely by extending electric wires, and is considered to be a rudimentary version of today&#x27;s online systems that use communication lines. Torres had no thought of making such a machine commercially, viewing it instead as a means of demonstrating his ideas and techniques. Furthermore, in his paper about this device, he pointed out the need for various automatic machines to represent continuous numerical values as finite, discrete values for processing and evaluation, which corresponds to current digital data.

From 26 April to 23 September 1990, an exposition called &quot;De la Machine à Calculer de Pascal à l&#x27;Ordinateur. 350 annes d&#x27;Informatique&quot; was held at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris, where Torres&#x27; invention would be recognized as one of the first digital calculation systems: &quot;In 1920, the Spaniard Leonardo Torres Quevedo built a fully automatic electromagnetic arithmometer. To do this, he used relay technology, developed for the needs of the telephone.&quot;

=== Naval projects ===

In those days when the outbreak of the Great War was anticipated, Torres designed a transport ship intended to accompany fleets. On 30 July 1913, he patented the &quot;Buque campamento&quot; (&quot;Camp-Vessel&quot;), an airship carrier with a mooring mast and a hold large enough to house up to two inflated units, and hydrogen cylinders. He had thought of the possibility of combining aeronautics with the navy in this way, offering his patent to Vickers Limited, although the conglomerate did not show interest in the project. Negotiations continued, and Torres reached Admiral Reginald Bacon, who, on 17 March 1914, wrote from the Coventry Ordnance Works that &quot;the experience of the Navy has invariably been that any auxiliary craft carried on board ship are of very little real service&quot;. A few years later, in 1922, the Spanish Navy would construct a real airship carrier, the &quot;Dédalo&quot;, to be used in the war against Morocco.

In 1916 Torres patented in Spain a new kind of ship, a multihull steel vessel which received the name of &quot;Binave&quot; (&quot;Twin Ship&quot;). He applied for the patent of the Binave in the United Kingdom with the name &quot;Improvements in Ships&quot; in 1917, and it was built by the Euskalduna company in Bilbao in 1918, with several test departures such as the successful round trip to Santoña on 28 September. The tests would be resumed in 1919, obtaining the certificate of implementation of the patent on 12 November of that year. The design introduces new features, including two 30 HP Hispano-Suiza marine engines, and the ability to modify its configuration when sailing, positioning two rudders at the stern of each float, and placing the propellers aft too. As a result of the experience acquired in the tests, to improve stability in 1920 it was considered appropriate to add a lower keel to each of the floats proposed in the patent, making it similar to modern catamarans, whose development would become widespread from the 1990s onwards.

=== Other inventions and miscellaneous activities ===

Apart from the aforementioned inventions, Torres patented the &quot;Indicadores coordinados&quot; (&quot;Coordinate Indicator&quot;, 1901), a guidance system for vehicles and pedestrians using markers installed on streetlights throughout an entire city, which he proposed for Madrid and Paris under the name of &quot;Guide Torres&quot;, the &quot;Dianemologo&quot; (1907), an apparatus for copying a speech as it is delivery without the need for shorthand, &quot;Globos fusiformes deformables&quot; (&quot;Deformable Fusiform Balloons&quot;, 1914), a fusiform envelope with a variable section depending on the volume of the hydrogen contained, and &quot;Enclavamientos T.Q.&quot; (&quot;Interlocks T.Q.&quot;, 1918), a railway interlock of his own design to protect the movement of trains within a certain area.

In the last years of his life, Torres turned his attention to the field of educational disciplines, to investigate those elements or machines that could help educators in their task. His last patents related to subjects such as typewriters and their improvement (1922–23), the marginal pagination of books (1926), and, especially, the &quot;Puntero Proyectable&quot; (Projectable Pointer, 1930), and the &quot;Proyector Didáctico&quot; (Didactic Projector, 1930). The Projectable Pointer was based on the shadow produced on a plate or screen by an opaque body in motion. The presenter had the option to move the pointer on any place on the plate (today a slide) at operate with an articulated system. The Didactic Projector improved the way slides were placed on glass plates for projection.

====Esperantist====

In the early 1900s, Torres learned the international language Esperanto, and was an advocate of the language throughout his life. From 1922 to 1926 he participated in the work of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations, where such figures as Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Gilbert Murray and Henri Bergson, its first president, attended. Torres proposed to the Committee that it study the role of an artistic auxiliary language to facilitate the scientific ones relations between the peoples. Although almost half of the Committee members were in favor of Esperanto, his motion was strongly opposed by President Bergson, receiving a clear notice from French diplomats to put the influence of French culture first, which included the French ambassador in Bern, who considered Torres a &quot;farouchement espérantiste&quot; (&quot;fierce Esperantist&quot;). In 1925 he participated as the official representative of the Spanish government in the &quot;Conference on the Use of Esperanto in Pure and Applied Sciences&quot; held in Paris, together with and Emilio Herrera Linares. That same year, he joined to the Honorary Committee of the (HEA) founded by Julio Mangada, and continued defending the language in other forums until his death in 1936.

====Spanish-American Technological Dictionary====

In 1910 Torres traveled to Argentina with the Infanta Isabel to assist at the International Scientific Congress held in Buenos Aires, one of the events organized to mark the centenary of the independence of Argentina. At the congress, he proposed, along with the Argentinean engineer Santiago Barabino, the constitution of a Spanish-American board of scientific technology, which would eventually become the &quot;Unión Internacional Hispano–Americana de Bibliografía y Terminología Científicas&quot;. The first task was the publication of a technological dictionary of the Spanish language to tackle the problems caused by the increasing use of scientific and technological neologisms, as well as the adaptation of words from other languages, confronted with the avalanche of foreign terms. As a result of the work of this board, the &quot;Diccionario Tecnológico Hispanoamericano&quot; (Hispanic American Technological Dictionary) began to be published in fascicles between 1926 and 1930, although it did not see a complete edition until 1983, with a second expanded edition in 1990.

== Distinctions ==

Over the years, Torres received an increasing number of decorations, prizes, and societal memberships, both Spanish and from other countries. In 1901, he entered the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid for his work carried out in these years about algebraic machines, an entity of which he was its president between 1928 and 1934. In 1916 King Alfonso XIII of Spain bestowed the Echegaray Medal upon him; and in 1918, he declined the offer of the position of Minister of Development. In 1920, he was admitted to the Real Academia Española, to fill the seat &quot;N&quot; vacated by the death of Benito Pérez Galdós. In his acceptance speech he said in a humble and funny way:

That same year Torres was elected President of the Spanish Royal Physics Society and the Royal Spanish Mathematical Society, the latter position he held until 1924, and became a member of the Mechanics Section of the Paris Academy. In 1921 he was appointed President of the International Spanish-American Union of Scientific Bibliography and Technology. From 1921 to 1928 he assumed the presidency of the Spanish section of the International Committee for Weights and Measures, where due to his experience in development of instruments, contributed to the improvement of measurements made in the laboratories of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). In 1923 he became an Honorary Academician of the . In 1925 he was promoted to Corresponding Member of the Hispanic Society of America. In 1926 he became Honorary Inspector General of the &quot;Corps of Civil Engineers&quot;. On 27 June 1927 he was named one of the twelve foreign associate academicians of the French Academy of Sciences with 34 votes in favor for his entry, surpassing Ernest Rutherford (4 votes) and Santiago Ramón y Cajal (2 votes).

His accolades also include:

* Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso XII (1906)
* Parville Prize of the French Academy of Sciences (1916)
* Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III (1921)
* Grand Cross of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword (1921)
* Commander of the Legion of Honour (1922)
* Honorary doctorate of the University of Paris (1923)
* Honorary doctorate of the University of Coimbra (1925)
* Grand-Cross Band of the Order of the Spanish Republic (1934)

==Personal life, religious beliefs and death==

On 16 April 1885 Torres married Luz Polanco y Navarro (1856–1954) in Portolín (Molledo). The marriage lasted 51 years and had eight children (3 sons and 5 daughters: Leonardo (born 1887, died 2 years old in 1889), Gonzalo (born 1893, died in 1965, who also became an engineer, and used to work as an assistant of his father), Luz, Valentina, Luisa, Julia (also died young), Joaquina, and Fernando). After the death of his first son, in 1889, Torres moved with his family to Madrid with the firm intention of putting into practice the projects he had devised in previous years. During this time he attended the Athenæum in the Spanish capital and the literary gatherings at the , but generally without participating in debates and discussions of a political nature. He lived for many years in nº 3.

Torres was a devout Catholic who usually read the catechism and take communion every First Friday of the month. He read the catechism as if intimately preparing himself for the next peaceful end that awaited him. His daughter Valentina told him on one occasion: &quot;Dad, maybe you don&#x27;t fully understand the mysteries that faith offers us, just as I don&#x27;t understand your inventions either&quot; and he responded affectionately: &quot;Oh daughter, it&#x27;s just that from God to me there is an infinite distance!&quot;. Once the Spanish Civil War began, his daughter Luz was arrested by the militia, and the family had to resort to the fact that Torres was a Commander of the Legion of Honour to save her life, with the intervention of the French Embassy included. In his last moments, his family managed to have the sacraments administered to him despite the difficulties due to religious persecution. At the moment of receiving the extreme unction, he pronounced his last words: &quot;Memento homnia, quia pulvis eris et in pulverem reverteris&quot; (&quot;Remember, man, you are dust and to dust you will return&quot;). On 18 December 1936, after a progressive illness, Torres died at his son Gonzalo&#x27;s home in Madrid, in the middle of the Civil War, ten days before his eighty-fourth birthday. He was initially buried in the Cementerio de la Almudena, and later removed in 1957 to the monumental Saint Isidore Cemetery.

==Legacy==

The distressing circumstances that Spain was going through during its Civil War meant that Torres&#x27; death in 1936 went somewhat unnoticed. However, newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the French mathematician Maurice d&#x27;Ocagne reported on his demise by publishing obituaries and articles in 1937–38, with d&#x27;Ocagne giving some lectures about his research work in Paris and Brussels.

In the years following his death, Torres was not forgotten. Created the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in 1939, the architect was commissioned with the project and construction of a large building in Madrid to house the new Institute «Leonardo Torres Quevedo» of Applied Physics, which was completed in 1943. Its dedicated to &quot;designing and manufacturing instruments and investigating mechanical, electrical and electronic problems&quot;, and was the germ of the current Institute of Physical and Information Technologies &quot;Leonardo Torres Quevedo&quot; (ITEFI).

In 1940 his name was among those selected by American philanthropist Archer Milton Huntington to inscribe on the building of the Hispanic Society of America.

In 1953, the commemorative events for the centenary of his birth began, which took place at the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences with the participation of high academic, scientific and university figures from the country and abroad, among them Louis Couffignal, Charles Lambert Manneback, and .

Two postage stamps were issued in Spain to honoured him in 1955 and 1983, the last one next to the image of the Niagara cable car, regardess as a work of genius.

In 1965, the City Council of Madrid dedicated a commemorative plaque to him in his residence building at Válgame Dios, 3, informing the people of Madrid that &quot;the scientist who brought so much glory to Spain lived in that place.&quot;

In 1978 his work was honoured in Madrid at the Palacio de Cristal del Retiro, an exposition that was organized by the College of Civil Engineers led by .
The was established in 1982 in Spain by the Ministry of Science in recognition of the merits of Spanish scientists or researchers in the field of engineering. The same year the (FLTQ) was created under his name as a non-profit organization to promote scientific research within the framework of the University of Cantabria and to training professionals in this area. The Foundation had its headquarters at the University of Cantabria School of Civil Engineering.

A bronze statue on a stone pedestal was erected in 1986 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of his death. The work was commissioned to the sculptor and its located in Santa Cruz de Iguña, Torres&#x27; birth town.

Between the end of the 1980s and the mid-1990s, three symposiums were held in Spain on his figure titled &quot;Leonardo Torres Quevedo, su vida, su tiempo, su obra&quot; in Molledo (1987), Camargo (1991) and Pozuelo de Alarcón (1995).

On 19 July 2008, commemorated the centenary of the Torres Quevedo airship built in Guadalajara, which was the beginnings of the Spanish Air Force. In November, the Leonardo Torres Quevedo Centre was established in Santa Cruz, Molledo, dedicated to his life and work.

On 28 December 2012, Google celebrated his 160th birthday with a Google Doodle. The company had also commemorated the 100th anniversary of El Ajedrecista, highlighting that it was a marvel of its time and could be considered the &quot;grandfather&quot; of current video games. A conference was organized on 7 November in cooperation with the School of Telecommunication Engineering of the Technical University of Madrid to exhibit Torres&#x27; devices.

Since 2015, an image of his , a pioneering cable car built in San Sebastián in 1907 to transport people, can be seen on the &#x27;visas&#x27; page of the Spanish passports.
On 8 August 2016, the 100th Anniversary of the Whirlpool Aero Car was celebrated for its uninterrupted operation, without having had any accidents. The ceremony also included members of the Torres Quevedo family, who made a special trip from Spain to attend the anniversary celebrations and , the Spanish Ambassador to Canada. According to Niagara Parks Commission Chair, Janice Thomson, &quot;this morning’s celebrations have allowed us to properly mark an important milestone in the history of the Niagara Parks Commission, all while recognizing the accomplishments and paying tribute to Leonardo Torres Quevedo, who through his work made a lasting impression on both the engineering profession and the tourism industry here in Niagara.&quot;

In February 2022 was presented in Santander the new turbosail of La Fura dels Baus, &quot;La Naumon&quot;, a large white structure at the base of which stands out the figure of Leonardo Torres Quevedo, with whose name it was baptized the device. A museum called El Valle de los Inventos was opened in La Serna de Iguña, which offers a permanent exhibition about him and his inventions where guided tours, scientific workshops and an escape room are organized. On 4 July, the flag carrier Iberia received the fifth of the six Airbus A320neo planned for that year. This A320neo with registration EC-NTQ bears the name &quot;Leonardo Torres Quevedo&quot; in his honour.

On 5 May 2023, the Instituto Cervantes opens the Caja de las Letras to house the &quot;in memoriam&quot; legacy of Leonardo Torres Quevedo. Among the deposited objects, letters and manuscripts; a dozen publications, with books, monographs or catalogues; postcards and a schedule of the Niagara Falls cable car designed by him, and the Milestone awarded by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers that recognizes the engineer&#x27;s scoop in the development of remote-control in 1901 with the &quot;Telekino&quot;. Torres&#x27; granddaughter Mercedes Torres Quevedo expressed her gratitude to the institution on behalf of all her descendants for welcoming her grandfather&#x27;s legacy and the &quot;pride&quot; of all of them for the scientific and humanistic work he carried out throughout of his life. His legacy has been deposited in box number 1275 and the keys in the hands of his descendants and the institution itself.

==In fiction==
Leonardo Torres Quevedo is a main character of the novel &quot;Los horrores del escalpelo&quot; (The Horrors of the Scalpel, 2011), written by Daniel Mares. The plot tells how the Spanish engineer travels to London in 1888 to find Maelzel&#x27;s Chess Player, a mechanical automaton that was believed to have been lost for decades. Together with Raimundo Aguirre, a thief and murderer, who claims to have the clue to the lost automaton, he begins the search through the London underworld and Victorian high society. The search is interrupted due to the streets of the Whitechapel neighborhood dawn with corpses of prostitutes, which causes Torres and his partner Aguirre to become involved in the hunt for Jack the Ripper.

<text>Embraer S.A. () is a Brazilian multinational aerospace corporation. It develops and manufactures aircraft and aviation systems, and provides leasing, equipment, and technical support services. Embraer is the third largest producer of civil aircraft worldwide after Boeing and Airbus. The company also has a significant presence in military aviation, ranking among the top 100 defense contractors. It is headquartered in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil, with offices and operations in China, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, and the United States.

Embraer was founded in 1969 by the Brazilian government as a national champion for domestic aerospace technology. It initially focused on supplying military aircraft to the Brazilian Air Force, but by the 1980s began producing a series of successful commuter and regional airliners for export. The company was privatized in 1994 and began expanding to the production of larger regional airliners and smaller business jets. In 2000, Embraer became public as a limited company (&quot;Sociedade Anônima&quot;) with its own shares publicly traded in both the United States (NYSE) and Brazil (B3).

Embraer has divisions for commercial, executive, military, and agricultural aviation; it also maintains an incubator for aerospace technologies and businesses. While the company continues producing aircraft for the defense sector, it is best known for the ERJ and E-Jet families of narrow-body short to medium range airliners, and for its line of business jets, including the market-leading Phenom 300. As of May 2024, Embraer has delivered more than 8,000 aircraft, including 1,800 E-Jet planes.

==History==
Seeking to develop a domestic aircraft industry, the Brazilian government under then President Getúlio Vargas&#x27; Estado Novo made several investments in the aerospace industry during the 1940s and 1950s. However, it was not until 1969, following the establishment of the Brazilian military dictatorship after the 1964 coup d&#x27;état, that &quot;Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica&quot; (Brazilian Aeronautics Corporation, short Embraer) was created as a government-owned corporation. Its first president, Ozires Silva, was a government appointee, and the company initially only produced a turboprop passenger aircraft, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. The city of São José dos Campos was chosen to host the company&#x27;s headquarters because it had already hosted, since 1950, the Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA), the first higher education institution in Brazil dedicated to the aerospace sector. 

===Early growth===
The Brazilian government contributed to Embraer&#x27;s early growth by providing production contracts. The company sold solely to the domestic market until 1975.

While military aircraft made up the majority of Embraer&#x27;s products during the 1970s and early 1980s, including the Embraer AT-26 Xavante and the Embraer EMB 312 Tucano, it debuted a regional airliner, the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante, which made its first flight in 1968, and the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, launched in 1985. Aimed at the export market, the EMB family was the first in a series of highly successful small and regional airliners.

In addition to its own line of aircraft, beginning in 1974, Embraer was licensed by the United States&#x27; Piper Aircraft to develop, produce, and market its light airplanes, as Brazil was one of the world&#x27;s leading importers of small single- or twin-engine aircraft. Piper first put together knock-down kits in its U.S. factory for Embraer to then assemble and market in Brazil and Latin America. By 1978, most parts and components were being sourced by Embraer locally. The aircraft were sold as the EMB 820 Navajo (Piper Navajo Chifetais), EMB 810 Seneca (Piper Seneca III), EMB 720 Minuano (Cherokee Six), EMB 710 Carioca aircraft (Cherokee 235 Pathfinder) and the EMB 711 Corisco (Cherokee Arrow II). Between 1974 and 2000, nearly 2,500 license-built Pipers were produced by Embraer.

===Acquisition of Aerotec===
Aerotec S/A Indústria Aeronáutica was a design and manufacturing company founded in São José dos Campos in 1962 under the auspices of the Brazilian General Command for Aerospace Technology. Beginning in the late 1960s, the firm manufactured a two-seat trainer for the Brazilian Air Force, the Aerotec Uirapuru. A small number were also built for the civilian market, and others were exported to other Latin American countries.

By 1980, Aerotec&#x27;s main business was producing components for Embraer. However, around this time, the Brazilian Air Force became interested in an upgraded version of the Uirapuru. A prototype, designated Uirapuru II, was built; but, by the time it flew, the Air Force no longer required it. A small number were built for export. In 1987, the firm was sold to Embraer.

===Privatization===
Born from a Brazilian government plan and having been state-run, Embraer eventually started a privatisation process in 1992 alongside other state-run companies, such as Telebrás and Vale. Privatisation was a key policy of the economically liberal government of Fernando Collor, elected in the 1989 presidential election.

Embraer was sold to private investors on December 7, 1994, which helped it avoid a looming bankruptcy. The Brazilian government retained interest through possession of golden shares, which allow it veto power. Embraer continued to win government contracts throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

===Initial public offerings===
In 2000, Embraer made simultaneous initial public offerings on the NYSE and BM&amp;F Bovespa stock exchanges. As of 2008 its NYSE-traded shares were American depositary receipts representing four BM&amp;F Bovespa shares and it was partially owned by the Bozano Group (11.10%), Previ (16.40%), Sistel (7.40%), Dassault Aviation (2.1%), EADS (2.1%), Thales (2.1%), Safran (1.1%), and the government of Brazil (0.3% and golden share), the remainder being publicly traded.

As of December 31, 2014 the shareholders with more than 5% of the company&#x27;s capital were:
* OppenheimerFunds, 12.29%
* Caixa de Previdência dos Funcionários do Banco do Brasil, 6.71%
* Baillie Gifford, 6.46%
* BNDESPAR, 5.31%.

===Product line expansion: military, regional and executive===
In the mid-1990s, the company pursued a product line focused on small commercial airplanes over the military aircraft that had previously made up the majority of its manufacturing. It soon expanded to the production of larger regional airliners in the 70–110 seat range, and smaller business jets.

By May 2019, Embraer considered developing a new family of turboprop regional airliners in the 50–70 seat range, complementing the E-Jet E2, so as to free engineering resources. It would compete against older ATR and Dash 8 designs for 1.5 to 2 h flights over . In August 2021, Embraer released a new configuration with quieter aft-mounted engines for a 70-90 seat aircraft, with the E-Jet cross-section, aiming for a 2022 launch and a 2027/2028 service entry.

=== Executive jets ===
At the 2000 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer launched the Legacy 600, a business jet variant of the Embraer Regional Jet. In 2002, a dedicated subsidiary, &quot;Embraer Executive Jets&quot;, was created, as the Legacy was introduced into service. In 2005, the Phenom 100 was first envisioned as an air taxi similar to the Eclipse 500, competing with Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft. It was introduced in 2008 and is the basis of the larger Phenom 300. The midsize Legacy 450 and Legacy 500 were jointly developed as clean sheet designs, while the Lineage 1000 is a VIP version of the E190. In 2016, Embraer delivered its 1,000th executive jet and had a market share of 17% by volume, though it lacked an ultra-long-range large cabin jet. In October 2018 Embraer announced two new business jets—the Praetor 500 in the midsize cabin category—and the Praetor 600 in the super midsize category.

===Military transport===
On April 19, 2007, Embraer announced it was considering the production of a twin-jet military transport. Work began in May 2009 with funding from the Brazilian Air Force. Correios, the Brazilian postal service, has shown interest in buying this aircraft. Using much of the technology developed for the Embraer 190, the C-390 would carry up to 23 tons of cargo and aims to replace Cold War-era cargo aircraft.

While firm orders for the yet-to-be-produced KC-390 transport had not yet been made in the fall of 2010, Argentina asked for six examples and several other South American nations also expressed interest.

===Government subsidy controversy===
Brazil and Canada engaged in an international, adjudicated trade dispute over government subsidies to domestic plane-makers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The World Trade Organization determined that both countries had provided illegal subsidies to what were supposed to be privately owned industries. Brazil ran an illegal subsidy program, Proex, benefiting its national aviation industry from at least 1999–2000, and Canada illegally subsidized its indigenous regional airliner industry including in export contracts, comprising Bombardier Aerospace.

===Failed Boeing-Embraer joint venture===
On July 5, 2018, a joint venture with Boeing was announced that would have resulted in Boeing owning 80% of Embraer&#x27;s commercial aviation division. This was seen as a reaction to Airbus&#x27; acquisition of a majority in the competing Bombardier CSeries the previous year. Under the 2018 plan, Embraer would retain its executive business jet and its defence business. The resulting division would be known as Boeing BrasilCommercial, though it was unclear whether the aircraft would be rebranded as Boeing models.

On November 18, 2019, Boeing and Embraer announced another joint venture, at 49% and 51% respectively, to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft; the resulting entity would be called Boeing Embraer – Defense and would begin operating after regulatory approvals and closing conditions.

In April 2020, Boeing canceled its acquisition of Embraer&#x27;s commercial operations after being heavily affected financially by the air crisis initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the 737 MAX groundings.

In November 2020, Embraer announced that its loss for the third quarter of the year is $121 million due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the travel restrictions.

===STOUT light military transport aircraft===
In December 2019, Embraer and the Brazilian Air Force tackled the development of a light military transport aircraft. The Short Take Off Utility Transport (STOUT) would replace its 64 EMB-110 Bandeirante (average age of 38.3 years) and 19 EMB-120 Brasilia (average age of 26.5 years) with similar dimensions.

== Organization ==
Embraer is organized into four segments: Commercial Aviation, which manages the development, production, sale, and lease of commercial jets, as well as the provision of aviation support services; Defense &amp; Security, which consists of research, development, production, modification, and support for military defense aircraft, and related products and services; Executive Aviation, which concerns the development, production, and sale of executive jets, and support services; and Other, which entails the production of structural parts, mechanical and hydraulic systems, agricultural crop-spraying aircraft, and customer training.

<text>The Mali Empire (Manding: &quot;Mandé&quot; or &quot;Manden Duguba&quot;; ) was an empire in West Africa from 1226 to 1670. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita () and became renowned for the wealth of its rulers, especially Mansa Musa (Musa Keita). At its peak, Mali was the largest empire in West Africa, widely influencing the culture of the region through the spread of its language, laws, and customs.

The empire began as a small Mandinka kingdom at the upper reaches of the Niger River, centered around the Manding region. It began to develop during the 11th and 12th centuries as the Ghana Empire, or Wagadu, declined and trade epicentres shifted southward. The history of the Mali Empire before the 13th century is unclear, as there are conflicting and imprecise accounts by both Arab chroniclers and oral traditionalists. The first ruler for which there is accurate written information is Sundiata Keita, a warrior-prince of the Keita dynasty who was called upon to free the local people from the rule of the king of the Sosso Empire, Soumaoro Kanté. The conquest of Sosso in marked the emergence of Mali as a major power, with the Kouroukan Fouga as its constitution.

Following the death of Sundiata Keita, in , the kings of Mali were referred to by the title &quot;mansa&quot;. In Sakoura, a former royal court slave, became emperor and was one of Mali&#x27;s most powerful rulers, greatly expanding the empire&#x27;s territory. He made a pilgrimage to Mecca during the reign of Mamluk Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad (r. 1298–1308), but died on his voyage home. Mansa Musa took the throne in . He made a famous pilgrimage to Mecca from 1324 to 1326, where his generous gifts and his expenditure of gold caused significant inflation in Egypt. Maghan I succeeded him as mansa in 1337, but was deposed by his uncle Suleyman in 1341. It was during Suleyman&#x27;s 19-year reign that Ibn Battuta visited Mali. Suleyman&#x27;s death marked the end of Mali&#x27;s Golden Age and the beginning of a slow decline.

The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; records that Mali was still a sizeable state in the 15th century. At that time, the Venetian explorer Alvise Cadamosto and Portuguese traders confirmed that the peoples who settled within Gambia River were still subject to the mansa of Mali. Upon Leo Africanus&#x27;s visit at the beginning of the 16th century, his descriptions of the territorial domains of Mali showed that it was still a kingdom of considerable size. However, from 1507 onwards neighboring states such as Diarra, Great Fulo, Yatenga, and the Songhai Empire chipped away at Mali&#x27;s borders. In 1542, the Songhai invaded the capital but were unsuccessful in conquering the empire. During the 17th century, the Mali Empire faced incursions from the Bamana Empire, who ultimately sacked and burned the capital in 1670. The Mali Empire rapidly disintegrated, being replaced by independent chiefdoms. The Keitas retreated to the town of Kangaba, where they became provincial chiefs.

== Historiography ==
Much of the recorded information about the Mali Empire comes from 14th century Tunisian historian Ibn Khaldun, 14th century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta and 16th century Andalusian traveller Leo Africanus. The other major source of information comes from Mandinka oral tradition, as recorded by storytellers known as griots. Imperial Mali is also known through the account of Shihab al-&#x27;Umari, written in about 1340 by a geographer-administrator in Mamluk Egypt. His information about the empire came from visiting Malians taking the hajj, or pilgrim&#x27;s voyage to Mecca. He had first-hand information from several sources, and from a second-hand source he learned of the visit of Mansa Musa. The traveller Ibn Battuta, who visited Mali in 1352 left the first account of a West African kingdom made directly by an eyewitness; the others are usually second-hand. The third great account is that of Ibn Khaldun, who wrote in the early 15th century. While the accounts are of limited length, they provide a fairly good picture of the empire at its height.

After Ibn Khaldun&#x27;s death in 1406, there are no further Arab primary sources except for Leo Africanus, who wrote more than a century later. Arab interest in the Mali Empire declined after the Songhai conquered the northern regions of the empire which formed the primary contact between Mali and the Arab world. For the later period of the Mali Empire, the major written primary sources are Portuguese accounts of the coastal provinces of Mali and neighboring societies.

=== Etymology of Mali ===
&quot;Mali&quot;, &quot;Mandé&quot;, &quot;Manden&quot;, and &quot;Manding&quot; are all various pronunciations of the same word across different languages and dialects. The version recorded by medieval Arab geographers is Mali (). &quot;Mali&quot; is the Fula form of the word. In the Manding languages, the modern descendants of the language spoken at the core of the Mali Empire, &quot;Manden&quot; or &quot;Manding&quot; is the name of the region corresponding to the heartland of the Mali Empire.

Medieval sources are divided over whether Mali is the name of a town or a region. Ibn Battuta who visited the capital city from 1352 to 1353, called it Mali. The 1375 Catalan Atlas portrayed a &quot;city of Melly&quot; () in West Africa. Leo Africanus said that the capital city was called Melli. However, Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari gives &quot;Mali&quot; as the name of the capital province and Ibn Khaldun refers to &quot;Mali&quot; as a people, with each giving different names for the capital city itself. Whether &quot;Mali&quot; originated as the name of a town or region, the name was subsequently applied to the entire empire ruled from Mali.

Another hypothesis suggests that the name Mali is derived from Mandé &quot;mali&quot; &quot;hippopotamus&quot;, an animal that had special significance to the Keitas, and that Mandé means &quot;little manatee&quot;. A legend claims that Sunjata transformed into a hippopotamus. However, these hypotheses have been rejected by locals and are inconsistent with the apparent cognate status of &quot;Mali&quot; and &quot;Mandé&quot;.

== History ==

===Pre-imperial Mali===
The first Mande people entered the Manding region during the period of the Ghana Empire. The Manden city-state of Ka-ba (present-day Kangaba) served as the capital and name of the province. From at least the beginning of the 11th century, Mandinka kings ruled Manden from Ka-ba in the name of the Ghanas. The ruler was elected from among the heads of the major clans, and at this time had little real power. Wagadou&#x27;s control over Manden ended in the 12th century. The Kangaba province, free of Soninké influence, splintered into twelve kingdoms with their own &quot;faama&quot;. 

In approximately 1140 the Sosso kingdom of Kaniaga, another former vassal of Wagadou, began conquering the lands of its old rulers. In 1203, the Sosso king and sorcerer Soumaoro Kanté came to power and reportedly terrorised much of Manden.

===Sundiata Keita===
Sundiata Keita, born during the rise of Kaniaga, was the son of Niani&#x27;s &quot;faama&quot;, Nare Fa (also known as Maghan Kon Fatta, meaning the handsome prince). Upon his father&#x27;s death, he was forced into exile along with his mother and two sisters. After many years in exile, Sundiata led the combined armies of Mema, Wagadou and the Mandinka city-states in a revolt against the Kaniaga Kingdom around 1234. The combined forces of northern and southern Manden defeated the Sosso army at the Battle of Kirina in approximately 1235. Maghan Sundiata was declared &quot;mansa&quot; over all the 12 kingdoms in an alliance that became the Mali Empire. During his reign, Sundiata&#x27;s generals continued to expand the empire&#x27;s frontiers, reaching from Kaabu in the west, Takrur, Oualata and Audaghost in the north, and the Soninke Wangara goldfields in the south.

The transfer of power following Sunjata&#x27;s death is unclear, but there was evidently a power struggle of some kind involving the &quot;gbara&quot; or great council and &quot;donson ton&quot; or hunter guilds. Some oral traditions agree with Ibn Khaldun in indicating that a son of Sunjata, named Yerelinkon in oral tradition and Wali in Arabic, took power as Sunjata&#x27;s successor. Two more of Sundiata&#x27;s sons would reign, as well as a grandson, before a former slave Sakura, seized power. He was able to stabilize the political situation in Mali. Under his leadership, Mali conquered new territories and trade with North Africa increased. 

===Height of power===
After Sakura&#x27;s death, power returned to the line of Sunjata, with Qu taking the throne. He was succeeded by his son Muhammad, who launched two voyages to explore the Atlantic Ocean. After the loss of the first expedition, Muhammad led the second expedition himself. He left his cousin Kanku Musa in charge during his absence. Eventually, due to Muhammad&#x27;s failure to return, Musa was recognized as mansa in approximately 1312.

The reign of Kankan Musa, better known as Mansa Musa, is considered the golden age of Mali. A devout and well-educated Muslim, he took an interest in the scholarly city of Timbuktu, which he peaceably annexed in 1324, and transformed Sankore from an informal madrasah into an Islamic university. Mansa Musa Keita&#x27;s crowning achievement was his famous 1324 pilgrimage to Mecca. Accounts of how many people and how much gold he spent vary. All of them agree that he took a very large group of people; the &quot;mansa&quot; kept a personal guard of some 500 men, and he gave out so many alms and bought so many things that the value of gold in Egypt and Arabia depreciated for twelve years. When he passed through Cairo, historian al-Maqrizi noted &quot;the members of his entourage proceeded to buy Turkish and Ethiopian slave girls, singing girls and garments, so that the rate of the gold &quot;dinar&quot; fell by six &quot;dirhams&quot;.&quot; In addition to his famous hajj, Musa built mosques and palaces in Timbuktu and Gao, and took control of the valuable salt mine of Taghazza.

Mansa Musa&#x27;s son Maghan I ruled for only a few years before being succeeded (or overthrown) by his uncle Sulayman. Sulayman&#x27;s reign continued Mali&#x27;s golden age, as attested by the writer Ibn Battuta who arrived in Mali in July 1352, and he made a successful &quot;hajj&quot;, kept up correspondence with Morocco and Egypt.

Upon Sulayman&#x27;s death in 1360, the empire was ruled by a string of short-lived, cruel, or incompetent rulers. The &quot;kankoro-sigui&quot; held increasing influence as a power behind the throne. During this period the Jolof Empire was founded, and soon dominated all of northern Senegambia. In the 1370s a war between Mali imperial forces and Berber Tuareg forces from Takedda devastated the city of Gao. The area around it became independent of Malian control around this time. Still, by the time of Mansa Musa Keita II&#x27;s death in 1387, Mali was financially solvent and in control of all of its previous conquests except Gao and Dyolof. Forty years after the reign of Mansa Musa Keita I, the Mali Empire still controlled some of land.

===Decline===
The late 14th century again saw a series of short reigns, often ending in palace coups. While maintaining a firm grip in the south and west, and even expanding in some areas, imperial control of their northernmost provinces was slipping, as attested by the Mossi raids on Macina. In 1433–1434, the Empire lost control of Timbuktu to the Tuareg, led by Akil Ag-Amalwal. Three years later, Oualata also fell into their hands. The rising Songhai Empire conquered Mema, one of Mali&#x27;s oldest possessions, in 1465. It then seized Timbuktu from the Tuareg in 1468 under Sunni Ali Ber. In 1477, the Mossi emperor Nasséré made yet another raid into Macina, this time conquering it and the old province of BaGhana (Wagadou).

In an attempt to stem the tide, Mansa Mahmud Keita II opened diplomatic relations with Portugal, receiving the envoys Pêro d&#x27;Évora and Gonçalo Enes in 1487. In 1493 he sent another envoy proposing an alliance against the threat of Tenguella, but this came to nothing. Songhai forces under the command of Askia Muhammad I defeated the Mali general Fati Quali Keita in 1502 and seized the province of Diafunu. In 1514, the Denianke dynasty was established in Tekrour and it was not long before the new kingdom of Great Fulo was warring against Mali&#x27;s remaining provinces.

In 1544 or 1545, a Songhai force led by &quot;kanfari&quot; Dawud, who later succeeded his brother Askia Ishaq as ruler of the Songhai Empire, sacked the capital of Mali and purportedly used the royal palace as a latrine. However, the Songhai did not maintain their hold on the Malian capital.

Mali&#x27;s fortunes seem to have improved in the second half of the 16th century. Around 1550, Mali attacked Bighu in an effort to regain access to its gold. Songhai authority over Bendugu and Kala declined by 1571, and Mali may have been able to reassert some authority over them. The breakup of the Wolof Empire allowed Mali to reassert authority over some of its former subjects on the north bank of the Gambia, such as Wuli, by 1576.

===Collapse===

The end of the Mali Empire came in 1599, under the reign of Mansa Mahmud IV. The Songhai Empire had fallen to the Saadi Sultanate of Morocco eight years earlier, and Mahmud sought to take advantage of their defeat by trying to capture Jenne. Mahmud sought support from several other rulers, including the governor of Kala, Bukar. Bukar professed his support, but believing Mahmud&#x27;s situation to be hopeless, secretly went over to the Moroccans. The Malian and Moroccan armies fought at Jenne on 26 April, the last day of Ramadan, and the Moroccans were victorious thanks to their firearms and Bukar&#x27;s support, but Mahmud was able to escape. Around 1610, Mahmud Keita IV died. Oral tradition states that he had three sons who fought over Manden&#x27;s remains. No single Keita ever ruled Manden after Mahmud Keita IV&#x27;s death, resulting in the end of the Mali Empire.

==Government==
As founded by Mari Djata, it was composed of the &quot;three freely allied states&quot; of Mali, Mema and Wagadou plus the Twelve Doors of Mali.

The Twelve Doors of Mali were a coalition of conquered or allied territories, mostly within Manden, with sworn allegiance to Sundiata and his descendants. Upon stabbing their spears into the ground before Sundiata&#x27;s throne, each of the twelve kings relinquished their kingdom to the Keita dynasty. In return for their submission, they became &quot;farbas&quot;, a combination of the Mandinka words &quot;farin&quot; and &quot;ba&quot; (great farin). Farin was a general term for northern commander at the time. These farbas would rule their old kingdoms in the name of the &quot;mansa&quot; with most of the authority they held prior to joining the empire.

The Mansa held ultimate, unquestioned authority. Audiences with the monarch were governed by strict protocol. Conquered areas were ruled directly by the state through a &quot;farin&quot; (also called &quot;farin-ba&quot; or &quot;farba&quot;), essentially a military governor, chosen by the Mansa. Duties of the &quot;farin&quot; included managing the garrison, collecting taxes and customs duties, and controlling the local administration of justice. He could also take power away from the native administration if required and raise an army in the area for defence or putting down rebellions. This system tended to promote assimilation into the empire.

The &quot;mansa&#x27;s&quot; second in command was a general, thought to have been chief of the armed forces. The &quot;santigui&quot; was the chief of the treasury and managed the royal granaries and valuable goods such as gold and gems. The &quot;griot&quot; played a very important role in the royal court. He was the tutor of princes and master of ceremonies, and served as an advisor to the king.

The &quot;mansa&quot; often liked to play the role &quot;father of his people&quot;, dispensing justice himself in solemn sessions, and he listened personally to a subject&#x27;s grievances against a &quot;farin&quot;. The post of &quot;farin&quot; was very prestigious, and his descendants could inherit it with the &quot;mansa&quot;&#x27;s approval. The &quot;mansa&quot; could also replace a &quot;farin&quot; swiftly.

Most of the empire consisted of autonomous kingdoms of communities who recognized the Mansa&#x27;s ultimate authority and paid tribute. At the local level (village, town and city), &quot;kun-tiguis&quot; (heads of family) elected a &quot;dougou-tigui&quot; (village-master) from a bloodline descended from that locality&#x27;s founder. The county level administrators called &quot;kafo-tigui&quot; were appointed by the governor of the province. Only at the state or province level was there any real interference from the central authority. Provinces picked their own governors via their own custom (election, inheritance, etc.) and, regardless of their title in the province, were recognised as &quot;dyamani-tigui&quot; (province-master) by the &quot;mansa&quot;. &quot;Dyamani-tiguis&quot; had to be approved by the &quot;mansa&quot; and were subject to his oversight. If the &quot;mansa&quot; didn&#x27;t believe the &quot;dyamani-tigui&quot; was capable or trustworthy, a &quot;farba&quot; might be installed to oversee the province or administer it outright.

Conquered territories that had proven quiescent could receive this level of autonomy rather than remain under direct rule, but territories that were crucial to trade or subject to revolt could and did lose this privilege as well and have a &quot;farin&quot; installed to rule over them.

Mali was densely populated with the Tarikh al-Sudan stating:
=== Great Assembly ===
The Gbara or Great Assembly would serve as the Mandinka deliberative body and council of state until the collapse of the empire in 1645. Its first meeting, at the famous Kouroukan Fouga (Division of the World), had 29 clan delegates presided over by a &quot;belen-tigui&quot; (master of ceremony). The Kouroukan Fouga put in place social and economic reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing documents between clans which clearly stated who could say what about whom. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had a place in the empire and fixed exchange rates for common products.

The final incarnation of the Gbara, according to the surviving traditions of northern Guinea, held 32 positions occupied by 28 clans. It functioned as the ruler&#x27;s cabinet, with different dignitaries given different portfolios (war, justice, economy, foreign relations, religion, etc.), and all major social groups of Mande society were represented.

===Territorial administration===
The Mali Empire covered a larger area for a longer period of time than any other West African state before or since. What made this possible was the decentralised nature of administration throughout the state. According to Burkinabé writer Joseph Ki-Zerbo, the farther a person travelled from the capital, the more decentralised the &quot;mansa&quot;&#x27;s power became. Nevertheless, the &quot;mansa&quot; managed to keep tax money and nominal control over the area without agitating his subjects into revolt. The Malian state balanced centralization and decentralization by dividing the empire into a series of provinces and vassal states that had been either conquered or annexed, respectively. These were administered in different ways.

The Mali Empire reached its largest area under the Abubakrids, the lineage of Mansa Musa. Al-Umari, who wrote down a description of Mali based on information given to him by Abu Sa’id &#x27;Otman ed Dukkali (who had lived 35 years in the capital), reported the realm as being square and an eight-month journey from its coast at Tura (at the mouth of the Senegal River) to Muli. Umari also describes the empire as being south of Marrakesh and almost entirely inhabited except for few places. Mali&#x27;s domain also extended into the desert. He describes it as being north of Mali but under its domination implying some sort of vassalage for the Antasar, Yantar&#x27;ras, Medussa and Lemtuna Berber tribes, with garrisons kept at Oualata, Timbuktu, Koumbi, and Gao, and responsibility of governing the Sahara given to the military commander (&quot;sura farin&quot;).

The empire&#x27;s total area included nearly all the land between the Sahara Desert and coastal forests. It spanned the modern-day countries of Senegal, southern Mauritania, Mali, northern Burkina Faso, western Niger, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, the Ivory Coast and northern Ghana. By 1350, the empire covered approximately .

Al-ʿUmari reported that Mali had fourteen provinces. His list does not necessarily accurately reflect the actual organization of the Mali Empire, and the identification of the listed provinces is controversial. Several of the names are spelled in a variety of ways in different manuscripts. Al-ʿUmari&#x27;s list, which is quoted with slight differences by al-Qalqashandi, is as follows:

*Ghana (): Corresponds to the former Ghana Empire.
*Zafun (): Diafunu
*Tirafka (): Probably the same as Tiraqqa, a town on the Niger between Timbuktu and Gao mentioned by several other sources. Alternatively, may be Tiringa, between Kayes and Nioro, or the same as , which may be Futa Toro.
*Takrur (): On 3rd cataract of the Senegal River, north of Jolof. By the 14th century, the term Takrur had become commonly misused by Arab writers.
*Sanghana (): A region surrounding the mouth of the Senegal river. The name of the river may be derived from the name Sanghana.
* () or (): Possibly the Bambuk region, between the Senegal and Faleme rivers, which was a major source of gold, but identification is uncertain.
*Zarqatabana ()
* (): Possibly a typographical error for , referring to the Bambara people.
*Damura ()
*Zagha (): Dia. Ruled by a sultan who was a vassal of the Mansa of Mali.
*Kabura (): Along the Niger upstream of Zagha. Like Zagha, ruled by a sultan who was a vassal of the Mansa of Mali. Identified with Diafarabé by Delafosse and Kaara (south of the Niger, opposite Kokry) by Bazin. Also spelled Kabara or Kabira; not to be confused with Kabara, Timbuktu&#x27;s port on the Niger.
*Bawaghuri (): Possibly Zagra (), ten days&#x27; travel south of Walata.
*Kawkaw (): The city of Gao, which was called Kawkaw by medieval Arabic sources. Formerly an independent kingdom, it was annexed into the Mali Empire by either Mansa Sakura or Mansa Musa. It later became the capital of the Songhai Empire.
*Mali (): The capital province, for which the empire gets its name. Al-&#x27;Umari reports that the capital itself, located in the province of Mali, was called .

Al-ʿUmari also indicates that four Amazigh tribes were subjects of Mali:

*Yantaṣar or Kel Antasar: Located in the vicinity of the Adrar des Ifoghas.
*Tīn Gharās or Yantar&#x27;ras: Correspond to the modern Kel Gres. Located in the vicinity of Tadmekka in medieval times.
*Madūsa: Members of the Sanhaja confederation located on the Niger between Ghana and Tadmekka.
*Lamtūna: Members of the Sanhaja confederation in the vicinity of the Adrar Plateau and Tagant Plateau.

Gomez instead suggests that these tribes would have inhabited territory in the vicinity of Mema, Ghana, and Diafunu.

=== Capital location ===
The identity of the capital city of the Mali Empire is a matter of dispute among historians. Scholars have located the capital in Niani, or somewhere on the Niger, or proposed that it changed several times, that there was no true capital, or even that it lay as far afield as the upper Gambia River in modern-day Senegal. Seemingly contradictory reports written by Arab visitors, a lack of definitive archaeological evidence, and the diversity of oral traditions all contribute to this uncertainty. A particular challenge lies in interpreting early Arabic manuscripts, in which, without vowel markings and diacritics, foreign names can be read in numerous different ways (e.g. Biti, Buti, Yiti, Tati). Ibn Battuta and Leo Africanus both call the capital &quot;Mali.&quot;

Early European writers such as Maurice Delafosse believed that Niani, a city on what is now the border between Guinea and Mali, was the capital for most of the empire&#x27;s history, and this notion has taken hold in the popular imagination. Djibril Tamsir Niane, a Guinean historian, has been a forceful advocate of this position in recent decades. The identification of Niani as imperial capital is rooted in an (possibly erroneous) interpretation of the Arab traveler al Umari&#x27;s work, as well as some oral histories. Extensive archaeological digs have shown that the area was an important trade and manufacturing center in the 15th century, but no firm evidence of royal residence has come to light.

Niani&#x27;s reputation as an imperial capital may derive from its importance in the late imperial period, when the Songhai Empire to the northeast pushed Mali back to the Manding heartland. Several 21st century historians have firmly rejected Niani as a capital candidate based on a lack of archaeological evidence of significant trade activity, clearly described by Arab visitors, particularly during the 14th century, Mali&#x27;s golden age. In fact, there is a conspicuous absence of archaeological samples of any kind from Niani dated to the late 13th through early 15th centuries, suggesting that Niani may have been uninhabited during the heyday of the Mali Empire.

Various sources cite several other cities as capitals of the Mali Empire, some in competition with the Niani hypothesis and others addressing different time periods. A city called Dieriba or Dioliba is sometimes mentioned as the capital or main urban center of the province of Mande in the years before Sundiata, that was later abandoned.

Many oral histories point to a town called Dakajalan as the original home of the Keita clan and Sundiata&#x27;s childhood home and base of operations during the war against the Soso. It may have been located close to modern Kangaba. Mande bards in the region speak of the Dakajalan site, containing Sundiata&#x27;s grave, as sacrosanct. Kangaba became the last refuge of the Keita royal family after the collapse of the Mali Empire, and so has for centuries been associated with Sundiata in the cultural imagination of Mande peoples. If Dakajalan was, in fact, situated near Kangaba, this may also have contributed to their conflation, beginning with Delafosse&#x27;s speculation that the latter may have begun as a suburb of the former.

According to Jules Vidal and Levtzion, citing oral histories from Kangaba and Keyla, another onetime capital was Manikoro or Mali-Kura, founded after the destruction of Niani.

Parallel to this debate, many scholars have argued that the Mali Empire may not have had a permanent &quot;capital&quot; in the sense that the word is used today, and historically was used in the Mediterranean world. Rather, authority would rest with the mansa and his court, wherever he went. Therefore, Arabic visitors may have assigned the &quot;capital&quot; label merely to whatever major city the mansa was based out of at the time of their visit. It has been suggested that the name given in the Arabic sources for the capital of Mali is derived the Manding word &quot;bambi&quot;, meaning &quot;dais&quot;, and as such refers to the &quot;seat of government&quot; in general rather than being the name of a specific city. Such impermanent capitals are a historically widespread phenomenon, having occurred in other parts of Africa such as Ethiopia, as well as outside Africa, such as in the Holy Roman Empire.

===Imperial Regalia===

The Mansas of Mali used several symbols to demonstrate their power and influence. A red banner struck with a golden disc, referred to as the &#x27;Mali djondjon&#x27; or the &#x27;Sun Banner&#x27; of Sundiata, appears in oral histories of his coronation. Written sources have Mansa Musa using a similar banner, &#x27;with yellow symbols (&quot;shi’ār&quot;) on a red background&#x27;, during his visit to Cairo, as well as a parasol.

Ibn Battuta records the Mansa using golden and silver lances as imperial regalia. Other royal items included a ruler&#x27;s cap, slippers, arrows, and bow. The material of which they were made indicated the rank of the holder: gold was the highest, and reserved for the Mansa, followed in descending order by silver, brass, iron, and wood. The rulers of Kaabu held a silver lance, for example, while the king of Guinala, one of their subordinates, held a bow and arrows of iron.

==Economy==

===Agriculture===
The majority of the population were farmers, with this being the base of the economy, and food was abundant. Whilst cattle-rearing was a speciality of the Fulani, peoples of the Niger were raising sheep, goats, and cattle by the 14th century. The Bozo, Somono, and Sorko people specialised in fishing.

===Crafts===
Iron was abundant and smiths manufactured farming tools and weapons. Shoemaker clans resided in the south. In the north weaving flourished, owing to cotton fields in regions such as Casamance, and the Soninke and Takrur peoples specially dyed their cloths indigo. &quot;Siaki&quot; (goldsmiths) were honoured.

===Trade===
Trade was a significant factor to the rise and success of Mali. Its height coincided with the period when Timbuktu came under the Mansa&#x27;s control. The empire taxed every ounce of gold, copper and salt that entered its borders, with kola nuts also bearing importance. By the 14th century, a &quot;pax mandinka&quot; reigned in West Africa, allowing trade to flourish.

There was no standard currency throughout the realm, but several forms were used. The Sahelian and Saharan towns of the Mali Empire were staging posts in the long-distance caravan trade and trading centres for various West African products. At Taghaza, for example, salt was exchanged; at Takedda, copper. Ibn Battuta observed the use of slaves in both towns. During most of his journey, Ibn Battuta travelled with a retinue that included slaves, most of whom carried goods for trade. On the return from Takedda to Morocco, his caravan transported 600 female slaves, suggesting that slavery was a substantial part of the commercial activity of the empire.

===Gold===
Mali&#x27;s wealth in gold did not primarily come from direct rule of gold-producing regions, but rather from tribute and trade with the regions where gold was found. Gold nuggets were the exclusive property of the &quot;mansa&quot; and were illegal to trade within his borders. All gold was immediately handed over to the imperial treasury in return for an equal value of gold dust. Gold dust had been weighed and bagged for use at least since the time of the Ghana Empire. Mali borrowed the practice to stem inflation, since it was so prominent in the region. The most common measure for gold within the realm was the &quot;mithqal&quot; (4.5 grams of gold). This term was used interchangeably with &quot;dinar&quot;, though it is unclear if coined currency was used in the empire. Gold dust was used all over the empire, but was not valued equally in all regions.

By the beginning of the 14th century, Mali was the source of almost half the Old World&#x27;s gold exported from mines in Bambuk, Boure and Galam. Gold mines in Boure, which is located in present-day Guinea, were discovered sometime near the end of the 12th century.

=== Salt ===
Salt, another critical trade good, was as valuable, if not more valuable, than gold in sub-Saharan Africa. It was cut into pieces and spent on goods with close to equal buying power throughout the empire. While it was as good as gold in the north, it was even better in the south, as it was rare there. Every year merchants entered Mali via Oualata with camel loads of salt to sell in the capital. Ibn Battuta had written that in Taghaza, one of Mali&#x27;s most important salt mines, there were no trees, only sand and the salt mines. Nobody lived in the area except the Musafa servants who sug the salt and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar&#x27;a valley, camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan. The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins. The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs, two of which were loaded onto each camel where they would be taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold. The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs. According to Ibn Battuta one camel load of salt sold at Walata for 8–10 &quot;mithqals&quot; of gold, but in Mali proper it was worth 20–30 ducats and sometimes even 40.

=== Copper ===
Copper was also a valued commodity in imperial Mali. According to Ibn Battuta, copper was mined from Takedda in the north and traded by the bar in the south for gold. Contemporary sources claim 60 copper bars traded for 100 dinars of gold. The Akan would trade gold for two thirds its weight in copper. Copper was also traded to Benin, Ife and Nri.

==Military==
The number and frequency of conquests in the late 13th century and throughout the 14th century indicate the Kolonkan &quot;mansas&quot; inherited and/or developed a capable military. Sundjata is credited with at least the initial organisation of the Manding military. However, it went through radical changes before reaching the legendary proportions proclaimed by its subjects. As a result of steady tax revenue and stable government beginning in the last quarter of the 13th century, the Mali Empire was able to project its power throughout its own extensive domain and beyond. It had a well-organised army with an elite corps of horsemen and many foot soldiers in each battalion. An army was required to guard the borders to protect its flourishing trade. Evidence of cavalry in terracotta figures suggest the empire&#x27;s prosperous economy as horses are not indigenous to Africa.

===Strength===
The Mali Empire maintained a semi-professional, full-time army in order to defend its borders. The entire nation was mobilised, with each clan obligated to provide a quota of fighting-age men. These men had to be of the &quot;horon&quot; (freemen) caste and appear with their own arms. Historians who lived during the height and decline of the Mali Empire consistently record its standing army peaking at 100,000, with 10,000 of that number being made up of cavalry. With the help of the river clans, this army could be deployed throughout the realm on short notice. Numerous sources attest that the inland waterways of West Africa saw extensive use of war canoes and vessels used for war transport where permitted by the environment. Most West African canoes were of single-log construction, carved and dug out from one massive tree trunk.

=== Order of battle ===
The army of the Mali Empire during the 14th century was divided into northern and southern commands led by the Farim-Soura and Sankar-Zouma, respectively. Both of these men were part of Mali&#x27;s warrior elite known as the &quot;ton-ta-jon-ta-ni-woro&quot; (&quot;sixteen carriers of quivers&quot;). Each representative or &quot;ton-tigi&quot; (&quot;quiver-master&quot;) provided counsel to the &quot;mansa&quot; at the Gbara, but only these two &quot;ton-tigi&quot; held such wide-ranging power.

The &quot;ton-tigi&quot; belonged to an elite force of cavalry commanders called the &quot;farari&quot; (&quot;brave men&quot;). Each individual &quot;farariya&quot; (&quot;brave&quot;) had a number of infantry officers beneath them called &quot;kèlè-koun&quot; or &quot;dùùkùnàsi&quot;. A &quot;kèlè-koun&quot; led free troops into battle alongside a &quot;farima&quot; (&quot;brave man&quot;) during campaign. A &quot;dùùkùnàsi&quot; performed the same function except with slave troops called &quot;sofa&quot; (&quot;guardian of the horse&quot;) and under the command of a &quot;farimba&quot; (&quot;great brave man&quot;). The &quot;farimba&quot; operated from a garrison with an almost entirely slave force, while a &quot;farima&quot; functioned on field with virtually all freemen.

=== Equipment ===
The army of the Mali Empire used of a wide variety of weapons depending largely on where the troops originated. Only &quot;sofa&quot; were equipped by the state, using bows and poisoned arrows. Free warriors from the north (Mandekalu or otherwise) were usually equipped with large reed or animal hide shields and a stabbing spear that was called a &quot;tamba&quot;. Free warriors from the south came armed with bows and poisonous arrows. The bow figured prominently in Mandinka warfare and was a symbol of military force throughout the culture. Bowmen formed a large portion of the field army as well as the garrison. Three bowmen supporting one spearman was the ratio in Kaabu and the Gambia by the mid-16th century. Equipped with two quivers and a knife fastened to the back of their arm, Mandinka bowmen used barbed, iron-tipped arrows that were usually poisoned. They also used flaming arrows for siege warfare. While spears and bows were the mainstay of the infantry, swords and lances of local or foreign manufacture were the choice weapons of the cavalry. Ibn Battuta comments on festival demonstrations of swordplay before the &quot;mansa&quot; by his retainers including the royal interpreter. Another common weapon of Mandekalu warriors was the poison javelin used in skirmishes. Imperial Mali&#x27;s horsemen also used iron helmet and mail armour for defence as well as shields similar to those of the infantry.

==Legacy==
The Mali Empire had a massive effect on the development of West Africa societies even well after its peak. Its expansion spread Mande culture and the Mande languages from the mouth of the Gambia River to what is now Burkina Faso and, particularly through Dyula traders, from the Niger loop to the trading centers on the south coast. All across this region, political institutions with Malian structures and terminology survived to the colonial period and beyond. 
===Architecture===
Imperial Malian architecture was characterised by Sudano-Sahelian architecture. This style is distinguished by the use of mudbricks and an adobe plaster, with large wooden-log support beams that jut out from the wall face for large buildings such as mosques or palaces.

The dating of the original Great Mosque of Djenné, the most prominent example of this style today, is uncertain but thought to date as early as 1200 to as late as 1330. The current structure, built under French colonial rule by the traditional Djenne masons, dates from 1907 and recreates some of the original&#x27;s design and on the original plan. The earliest document mentioning the old Djenne mosque is Abd al-Sadi&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid seventeenth century. The &quot;tarikh&quot; states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque; he then built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side.

The Sudano-Sahelian influence was particularly widely incorporated during the rule of Mansa Musa I, who constructed many architectural projects, including the Great Mosque of Gao and Royal Palace in Timbuktu, which was built with the assistance of Ishaak al-Tuedjin, an architect brought by Musa from his pilgrimage to Mecca.

<text>The M45 is a motorway in Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, England and is long. It runs between junction 17 of the M1 motorway south east of Rugby and a junction with the A45 road southwest of Rugby. It has one of the lowest traffic volumes of the United Kingdom motorway system.

==History==
Built in 1959 when the M1 (as part of a link from London to Birmingham) went as far as Junction 18, the M45 was designed to dissipate some of the motorway traffic before the M1 terminated. Its equivalent at the southern end of the M1 is the former M10, which was downgraded on 1 May 2009 to become part of the A414.

As the signposted route to Birmingham, accompanied by a boom in private motor ownership in the 1960s, the M45 (and its effective continuation, the final or so along the predominantly dual carriageway A45), formed a key leg of one of the busiest roads in Britain.

In 1972, the opening of the M6 parallel to the north provided a much faster route through to the West Midlands from London. Most traffic diverted to this route, and since January 1991 additional West Midlands traffic, whether to the south of that region, or from the south side of London has often used the M40 motorway parallel to the south, leaving the route with only a fraction of its previous traffic.

A limited-access junction (Eastbound exit and Westbound entry) was added in September 1991, around two-thirds of the way along from the M1, south of Dunchurch, the main southern suburban village (to Rugby) nearby. Apart from this, the motorway is very much in its &#x27;as-built&#x27; condition and unlike its feeder motorway, the M1 its land use has not expanded, in a county that has three motorways running east–west almost wholly across it, Warwickshire. The choice of routes means that logistics operations are an important part of the economy of Coventry and Rugby.

<text>The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) is a prehistoric species of bear that lived in Europe and Asia during the Pleistocene and became extinct about 24,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Both the word &quot;cave&quot; and the scientific name &quot;spelaeus&quot; are used because fossils of this species were mostly found in caves. This reflects the views of experts that cave bears spent more time in caves than the brown bear, frequently using them to hibernate during the winter months. Unlike brown bears, cave bears are thought to have been almost entirely or exclusively herbivorous.

Cave bears exhibit a great degree of size, morphological and genetic varability, and Late Pleistocene cave bears are often (though not universally) considered to be species complex of up to 6 different species.

==Taxonomy==

Cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by Johann Friedrich Esper, in his book &quot;Newly Discovered Zoolites of Unknown Four Footed Animals&quot;. While scientists at the time considered that the skeletons could belong to apes, canids, felids, or even dragons or unicorns, Esper postulated that they actually belonged to polar bears. Twenty years later, Johann Christian Rosenmüller, an anatomist at Leipzig University, gave the species its binomial name. The bones were so numerous that most researchers had little regard for them. During World War I, with the scarcity of phosphate dung, earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred was used as a source of phosphates. When the &quot;dragon caves&quot; in Austria’s Styria region were exploited for this purpose, only the skulls and leg bones were kept.

Many caves in Central Europe North AmericA, ALASKA have skeletons of cave bears inside, such as the &quot;Heinrichshöhle&quot; in Hemer and the &quot;Dechenhöhle&quot; in Iserlohn, Germany. A complete skeleton, five complete skulls, and 18 other bones were found inside Kletno Bear Cave, in 1966 in Poland. In Romania, in a cave called Bears&#x27; Cave, 140 cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983.

Remains assigned to &quot;cave bears&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; from the Late Pleistocene exhibit a strong degree of morphological and size variability, and have often been assigned to their own species, including &quot;Ursus rossicus&quot; (Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Siberia)&quot;, Ursus ingressus&quot; (Central Europe to the Urals), &quot;Ursus kanivetz,&quot; (Urals) &quot;Ursus kudarensis&quot; (the Caucasus), &quot;Ursus eremus&quot; (Central Europe, possibly a subspecies of &quot;U. spelaeus&quot; s.s.) and &quot;Ursus spelaeus&quot; sensu stricto (Western, Central and Southeast Europe). These populations/species show considerable genetic divergence from each other, (with genetic divergences estimated at hundreds of thousands to a million years) though whether these species should be regarded as synonyms of &quot;U. speleus&quot; is debated.

===Evolution===
Both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the Plio-Pleistocene Etruscan bear (&quot;Ursus etruscus&quot;) that lived about 5.3 Mya to 100,000 years ago. The last common ancestor of cave bears and brown bears lived between 1.2–1.4 Mya. Middle Pleistocene remains of the cave bear lineage are assigned to &quot;Ursus deningeri&quot; (Deninger&#x27;s bear), which is known from remains spanning from Europe to China. The transition between Deninger&#x27;s bear and the cave bear is given as the last interglacial, although the boundary between these forms is arbitrary, and intermediate or transitional taxa have been proposed, e.g. &quot;Ursus spelaeus deningeroides&quot;, while other authorities consider both taxa to be chronological variants of the same species.

Cave bears found anywhere will vary in age, thus facilitating investigations into evolutionary trends. The three anterior premolars were gradually reduced, then disappeared, possibly in response to a largely vegetarian diet. In a fourth of the skulls found in the &quot;Conturines&quot;, the third premolar is still present, while more derived specimens elsewhere lack it. The last remaining premolar became conjugated with the true molars, enlarging the crown and granting it more cusps and cutting borders. This phenomenon, called &quot;molarization&quot;, improved the mastication capacities of the molars, facilitating the processing of tough vegetation. This allowed the cave bear to gain more energy for hibernation, while eating less than its ancestors.

In 2005, scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear DNA of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago. The procedure used genomic DNA extracted from one of the animal&#x27;s teeth. Sequencing the DNA directly (rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction), the scientists recovered 21 cave bear genes from remains that did not yield significant amounts of DNA with traditional techniques. This study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial DNA extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old. Both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than it was to the American black bear, but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified, and before the split of brown bears and polar bears. The divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is about 1.2–1.4 Mya. However, a recent study showed that both species had some hybridization between them.

==Description==

The cave bear had a very broad, domed skull with a steep forehead; its stout body had long thighs, massive shins and in-turning feet, making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear. Cave bears were comparable in size to, or larger than, the largest modern-day bears, measuring up to in length. The average weight for males was , while females weighed . Of cave bear skeletons in museums, 90% are classified as male due to a misconception that the female skeletons were merely &quot;dwarfs&quot;. Cave bears grew larger during glaciations and smaller during interglacials, probably to adjust heat loss rate.

Cave bears of the last Ice Age lacked the usual two or three premolars present in other bears; to compensate, the last molar is very elongated, with supplementary cusps. The humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear, as were the femora of females. The femora of male cave bears, however, bore more similarities in size to those of Kodiak bears.

==Behaviour==

===Dietary habits===

Cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species, suggesting a diet of tough materials. However, tubers and other gritty food, which cause distinctive tooth wear in modern brown bears, do not appear to have constituted a major part of cave bears&#x27; diets on the basis of dental microwear analysis. Seed fruits are documented to have been consumed by cave bears.

The morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus, including loss of premolars, have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the Eurasian brown bear. Indeed, a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology. Results obtained on the stable isotopes of cave bear bones also point to a largely vegetarian diet in having low levels of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, which are accumulated at a faster rate by carnivores as opposed to herbivores.

However, some evidence points toward the occasional inclusion of animal protein in cave bear diets. For example, toothmarks on cave bear remains in areas where cave bears are the only recorded potential carnivores suggests occasional cannibalistic scavenging, possibly on individuals that died during hibernation, and dental microwear analysis indicates the cave bear may have fed on a greater quantity of bone than its contemporary, the smaller Eurasian brown bear. The dental microwear patterns of cave bear molars from the northeastern Iberian Peninsula show that cave bears may have consumed more meat in the days and weeks leading up to hibernation. Additionally, cave bear remains from Peștera cu Oase in the southwestern tip of the Romanian part of the Carpathian Mountains had elevated levels of nitrogen-15 in their bones, indicative of omnivorous diets, although the values are within the range of those found for the strictly herbivorous mammoth. One isotopic study concluded that cave bears displayed omnivorous habits similar to those of modern brown bears.

Although the current prevailing opinion concludes that cave bears were largely herbivorous, and more so than any modern species of the genus &quot;Ursus&quot;, increasing evidence points to omnivorous diets, based both on regional variability of isotopic composition of bone remains indicative of dietary plasticity, and on a recent re-evaluation of craniodental morphology that places the cave bear squarely among omnivorous modern bear species with respect to its skull and tooth shapes.

===Mortality===

Death during hibernation was a common end for cave bears, mainly befalling specimens that failed ecologically during the summer season through inexperience, sickness or old age. Some cave bear bones show signs of numerous ailments, including spinal fusion, bone tumours, cavities, tooth resorption, necrosis (particularly in younger specimens), osteomyelitis, periostitis, rickets and kidney stones. There is also evidence that cave bears suffered from tuberculosis. Male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken bacula, probably due to fighting during the breeding season. Cave bear longevity is unknown, though it has been estimated that they seldom exceeded twenty years of age. Paleontologists doubt adult cave bears had any natural predators, save for pack-hunting wolves and cave hyenas, which would probably have attacked sick or infirm individuals. Cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the disarticulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for the hyenas, especially at the end of the winter, when food was scarce. The presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons, deep in cave bear dens, indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears, with some dying in the attempt.

==Range and habitat==
The cave bear&#x27;s range stretched across Europe; from Spain and the British Isles in the west, Belgium, Italy, parts of Germany, Poland, the Balkans, Romania, Georgia, and parts of Russia, including the Caucasus; and northern Iran. No traces of cave bears have been found in the northern British Isles, Scandinavia or the Baltic countries, which were all covered in extensive glaciers at the time. The largest numbers of cave bear remains have been found in Austria, Switzerland, northern Italy, northern Spain, southern France, and Romania, roughly corresponding with the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians. The huge number of bones found in southern, central and eastern Europe has led some scientists to think Europe may have once had herds of cave bears. Others, however, point out that, though some caves have thousands of bones, they were accumulated over a period of 100,000 years or more, thus requiring only two deaths in a cave per year to account for the large numbers.

The cave bear inhabited low mountainous areas, especially in regions rich in limestone caves. They seem to have avoided open plains, preferring forested or forest-edged terrains.

==Relationship with humans==
Between the years 1917 and 1923, the Drachenloch cave in Switzerland was excavated by Emil Bächler. The excavation uncovered more than 30,000 cave bear skeletons. It also uncovered a stone chest or cist, consisting of a low wall built from limestone slabs near a cave wall with a number of bear skulls inside it. A cave bear skull was also found with a femur bone from another bear stuck inside it. Scholars speculated that it was proof of prehistoric human religious rites involving the cave bear, or that the Drachenloch cave bears were hunted as part of a hunting ritual, or that the skulls were kept as trophies. In &quot;Archaeology, Religion, Ritual&quot; (2004), archaeologist Timothy Insoll strongly questions whether the Drachenloch finds in the stone cist were the result of human interaction. Insoll states that the evidence for religious practices involving cave bears in this time period is &quot;far from convincing&quot;. Insoll also states that comparisons with the religious practices involving bears that are known from historic times are invalid.

A similar phenomenon was encountered in Regourdou, southern France. A rectangular pit contained the remains of at least twenty bears, covered by a massive stone slab. The remains of a Neanderthal lay nearby in another stone pit, with various objects, including a bear humerus, a scraper, a core, and some flakes, which were interpreted as grave offerings.

An unusual discovery in a deep chamber of Basura Cave in Savona, Italy, is thought to be related to cave bear worship, because there is a vaguely zoomorphic stalagmite surrounded by clay pellets. It is thought to have been used by Neanderthals for a ceremony; bear bones scattered on the floor further suggests it was likely to have had some sort of ritual purpose.

==Extinction==

Reassessment of fossils in 2019 indicate that the cave bear probably died out 24,000 years ago. A complex set of factors, rather than a single factor, are suggested to have led to the extinction.

Compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the Last Glacial Maximum, the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range. This was suggested as an explanation as to why it died out so much earlier than the rest. Some experts have disputed this claim, as the cave bear had survived multiple climate changes prior to extinction. Additionally, mitochondrial DNA research indicated that the genetic decline of the cave bear began long before it became extinct, demonstrating habitat loss due to climate change was not responsible. Finally, high δ15N levels were found in cave bear bones from Romania, indicating wider dietary possibilities than previously believed.

Some evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations, such as thickets, for this purpose, in contrast to the more versatile brown bear. This specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves. Therefore, as human populations slowly increased, the cave bear faced a shrinking pool of suitable caves, and slowly faded away to extinction, as both Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans sought out caves as living quarters, depriving the cave bear of vital habitat. This hypothesis is being researched . According to the research study, published in the journal &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot;, radiocarbon dating of the fossil remains shows that the cave bear ceased to be abundant in Central Europe around 35,000 years ago.

In addition to environmental change, human hunting has also been implicated in the ultimate extinction of the cave bear. In 2019, the results of a large scale study of 81 bone specimens (resulting in 59 new sequences) and 64 previously published complete mitochondrial genomes of cave bear mitochondrial DNA remains found in Switzerland, Poland, France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Serbia, indicated that the cave bear population drastically declined starting around 40,000 years ago at the onset of the Aurignacian, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans. It was concluded that human hunting and/or competition played a major role in their decline and ultimate disappearance, and that climate change was not likely to have been the dominant factor. In a study of Spanish cave bear mtDNA, each cave used by cave bears was found to contain almost exclusively a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes, indicating a homing behaviour for birthing and hibernation. The conclusion of this study is cave bears could not easily colonize new sites when in competition with humans for these resources.

Overhunting by humans has been dismissed by some as human populations at the time were too small to pose a serious threat to the cave bear&#x27;s survival. However, the two species may have competed for living space in caves. The Chauvet Cave contains around 300 &quot;bear hollows&quot; created by cave bear hibernation. Unlike brown bears, cave bears are seldom represented in cave paintings, leading some experts to believe the cave bear may have been avoided by human hunters or their habitat preferences may not have overlapped. Paleontologist Björn Kurtén hypothesized cave bear populations were fragmented and under stress even before the advent of the glaciers. Populations living south of the Alps possibly survived significantly longer.

<doc id="182052" wikidata="Q335138" url="?curid=182052" title="FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan">
<text>Field Marshal FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, (30 September 1788 – 28 June 1855), known before 1852 as Lord FitzRoy Somerset, was a British Army officer. When a junior officer, he served in the Peninsular War and the Waterloo campaign, latterly as military secretary to the Duke of Wellington. He also took part in politics as Tory Member of Parliament for Truro, before becoming Master-General of the Ordnance.

He became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea in 1854: his primary objective was to defend Constantinople, and he was also ordered to besiege the Russian port of Sevastopol. After an early success at the Battle of the Alma, a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Despite further success at the Battle of Inkerman, a poorly coordinated allied assault on Sevastopol in June 1855 was a complete failure. Raglan died later that month, after having dysentery and depression.

==Early life==
Born at Badminton House in Gloucestershire as the ninth and youngest son of Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort and his wife Elizabeth (daughter of Admiral Edward Boscawen), Somerset was educated at Westminster School and was commissioned as a cornet in the 4th Light Dragoons on 16 June 1804.

==Military career==
Promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1805, Somerset accompanied Sir Arthur Paget on his visit to Sultan Selim III of the Ottoman Empire, who had been aligning himself too closely with France, in 1807. He became a captain in the 43rd Regiment of Foot on 5 May 1808 shortly before his appointment as aide-de-camp to Sir Arthur Wellesley in July 1808. Somerset accompanied Wellesley&#x27;s Army when it was sent to Portugal later that month. Somerset fought at the Second Battle of Porto in May 1809, the Battle of Talavera in July 1809 and the Battle of Bussaco (where he was wounded) in September 1810. He was appointed acting military secretary to Wellington in November 1810 and fought with him at the Battle of Pombal in March 1811, the Battle of Sabugal in April 1811 and the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro in May 1811. Promoted to brevet major on 9 June 1811, he also took part in the Battle of El Bodón in September 1811. He specially distinguished himself at the storming of Badajoz in March 1812 by being the first to mount the breach and by helping to secure the surrender of the French Governor and was duly promoted to lieutenant colonel on 27 April 1812.

Somerset went on to fight with Wellington at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812, the Siege of Burgos in September 1812 and the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 as well as the Siege of San Sebastián in July 1813, the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813 and the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813. They also fought together at the Battle of the Nive in December 1813, the Battle of Orthez in February 1814 and the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814. Following Wellington&#x27;s appointment as British Ambassador during the short period of Bourbon restoration, Somerset assumed a role as his secretary at the Embassy on 5 July 1814. Somerset transferred to the 1st Guards on 25 July 1814 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815.

Somerset also saw action during the Hundred Days: he served on Wellington&#x27;s staff at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and at the Battle of Waterloo two days later where he had to have his right arm amputated (and then demanded his arm back so he could retrieve the ring that his wife had given him). Faced with the difficulties in dressing following the amputation, he invented the so-called Raglan sleeve, sewn from the collar rather than the shoulder.

Promoted to colonel and appointed an aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent on 28 August 1815, he was appointed a Knight of the Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph on 3 October 1815. He remained with the Army of Occupation in France until May 1816 when he returned to the post of secretary at the British Embassy in Paris.

Somerset was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Truro in 1818 and became Wellington&#x27;s secretary in the latter&#x27;s new capacity as Master-General of the Ordnance in 1819. Somerset lost his seat at the general election in 1820 but, having been promoted to major-general on 27 May 1825, regained his seat in Parliament in 1826. Following Wellington&#x27;s appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in January 1827 Somerset became Military Secretary in August 1827. He stood down from Parliament in 1829 and was promoted to lieutenant-general on 28 June 1838. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 24 September 1852, he became Master-General of the Ordnance on 30 September 1852 and was raised to the peerage as Baron Raglan of Raglan in the County of Monmouthshire on 11 October 1852.

==Crimean War==
Raglan became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea with the temporary rank of full general on 21 February 1854 and was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 20 June 1854. While Raglan&#x27;s primary objective was to defend Constantinople he was ordered by the Duke of Newcastle, who was at the time Secretary of State for War, to besiege the Russian port of Sevastopol &quot;unless it could not be undertaken with a reasonable prospect of success&quot;. An Anglo-French force under the joint command of Somerset and General Jacques St. Arnaud defeated General Alexander Menshikov&#x27;s Russian army at the Battle of the Alma in September 1854.

During the campaign Raglan had the abstracted habit of referring to the Russian enemies as &quot;the French&quot;. While this eccentricity is often cited as evidence of his unsuitability for high command, he did in fact speak fluent French and relations between the two allies in the field were good.

At the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854, Raglan issued an order to the Earl of Lucan, his cavalry commander, who in turn ordered the Earl of Cardigan, a subordinate commander who happened to be Lucan&#x27;s brother-in-law and who detested him, to lead the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade leading to some 278 British casualties. Despite an indecisive result at Balaclava the British and French allied army gained a victory at the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and Raglan was promoted to the rank of field marshal on 5 November 1854. He was also awarded the Ottoman Empire Order of the Medjidie, 1st Class on 15 May 1855.

Raglan was blamed by the press and the government for the sufferings of the British soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter during the Siege of Sevastopol owing to shortages of food and clothing although this, in part, was the fault of the home authorities who failed to provide adequate logistical support. A piecemeal allied assault on Sevastopol on 18 June 1855 was a complete failure. The anxieties of the siege began to seriously undermine Raglan&#x27;s health and he died unexpectedly on 28 June 1855, while suffering with dysentery and depression. His body was embalmed, his heart buried in the garden of his headquarters in Sevastopol, and his body brought home and interred at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton.

Raglan had also served as honorary colonel of the 53rd Regiment of Foot and then as honorary colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards (The Blues). Cefntilla Court, Llandenny was built as a lasting memorial to Somerset in 1858: an inscription over the porch there reads:

A blue plaque was erected outside Raglan&#x27;s house at Stanhope Gate in London in 1911.

==Family==
On 6 August 1814 Somerset married Lady Emily Harriet Wellesley-Pole (daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, and niece of the Duke of Wellington). They had three sons, and two daughters:

* Charlotte Caroline Elizabeth Somerset (16 May 1815 - 1906)
* Arthur William FitzRoy Somerset (6 May 1816 – 21 December 1845)
* Richard Henry Fitzroy Somerset, 2nd Baron Raglan (24 May 1817 – 3 May 1884)
* Frederick John Fitzroy Somerset (8 Mar 1821 - 26 Nov 1824)
* Katherine Anne Emily Cecilia Somerset (31 Aug 1824 - 1915)

==Ancestry==
==Cultural depictions==
Raglan was portrayed by John Gielgud in the film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968). Lord Raglan is a character in George MacDonald Fraser&#x27;s novel &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot;, in which he is described as a kindly, but ineffectual man, and completely unsuited for his command.

<doc id="182053" wikidata="Q5276395" url="?curid=182053" title="Gamer">
<text>A gamer is someone who plays interactive games, either video games, tabletop role-playing games, skill-based card games, or any combination thereof, and who often plays for extended periods of time. Originally a hobby, gaming has evolved into a profession for some, with some gamers routinely competing in games for money, prizes, or awards. In some countries, such as the US, UK, and Australia, the term &quot;gaming&quot; can refer to legalized gambling, which can take both traditional and digital forms, such as through online gambling. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch virtual communities, as well as in-person social clubs. In 2021, there were an estimated 3.24 billion gamers across the globe.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;gamer&quot; originally meant &quot;gambler&quot;, and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of Walsall, England, referred to &quot;any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer&quot;. However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as wargames. Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool. When &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released, it was originally marketed as a wargame, but later was described by its creators as a role-playing game. They called their players &quot;gamers&quot; and this is where the word changed definition from someone who gambles to someone who plays board games and/or video games.

==Categories==

In the United States as of 2018, 28% of gamers are under 18, 29% are 18–35, 20% are 36-49 and 23% are over 50. In the UK as of 2014, 29% are under 18, 32% are 18-35 and 39% are over 36. According to Pew Research Center, 49% of adults have played a video game at some point in their life and those who have are more likely to let their children or future children play. Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female, but men are more likely to call themselves a gamer. As of 2019, the average gamer is 33 years old.

===Female gamer/gamer girl===

A female gamer, or gamer girl or girl gamer, is any female who regularly engages in playing video games. According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009, 40% of the game playing population is female, and women 18 or older comprise 34% of all gamers. Also, the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43%, up 4% from 2004. The same study shows that 48% of game purchasers are female.
According to a 2015 Pew survey, 6% of women in the United States identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men, and 48% of women and 50% of men play video games. Usage of the term &quot;girl gamer&quot; is controversial. Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, while others see it as non-descriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group. However it is generally understood that the term &quot;girl gamer&quot; implies that it is a girl who plays video games.

==Psychology==

Shigeru Miyamoto says that &quot;I think that first a game needs a sense of accomplishment. And you have to have a sense that you have done something, so that you get that sense of satisfaction of completing something.&quot;

In April 2020, researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as Olympian athletes.

Escapism is a major factor in why individuals enjoy gaming. This idea of being in another world while gaming has become very common with gamers, these video games create a new world where these gamers feel they fit in and can control what is going on. Gaming is a form of escapism, Hideo Kojima states that &quot;If the player isn&#x27;t tricked into believing that the world is real, then there&#x27;s no point in making the game.&quot;

==Types and demographics==

===Sexes===
Two highly controversial issues surrounding the gaming world in today&#x27;s day and age are ideas of gender roles and LGBTQ+ involvement in the gaming industry. It is first important to understand the difference between men and women in the world of gaming. Although roughly the same number of men and women play games, the stereotype of a gamer is one that is predominantly male. A justification sometimes given for this is that while many women occasionally play games, they should not be considered &quot;true&quot; gamers because they tend to play games that are more casual and require fewer skills than men. This stereotype is perpetuated by the fact that at a professional level, most of the teams competing are composed of men, while female gamers of moderate skill are rendered invisible. The average gamer is seen as a male player who is usually Caucasian. A study has shown 48% of game purchases are from female consumers, but in 2015 only 6% of women that are in the U.S. identify as a gamer. Ideas behind the word &quot;girl gamer&quot; tend to spark a contentious reaction, and the use of this name has been supported as a title that is seen as a reappropriated term.

===Gaymer===
Besides the distinction of a &quot;girl gamer&quot; from a &quot;male gamer&quot;, there is also a common understanding as stereotype of a &quot;Gaymer.&quot; A Gaymer is a depiction of a gay gamer, and someone who identifies their sexual orientation to be a part of the LGBT (gay, bisexual, lesbian, or transgender) community while participating in video games. The concept of Gaymers is a part of two surveys in 2006 and 2009. The 2006 survey took note of the levels of detriment that Gaymers may have experienced, and the 2009 survey kept detail of the content that Gaymers would find to be normalized in video games. Staying the topic of ideas behind gaming and the relationship with the LGBTQ community, it has been noted that video games are starting to develop more characters and depictions of members from this specific community. Some of the topics of these specific LGBTQ-friendly video games include such ideas as coming out stories and queer relationships. These games are also providing the option of character creation with different forms of gender expression along with more LGBTQ romance options. One example of these games in the LGBTQ+ realm of dating would be &quot;Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator,&quot; released in 2017. The game had many queer individuals debating, but the overall representation of the game was applauded by many LGBTQ+ people due to its accurate presentation and the way that it provided comfort to people of many sexualities. Having more of these gender- and sexuality-friendly games is providing LGBTQ+ members with a safe space to feel welcome and explore their queerness in a more confident manner.

=== Dedication spectrum===
It is common for games media, games industry analysts, and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories. These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming, sometimes by primary type of game played, and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors. There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories, though many attempts have been made to formalize them. An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows.

* &quot;Newbie&quot;: (commonly shortened to &quot;noob&quot;, &quot;n00b&quot;, or &quot;newb&quot;) A slang term for a or to a certain game, or to gaming in general.
* &quot;Casual gamer&quot;: The term often used for gamers who primarily play casual games, but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers. Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay, or play more involved games in short sessions, or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers. The types of game that casual gamers play vary, and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console. Notable examples of casual games include &quot;The Sims&quot; and &quot;Nintendogs&quot;. Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers, as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female. Fitness gamers, who play motion-based exercise games, are also seen as casual gamers.
* &quot;Core gamer&quot;: (also mid-core) A player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games, but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer. The mid-core gamer enjoys games but may not finish every game they buy and is a target consumer. Former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata stated that they designed the Wii U to cater to core gamers who are in between the casual and hardcore categories. A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games. James Hursthouse, the founder of Roadhouse Interactive, credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces, whereas Jon Radoff of Disruptor Beam compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as television.
* &quot;Hardcore gamer&quot;: Ernest Adams and Scott Kim have proposed classification metrics to distinguish &quot;hardcore gamers&quot; from casual gamers, emphasizing action, competition, complexity, gaming communities, and staying abreast of developments in hardware and software. Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers, or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague.

===Professional gamer===
Professional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries. Usually, such individuals deeply study the game in order to master it and usually to play in competitions like esports. A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer, such as a hardcore gamer, if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type. In countries of Asia, particularly South Korea and China, professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than a year. In 2006, Major League Gaming contracted several &quot;Halo 2&quot; players including Tom &quot;Tsquared&quot; Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with $250,000 yearly deals. Many professional gamers find that competitions are able to provide a substantial amount of money to support themselves. However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online live streaming of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer. Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as Twitch and YouTube. Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown through retired professional &quot;League of Legends&quot; player Wei &quot;CaoMei&quot; Han-Dong. Han-Dong had decided to retire from esports due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming. His yearly salary through the Battle Flag TV live streaming service increased his pay to roughly $800,000 yearly. Live streaming can be seen by many as a truly lucrative way for professional gamers to make money in a way that can also lessen the pressure in the competitive scene. We are seeing a rapid increase in the young video game players wanting to be professional gamers instead of the &quot;pro athlete&quot;. The career path of becoming a professional gamer is open for anyone any race, gender, and background. The gaming community now has developed at a much faster rate and now is being considered esports. These more serious gamers are professional gamers; they are individuals that take the average everyday gaming much more seriously and profit from how they perform.

Although the LGBTQ+ gamers are starting to make more of a mark in the gaming world, there are still many disadvantages to this process. Homophobia in the gaming world does tend to take a toll on the problem of an equally shared gaming experience. This is both an issue within the games industry and many areas of the games culture. The brings back the thought of importance for increasing LGBTQ representation in games, especially with such events as GaymerX. There is a study called the online roulette survey that shows that queer gamers are at a disadvantage financially for the fact that the highest earning professional gamers in the LGBTQ+ community bring in less money than popular heterosexual professional gamers. This highlights that not only is there a huge divide between male and female counterparts in the gaming industry, but there also happens to be a great divide when it comes to sexual preference in the gaming world, especially when it comes to the professional gaming scene. Often, tech companies&#x27; privilege men&#x27;s point of view over women&#x27;s participation in tech and their consumption, which could be seen as vice versa for people of a homosexual and heterosexual identity. The two topics will always hold a big weight in the gaming industry.

===Retrogamer===

A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play, and enough collect, retro games—older video games and arcade games. They may also be called &quot;classic gamers&quot; or &quot; gamers&quot;, which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States. The games can be played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via emulation, or on modern hardware via ports or compilations (though those &#x27;in the hobby&#x27; tend toward original hardware and emulation).

===Classification in taxonomies===
A number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.

The Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:

* Achievers, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and game badges.
* Explorers, who like to discover all areas within the game, including hidden areas and glitches, and expose all game mechanics.
* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.
* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.
* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it.
The MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (&quot;Mechanics&quot;), how they build up during game to develop the gameplay (&quot;Dynamics&quot;), and what emotional response they convey to the player (&quot;Aesthetics&quot;). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation, Schadenfreude, Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.

==Avatar==


Creating an avatar can be one of the first interaction that a potential player makes to identify themselves among the gaming community. An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a pseudonym) adopted by a video gamer, often used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is often most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support, or at electronic sport conventions. While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a middle name, such as Tyler &quot;Ninja&quot; Blevins or Jay &quot;sinatraa&quot; Won.

Similarly, a &quot;clan tag&quot; is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans. They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another. Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other. A &quot;team tag&quot; is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team. Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation. These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.

==Clans and guilds==

A clan, squad or guild is a group of players that form, usually under an informal &#x27;leader&#x27; or administrator. Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an &#x27;offline&#x27; community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of professional gamers, who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).

==Identity==
The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody. These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books. According to Graeme Kirkpatrick, the &quot;true gamer&quot; is concerned first and foremost with gameplay. &quot;The Escapist&quot; founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to &quot;cinemaphile&quot;. People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they do not play &quot;enough&quot; to qualify. Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term &quot;gamer&quot;, even though they may play regularly.

===Demographics===
Games are stereotypically associated with young males, but the diversity of the audience has been steadily increasing over time. This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly. Among players using the same category of device (e.g., console or phone), patterns of play are largely the same between men and women. Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms. Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo&#x27;s efforts to reach new demographics. Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience, since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs, mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own.

While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. Connotations of &quot;gamer&quot; with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.

Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers, with 19% of Hispanics identifying as gamers, compared to 11% of African-Americans and 7% of whites. The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant. This is attributed to its origin in arcades, where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter. Only 4% of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers.

===Casualization===
Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences, especially women or the elderly. Some developers, hoping to attract a broader audience, simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises. Compared to seminal titles like &quot;DOOM&quot;, more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill, approaching the status of interactive movies.

The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay, meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game. According to Brendan Keogh, these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance. He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences, and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity. Belying these trends, games including &quot;The Sims&quot; or &quot;Minecraft&quot; have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex. According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research, girls who play Minecraft are &quot;just as &#x27;hardcore&#x27; as the next guy over who plays &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;&quot;. Dreunen says being in control of a game&#x27;s environment appeals equally to boys and girls. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2003 was the 48th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Riga, Latvia, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;I Wanna&quot; by Marie N. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (LTV), the contest was held at the Skonto Hall on 24 May 2003. The contest was presented by last year&#x27;s winner Marie N and former contestant Renārs Kaupers.

Twenty-six countries participated in the contest, beating the record of twenty-five first set in .

The host country Latvia placed twenty-fourth (third from last) – this was the first time since that the host entry did not place in the top 10, and it was, overall, the worst result for a host entry since .

This was the last contest to take place on one evening. The EBU revealed that it would be adding a semi-final show to the competition in order to accommodate the growing number of interested countries wishing to take part in the contest. This was also the last contest in which a relegation system was used to determine which countries would participate in the following year&#x27;s contest. As the Belgian entry was sung in an imaginary language, this was also the first time the contest featured a song with no parts performed in English or a language native to the country.

== Location ==

On 22 August 2002, Latvian public broadcaster (LTV) announced that it had chosen the Skonto Hall in Riga as the host venue for the 2003 contest.

Latvia won the Eurovision Song Contest 2002 on 25 May 2002 in Tallinn, Estonia, with the song “I Wanna” performed by Marie N. This was Latvia&#x27;s first victory in the contest, which also carried the right for LTV to organise the 2003 contest. LTV initially had budgetary concerns with staging the contest. The chairman of the National Radio and Television Council Ojārs Rubenis stated that if the government presented no budget guarantees, the council, which owns shares in LTV, would vote against organising the contest. Rubenis elaborated that LTV was prepared to cover the creative side and broadcasting of the contest, but additional funds would be needed for infrastructure, hotels and other financial issues.

The Government of Latvia allotted €5.3 million for the event with a further €1.1 million being provided by the Riga City Council – covering the anticipated organisational costs for the contest. A task force that included members from LTV, the National Radio and Television Council, and state secretaries was formed to explicitly work on organisation of the contest and report on the estimated expenses.

=== Bidding phase ===
Three cities were considered as host city of the contest: Riga, Ventspils, and Jūrmala. LTV requested proposals from the three cities concerning how they plan to organise the contest. Riga City Council offered the Mežaparks Open-air Stage, Skonto Hall, and the Ķīpsala International Exhibition Centre as potential venues for hosting the contest. Ventspils bid to host the contest at the Ventspils Olympic Centre with a pledge of support from city mayor Aivars Lembergs, who added that Ventspils could also provide two cruise ferries that could be used to accommodate up to 8,000 guests. Jūrmala City Council offered the Dzintari Concert Hall with plans to expand and upgrade the facility and surrounding infrastructure.

LTV&#x27;s organisational task force later decided to proceed with the bids from Riga and Ventspils, eliminating Jūrmala and the Mežaparks Open-air Stage in Riga. On 15 June 2002, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) Reference Group decided in conjunction with the organisational task force in Latvia that Riga would host the 2003 contest with the venue option between the Skonto Hall and Ķīpsala International Exhibition Centre being decided upon by LTV. LTV ultimately chose the Skonto Hall as the venue to stage the contest.

==Participating countries==
Per the rules of the contest, twenty-six countries were allowed to participate in the event, a new record number of competing entries in a single edition. Originally a total of twenty-five countries were scheduled to participate in the event, however was added to the line-up shortly before the publication of the competing countries in November 2002, making its début appearance in the contest. , , the , , , and returned after being absent from the previous year&#x27;s event, and competed alongside Ukraine, the &quot;Big Four&quot; largest contributing participating countries, , , and the and the remaining fifteen highest-scoring participating countries from the . Having received the lowest scores in the 2002 contest, , , , , and were subsequently relegated and were prevented from participating in this year&#x27;s event.

Twenty-four countries participated in the 2002 contest in Tallinn; of these, fourteen were expected to compete in 2003. The bottom ten in Tallinn would be relegated, to allow countries to compete for the first time. In reality, only five countries were relegatednineteen countries that entered in 2002 competed in Riga. Originally, , , and had planned 2003 debuts, but the EBU&#x27;s late changes to the relegation procedure meant that they could not compete. The countries eventually made their debuts in 2004.

The 2003 contest was one of the few editions where no lead artists had previously competed as lead artists in past contests, although Slovenian representative Karmen had previously performed as a backing singer to Vili Resnik for .

==Format==
The EBU released the rules for the 2003 contest in November 2002, which detailed that twenty-six countries would participate, making it the largest number of participants to take part in the contest up to this point. The rules also modified the eligibility criteria for entries, changing the date of release cut-off point for songs from 1 January 2003 to 1 October 2002. There was also a change in the tie-break rule, which would now resolve such a case in favour of the nation that received points from a higher number of countries rather than taking into account the number of top scores (12 points) received. The draw for running order was held on 29 November 2002 in Riga, hosted by Marie N and Renārs Kaupers, with the results being revealed during a delayed broadcast of the proceedings later that day.

The official sponsors for the contest were Latvian mobile telecom provider and Latvian bank company . LTV selected Latvia Tours as its official partner to provide lodging, travel and recreation for the contest delegations and other guests. Riga City Council was also responsible for offering promotion and activities during the week preceding the contest.

Full preparations for the 2003 contest began on 18 May 2003 at the Skonto Hall. There were rehearsals, press conferences and participants were also involved in an internet chat. Two dress rehearsals were held on 23 May, in front of an estimated 12,000 people. The organisers of the contest held a press conference; one of the issues complained about was the lack of invitations for the after-party. The final dress rehearsal was held on 24 May, the day of the contest. A simulation of the voting procedure was also held, in which the presenters linked up with all twenty-six countries by satellite for the first time.

On the day of the contest, bookmaker William Hill&#x27;s odds placed Russia as joint favourites to win the contest with Spain. Ireland, Slovenia, Estonia, Norway and Iceland were behind in third, fourth and joint fifth respectively. At the conclusion of the contest, favourites Russia placed third and Spain placed eighth, while outsiders Turkey (20-1) and Belgium (50-1) claimed the first and second places, respectively. Austria, at 100–1, were favourites to finish last, however, they scored their best result since 1989, placing sixth.

An official compilation album, featuring all twenty-six competing entries from the contest, was released for the first time on the EMI/CMC label.

===Graphic design===
The design of the contest was built around the theme &quot;Magical rendez-vous&quot;, which represented the meeting of the various European nations coming to Latvia and encountering Latvia&#x27;s versatile landscapes. LTV launched a competition in order to find the logo for the contest. At the close of the competition, high interest from the public translated into 204 logo submissions, which were ultimately judged by a jury panel consisting of Uldis-Ivars Grava (general director of LTV), Arvīds Babris (then executive producer of the contest), Ugis Brikmanis (director), Laimonis Šteinbergs (artist), Ingūna Rībena (architect), Arta Giga (LTV representative) and Juhan Paadam (EBU representative). On 16 November 2002, LTV and the EBU presented the logo for the contest which was designed by the director of the Computer Graphics Department of LTV, Maris Kalve with further elaboration by LTV&#x27;s chief artist Kristaps Skulte. The logo was named &quot;upes&quot;, the Latvian word for rivers, and carried the slogan &quot;All rivers flow toward the sea, all songs flow toward the Eurovision Song Contest&quot;.

The postcards shown between the entries were directed by Ugis Brikmanis and featured the artists competing at the contest interacting with Latvia&#x27;s various landscapes: forests, rivers, lakes and towns. The postcards were recorded during the preceding week of the contest and ran behind schedule, leading to some postcards featuring only footage from the rehearsals and press conferences.

The stage design was created by Aigars Ozoliņš and based on the concept called Planet Latvia. The stage used several light and video effects and included an innovation new to the contest – a video screen stage floor that could be used to give each entry a unique look. The green room where the delegations and competitors awaited the results of the contest was placed directly behind the stage and unveiled shortly before the voting portion of the show commenced, allowing the audience to see the representatives of the competing nations as they received points. For the first time, the scoreboard automatically rearranged itself in descending order as each point was awarded, making it easier for the audience and television viewers to follow the exact progress of the competitors throughout the voting process.

===National host broadcaster===
Initially, Arvīds Babris, head of the Latvian delegation at the 2002 contest, was appointed as executive producer for the contest, however, after production fell behind schedule and the EBU applied pressure upon LTV, he was dismissed and Brigita Rozenbrika took over the position, receiving additional support from the Swedish broadcaster (SVT) and Estonian broadcaster (ETV). SVT was also the technical producer of the contest for the second year running with Sven Stojanović as director and the Swedish lighting company Spectra+ contracted for the contest.

===Voting system===
The EBU reintroduced televoting as an obligatory voting mode in all participating countries, which awarded 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 points to their ten favourite songs, in ascending order. Countries voted in the same order as they had performed. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Russia were granted an exception to holding a televote as they cited that their telecommunications penetration was less than 80%. Polish broadcaster opted to use only SMS-voting. In the televoting/smsvoting household shall not be permitted to vote more than three times. All other participating broadcasters planned to use a televote. Due to a technical issue, Ireland used results from their back-up jury instead of televoting. This contest was also the first to introduce a computer-generated scoreboard which rearranged itself in order as the points were awarded. Participating broadcasters were required to assemble back-up juries that consisted of eight voting members, with age and gender equally distributed, in the case of televote failure on the night of the competition. Four members of the jury had to be members of the general public and the other four members had to be music professionals.

===Future changes in contest format===
With the increased number of potential participating countries, the EBU began to review the format of the contest with potential changes being considered such as adding extra evenings for the show, holding a regional pre-selection, or putting a limit to number of participating countries by increasing the entrance fee. On 29 January 2003, the EBU unveiled a two-night system for the contest in 2004: a semi-final would be held before a grand final. The &quot;Big Four&quot;, along with the top ten from the 2003 contest, would automatically qualify for the 2004 final. The format change eliminated the relegation system, allowing all countries to send an artist and song to the contest. The fourteen eventual countries from the 2003 contest that qualified to compete directly in the 2004 final were Turkey, Belgium, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Poland, Spain, Iceland, Romania, Ireland, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. All other countries would have to compete in the semi-final for ten remaining spots in the final.

== Contest overview ==
The contest featured special guests that communicated with the hosts via satellite: Lys Assia, winner of the 1956 contest greeted the hosts and spectators from Nicosia, Elton John spoke to the presenters live from the Life Ball in Vienna and one astronaut and one cosmonaut—Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko—gave their greetings from the International Space Station. The interval act for the contest was a short film directed by Anna Viduleja that featured a sequence of performances by Latvian post-folklore group Iļģi, Renārs Kaupers&#x27; band Brainstorm, Marie N and piano player Raimonds Pauls.

The UK&#x27;s result was their worst-ever at Eurovision; by contrast, Turkey&#x27;s win was their first. Alf Poier&#x27;s sixth place was Austria&#x27;s best result for fourteen years, Poland&#x27;s seventh place was their best in nine, and Romania&#x27;s tenth place was one place behind their best-ever. Belgium&#x27;s second place was their first top-five finish in seventeen years, while Spain&#x27;s eighth place (tied with Iceland&#x27;s, which was its best result since 1999) was their third top-ten finish in 2 years, but Latvia&#x27;s third-from-bottom finish was their worst result in four attempts; it was also the worst placing for a host country since 1992, until 2015 when host country Austria received &#x27;nul points&#x27; and came second to last (Germany also received &#x27;nul points&#x27; but because of the running order Austria placed ahead of them).


=== Spokespersons ===

Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. The voting order in the 2003 contest was the order in which the countries had been drawn to perform. The spokespersons for each country were:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below. Broadcasters in 42 countries were reported to have broadcast the event live or deferred, including broadcasters in Albania, Armenia, Australia, Belarus, Puerto Rico, Serbia and Montenegro, and the United States.

==Incidents==

===Organisational issues===
In January 2003, German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Riga was suffering from serious financial problems that could lead to a breach of contract so the contest might need to be moved to another city. Ilona Bērziņa, spokesperson of LTV, denied that potential financial issues the city council of Riga may be facing would interrupt the organisation of the contest. In February 2003, The Baltic Times reported that a committee of Riga municipality rejected the proposal to withdraw the funds it pledged in support of organising the contest.

In March 2003, Danish newspaper B.T. published an article based on accusations that the EBU television director Bjørn Erichsen made in reference to LTV suffering from organisational chaos which could result in the removal of Latvia&#x27;s hosting duties since they were running behind schedule. The general director of LTV, Uldis-Ivars Grava, replied, saying: &quot;A few weeks ago, the EBU&#x27;s legal director, Werner Rumphorst, was in Riga, and I spent an entire day with him and with the former general director of the Danish broadcaster DR, Bjørn Erichsen. We talked about co-operation and about programme exchanges, and neither of them said a single word that would indicate any doubts, lack of trust or accusation.&quot; Ingrida Smite, head of press for the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, reaffirmed that the contest would take place in Riga despite reports to the contrary.

===Controversies surrounding Russian band t.A.T.u.===
Upon the selection of the Russian artists t.A.T.u., the duo gave an interview to German tabloid &quot;Bild&quot; in March 2003 where they claimed that they would win the contest without a doubt and criticised the German entrant Lou calling her a witch with duo member Julia Volkova (also referring to Germany&#x27;s 2002 entrant) stating, &quot;In Russia we nurse blind and old people, but we don&#x27;t send them to the Grand Prix. This must be different in Germany.&quot; Lou later responded to the comments stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether bitching, fighting and boozing kids are the right representatives for such a beautiful country as Russia.&quot;

t.A.T.u.&#x27;s first rehearsal dominated proceedings on 20 May—the band were supposed to rehearse the day before, but had turned up a day late, claiming that Julia Volkova was suffering from a sore throat. The group were booed by journalists during their press conference where they complained about the production&#x27;s poor lighting and stage. EBU supervisor Sarah Yuen said &quot;They are the bad girls of pop… we shouldn’t have expected them to come here and be nice and pleasant.&quot; The EBU had originally planned to have a pre-recorded performance of the Russian entry ready to substitute during the live broadcast in case the duo performed a lesbian publicity stunt on stage, which they deemed inappropriate for a family entertainment show. The EBU later stated that the performance would be broadcast live without any interruption.

===Russian complaint against Irish vote===
After the contest, Russian broadcaster Channel One complained that Irish broadcaster RTÉ had used a back-up jury, and that it had cost them victory. A statement by Channel One said &quot;Considering [the] insignificant difference in points between the first and third places, there are grounds to believe that the contest results could be much different for Russia.&quot; On the night of the competition, the voting polls operated by Irish telecommunications company Eircom suffered a delay in delivering the results on time, which prompted RTÉ to use the votes of the back-up jury instead. The EBU cleared RTÉ of any potential wrongdoing after an investigation on the matter and stated that the rules concerning substituting the back-up jury in place of the televote were correctly applied. RTÉ later published the unused results of the televote, which showed that had the jury not been used, Turkey would still have won, and Ireland&#x27;s voting &quot;partners&quot;, the United Kingdom, would still have no points. Russia did not receive any points from the televote, however, since Belgium only received 2 points from the Irish televote as opposed to 10 points awarded by the Irish jury, Russia would have placed second.

== Other awards ==

=== Marcel Bezençon Awards ===
For the second year, the Marcel Bezençon Awards, organised by Sweden&#x27;s then-Head of Delegation and 1992 representative Christer Björkman, and 1984 winner Richard Herrey, honoured songs in the contest. The awards were divided into three categories: the Artistic Award, the Fan Award, and the Press Award. The Fan Award was decided by the combined votes from members of OGAE, an organisation consisting of a network of over 40 Eurovision Song Contest fan clubs across Europe and beyond.

==Official album==

Eurovision Song Contest: Riga 2003 was the official compilation album of the 2003 contest, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by CMC International on 19 May 2003. The album featured all 26 songs that entered in the 2003 contest.

<text>Marguerite Yourcenar (, ; ; born Marguerite Antoinette Jeanne Marie Ghislaine Cleenewerck de Crayencour; 8 June 190317 December 1987) was a Belgian-born French novelist and essayist who became a US citizen in 1947. Winner of the Prix Femina and the Erasmus Prize, she was the first woman elected to the Académie Française, in 1980. In 1965, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Biography==
Yourcenar was born in Brussels, Belgium, as Marguerite Antoinette Jeanne Marie Ghislaine Cleenewerck de Crayencour, to Michel Cleenewerck de Crayencour and Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. Her father was of French bourgeois descent, originating from French Flanders, and a wealthy landowner. Her mother, of Belgian nobility, died ten days after Marguerite&#x27;s birth. She grew up in the home of her paternal grandmother, and adopted the surname Yourcenar as a pen name; in 1947, she also took it as her legal surname.

Yourcenar&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Alexis&quot;, was published in 1929. She translated Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;The Waves&quot; over a ten-month period in 1937.
In 1939, her partner at the time, the literary scholar and Kansas City native Grace Frick, invited Yourcenar to the United States to escape the outbreak of World War II in Europe. She lectured in comparative literature in New York City and Sarah Lawrence College.

Yourcenar and Frick became lovers in 1937 and remained together until Frick&#x27;s death in 1979. After ten years spent in Hartford, Connecticut, they bought a house in Northeast Harbor, Maine, on Mount Desert Island, where they lived for decades. They are buried next to each other at Brookside Cemetery, Somesville, Mount Desert, Maine. Yourcenar&#x27;s last companion was Jerry Wilson, with whom she had a tormented relationship; he died of AIDS in 1986. 

In 1951, Yourcenar published, in France, the novel &quot;Memoirs of Hadrian&quot;, which she had been writing on and off for a decade. The novel was an immediate success and met with critical acclaim. In this novel, Yourcenar recreated the life and death of one of the great rulers of the ancient world, the Roman emperor Hadrian, who writes a long letter to Marcus Aurelius, the son and heir of Antoninus Pius, his successor and adoptive son. Hadrian meditates on his past, describing both his triumphs and his failures, his love for Antinous, and his philosophy. The novel has become a modern classic. The English version was translated by Frick.

In 1980, Yourcenar became the first female member elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot;. An anecdote tells of how the bathroom labels were then changed in this male-dominated institution: &quot;Messieurs|Marguerite Yourcenar&quot; &quot;(Gents/Marguerite Yourcenar)&quot;. She published many novels, essays, and poems, as well as a trilogy of memoirs. At the time of her death, she was working on the third volume, titled &quot;Quoi? L&#x27;Eternité&quot;.

Yourcenar&#x27;s house on Mount Desert Island, &quot;Petite Plaisance&quot;, is now a museum dedicated to her memory. She is buried across the sound in Somesville.

<text>David James Gorman (born 2 March 1971) is an English comedian, presenter, and writer.

Gorman began his career writing for comedy series such as &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; (1993–1998) and &quot;The Fast Show&quot; (1994–1997), and later garnered acclaim for his stand-up shows, one of which earned him a nomination for a Perrier Award. He became widely known for his &quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot; stage show, which he debuted at the 2000 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, while its television adaptation was broadcast as &quot;The Dave Gorman Collection&quot; in 2001.

Gorman followed &quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot; with several other stand-up shows or comedic concepts that were turned into television series, including &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;Genius&quot; (2009–2010), and &quot;Dave Gorman: Modern Life Is Goodish&quot; (2013–2017). He has also been a guest on other shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, &quot;Go 8 Bit&quot;, &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, and &quot;QI&quot;.

==Early life==
David James Gorman was born in Stafford on 2 March 1971. He has a twin brother named Nicholas. He attended Walton High School in Stafford, and later studied mathematics at the University of Manchester, but dropped out after a year.

==Career==
===Early work===
Before his solo successes, he was in demand as a writer, having co-written three series of &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot;, as well as writing for many other television series in the UK, including &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. In 2003, he was listed in &quot;The Observer&quot; as one of the 50 funniest acts in British comedy. As a producer, Gorman contributed to two series featuring Jenny Eclair. He has also written for comedians Harry Hill and Steve Coogan.

Gorman&#x27;s first one-man &quot;documentary style&quot; show was entitled &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful&quot;. Billed as &quot;a ninety minute show based on a four-minute pop song&quot;, it was based on the song &quot;Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3&quot; by Ian Dury and the Blockheads. The show examined the song&#x27;s lyrics in detail, with a view to establishing whether or not each of the items listed in the song was really a reason to be cheerful. The visual aspect of the show was provided by each &quot;reason&quot; being illustrated by one of a collection of second-hand slides that he had accumulated for the show. The show was first performed at the 1998 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and toured theatres afterwards.

His second full-length show, &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Better World&quot;, was first performed in Edinburgh in 1999. For the show he wrote anonymous letters to thousands of local newspapers and asked the public to suggest ways in which one man could make the world a better place. He then attempted to carry out their suggestions in order to determine their efficacy.

===&quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot;===
Gorman shot to fame following a drunken bet with his flatmate Danny Wallace which became the backdrop to a book written by Gorman, and a play written by Wallace. The bet was thus: Gorman claimed he shared the name Dave Gorman with the assistant manager of East Fife F.C. and that there must be &quot;loads&quot; of others around. Wallace disagreed with him, so the two travelled to Methil (about from London), with a Polaroid camera, to meet the assistant manager, whose name was indeed Dave Gorman. The bet soon evolved into a monster as, on the way to meet Dave Gormans numbers 4 and 5, Wallace decided Gorman must meet one for every card in the deck (including the jokers).

His quest to meet this target is described, with highlights including: five people changing their names by deed poll (two of whom were women); a trip to New York that resulted in failure when he discovered the man he had gone to meet was not Dave Gorman, but B. David Gorman and therefore was ineligible; and the American journey included a meeting with an actor who had played a character called David Gorman, the validity of which is hotly contested in the book.

===&quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Important Astrology Experiment&quot;===

Gorman&#x27;s second television series, broadcast on BBC Two in September 2002, was entitled &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Important Astrology Experiment&quot; and was based upon the idea of a controlled scientific experiment, although naturally not a serious one. The series had six episodes.

The premise was that it would test whether or not astrology really worked. Over the course of 40 days, he would try to follow any instructions given to people with his star sign in a selection of horoscopes, while his &quot;control experiment&quot; (his fraternal twin brother, Nick) ignored them. Each would record the events of each day, and how they fared in each of three areas of life: love, health and wealth. On each episode of the show, Gorman would show footage of the amusing situations he got into by trying to follow his horoscope, and then asked a panel of &quot;experts&quot;, agony aunt Denise Robertson (love), GMTV&#x27;s Hilary Jones (health) and financial expert Alvin Hall (wealth), in the studio to assess how he had fared in the three areas. Following an audience vote, Gorman would display on a &quot;happiness graph&quot; the difference between how he and his twin brother had fared that week, and whether it showed that astrology had produced a positive effect, a negative effect, or no significant effect at all.

The results of the &quot;experiment&quot; showed that his overall happiness, love, and wealth steadily began to recede over time (especially wealth as he was forced to travel excessively). Throughout the experiment, he had numerous adventures, including travelling to New York City to meet a long lost friend and then leaving a few hours later because he was ordered to spend as much time at home as possible, sharing pizza in a park while dressed in a rubber suit, and reading an illegally acquired pornographic magazine at Sunday lunch in front of his mother.

The most notable stunt he had to perform, from episode 2, was standing in Covent Garden on one leg with his foot in a bucket of water, a tangerine in one hand and some breakfast cereal in the other (in a bowl that cost £85 from Harrods), singing the national anthem backwards and balancing three books on his head. This was taken entirely literally from a very odd horoscope by Jonathan Cainer, which Gorman deemed so implausible that he did in fact present the copy of the newspaper which published it in the studio, while noting his suspicion that perhaps the author of the horoscope found out about his experiment and was pulling a prank on him.

Gorman showed that his wealth was rapidly declining, as were happiness and love, until, on the last day, he invested the last of his money to travel to Dubai to watch a golf tournament (the &quot;Dubai Desert Classic&quot;) and bet on Ian Woosnam, a golfer that shared his birthday (and would therefore share his luck). He emptied his account to travel there and, using his lucky number of the day from each of the 40 days of his experiment to determine how much he should bet, went ahead with the plan. However, he then found out that not only was gambling illegal in the country, but also that his lucky number indicated he should bet 2,903 Dirhams, which at the time was £549. Ultimately, he borrowed the money from his mother and asked her to bet the sum on Ian Woosnam to win the match of the day, as he had been instructed by his horoscope.

With his happiness at an all-time low, love scraping the bottom, and his finances in an extremely negative position, the experts, his mother, Wallace, the crowd and Gorman himself could only hope the bet would pay off – which it ultimately did at odds long enough to place him not only back at level wealth, but supplying him with twice as much cash as he had started off with. Therefore, he &quot;proved&quot; that astrology works and has made him happier than the control.

===&quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot;===
In 2003, Gorman toured Britain with a show entitled &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot;, and published a book of the same name. It is another true story. As a result, he believes people took him more seriously and a new novel was commissioned. While trying to write a novel for his publisher, Random House, Gorman became obsessed with Googlewhacks when someone notified him that his site had one (Francophile Namesakes), and caused him to travel across the world finding people who had authored them (one of whom turned out to be one of the Dave Gormans he had met in his first adventure). He eventually spent his publisher&#x27;s advance on the quest, without writing any of the promised novel, and had to create the &quot;Dave Gorman&#x27;s Googlewhack Adventure&quot; show to pay them back.

This show was premiered at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and then went on to sell out for a two-week run at the Sydney Opera House&#x27;s Studio Theatre. It also sold out at the George Square Theatre as part of the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe before embarking on a major UK tour of 75 shows in the space of three months. It won Gorman the award for Best One Person Show at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado, an award he had previously won for the show &quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot; He ended up writing a book about his Googlewhack Adventure which went on to be the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; number one best seller. During his Googlewhack adventure, Gorman had a nervous breakdown, which he discusses frankly in the show.

In 2004, a DVD of the &quot;Googlewhack Adventure&quot; was released which was filmed at Swansea Grand Theatre. In 2005, Gorman toured the U.S. and performed his &quot;Googlewhack&quot; show in several cities. While in Los Angeles, he appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, elaborating on his travels and his quest. This tour, in which he stayed at chain motels and experienced corporate America, led him to undertake a road-trip across the U.S. in which he avoided such hotels and corporate petrol stations in favour of family-owned businesses. The road trip was documented as the book and film &quot;America Unchained&quot;.

===&quot;Dave Gorman versus the Rest of the World&quot;===
In 2011, Gorman published a book about his adventures in various British towns, during a period of his life when he challenged people to invite him to game-playing sessions. The book explains games of Bluke, Khet, Kubb, Smite, Settlers of Catan, Monopoly, Poker and others.

===&quot;Genius&quot;===
====Radio series====

He hosted a BBC Radio 4 show called &quot;Genius&quot;, in which members of the public submitted suggestions to make a better world. Gorman and a guest then assess the idea in order to determine whether it qualifies as &quot;genius&quot;. One series of five episodes was broadcast between 27 October and 24 November 2005, with a CD of the first series released on 27 November 2006. The second series was broadcast between 7 September and 12 October 2006, with a CD released on 7 January 2008 and a third series between 1 October and 5 November 2007. He has made many references to disliking Darren Day in various episodes of the show.

====TV series====

A pilot for a television version of &quot;Genius&quot; was recorded on 23 November 2007, and a series was commissioned in the spring of 2008. The series was created by Ali Crockatt and David Scott, and is produced by Simon Nicholls.

The six-part series started on Friday 20 March, 10pm on BBC2. A second series for 2010 was commissioned by the BBC. The show broadcast its first episode on Monday 27 September 2010 at 10pm on BBC Two.

===&quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;===
On 24 April 2006, Gorman made his first appearance as a reporter (he had previously appeared as a guest on 11 December 2001 promoting &quot;Are You Dave Gorman?&quot;), in which he was credited as the show&#x27;s senior new correspondent. On 27 April, he debuted as the host of the show&#x27;s satirical statistical analysis piece called &quot;Poll Smoking with Dave Gorman&quot;. He was the first &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent to have been born in England, and the third &quot;Daily Show&quot; correspondent to have been born outside of the United States. His most recent appearance on the show was on 5 October 2006. He has also appeared co-hosting a segment called &quot;ConTROVersy&quot; with the Daily Show&#x27;s other English correspondent, John Oliver, in which the pair calmly and genteelly discussed former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair over tea, parodying American stereotypes of Britons.

===&quot;America Unchained&quot;===
Between 22 October and 5 December 2006, Gorman undertook a coast-to-coast road trip through 17 states from the west coast to east coast of the United States. A book about the trip, entitled &quot;America Unchained: A Freewheeling Roadtrip in Search of Non-Corporate USA&quot;, was released on 3 April 2008. The rationale for the trip was to discover whether it is possible to travel across the United States without ever patronising any corporate or chain-style businesses (&quot;The Man&quot;). Gorman ate, slept, and filled his car in restaurants, hotels, and petrol stations which were all independently owned.

America Unchained also is the name of an annual campaign spearheaded by the American Independent Business Alliance since 2004 to promote the economic, cultural, and democratic importance of independent locally owned businesses. A documentary film of the adventure was also made and was aired on the British TV channel More4 on 5 February 2008 and released on DVD on 11 February. In 2007, it won the Audience Award for Best Documentary Feature at the Austin Film Festival.

Gorman&#x27;s journey started in Coronado, California, and ended in Savannah, Georgia, and he was continually challenged to find independently owned gas stations, as well as repairing the car itself – which broke down surprisingly little, considering the age and mileage (124,000 at start).

===Absolute Radio===
Gorman was a regular guest on &quot;The Geoff Show&quot;, having been on a guest on the show three times (and also entering a phone-in competition whilst undertaking the &quot;Important Astrology Experiment&quot;), while he also had weekly interviews on &quot;Geoff Lloyd&#x27;s Hometime Show&quot; to discuss his bikeathon during his &quot;Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up Tour&quot;. He filled in for weekend presenter Frank Skinner for three weeks during the summer of 2009. The station subsequently announced that he would have a full-time show; his first show aired on 11 October, with Gorman joined by Danielle Ward and Martin White. White left the show in April 2012, to be replaced by Michael Legge. The show ended on 18 November 2012.

===Stand-up===
Gorman performed numerous times as a stand up earlier in his career. On 30 August 2009, he began a 32-date tour called &quot;Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up&quot;. The tour saw him covering the extremes of the British mainland as he cycled from Britain&#x27;s southernmost point to its northernmost tip, taking in the most easterly and westerly points along the way and performing each night of the journey.

In 2010, Gorman performed a 37-date tour as an extension of his 2009 &quot;Sit Down, Pedal, Pedal, Stop and Stand Up Tour&quot;. About this show he said, &quot;I won&#x27;t be cycling to these. Same show, fewer blisters.&quot; On 12 July 2010, he performed the show again – twice in one evening – at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, which was recorded for a DVD release (&quot;Dave Gorman Stand-Up. Live.&quot;). Before the recording, Gorman performed the act again as &quot;The Warm Up Show&quot; at four small venues in the UK in order to freshen his memory.

===&quot;Modern Life Is Goodish&quot;===

In September 2013, Gorman returned to television with a new show, &quot;Modern Life Is Goodish&quot;, on the Dave channel. In January 2014, the show was renewed for two additional series to follow the initial three. The fourth series commenced in November 2016. The fifth series ran from 31 October to 20 December 2017, after which Gorman confirmed that it was the final series. At its peak, the series attracted 1.5 million viewers. On 1 February 2025, Gorman announced that there would be a sixth series releasing on 24 February 2025. Unlike prior series it will consist of three episodes.

===&quot;With Great PowerPoint Comes Great &quot;===
On 13 November 2017, towards the end of the run of &quot;Modern Life Is Goodish&quot;, Gorman announced a new stage show to conclude the series called &quot;With Great PowerPoint Comes Great &quot;. The show had an initial run from 6 September to 25 November 2018. Since then, Gorman has announced 19 more tour dates for January–February 2019 due to the number of tickets sold. While Gorman has wished for the contents of the show to remain unspoiled for people going into the show, he has requested that people talk about the Giraffe joke, which Gorman has cited as being the best giraffe joke in the world. Because of the popularity of the show, after a short break during the filming of &quot;Terms and Conditions Apply&quot;, Gorman continued to tour until November 2019.

===&quot;Terms and Conditions Apply&quot;===
In June 2019, it was announced on Chortle that Gorman would be hosting a new TV series on Dave called &quot;Terms and Conditions Apply&quot;, with eight one-hour long episodes. The format is similar to that of &quot;Modern Life Is Goodish&quot;, but Gorman was joined by guest stars on each episode, competing in various games based on the subjects presented. Filming for the first series took place from 2 July to 29 August 2019. It began airing on Dave in October 2019.

===&quot;PowerPoint to the People&quot;===
On 30 April 2022, Dave Gorman announced another live stage show tour called &quot;PowerPoint to the People&quot; for autumn 2022. It originally ran from 10 September to 11 November 2022.

Extra dates were then added, running from 16 March 2023 until 17 June 2023. The tour was extended again up to 13 December 2023.

===Other appearances===
Gorman appeared in one episode of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; in 2001. He played the part of Rimmer, a photographer, in the fourth season&#x27;s third episode &quot;Paris&quot;. He also appeared for two series as one of the team captains on the BBC Three television show &quot;Rob Brydon&#x27;s Annually Retentive&quot;. The programme was a comedy about the making of a celebrity panel show hosted by Rob Brydon, and ran from 2006 to 2007. In 2006, he also became an occasional contributor on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. He has listed among his ambitions a wish to become a captain on the quiz show &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;.

Gorman appeared in two episodes of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, including the famous episode broadcast in the week that news broke of host Angus Deayton&#x27;s scandal involving prostitutes and the use of illegal drugs. He also appeared in an episode of the sports comedy quiz &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;. Gorman also appeared on, and won, episode nine of the first series of &quot;QI&quot;, in which the guests included Jo Brand and Jeremy Hardy. He appeared again in 2011 in the ninth series, winning again. He appeared as a guest on the Frank Skinner show &quot;Opinionated&quot; on 23 April 2010.

In 2009, Gorman appeared in Robert Llewellyn&#x27;s online programme &quot;Carpool&quot; which was broadcast on Dave, and can be viewed at Llewellyn&#x27;s YouTube channel, LlewTube. He presented Bravo TV&#x27;s first live PDC darts coverage alongside James Richardson during the 2010 European Championship Darts. Gorman appeared on the week-long special &quot;Grand Designs Live&quot;, in which he showcased eccentric houses in the United States in 2015.

Gorman was a regular alongside Geoff Lloyd on Virgin Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Geoff Show&quot;, also appearing on the same presenter&#x27;s &quot;Hometime Show&quot;. Following the rebranding of the station to Absolute Radio, Gorman joined the station as a presenter himself. He has made many appearances on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, and has appeared on several episodes of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. Gorman was also the &quot;Curator&quot; for John Lloyd&#x27;s BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Museum of Curiosity&quot; in the fourth series, as well as standing in for Jon Richardson in one edition of the third series after the latter was left stranded due to the volcanic eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.

In October 2014, it was announced that Gorman would voice a character in the upcoming crowdfunded animated film &quot;Doug and the Meaning of Life&quot;. However, as of 2019, the domain hosting the website has been shut down, and no further updates have been posted to the Kickstarter page of the project. Only a small clip featuring Gorman&#x27;s audition for his role seems to exist, via the official YouTube channel for the film.

Gorman has also provided voiceover for a television campaign by Homebase, the UK DIY chain.

When Lee Mack appeared on a &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; celebrity special on 3 January 2012, Gorman was the &#x27;phone-a-friend&#x27; to whom Mack turned; he successfully identified &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; as a James Bond novel, doing so without needing to be told the four possible answers.

In 2020, Gorman began setting cryptic crosswords for three British newspapers, first for &quot;The Independent&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Bluth&quot; then for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; under the name &quot;Django&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; under the name &quot;Fed&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gorman and his wife, Beth, were married on 8 October 2010. They live in Bournemouth and have a son.

During his performance at the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Gorman referred to himself as an &quot;atheist from a Christian background&quot;. He has been mistakenly identified as Jewish, which once led to his inclusion in the Jewish magazine &quot;JLifestyle&quot; list of top &quot;literary Jews&quot; in 2008. Gorman is a pescatarian.

<text>This article is about the history of Hesse. Hesse is a state in Germany.

==Prehistoric==
In the Paleolithic Era, the Central Hessian region around Wetzlar was settled. Extensive excavations along the Lahn in Wetzlar-Dalheim recently uncovered a 7000-year-old settlement from the Linear Pottery culture. Bell Beaker shards found in Rüsselsheim, Offenbach, Griesheim and Wiesbaden suggest settlement in southern Hesse 4,500 years ago.

==Landgraviate==
In 1568 with the death of Landgrave Philip I, the Landgraviate of Hesse (), a German Principality of the Holy Roman Empire, was divided among his sons. With the extinction of the Hesse-Marburg and Hesse-Rheinfels lines by 1604, Hesse-Darmstadt, along with Hesse-Kassel, became one of the two Hessian states. While Hesse-Kassel converted to Calvinism and became one of the most zealous exponents of the Protestant cause in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Landgrave George II remained a strict Lutheran and maintained a close alliance with Saxony, which led to a pro-Habsburg policy after 1642.

Hesse-Darmstadt gained a great deal of territory from the secularization and modifications authorized by the &quot;&quot; of 1803. The acquisition of the Duchy of Westphalia, formerly owned by the Archbishop of Cologne, was significant, as were the acquisition of territories from the Archbishop of Mainz and the Bishop of Worms. In 1806, upon the dissolution of the &quot;Reich&quot; and the dispossession of his cousin, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel, the Landgrave took the title of Grand Duke of Hesse.

At the Congress of Vienna, the Grand Duke was forced to cede Westphalia to Prussia. In exchange for this he received a piece of territory from the left bank of the Rhine, including the important federal fortress at Mainz. The Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in 1816.

In 1867, the northern half of the Grand Duchy (Upper Hesse) became a part of the North German Confederation, while the half of the Grand Duchy south of the Main (Starkenburg and Rhenish Hesse) remained outside. In 1871, it became a constituent state of the German Empire. The last Grand Duke, Ernst Ludwig (a grandson of Queen Victoria and brother to Empress Alexandra of Russia), was forced from his throne at the end of World War I. The state was then renamed the &quot;&quot; (People&#x27;s State of Hesse).

The majority of the state combined with Frankfurt am Main, the Waldeck area (Rhine-Province) and the old Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau to form the new state of Hesse following the Second World War. Excepted was the Montabaur district from Hessen-Nassau and that part of Hessen-Darmstadt on the left bank of the Rhine (Rhenish Hesse) became part of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. (Bad) Wimpfen — an exclave of Hessen-Darmstadt — became part of Baden-Württemberg, district of Sinsheim.

== 17th and 18th centuries==
From the early years of the Reformation, the House of Hesse was predominately Protestant. Landgraves Philip I, William V, and Maurice married descendants of King George of Bohemia; from William VI onwards, mothers of the heads of Hesse-Kassel were always descended from William the Silent, the leader of the Dutch to independence on the basis of Calvinism.

The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel expanded in 1604 when Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel inherited the Landgraviate of Hesse-Marburg from his childless uncle, Louis IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Marburg (1537–1604).

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Calvinist Hesse-Kassel proved to be Sweden&#x27;s most loyal German ally. Landgrave William V and, after his death in 1637, his widow Amelia of Hanau, a granddaughter of William the Silent, as regent supported the Protestant cause and the French and Swedes throughout the war and maintained an army, garrisoning many strongholds, while Hesse-Kassel itself was occupied by Imperial troops.

William V was succeeded by Landgraves William VI and William VII. Under King Frederick I of Sweden, Hesse-Kassel was in personal union with Sweden from 1730–51. But in fact the King&#x27;s younger brother, Prince William, ruled in Kassel as Regent until he succeeded his brother, reigning as William VIII until 1760.

Although it was a fairly widespread practice at the time to rent out troops to other princes, it was the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel who became infamous for hiring out contingents of their army as mercenaries during the 17th and 18th centuries. Hesse-Kassel maintained 7% of its entire population under arms throughout the eighteenth century. This force served as a source of mercenaries for other European states. Frederick II, notably, hired out so many troops to his nephew King George III of Great Britain for use in the American War of Independence, that &quot;Hessian&quot; has become a common term among Americans and historians for all German soldiers deployed by the British in the War. One of these regiments that saw service in America was the Musketeer Regiment Prinz Carl.

During the 17th century, the landgraviate was internally divided for dynastic purposes, without allodial rights, into:
* the Landgraviate of Hesse-Rotenburg (1627–1834) 
* the Landgraviate of Hesse-Wanfried-(Rheinfels) (1649–1755) 
* the Landgraviate of Hesse-Philippsthal 
* Landgraviate of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld

These were reunited with the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel when each particular branch died out without issue.

== 19th century ==

Following the reorganization of the German states during the German mediatization of 1803, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel was raised to the Electorate of Hesse and Landgrave William IX was elevated to Imperial Elector, taking the title William I, Elector of Hesse. The principality thus became known as &quot;&quot;, although it is still usually referred to as Hesse-Kassel.

In 1806, William I was dispossessed by Napoleon Bonaparte for his support of the Kingdom of Prussia. Kassel became the capital of a new Kingdom of Westphalia with Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme Bonaparte as king. The elector was restored following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1813, and although the Holy Roman Empire was now defunct, William retained his title of Elector, as it gave him pre-eminence over his cousin, the Grand Duke of Hesse. From 1813 onwards, the Electorate of Hesse was an independent country and, after 1815, a member of the German Confederation.

William&#x27;s grandson, Elector Frederick William, sided with the Austrian Empire in the Austro-Prussian War. Following the Prussian victory his lands were annexed by Prussia in 1866. Along with the annexed Duchy of Nassau and Free City of Frankfurt, Hesse-Kassel became part of the new Province of Hesse-Nassau of the Kingdom of Prussia.

== 20th century ==

In 1918, Hesse-Nassau became part of the Free State of Prussia until 1944. From 1944–45 as part of Nazi Germany, it was divided into the Prussian provinces of Kurhessen and Nassau. From 1945–46, it was renamed Greater Hesse () and was part of the US occupation zone in Germany. From 1946 onwards, it was reorganized into the State of Hesse, a federal state of West Germany.

In 1918, Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, younger brother of the head of the house and a brother-in-law of Emperor William II, was elected by the pro-German Finnish government to be King of Finland, but he never reigned.

In 1968, the head of the House of Hesse-Kassel became the head of the entire House of Hesse due to the extinction of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt.

<text>Plataea (; , &quot;Plátaia&quot;) was an ancient Greek city-state situated in Boeotia near the frontier with Attica at the foot of Mt. Cithaeron, between the mountain and the river Asopus, which divided its territory from that of Thebes. Its inhabitants were known as the &quot;Plataeans&quot; (; &quot;Plataiaí&quot;, ).

It was the location of the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC, in which an alliance of Greek city-states defeated the Persians.

Plataea was destroyed and rebuilt several times during the Classical period of ancient Greece. The modern Greek town of Plataies is adjacent to its ruins.

== Early history ==
Plataea was settled during the Bronze Age. (It was mentioned in Homer in the &quot;Iliad&quot; as among the other Boeotian cities).  Local tradition, as related by the geographer Pausanias, was that its people were &quot;sprung from the soil&quot; (autochthonous, or indigenous).  Its name is that of the daughter of an ancient king, Asopus, for whom the nearby river is named. According to the ancient Thebans, who claimed authority over the city, Plataea was founded by them.

In 520 BC Plataea, unwilling to submit to the supremacy of Thebes, and unable to resist this powerful neighbour with its own resources, sought the protection of Sparta.  Sparta, however, demurred, saying:We live too far away, and our help would be cold comfort to you. You could be enslaved many times over before any of us heard about it. We advise you to put yourselves under the protection of the Athenians, since they are your neighbours and not bad men at giving help.
Herodotos, the source of this statement, went on to say that the Spartans had an ulterior motive in this: that they wished to cause trouble between Athens and Thebes.  In the end, Plataea did form a close alliance with Athens, to which its people remained faithful during the whole of its subsequent history. 

== Persian Wars (Battles of Marathon and Plataea) ==
When the Persian king Dareios sent an armada to invade Attica in 490 BC, Plataea sent 1,000 men to join Athens at the Battle of Marathon, and shared in the glories of that victory. A decade later, they also served in the Athenian fleet at the sea battle at Artemisium, though they had no ships of their own.  They missed the later Battle of Salamis, in order to remove their families and property from the city at the approach of the Persian army. Upon the arrival of the Persians shortly afterwards their city was burned to the ground. 

In the following year (479 BC), their territory was the scene of the Battle of Plataea, which delivered Greece from the Persian invaders. In this engagement, a combined Greek force met those of the Persian general Mardonius on the plain next to the Asopus River.  As this victory had been gained on the soil of Plataea, its citizens received special honour and rewards from the confederated Greeks. Not only was the large sum of 80 talents granted to them, which they employed in erecting a temple to Athena, but they were charged with the duty of tendering religious honours every year to the tombs of the warriors who had fallen in the battle, and of celebrating every four years the festival of the Eleutheria in commemoration of the deliverance of the Greeks from the Persian yoke. The festival was sacred to Zeus Eleutherius, to whom a temple was erected at Plataea. In return for these services the assembled Greeks swore to guarantee the independence and inviolability of the city and its territory.

== Peloponnesian War ==
Plataea was rebuilt and its inhabitants were unmolested until the commencement of the Peloponnesian War. In the spring of 431 BC, before war was formally declared, a party of 300 Thebans attempted to take over Plataea. They were admitted within the walls during the night by members of a faction partial to Thebes, but the Plataeans soon discovered the attack and engaged the invaders.  During the night they killed many and captured 180. Few escaped. Word was sent to Athens of the attempted coup, and then the captives were executed.  The Athenians, dismayed at the slaughter, nevertheless sent a garrison to protect the city from further attack.  This event proved to be the spark that ignited the war between Athens and Sparta. 

In the third year of the war (429 BC) the Peloponnesian army under the command of Spartan king Archidamus laid siege to Plataea, claiming that it had violated the protections guaranteed it after the Persian War by continuing its alliance with Athens. Before deciding whether to declare the city neutral or maintain their alliance with Athens, the Plataeans secured a truce, during which they sent their old men, women, and children to Athens together with the envoys who were to see what Athens had to say.  In the end, they determined to continue the alliance, which set the stage for the assault that came next.  The remaining garrison of the city consisted of only 400 citizens and 80 Athenians, and 110 women who were there to manage household affairs.  Yet this small force defied the whole army of the Peloponnesians, which, after many fruitless attempts to take the city, gave up the assault and converted the siege into a blockade.  They raised a circumvallation round the city consisting of two parallel walls, 16 feet apart, with a ditch on either side.  Then, leaving a small force to guard the city, the invading army went home.

In the second year of the blockade (428), 212 of the besieged succeeded in scaling the walls of circumvallation during the night and safely made it to Athens. In the course of the following summer (427), those remaining in Plataea were obliged, through failure of provisions, to surrender to the Peloponnesians.  After a &quot;trial&quot; by the Spartans, in which their arguments against the unwarranted assault on the city were shunted aside, they were put to death and all private buildings were razed to the ground by the Thebans.  In time, the latter used the remnants to erected an inn and a chapel for the local precinct of Hera.  The land was allocated to those Plataeans who had supported Thebes in the lead-up to the attack.

=== Relocation to Scione ===
In 423 BC, Athens and Sparta negotiated a one-year truce in the midst of the Pelopennesian War.  One of the terms was that no new conquests or revolts were to take place once the truce was signed.  The people of Scione, in the Chalcidice, had revolted about this time, and while Sparta claimed it was before the truce, Athens had intelligence that it took place afterward.  The Athenian assembly then passed a decree &quot;to reduce and put to death the Scionaeans&quot;.  The next year they besieged the city, finally subduing it and carrying out the decree in 420.  Once this was done, they gave the town to those Plataeans then living at Athens to be their new home.

At the close of the Peloponnesian War, Athens was compelled to evacuate Scione, and the Plataeans again found a hospitable welcome at Athens.

== Peace of Antalcidas (The King&#x27;s Peace) ==
The exiled Plataeans continued to live at Athens until the imposition Peace of Antalcidas by the Great King of Persia (387 BC), which guaranteed the autonomy of all Greek cities. The Spartans, who were now anxious to humble the power of Thebes, took advantage of it to restore the Plataeans to their native city. 

But the Plataeans did not long retain possession of their city. With Thebes ever a threat to their independence, Sparta kept a garrison there to protect it, and at the Boeotian cities of Thespiae and Orchomenus as well.  In the 370s, Athens and Thebes went to war against Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians used Thespiae and Plataea as staging areas for a series of incursions into Boeotia to ravage the Theban countryside. After several years of this, the Thebans, sometimes with Athenian help, began to get the upper hand in these encounters. In 375 BC Sparta was too busy with other campaigns to send forces to the area and Thebes took the opportunity to compel these cities back into the Boeotian Federation.  Though not under assault, the Plataeans had lost their independence once more.

Over the next couple of years, the Plataeans increasingly resented Thebes&#x27; heavy hand. At some point – the year is reported variously as 373, 372, and 371 BC by ancient sources – they reached out to Athens in an attempt to restore the long-standing alliance between the two cities. This, of course, incensed the Thebans and they attacked the Plataea before Athens could respond. 

Unlike the attack in 427 BC, this time the Thebans expelled the Plataeans rather than killing them - sending them once again to Athens, after which they razed the city. They next did the same to neighboring Thespiae. (The wrongs done to the Plataeans by Thebes were set forth in a speech of Isocrates, entitled &quot;Plataicus&quot;, which was probably delivered at this time by a Plataean speaker before the Assembly at Athens. At any rate, it was later published and preserved among Isocrates works.) As a result of these actions, Athens backed out of its alliance with Thebes and sought peace with Sparta.

In 371 BC, Sparta lost a major battle to Thebes at Leuktra, in Boeotia.  For the next two decades Thebes reigned supreme in Greece, until the rise of Macedon and the campaign of Philip II to extend its hegemony throughout the region. During this time, the Plataeans remained in exile at Athens.

== Battle of Chaeroneia ==
In 338 BC the simmering war between Athens and Macedon came to a head when Philip brought his army into southern Greece.  At the last minute Thebes, which had been in league with Macedon for years, switched sides and fought with Athens against him and his son Alexander at Chaeroneia, in northern Boeotia.  The result was a resounding victory for Macedon.  Among the settlements later imposed by Philip on the Greek cities, the Plataeans were restored to their city once more. 

In 335 BC, Thebes revolted against Alexander, who had succeeded his father the previous year.  In response, Alexander destroyed the city, sending the Theban survivors into slavery.  With their would-be overlords out of the picture, the Plataeans were finally free.

== Later years ==
After its restoration by Philip, Plataea continued to be inhabited for several centuries. It was visited by Pausanias in the 2nd century AD, who mentioned three temples, one of Hera, another of Athena Areia, and a third of Demeter Eleusinia. He wrote of only one temple of Hera, which he described as situated within the city and worthy of admiration because of its magnitude and the offerings with which it was adorned. This was possibly the temple built by the Thebans after the destruction of Plataea. It is probable that the old temple of Hera mentioned by Herodotus, and which he described as outside the city, was no longer repaired after the erection of the new one, and had disappeared before Pausanias&#x27; visit. 

The temple of Athena Areia was built, according to Pausanias, out of a share of the spoils of Marathon; but according to Plutarch it was with the 80 talents out of the spoils of Plataea, as mentioned above. The temple was adorned with pictures by Polygnotus and Onatas, and with a statue of the goddess by the Athenian sculptor Pheidias. Of the temple of Demeter Eleusinia we have no details, but it was probably erected in consequence of the battle having been fought near a temple of Demeter Eleusinia at Argiopius. The temple of Zeus Eleutherius seems to have been reduced in the time of Pausanias to an altar and a statue. It was situated outside the city.

Plataea is featured in the 2nd-century AD Latin novel &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (often called &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;) by Apuleius, in which it is depicted as hosting gladiatorial combat and an array of wild beasts. 

Plataea&#x27;s walls were restored by Justinian in the 6th century AD. 

The modern village of Plataies is adjacent to the ancient ruins.  Foundation stones for several of its buildings are still extant.  More information can be found at https://eternalgreece.com/ancient-plataea/

== Athenian citizenship ==
There are several references to a special relationship between Plataeans and Athenians, though the exact nature of it is disputed by scholars. Thucydides had the Thebans say in a speech: &quot;It was in defense against us, say you, that you became allies and citizens (&quot;politai&quot;) of Athens.&quot; Diodorus Siculus, in describing a later event, says: &quot;The Plataeans with their wives and children, having fled to Athens, received equality of civic rights (&quot;isopoliteia&quot;) as a mark of favour from the Athenian people&quot;. Aristophanes, in his &quot;Frogs&quot; (693-4) has the Chorus opine, &quot;For it is disgraceful for men who have fought one battle by sea to become Plataeans straightway and masters instead of slaves&quot;. A scholiast to this passage appended this: &quot;Hellanicus says that the slaves who joined in the sea battle were given their freedom and were enrolled as joint-citizens (&quot;sympoliteysasthai&quot;) with the Athenians on the same terms as the Plataeans&quot;. 

Perhaps the fullest explanation of their status came from Demosthenes in &quot;Against Neaera&quot;.  During this oration, he had the clerk read out a previously enacted degree regarding the Plataeans that had been passed during their exile in 429 BC:On motion of Hippocrates it is decreed that the Plataeans shall be Athenians from this day, and shall have full rights as citizens, and that they shall share in all the privileges in which the Athenians share, both civil and religious, save any priesthood or religious office which belongs to a particular family, and that they shall not be eligible to the office of the nine archons but their descendants shall be. And the Plataeans shall be distributed among the demes and the tribes; and after they have been so distributed, it shall no longer be lawful for any Plataean to become an Athenian, unless he wins the gift from the people of Athens.If this is a true representation of the decree (and its wording has been challenged in modern times), it would seem that the status did not apply to all Plataeans forever, but only to those individuals who were specifically honored and their children.  Based on the several references to separate grants of citizenship, it is probable that these honors were bestowed multiple times over the years to succeeding generations of Plataean exiles.

<text>Otto Wallach (; 27 March 1847 – 26 February 1931) was a German chemist and recipient of the 1910 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on alicyclic compounds.

==Biography==
Wallach was born in Königsberg, the son of a Prussian civil servant. His father, Gerhard Wallach, descended from a Jewish family that had converted to Lutheranism. His mother, Otillie (Thoma), was an ethnic German of Protestant religion. Wallach&#x27;s father was transferred to Stettin (Szczecin) and later to Potsdam. Otto Wallach went to school, a &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, in Potsdam, where he learned about literature and the history of art, two subjects he was interested his whole life. At this time he also started private chemical experiments at the house of his parents.

In 1867 he started studying chemistry at the University of Göttingen, where at this time Friedrich Wöhler was head of organic chemistry. After one semester at the University of Berlin with August Wilhelm von Hofmann, Wallach received his Doctoral degree from the University of Göttingen in 1869, and worked as a professor in the University of Bonn (1870–89) and the University of Göttingen (1889–1915). Two of his doctoral students were Adolf Sieverts and Walter Haworth. Wallach died at Göttingen. In 1912, he was awarded the Davy Medal.

He died on 26 February 1931, and was buried in the Göttingen.

==Major works==
During his work with Friedrich Kekulé in Bonn he started a systematic analysis of the terpenes present in essential oils. Up to this time only a few had been isolated in pure form, and structural information was sparse. Melting point comparison and the measurement of mixtures was one of the methods to confirm identical substances. For this method the mostly liquid terpenes had to be transformed into crystalline compounds. With stepwise derivatisation, especially additions to the double bond present in some of the terpenes, he achieved the goal of obtaining crystalline compounds. The investigation of the rearrangement reactions of cyclic unsaturated terpenes made it possible to obtain the structure of an unknown terpene by following the rearrangement to a known structure of a terpene. With these principal methods he opened the path to systematic research on terpenes.

He was responsible for naming terpene and pinene, and for undertaking the first systematic study of pinene.

He wrote a book about the chemistry of terpenes, &quot;Terpene und Campher&quot; (1909).

Otto Wallach is known for Wallach&#x27;s rule, Wallach degradation, the Leuckart-Wallach reaction (which he developed along with Rudolf Leuckart) and the Wallach rearrangement.

<text>Aimable-Jean-Jacques Pélissier, 1st Duc de Malakoff (6 November 179422 May 1864), was a Marshal of France. He served in Algeria where he became widely known for his cruel conduct and extermination of entire tribes. He also served elsewhere, and as a general commanded the French forces in the Crimean War.

== Biography ==
Pélissier was born at Maromme (&quot;Seine Inférieure&quot;), of a family of prosperous artisans, his father being employed in a powder-magazine. After attending the military college of La Flèche and the special school of St Cyr, he entered the army in 1815 as second-lieutenant in an artillery regiment. Brilliant examination results in 1819 secured his appointment to the staff. He served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; in the Spanish campaign of 1823, and in the Morea expedition 1828–1829. In 1830, he took part in the expedition to Algeria, and on his return was promoted to the rank of &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot;.

After some years of staff service in Paris, he was again sent to Algeria as chief of staff of the province of Oran with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and remained there until the Crimean War, taking a leading part in many important operations. However, the severity of his conduct in suffocating the whole Ouled Riah tribe in the Dahra or Dahna caves, near Mostaganem, where they had taken refuge (18 June 1845), aroused such indignation in Europe that Marshal Soult, the minister of war, publicly expressed his regret; but Marshal Bugeaud, the governor-general of Algeria, not only approved, but secured for Pélissier the rank of général de brigade (Brigadier-General), which he held until 1850, when he was promoted to général de division (Major-General). In 1852 he successfully commanded the Siege of Laghouat.

After the battles of October and November 1854 before Sevastopol, Pélissier was sent to the Crimea, where on 16 May 1855 he succeeded Marshal Canrobert as commander-in-chief of the French forces before the Siege of Sevastopol. His command was marked by relentless pressure of the enemy and unalterable determination to conduct the campaign without interference from Paris. His perseverance was crowned with success in the storming of the Tower of Malakoff on 8 September which ended the Siege of Sevastopol, crowning the Anglo-French Crimean War against Russia with victory. On the 12th he was promoted to marshal. On his return to Paris he was named senator, created &quot;Duke of Malakoff&quot; (22 July 1856; the only other victory title awarded by Napoleon III, also ducal, was for the victory by Patrice de MacMahon in the battle of Magenta, in the Italian campaign), and rewarded with a grant of 100,000 francs per annum.

From March 1858 to May 1859, he was French ambassador in London, but was recalled to take command of the army of observation on the Rhine. In the same year, he became Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour. In 1860, he was appointed Governor-General of unruly colony of Algeria.

His Excellency the Duke died there in 1864, when the dukedom became extinct.

<doc id="182075" wikidata="Q642488" url="?curid=182075" title="Richard Lindzen">
<text>Richard Siegmund Lindzen (born February 8, 1940) is an American atmospheric physicist known for his work in the dynamics of the middle atmosphere, atmospheric tides, and ozone photochemistry. He is the author of more than 200 scientific papers. From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. In 1983, he was appointed as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he would remain until his retirement in 2013. Lindzen has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change and criticizes what he has called &quot;climate alarmism&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lindzen was born on February 8, 1940, in Webster, Massachusetts. His father, a shoemaker, had fled Nazi Germany with his mother. Lindzen moved to The Bronx soon after his birth and grew up in a Jewish household in a predominantly Catholic neighborhood.

Lindzen attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he won Regents&#x27; and National Merit Scholarships, then Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute before matriculating at Harvard University. In 1960, he graduated Bachelor of Arts in physics, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, followed by a Master of Science degree in applied mathematics in 1961 and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics in 1964. His doctoral thesis, &quot;Radiative and photochemical processes in strato- and mesospheric dynamics&quot;, was about the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer, and dynamics in the middle atmosphere.

==Career==
Lindzen has published papers on Hadley circulation, monsoon meteorology, planetary atmospheres, hydrodynamic instability, mid-latitude weather, global heat transport, the water cycle, ice ages and seasonal atmospheric effects. His main contribution to the academic literature on anthropogenic climate change is his proposal of the iris hypothesis in 2001, with co-authors Ming-Dah Chou and Arthur Y. Hou.

Lindzen is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Science, Health, and Economic Advisory Council at the Annapolis Center for Science-Based Public Policy. He joined MIT in 1983, prior to which he held positions at the University of Washington (1964–65), the Institute for Theoretical Meteorology at the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oslo (1965–67), the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) (1966–67), and the University of Chicago (1968–72). From 1972 to 1982, he served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Dynamic Meteorology at Harvard University. Lindzen also briefly held a position of visiting lecturer at UCLA in 1967.

As of January 2010, his publications list included 230 papers and articles published between 1965 and 2008, with five in process for 2009. He is the author of a standard textbook on atmospheric dynamics, and co-authored the monograph &quot;Atmospheric Tides&quot; with Sydney Chapman.

He was Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at MIT from 1983, until his retirement which was reported in the Spring 2013 newsletter of MIT&#x27;s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS). On December 27, 2013, the Cato Institute announced his appointment as a Distinguished Senior Fellow in its Center for the Study of Science.

==Early work (1964–1972)==
Lindzen&#x27;s early work was concerned with ozone photochemistry, the aerodynamics of the middle atmosphere, the theory of atmospheric tides, and planetary waves. His work in these areas led him to a number of fundamental scientific discoveries, including the discovery of negative equivalent depths in classical tidal theory, explanations for both the quasi-biennial oscillation of the Earth&#x27;s stratosphere and the four-day period of the superrotation of the Venus atmosphere above the cloud top.

===Ozone photochemistry===
His PhD thesis of 1964 concerned the interactions of ozone photochemistry, radiative transfer and the dynamics of the middle atmosphere. This formed the basis of his seminal &quot;Radiative and Photochemical Processes in Mesospheric Dynamics&quot; that was published in four parts in the &quot;Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences&quot; between 1965 and 1966. The first of these, &quot;Part I: Models for Radiative and Photochemical Processes&quot;, was co-authored with his Harvard colleague and former PhD thesis advisor, Richard M. Goody, who is well known for his 1964 textbook &quot;Atmospheric Radiation&quot;. The Lindzen and Goody (1965) study has been widely cited as foundational in the exact modeling of middle atmosphere ozone photochemistry. This work was extended in 1973 to include the effects of nitrogen and hydrogen reactions with his former PhD student, Donna Blake, in &quot;Effect of photochemical models on calculated equilibria and cooling rates in the stratosphere&quot;.

Lindzen&#x27;s work on ozone photochemistry has been important in studies that look at the effects that anthropogenic ozone depletion will have on climate.

===Atmospheric tides===
Since the time of Pierre-Simon Laplace (1799), scientists had been puzzled as to why pressure variations measured at the Earth&#x27;s surface associated with the semi-diurnal solar tide dominate those of the diurnal tide in amplitude, when intuitively one would expect the diurnal passage of the sun to dominate. Lord Kelvin (1882) had proposed the so-called &quot;resonance&quot; theory, wherein the semi-diurnal tide would be &quot;selected&quot; over the diurnal oscillation if the atmosphere was somehow able to oscillate freely at a period of very close to 12 hours, in the same way that overtones are selected on a vibrating string. By the second half of the twentieth century, however, observations had failed to confirm this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis was proposed that something must instead suppress the diurnal tide. In 1961, Manfred Siebert suggested that absorption of solar insolation by tropospheric water vapour might account for the reduction of the diurnal tide. However, he failed to include a role for stratospheric ozone. This was rectified in 1963 by the Australian physicist Stuart Thomas Butler and his student K.A. Small who showed that stratospheric ozone absorbs an even greater part of the solar insolation.

Nevertheless, the predictions of classical tidal theory still did not agree with observations. It was Lindzen, in his 1966 paper, &quot;On the theory of the diurnal tide&quot;, who showed that the solution set of Hough functions given by Bernhard Haurwitz to Laplace&#x27;s tidal equation was incomplete: modes with negative equivalent depths had been omitted. Lindzen went on to calculate the thermal response of the diurnal tide to ozone and water vapor absorption in detail and showed that when his theoretical developments were included, the surface pressure oscillation was predicted with approximately the magnitude and phase observed, as were most of the features of the diurnal wind oscillations in the mesosphere. In 1967, along with his NCAR colleague, Douglas D. McKenzie, Lindzen extended the theory to include a term for Newtonian cooling due to emission of infrared radiation by carbon dioxide in the stratosphere along with ozone photochemical processes, and then in 1968 he showed that the theory also predicted that the semi-diurnal oscillation would be insensitive to variations in the temperature profile, which is why it is observed so much more strongly and regularly at the surface.

While holding the position of research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, CO Lindzen was noticed and befriended by Professor Sydney Chapman, who had contributed to the theory of atmospheric tides in a number of papers from the 1920s through to the 1940s. This led to their joint publication in 1969 of a 186-page monograph (republished in 1970 as a book) &quot;Atmospheric Tides&quot;.

===Quasi-biennial oscillation===
Although it wasn&#x27;t realized at the time, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was observed during the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, when the ash from the volcano was transported around the globe from east to west by stratospheric winds in about two weeks. These winds became known as the &quot;Krakatoa easterlies&quot;. It was observed again in 1908, by the German meteorologist Arthur Berson, who saw that winds blow from the west at altitude in tropical Africa from his balloon experiments. These became known as the &quot;Berson westerlies&quot;. However, it was not until the early 1960s that the ~ 26-month cycle of the QBO was first described, independently by Richard J. Reed in 1960 and Veryhard and Ebdon in 1961.

Lindzen recalls his discovery of the mechanism underlying the QBO in the semi-autobiographical review article, &quot;On the development of the theory of the QBO&quot;. His interest in the phenomenon began in 1961 when his PhD advisor, Richard M. Goody, speculated that the 26-month relaxation time for stratospheric ozone at in the tropics might somehow be related to the 26-month period of the QBO, and suggested investigation of this idea as a thesis topic. In fact, Lindzen&#x27;s, &quot;Radiative and photochemical processes in mesospheric dynamics, Part II: Vertical propagation of long period disturbances at the equator&quot;, documented the failure of this attempt to explain the QBO.

Lindzen&#x27;s work on atmospheric tides led him to the study of planetary waves and the general circulation of atmospheres. By 1967, he had contributed a number of papers on the theory of waves in the middle atmosphere. In &quot;Planetary waves on beta planes&quot;, he developed a beta plane approximation for simplifying the equations of classical tidal theory, whilst at the same time developing planetary wave relations. He noticed from his equations that eastward-traveling waves (known as &quot;Rossby waves&quot; since their discovery in 1939 by Carl-Gustav Rossby) and westward-traveling waves (which Lindzen himself helped in establishing as &quot;atmospheric Kelvin waves&quot;) with periods less than five days were &quot;vertically trapped.&quot; At the same time, an important paper by Booker and Bretherton appeared, which Lindzen read with great interest. Booker and Bretherton showed that vertically propagating gravity waves were completely absorbed at a critical level.

In his 1968 paper with James R. Holton, &quot;A theory of the quasi-biennial oscillation&quot;, Lindzen presented his theory of the QBO after testing it in a two-dimensional (2-D) numerical model that had been developed by Holton and John M. Wallace. They showed that the QBO could be driven by vertically propagating gravity waves with phase speeds in both westward and eastward directions and that the oscillation arose through a mechanism involving a two-way feedback between the waves and the mean flow. It was a bold conjecture, given that there was very little observational evidence available to either confirm or confute the hypothesis. In particular, there was still no observational evidence of the westward-traveling &quot;Kelvin&quot; waves; Lindzen postulated their existence theoretically.

In the years following the publication of Lindzen and Holton (1968), more observational evidence became available, and Lindzen&#x27;s fundamental insight into the mechanism driving the QBO was confirmed. However, the theory of interaction via critical level absorption was found to be incomplete and was modified to include the importance of attenuation due to radiative cooling. The revised theory was published in the Holton and Lindzen (1972) paper, &quot;An updated theory for the quasibiennial cycle of the tropical stratosphere&quot;.

===Superrotation of Venus===
Since the 1960s a puzzling phenomenon has been observed in the atmosphere of Venus. The atmosphere above the cloud base is seen to travel around the planet about 50 times faster than the rotation of the planet surface, or in only four to five Earth-days. In 1974 a theory was proposed by Stephen B. Fels and Lindzen to explain this so-called &quot;superrotation&quot; which held that the rotation is driven by the thermal atmospheric tide. An alternative theory was proposed by Peter J. Gierasch in the following year which held instead that the meridional (Hadley) circulation may transport the momentum by eddy-mixing. As of 2005, the actual cause of this phenomenon continued to be debated in the literature, with General Circulation Model experiments suggesting that both the Fels/Lindzen and Gierasch mechanisms are involved.

== Middle period (1972–1990) ==
From 1972 to 1982 Lindzen was a professor of dynamic meteorology at Harvard University. From February to June 1975 he was a visiting professor of dynamic meteorology at MIT, and during part of 1979 Lindzen was a visiting professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, before switching affiliations to MIT as the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology in 1983.

During this time, Lindzen published some research on gravity waves, as well as Hadley circulations. He is named as one of 16 Scientific Members of the team authoring the National Academy of Sciences 1975 publication &quot;Understanding Climatic Change: A Program for Action&quot;.

== Final period (1990–2010) ==

===Climate sensitivity===
Lindzen hypothesized that the Earth may act like an infrared iris. A sea surface temperature increase in the tropics would result in reduced cirrus clouds and thus more infrared radiation leakage from Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Additionally, rising temperatures would cause more extensive drying due to increased areas of atmospheric subsidence. This hypothesis suggests a negative feedback which would counter the effects of warming by lowering the climate sensitivity. Satellite data from CERES has led researchers investigating Lindzen&#x27;s theory to conclude that the Iris effect would instead warm the atmosphere. Lindzen disputed this, claiming that the negative feedback from high-level clouds was still larger than the weak positive feedback estimated by Lin et al.

Lindzen has expressed his concern over the validity of computer models used to predict future climate change. Lindzen said that predicted warming may be overestimated because of their handling of the climate system&#x27;s water vapor feedback. The feedback due to water vapor is a major factor in determining how much warming would be expected to occur with increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and all existing computer models assume positive feedback — that is, that as the climate warms, the amount of water vapour held in the atmosphere will increase, leading to further warming. By contrast, Lindzen believes that temperature increases will actually cause more extensive drying due to increased areas of atmospheric subsidence as a result of the Iris effect, nullifying future warming. This claim was criticized by climatologist Gavin Schmidt, Director of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who notes the more generally-accepted understanding of the effects of the Iris effect and cites empirical cases where large and relatively rapid changes in the climate such as El Niño events, the Ultra-Plinian eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, and recent trends in global temperature and water vapor levels show that, as predicted in the generally-accepted view, water vapor increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as temperatures decrease.

Contrary to the IPCC&#x27;s assessment in 2001, Lindzen said that climate models are inadequate. Despite accepted errors in their models, e.g., treatment of clouds, modelers still thought their climate predictions were valid. Lindzen has stated that due to the non-linear effects of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, CO2 levels are now around 30% higher than pre-industrial levels but temperatures have responded by about 75% of the expected value for a doubling of CO2. The IPCC (2007) estimates that the expected rise in temperature due to a doubling of CO2 to be about , ± 1.5°. Lindzen has given estimates of the Earth&#x27;s climate sensitivity to be 0.5 °C based on ERBE data. These estimates were criticized by Kevin E. Trenberth and others, and Lindzen accepted that his paper included &quot;some stupid mistakes&quot;. When interviewed, he said &quot;It was just embarrassing&quot;, and added that &quot;The technical details of satellite measurements are really sort of grotesque.&quot; Lindzen and Choi revised their paper and submitted it to &quot;PNAS&quot;. The four reviewers of the paper, two of whom had been selected by Lindzen, strongly criticized the paper and PNAS rejected it for publication. Lindzen and Choi then succeeded in getting a little known Korean journal to publish it as a 2011 paper. Andrew Dessler published a paper which found errors in Lindzen and Choi 2011, and concluded that the observations it had presented &quot;are not in fundamental disagreement with mainstream climate models, nor do they provide evidence that clouds are causing climate change. Suggestions that significant revisions to mainstream climate science are required are therefore not supported.&quot;

===NAS panel===
In 2001, Lindzen served on an 11-member panel organized by the National Academy of Sciences. The panel&#x27;s report, titled &quot;Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions&quot;, has been widely cited. Lindzen subsequently publicly criticized the report summary for not referring to the statement in the full report that twenty years of temperature measurements was &quot;too short a period for estimating long term trends&quot;.

===IPCC activities===
Lindzen worked on Chapter 7 of 2001 IPCC Working Group 1, which considers the physical processes that are active in real world climate. He had previously been a contributor to Chapter 4 of the 1995 &quot;IPCC Second Assessment&quot;. He described the full 2001 IPCC report as &quot;an admirable description of research activities in climate science&quot; although he criticized the Summary for Policymakers. Lindzen stated in May 2001 that it did not truly summarize the IPCC report but had been amended to state more definite conclusions. He also emphasized the fact that the summary had not been written by scientists alone. The NAS panel on which Lindzen served says that the summary was the result of dialogue between scientists and policymakers.

===Work at Cato Institute===
Lindzen was a featured speaker at a Cato Institute conference, &quot;Global Environmental Crisis: Science or Politics?&quot; on June 5 (World Environment Day) and June 6, 1991. The conference was identified in 2019 in the book &quot;Kochland&quot; by business writer Christopher Leonard as a previously unhighlighted early landmark in the efforts by the fossil fuel multi-billionaire Koch brothers to promote questions about climate science. Cato Institute was &quot;founded and heavily funded for years&quot; by the Kochs, and Lindzen was prominently quoted in the brochure for the conference.
The notion that global warming is a fact and will be catastrophic is drilled into people to the point where it seems surprising that anyone would question it, and yet, underlying it is very little evidence at all. Nonetheless, there are statements made of such overt unrealism that I feel embarrassed. I feel it discredits science. I think problems will arise when one will need to depend on scientific judgment, and by ruining our credibility now you leave society with a resource of some importance diminished.
The title of the presentation Lindzen made at the conference was &quot;Critical Issues in Climate Forecasting&quot;.

In an announcement on December 27, 2013, the Institute said that in a new position at Cato, Lindzen&#x27;s focus would be on &quot;the interaction between science and policymakers&quot; and that he would study &quot;whether the move from largely private funding to public support has introduced biases into science and the public policies informed by science.&quot;

By mid-2019, Lindzen was no longer affiliated with the Cato institute.

==Views on climate change==
In June 1992, a year after the Cato Institute conference, Lindzen signed the Heidelberg Appeal.

He has criticized the scientific consensus on global climate change, claiming that scientists are just as liable to err when the science appears to point in just one direction. He drew an analogy in 1996 between the consensus in the early and mid-twentieth century on eugenics and the current consensus about global warming. In a 2007 interview on The Larry King Show, Lindzen said:
In a 2009 editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Lindzen said that the earth was just emerging from the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; in the 19th century and says that it is &quot;not surprising&quot; to see warming after that. Lindzen states that the IPCC&#x27;s 2001 findings were

According to an April 30, 2012 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;Dr. Lindzen accepts the elementary tenets of climate science. He agrees that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, calling people who dispute that point &#x27;nutty.&#x27; He agrees that the level of it is rising because of human activity and that this should warm the climate.&quot; He also believes that decreasing tropical cirrus clouds in a warmer world will allow more longwave radiation to escape the atmosphere, counteracting the warming. Lindzen first published this &quot;iris&quot; theory in 2001, and offered more support in a 2009 paper.

===Comments addressed to U.S. policymakers===
Starting in 1991, Lindzen has provided testimonies to the U.S. Senate and House committees regarding his understandings of the current state of research on climate change for multiple times.

In 2001, Lindzen urged the Bush administration not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In a letter to Mayor David B. Cohen of Newton, Massachusetts, Lindzen wrote that he believed the Kyoto Protocol would increase the cost of electricity for no gain, putting signatory states at a competitive disadvantage.

In 2017, Lindzen sent a petition to President Trump, asking the President to withdraw the United States from the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The petition contained the names of &quot;around 300 eminent scientists and other qualified individuals&quot;, and called on the United States and other nations to &quot;change course on an outdated international agreement that targets minor greenhouse gases&quot;, starting with carbon dioxide. It received considerable media coverage; 22 then- current or retired MIT professors promptly issued an open letter addressed to Trump saying that Lindzen&#x27;s petition does not represent their views or those of the vast majority of other climate scientists.

===Third-party characterizations of Lindzen===
An April 30, 2012, article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; included the comments of several other experts. Christopher S. Bretherton, an atmospheric researcher at the University of Washington, said Lindzen is &quot;feeding upon an audience that wants to hear a certain message, and wants to hear it put forth by people with enough scientific reputation that it can be sustained for a while, even if it&#x27;s wrong science. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s intellectually honest at all.&quot; Kerry A. Emanuel, another M.I.T. scientist, said of Lindzen&#x27;s views &quot;Even if there were no political implications, it just seems deeply unprofessional and irresponsible to look at this and say, &#x27;We&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s not a problem.&#x27; It&#x27;s a special kind of risk, because it&#x27;s a risk to the collective civilization.&quot;

A 1996 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; included the comments of several other experts. Jerry D. Mahlman, director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, did not accept Lindzen&#x27;s assessment of the science, and said that Lindzen had &quot;sacrificed his luminosity by taking a stand that most of us feel is scientifically unsound.&quot; Mahlman did, however, admit that Lindzen was a &quot;formidable opponent&quot;. William Gray of Colorado State University basically agreed with Lindzen, describing him as &quot;courageous&quot;. He said, &quot;A lot of my older colleagues are very skeptical on the global warming thing&quot;. He added that while he regarded some of Lindzen&#x27;s views as flawed, he said that, &quot;across the board he&#x27;s generally very good&quot;. John Wallace of the University of Washington agreed with Lindzen that progress in climate change science had been exaggerated, but said there are &quot;relatively few scientists who are as skeptical of the whole thing as Dick [Lindzen] is&quot;.

The November 10, 2004, online version of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine reported that Lindzen is &quot;willing to take bets that global average temperatures in 20 years will in fact be lower than they are now&quot;. However, on June 8, 2005, they reported that Lindzen insisted that he had been misquoted, after James Annan contacted Lindzen to make the bet but claimed that &quot;Lindzen would take only 50 to 1 odds&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in June 2016 that Lindzen has been a beneficiary of Peabody Energy, a coal company that has funded multiple groups contesting the climate consensus.

Lindzen has been called a &quot;contrarian&quot;, in relation to climate change and other issues. Lindzen&#x27;s graduate students describe him as &quot;fiercely intelligent, with a deep contrarian streak.&quot;

The characterization of Lindzen as a contrarian has been reinforced by reports that he claims that lung cancer has only been weakly linked to smoking. When asked about this during an interview as part of an Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, Lindzen said that while &quot;the case for second-hand tobacco is not very good ... the World Health Organization also said that&quot; (referencing a 1998 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)), on the other hand &quot;With first-hand smoke it&#x27;s a more interesting issue ... The case for lung cancer is very good but it also ignores the fact that there are differences in people&#x27;s susceptibilities which the Japanese studies have pointed to.&quot; Again, when asked to clarify his position Lindzen wrote &quot;there was a reasonable case for the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer, but that the case was not so strong that one should rule that any questions were out of order ... the much, much weaker case against second hand smoke [is] also being treated as dogma.&quot;

<text>Severo Ochoa de Albornoz (; 24 September 1905 – 1 November 1993) was a Spanish physician and biochemist, and winner of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine together with Arthur Kornberg for their discovery of &quot;the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&quot;.

==Education and early life ==
Ochoa was born in Luarca (Asturias), Spain. His father was Severo Manuel Ochoa (who he was named after), a lawyer and businessman, and his mother was Carmen de Albornoz. Ochoa was the nephew of Álvaro de Albornoz (President of the Second Spanish Republic in exile and former Foreign Minister), and a cousin of the poet and critic Aurora de Albornoz. His father died when Ochoa was seven, and he and his mother moved to Málaga, where he attended elementary school through high school. His interest in biology was stimulated by the publications of the Spanish neurologist and Nobel laureate Santiago Ramón y Cajal. In 1923, he went to the University of Madrid Medical School, where he hoped to work with Ramón y Cajal, but Ramón y Cajal retired. He studied with father Pedro Arrupe, and Juan Negrín was his teacher:

Negrín encouraged Ochoa and another student, José Valdecasas, to isolate creatinine from urine. The two students succeeded and also developed a method to measure small levels of muscle creatinine. Ochoa spent the summer of 1927 at University of Glasgow working with D. Noel Paton on creatine metabolism and improving his English skills. He also refined the assay procedure further and upon returning to Spain he and Valdecasas submitted a paper describing the work to the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot;, where it was rapidly accepted, marking the beginning of Ochoa&#x27;s biochemistry career.

Ochoa completed his undergraduate medical degree in the summer of 1929 and decide to go abroad again to gain further research experience. His creatine and creatinine work led to an invitation to join Otto Meyerhof&#x27;s laboratory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology in Berlin-Dahlem in 1929. At that time the institute was a &quot;hot bed&quot; of the rapidly evolving discipline of biochemistry, and thus Ochoa had the experience of meeting and interacting with scientists such as Otto Heinrich Warburg, Carl Neuberg, Einar Lundsgaard, and Fritz Lipmann in addition to Meyerhof who had received the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine less than a decade earlier.
In 1930 Ochoa returned to Madrid to complete research for his MD thesis, which he defended that year. In 1931, a newly minted MD, he married Carmen García Cobián. They did not have any children. He then began postdoctoral study at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, where he worked with Henry Hallett Dale. His London research involved the enzyme glyoxalase and was an important departure in Ochoa&#x27;s career in two respects. First, the work marked the beginning of Ochoa&#x27;s lifelong interest in enzymes. Second, the project was at the cutting edge of the rapidly evolving study of intermediary metabolism.

==Career and research==
In 1933 the Ochoas returned to Madrid where he began to study glycolysis in heart muscle. Within two years, he was offered the directorship of the Physiology Section in a newly created Institute for Medical Research at the University of Madrid Medical School. Unfortunately the appointment was made just as the Spanish Civil War erupted. Ochoa decided that trying to perform research in such an environment would destroy forever his &quot;chances of becoming a scientist.&quot; Thus, &quot;after much thought, my wife and I decided to leave Spain.&quot; In September 1936 they began what he later called the &quot;wander years&quot; as they traveled from Spain to Germany, to England, and ultimately to the United States within a span of four years.

Ochoa left Spain and returned to Meyerhof&#x27;s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology now relocated in Heidelberg, where Ochoa found a profoundly changed research focus. During his 1930 visit the laboratory work was &quot;classical physiology,&quot; which Ochoa described as &quot;one could see muscles twitching everywhere&quot;. By 1936 Meyerhof&#x27;s laboratory had become one of the world&#x27;s foremost biochemical facilities focused on processes such as glycolysis and fermentation. Rather than studying muscles &quot;twitch,&quot; the lab was now purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved in muscle action and those involved in yeast fermentation.

From then until 1938, he held many positions and worked with many people at many places. For example, Otto Meyerhof appointed him Guest Research Assistant at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg for one year. From 1938 until 1941 he was Demonstrator and Nuffield Research Assistant at the University of Oxford.

=== United States ===
Ochoa then went to the United States, where he again held many positions at several universities. Between 1940 and 1942, Ochoa worked for Washington University&#x27;s School of Medicine. In 1942 he was appointed research associate in medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and there subsequently became assistant professor of biochemistry (1945), professor of pharmacology (1946), professor of biochemistry (1954), and chair of the department of biochemistry.

In 1956, he became an American citizen. He was elected to both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957. In 1959, Ochoa and Arthur Kornberg were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discovery of the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid&quot;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1961.

Ochoa continued research on protein synthesis and replication of RNA viruses until 1985, when he returned to now democratic Spain where he was a science advisor. Ochoa was also a recipient of U.S. National Medal of Science in 1978.

Severo Ochoa died in Madrid, Spain on 1 November 1993. Carmen García Cobián had died in 1986.

Long after his death, Spanish actress Sara Montiel claimed that she and Severo Ochoa were involved in a romantic relationship in the 1950s, as stated in an interview in Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot;: &quot;The great love of my life was Severo Ochoa. But it was an impossible love. Clandestine. He was married, and besides, him doing research and me doing films wasn&#x27;t a good match.&quot;
===Legacy===

A new research center in the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), that was planned in the 1970s, was finally open in 1975 (CBM) and named, after his dead, the Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa.

In Leganés, Madrid, a hospital bears his name, as does the Madrid Metro station serving it, Hospital Severo Ochoa.

The asteroid 117435 Severochoa is also named in his honor.

In 2003 the Spanish General Post Office (Correos) issued a €0,76 postage stamp honoring Ochoa, as one of a pair featuring Spanish medical Nobel Prize winners alongside Santiago Ramón y Cajal. 

In June 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp honoring him, as part of the &quot;American Scientists&quot; collection, along with Melvin Calvin, Asa Gray, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer. This was the third volume in the series.

The main road in to the tourist resort Benidorm is named Avenida Dr. Severo Ochoa in his honor.

<text>A hydrogen carrier is an organic macromolecule that transports atoms of hydrogen from one place to another inside a cell or from cell to cell for use in various metabolical processes. Examples include NADPH, NADH, and FADH. The main role of these is to transport hydrogen atom to electron transport chain which will change ADP to ATP by adding one phosphate during metabolic processes (e.g. photosynthesis and respiration). Hydrogen carrier participates in an oxidation-reduction reaction by getting reduced due to the acceptance of a Hydrogen. The enzyme used in Glycolysis, Dehydrogenase is used to attach the hydrogen to one of the hydrogen carrier.

<doc id="182080" wikidata="Q47737" url="?curid=182080" title="Kahlil Gibran">
<text>Gibran Khalil Gibran (January 6, 1883 – April 10, 1931), usually referred to in English as Kahlil Gibran, was a Lebanese-American writer, poet and visual artist; he was also considered a philosopher, although he himself rejected the title. He is best known as the author of &quot;The Prophet&quot;, which was first published in the United States in 1923 and has since become one of the best-selling books of all time, having been translated into more than 100 languages.

Born in Bsharri, a village of the Ottoman-ruled Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate to a Maronite Christian family, young Gibran immigrated with his mother and siblings to the United States in 1895. As his mother worked as a seamstress, he was enrolled at a school in Boston, where his creative abilities were quickly noticed by a teacher who presented him to photographer and publisher F. Holland Day. Gibran was sent back to his native land by his family at the age of fifteen to enroll at the Collège de la Sagesse in Beirut. Returning to Boston upon his youngest sister&#x27;s death in 1902, he lost his older half-brother and his mother the following year, seemingly relying afterwards on his remaining sister&#x27;s income from her work at a dressmaker&#x27;s shop for some time.

In 1904, Gibran&#x27;s drawings were displayed for the first time at Day&#x27;s studio in Boston, and his first book in Arabic was published in 1905 in New York City. With the financial help of a newly met benefactress, Mary Haskell, Gibran studied art in Paris from 1908 to 1910. While there, he came in contact with Syrian political thinkers promoting rebellion in Ottoman Syria after the Young Turk Revolution; some of Gibran&#x27;s writings, voicing the same ideas as well as anti-clericalism, would eventually be banned by the Ottoman authorities. In 1911, Gibran settled in New York, where his first book in English, &quot;The Madman&quot;, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1918, with writing of &quot;The Prophet&quot; or &quot;The Earth Gods&quot; also underway. His visual artwork was shown at Montross Gallery in 1914, and at the galleries of M. Knoedler &amp; Co. in 1917. He had also been corresponding remarkably with May Ziadeh since 1912. In 1920, Gibran re-founded the Pen League with fellow Mahjari poets. By the time of his death at the age of 48 from cirrhosis and incipient tuberculosis in one lung, he had achieved literary fame on &quot;both sides of the Atlantic Ocean&quot;, and &quot;The Prophet&quot; had already been translated into German and French. His body was transferred to his birth village of Bsharri (in present-day Lebanon), to which he had bequeathed all future royalties on his books, and where a museum dedicated to his works now stands.

In the words of Suheil Bushrui and Joe Jenkins, Gibran&#x27;s life was &quot;often caught between Nietzschean rebellion, Blakean pantheism and Sufi mysticism.&quot; Gibran discussed different themes in his writings and explored diverse literary forms. Salma Khadra Jayyusi has called him &quot;the single most important influence on Arabic poetry and literature during the first half of [the twentieth] century,&quot; and he is still celebrated as a literary hero in Lebanon. At the same time, &quot;most of Gibran&#x27;s paintings expressed his personal vision, incorporating spiritual and mythological symbolism,&quot; with art critic Alice Raphael recognizing in the painter a classicist, whose work owed &quot;more to the findings of Da Vinci than it [did] to any modern insurgent.&quot; His &quot;prodigious body of work&quot; has been described as &quot;an artistic legacy to people of all nations&quot;.

==Life==
===Childhood===

Gibran was born January 6, 1883, in the village of Bsharri in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, (modern-day Lebanon). The few records mentioning the Gibrans indicate that they arrived at Bsharri towards the end of the 17th-century. While a family myth links them to Chaldean sources, a more plausible story relates that the Gibran family came from Damascus, Syria in the 16th-century, and settled on a farm near Baalbek, later moving to Bash&#x27;elah in 1672. Another story places the origin of the Gibran family in Acre before migrating to Bash&#x27;elah in the year 1300. Gibran parents, Khalil Sa&#x27;ad Gibran and Kamila Rahmeh, the daughter of a priest, were Maronite Christian. As written by Bushrui and Jenkins, they would set for Gibran an example of tolerance by &quot;refusing to perpetuate religious prejudice and bigotry in their daily lives.&quot; Kamila&#x27;s paternal grandfather had converted from Islam to Christianity. She was thirty when Gibran was born, and Gibran&#x27;s father, Khalil, was her third husband. Gibran had two younger sisters, Marianna and Sultana, and an older half-brother, Boutros, from one of Kamila&#x27;s previous marriages. Gibran&#x27;s family lived in poverty. In 1888, Gibran entered Bsharri&#x27;s one-class school, which was run by a priest, and there he learnt the rudiments of Arabic, Syriac, and arithmetic.

Gibran&#x27;s father initially worked in an apothecary, but he had gambling debts he was unable to pay. He went to work for a local Ottoman-appointed administrator. In 1891, while acting as a tax collector, he was removed and his staff was investigated. Khalil was imprisoned for embezzlement, and his family&#x27;s property was confiscated by the authorities. Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States. Although Khalil was released in 1894, Kamila remained resolved and left for New York on June 25, 1895, taking Boutros, Gibran, Marianna and Sultana with her.

Kamila and her children settled in Boston&#x27;s South End, at the time the second-largest Syrian-Lebanese-American community in the United States. Gibran entered the Josiah Quincy School on September 30, 1895. School officials placed him in a special class for immigrants to learn English. His name was registered using the anglicized spelling &#x27;Ka&quot;h&quot;lil Gibran&#x27;. His mother began working as a seamstress peddler, selling lace and linens that she carried from door-to-door. His half-brother Boutros opened a shop. Gibran also enrolled in an art school at Denison House, a nearby settlement house. Through his teachers there, he was introduced to the avant-garde Boston artist, photographer and publisher F. Holland Day, who encouraged and supported Gibran in his creative endeavors. In March 1898, Gibran met Josephine Preston Peabody, eight years his senior, at an exhibition of Day&#x27;s photographs &quot;in which Gibran&#x27;s face was a major subject.&quot; Gibran would develop a romantic attachment to her. The same year, a publisher used some of Gibran&#x27;s drawings for book covers.
Kamila and Boutros wanted Gibran to absorb more of his own heritage rather than just the Western aesthetic culture he was attracted to. Thus, at the age of 15, Gibran returned to his homeland to study Arabic literature for three years at the Collège de la Sagesse, a Maronite-run institute in Beirut, also learning French. In his final year at the school, Gibran created a student magazine with other students, including Youssef Howayek (who would remain a lifelong friend of his), and he was made the &quot;college poet&quot;. Gibran graduated from the school at eighteen with high honors, then went to Paris to learn painting, visiting Greece, Italy, and Spain on his way there from Beirut. On April 2, 1902, Sultana died at the age of 14, from what is believed to have been tuberculosis. Upon learning about it, Gibran returned to Boston, arriving two weeks after Sultana&#x27;s death. The following year, on March 12, Boutros died of the same disease, with his mother passing from cancer on June 28. Two days later, Peabody &quot;left him without explanation.&quot; Marianna supported Gibran and herself by working at a dressmaker&#x27;s shop.

===Debuts, Mary Haskell, and second stay in Paris===

Gibran held the first art exhibition of his drawings in January 1904 in Boston at Day&#x27;s studio. During this exhibition, Gibran met Mary Haskell, the headmistress of a girls&#x27; school in the city, nine years his senior. The two formed a friendship that lasted the rest of Gibran&#x27;s life. Haskell would spend large sums of money to support Gibran and would also edit all of his English writings. The nature of their romantic relationship remains obscure; while some biographers assert the two were lovers but never married because Haskell&#x27;s family objected, other evidence suggests that their relationship was never physically consummated. Gibran and Haskell were engaged briefly between 1910 and 1911. According to Joseph P. Ghougassian, Gibran had proposed to her &quot;not knowing how to repay back in gratitude to Miss Haskell,&quot; but Haskell called it off, making it &quot;clear to him that she preferred his friendship to any burdensome tie of marriage.&quot; Haskell would later marry Jacob Florance Minis in 1926, while remaining Gibran&#x27;s close friend, patroness and benefactress, and using her influence to advance his career.

It was in 1904 also that Gibran met Amin al-Ghurayyib, editor of &quot;Al-Mohajer&quot; (&#x27;The Emigrant&#x27;), where Gibran started to publish articles. In 1905, Gibran&#x27;s first published written work was &quot;A Profile of the Art of Music&quot;, in Arabic, by &quot;Al-Mohajer&quot;″s printing department in New York City. His next work, &quot;Nymphs of the Valley&quot;, was published the following year, also in Arabic. On January 27, 1908, Haskell introduced Gibran to her friend writer Charlotte Teller, aged 31, and in February, to Émilie Michel (Micheline), a French teacher at Haskell&#x27;s school, aged 19. Both Teller and Micheline agreed to pose for Gibran as models and became close friends of his. The same year, Gibran published &quot;Spirits Rebellious&quot; in Arabic, a novel deeply critical of secular and spiritual authority. According to Barbara Young, a late acquaintance of Gibran, &quot;in an incredibly short time it was burned in the market place in Beirut by priestly zealots who pronounced it &#x27;dangerous, revolutionary, and poisonous to youth. The Maronite Patriarchate would let the rumor of his excommunication wander, but would never officially pronounce it.
In July 1908, with Haskell&#x27;s financial support, Gibran went to study art in Paris at the Académie Julian where he joined the &quot;atelier&quot; of Jean-Paul Laurens. Gibran had accepted Haskell&#x27;s offer partly so as to distance himself from Micheline, &quot;for he knew that this love was contrary to his sense of gratefulness toward Miss Haskell&quot;; however, &quot;to his surprise Micheline came unexpectedly to him in Paris.&quot; &quot;She became pregnant, but the pregnancy was ectopic, and she had to have an abortion, probably in France.&quot; Micheline had returned to the United States by late October. Gibran would pay her a visit upon her return to Paris in July 1910, but there would be no hint of intimacy left between them.

By early February 1909, Gibran had &quot;been working for a few weeks in the studio of Pierre Marcel-Béronneau&quot;, and he &quot;used his sympathy towards Béronneau as an excuse to leave the Académie Julian altogether.&quot; In December 1909, Gibran started a series of pencil portraits that he would later call &quot;The Temple of Art&quot;, featuring &quot;famous men and women artists of the day&quot; and &quot;a few of Gibran&#x27;s heroes from past times.&quot; While in Paris, Gibran also entered into contact with Syrian political dissidents, in whose activities he would attempt to be more involved upon his return to the United States. In June 1910, Gibran visited London with Howayek and Ameen Rihani, whom Gibran had met in Paris. Rihani, who was six years older than Gibran, would be Gibran&#x27;s role model for a while, and a friend until at least May 1912. Gibran biographer Robin Waterfield argues that, by 1918, &quot;as Gibran&#x27;s role changed from that of angry young man to that of prophet, Rihani could no longer act as a paradigm&quot;. Haskell (in her private journal entry of May 29, 1924) and Howayek also provided hints at an enmity that began between Gibran and Rihani sometime after May 1912.

===Return to the United States and growing reputation===
Gibran sailed back to New York City from Boulogne-sur-Mer on the &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; on October 22, 1910, and was back in Boston by November 11. By February 1911, Gibran had joined the Boston branch of a Syrian international organization, the Golden Links Society. He lectured there for several months &quot;in order to promote radicalism in independence and liberty&quot; from Ottoman Syria. At the end of April, Gibran was staying in Teller&#x27;s vacant flat at 164 Waverly Place in New York City. &quot;Gibran settled in, made himself known to his Syrian friends—especially Amin Rihani, who was now living in New York—and began both to look for a suitable studio and to sample the energy of New York.&quot; As Teller returned on May 15, he moved to Rihani&#x27;s small room at 28 West 9th Street. Gibran then moved to one of the Tenth Street Studio Building&#x27;s studios for the summer, before changing to another of its studios (number 30, which had a balcony, on the third story) in fall. Gibran would live there until his death, referring to it as &quot;The Hermitage.&quot; Over time, however, and &quot;ostensibly often for reasons of health&quot;, he would spend &quot;longer and longer periods away from New York, sometimes months at a time [...], staying either with friends in the countryside or with Marianna in Boston or on the Massachusetts coast.&quot; His friendships with Teller and Micheline would wane; the last encounter between Gibran and Teller would occur in September 1912, and Gibran would tell Haskell in 1914 that he now found Micheline &quot;repellent.&quot;
In 1912, the poetic novella &quot;Broken Wings&quot; was published in Arabic by the printing house of the periodical &quot;Meraat-ul-Gharb&quot; in New York. Gibran presented a copy of his book to Lebanese writer May Ziadeh, who lived in Egypt, and asked her to criticize it. As worded by Ghougassian,

Gibran and Ziadeh never met. According to Shlomit C. Schuster, &quot;whatever the relationship between Kahlil and May might have been, the letters in &quot;A Self-Portrait&quot; mainly reveal their literary ties. Ziadeh reviewed all of Gibran&#x27;s books and Gibran replies to these reviews elegantly.&quot;
In 1913, Gibran started contributing to &quot;Al-Funoon&quot;, an Arabic-language magazine that had been recently established by Nasib Arida and Abd al-Masih Haddad. &quot;A Tear and a Smile&quot; was published in Arabic in 1914. In December of the same year, visual artworks by Gibran were shown at the Montross Gallery, catching the attention of American painter Albert Pinkham Ryder. Gibran wrote him a prose poem in January and would become one of the aged man&#x27;s last visitors. After Ryder&#x27;s death in 1917, Gibran&#x27;s poem would be quoted first by Henry McBride in the latter&#x27;s posthumous tribute to Ryder, then by newspapers across the country, from which would come the first widespread mention of Gibran&#x27;s name in America. By March 1915, two of Gibran&#x27;s poems had also been read at the Poetry Society of America, after which Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, the younger sister of Theodore Roosevelt, stood up and called them &quot;destructive and diabolical stuff&quot;; nevertheless, beginning in 1918 Gibran would become a frequent visitor at Robinson&#x27;s, also meeting her brother.

===&quot;The Madman&quot;, the Pen League, and &quot;The Prophet&quot;===
Gibran acted as a secretary of the Syrian–Mount Lebanon Relief Committee, which was formed in June 1916. The same year, Gibran met Lebanese author Mikhail Naimy after Naimy had moved from the University of Washington to New York. Naimy, whom Gibran would nickname &quot;Mischa&quot;, had previously made a review of &quot;Broken Wings&quot; in his article &quot;The Dawn of Hope After the Night of Despair&quot;, published in &quot;Al-Funoon&quot;, and he would become &quot;a close friend and confidant, and later one of Gibran&#x27;s biographers.&quot; In 1917, an exhibition of forty wash drawings was held at Knoedler in New York from January 29 to February 19 and another of thirty such drawings at Doll &amp; Richards, Boston, April 16–28.
While most of Gibran&#x27;s early writings had been in Arabic, most of his work published after 1918 was in English. Such was &quot;The Madman&quot;, Gibran&#x27;s first book published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1918. &quot;The Processions&quot; (in Arabic) and &quot;Twenty Drawings&quot; were published the following year. In 1920, Gibran re-created the Arabic-language New York Pen League with Arida and Haddad (its original founders), Rihani, Naimy, and other Mahjari writers such as Elia Abu Madi. The same year, &quot;The Tempests&quot; was published in Arabic in Cairo, and &quot;The Forerunner&quot; in New York.

In a letter of 1921 to Naimy, Gibran reported that doctors had told him to &quot;give up all kinds of work and exertion for six months, and do nothing but eat, drink and rest&quot;; in 1922, Gibran was ordered to &quot;stay away from cities and city life&quot; and had rented a cottage near the sea, planning to move there with Marianna and to remain until &quot;this heart [regained] its orderly course&quot;; this three-month summer in Scituate, he later told Haskell, was a refreshing time, during which he wrote some of &quot;the best Arabic poems&quot; he had ever written.
In 1923, &quot;The New and the Marvelous&quot; was published in Arabic in Cairo, whereas &quot;The Prophet&quot; was published in New York. &quot;The Prophet&quot; sold well despite a cool critical reception. At a reading of &quot;The Prophet&quot; organized by rector William Norman Guthrie in St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery, Gibran met poet Barbara Young, who would occasionally work as his secretary from 1925 until Gibran&#x27;s death; Young did this work without remuneration. In 1924, Gibran told Haskell that he had been contracted to write ten pieces for &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; in Cairo. In 1925, Gibran participated in the founding of the periodical &quot;The New East&quot;.

===Later years and death===

&quot;Sand and Foam&quot; was published in 1926, and &quot;Jesus, the Son of Man&quot; in 1928. At the beginning of 1929, Gibran was diagnosed with an enlarged liver. In a letter dated March 26, he wrote to Naimy that &quot;the rheumatic pains are gone, and the swelling has turned to something opposite&quot;. In a telegram dated the same day, he reported being told by the doctors that he &quot;must not work for full year&quot;, which was something he found &quot;more painful than illness.&quot; The last book published during Gibran&#x27;s life was &quot;The Earth Gods&quot;, on March 14, 1931.

Gibran was admitted to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Manhattan, on April 10, 1931, where he died the same day, aged forty-eight, after refusing the last rites. The cause of death was reported to be cirrhosis of the liver with incipient tuberculosis in one of his lungs. Waterfield argues that the cirrhosis was contracted through excessive drinking of alcohol and was the only real cause of Gibran&#x27;s death.

Gibran had expressed the wish that he be buried in Lebanon. His body lay temporarily at Mount Benedict Cemetery in Boston before it was taken on July 23 to Providence, Rhode Island, and from there to Lebanon on the liner &quot;Sinaia&quot;. Gibran&#x27;s body reached Bsharri in August and was deposited in a church near-by until a cousin of Gibran finalized the purchase of the Mar Sarkis Monastery, now the Gibran Museum.

All future American royalties to his books were willed to his hometown of Bsharri, to be used for &quot;civic betterment.&quot; Gibran had also willed the contents of his studio to Haskell.
In 1950, Haskell donated her personal collection of nearly one hundred original works of art by Gibran (including five oils) to the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah, Georgia. Haskell had been thinking of placing her collection at the Telfair as early as 1914. Her gift to the Telfair is the largest public collection of Gibran&#x27;s visual art in the country.

==Works==
===Writings===
====Forms, themes, and language====
Gibran explored literary forms as diverse as &quot;poetry, parables, fragments of conversation, short stories, fables, political essays, letters, and aphorisms.&quot; Two plays in English and five plays in Arabic were also published posthumously between 1973 and 1993; three unfinished plays written in English towards the end of Gibran&#x27;s life remain unpublished (&quot;The Banshee&quot;, &quot;The Last Unction&quot;, and &quot;The Hunchback or the Man Unseen&quot;). Gibran discussed &quot;such themes as religion, justice, free will, science, love, happiness, the soul, the body, and death&quot; in his writings, which were &quot;characterized by innovation breaking with forms of the past, by symbolism, an undying love for his native land, and a sentimental, melancholic yet often oratorical style.&quot; According to Salma Jayyusi, Roger Allen and others, Gibran as the leading poet of the Mahjar school belongs to Romantic (neo-romantic) movement.

About his language in general (both in Arabic and English), Salma Khadra Jayyusi remarks that &quot;because of the spiritual and universal aspect of his general themes, he seems to have chosen a vocabulary less idiomatic than would normally have been chosen by a modern poet conscious of modernism in language.&quot; According to Jean Gibran and Kahlil G. Gibran,

The poem &quot;You Have Your Language and I Have Mine&quot; (1924) was published in response to criticism of his Arabic language and style.

====Influences and antecedents====
According to Bushrui and Jenkins, an &quot;inexhaustible&quot; source of influence on Gibran was the Bible, especially the King James Version. Gibran&#x27;s literary oeuvre is also steeped in the Syriac tradition. According to Haskell, Gibran once told her that As worded by Waterfield, &quot;the parables of the New Testament&quot; affected &quot;his parables and homilies&quot; while &quot;the poetry of some of the Old Testament books&quot; affected &quot;his devotional language and incantational rhythms.&quot; Annie Salem Otto notes that Gibran avowedly imitated the style of the Bible, whereas other Arabic authors from his time like Rihani unconsciously imitated the Quran.
According to Ghougassian, the works of English poet William Blake &quot;played a special role in Gibran&#x27;s life&quot;, and in particular &quot;Gibran agreed with Blake&#x27;s &quot;apocalyptic vision&quot; of the world as the latter expressed it in his poetry and art.&quot; Gibran wrote of Blake as &quot;the God-man&quot;, and of his drawings as &quot;so far the profoundest things done in English—and his vision, putting aside his drawings and poems, is the most godly.&quot; According to George Nicolas El-Hage,

Gibran was also a great admirer of Syrian poet and writer Francis Marrash, whose works Gibran had studied at the Collège de la Sagesse. According to Shmuel Moreh, Gibran&#x27;s own works echo Marrash&#x27;s style, including the structure of some of his works and &quot;many of [his] ideas on enslavement, education, women&#x27;s liberation, truth, the natural goodness of man, and the corrupted morals of society.&quot; Bushrui and Jenkins have mentioned Marrash&#x27;s concept of universal love, in particular, in having left a &quot;profound impression&quot; on Gibran.

Another influence on Gibran was American poet Walt Whitman, whom Gibran followed &quot;by pointing up the universality of all men and by delighting in nature. According to El-Hage, the influence of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche &quot;did not appear in Gibran&#x27;s writings until &quot;The Tempests&quot;.&quot; Nevertheless, although Nietzsche&#x27;s style &quot;no doubt fascinated&quot; him, Gibran was &quot;not the least under his spell&quot;:
====Critics====
Gibran was neglected by scholars and critics for a long time. Bushrui and John M. Munro have argued that &quot;the failure of serious Western critics to respond to Gibran&quot; resulted from the fact that &quot;his works, though for the most part originally written in English, cannot be comfortably accommodated within the Western literary tradition.&quot; According to El-Hage, critics have also &quot;generally failed to understand the poet&#x27;s conception of imagination and his fluctuating tendencies towards nature.&quot;

===Visual art===
====Overview====
According to Waterfield, &quot;Gibran was confirmed in his aspiration to be a Symbolist painter&quot; after working in Marcel-Béronneau&#x27;s studio in Paris. Oil paint was Gibran&#x27;s &quot;preferred medium between 1908 and 1914, but before and after this time he worked primarily with pencil, ink, watercolor and gouache.&quot; In a letter to Haskell, Gibran wrote that &quot;among all the English artists Turner is the very greatest.&quot; In her diary entry of March 17, 1911, Haskell recorded that Gibran told her he was inspired by J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s painting &quot;The Slave Ship&quot; (1840) to utilize &quot;raw colors [...] one over another on the canvas [...] instead of killing them first on the palette&quot; in what would become the painting &quot;Rose Sleeves&quot; (1911, Telfair Museums).

Gibran created more than seven hundred visual artworks, including the Temple of Art portrait series. His works may be seen at the Gibran Museum in Bsharri; the Telfair Museums in Savannah, Georgia; the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City; in Doha; the Brooklyn Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; and the Harvard Art Museums. A possible Gibran painting was the subject of a September 2008 episode of the PBS TV series &quot;History Detectives&quot;.

==Religious views==
According to Bushrui and Jenkins,

Besides Christianity, Islam and Sufism, Gibran&#x27;s mysticism was also influenced by theosophy and Jungian psychology.

Around 1911–1912, Gibran met with ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the leader of the Baháʼí Faith who was visiting the United States, to draw his portrait. The meeting made a strong impression on Gibran. One of Gibran&#x27;s acquaintances later in life, Juliet Thompson, herself a Baháʼí, reported that Gibran was unable to sleep the night before meeting him. This encounter with ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá later inspired Gibran to write &quot;Jesus the Son of Man&quot; that portrays Jesus through the &quot;words of seventy-seven contemporaries who knew him – enemies and friends: Syrians, Romans, Jews, priests, and poets.&quot; After the death of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Gibran gave a talk on religion with Baháʼís and at another event with a viewing of a movie of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, Gibran rose to proclaim in tears an exalted station of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and left the event weeping.

In the poem &quot;The Voice of the Poet&quot; (), published in &quot;A Tear and a Smile&quot; (1914), Gibran wrote:
In 1921, Gibran participated in an &quot;interrogatory&quot; meeting on the question &quot;Do We Need a New World Religion to Unite the Old Religions?&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery.

==Political thought==
According to Young,

Nevertheless, Gibran called for the adoption of Arabic as a national language of Syria, considered from a geographic point of view, not as a political entity. When Gibran met ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá in 1911–12, who traveled to the United States partly to promote peace, Gibran admired the teachings on peace but argued that &quot;young nations like his own&quot; be freed from Ottoman control. Gibran also wrote his famous poem &quot;Pity the Nation&quot; during these years; it was published posthumously some 20 years later in &quot;The Garden of the Prophet&quot;.

On May 26, 1916, Gibran wrote a letter to Mary Haskell that reads: &quot;The famine in Mount Lebanon has been planned and instigated by the Turkish government. Already 80,000 have succumbed to starvation and thousands are dying every single day. The same process happened with the Christian Armenians and applied to the Christians in Mount Lebanon.&quot; Gibran dedicated a poem named &quot;Dead Are My People&quot; to the fallen of the famine.

When the Ottomans were eventually driven from Syria during World War I, Gibran sketched a euphoric drawing &quot;Free Syria&quot;, which was then printed on the special edition cover of the Arabic-language paper &quot;As-Sayeh&quot; (&quot;The Traveler&quot;; founded 1912 in New York by Haddad). Adel Beshara reports that, &quot;in a draft of a play, still kept among his papers, Gibran expressed great hope for national independence and progress. This play, according to Khalil Hawi, &#x27;defines Gibran&#x27;s belief in Syrian nationalism with great clarity, distinguishing it from both Lebanese and Arab nationalism, and showing us that nationalism lived in his mind, even at this late stage, side by side with internationalism.

According to Waterfield, Gibran &quot;was not entirely in favour of socialism (which he believed tends to seek the lowest common denominator, rather than bringing out the best in people)&quot;.

==Legacy==
The popularity of &quot;The Prophet&quot; grew markedly during the 1960s with the American counterculture and then with the flowering of the New Age movements. It has remained popular with these and with the wider population to this day. Since it was first published in 1923, &quot;The Prophet&quot; has never been out of print. It has been translated into more than 100 languages, making it among the top ten most translated books in history. It was one of the best-selling books of the twentieth century in the United States.
Elvis Presley referred to Gibran&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&quot; for the rest of his life after receiving his first copy as a gift from his girlfriend June Juanico in July 1956. His marked-up copy still exists in Lebanon and another at the Elvis Presley museum in Düsseldorf. A line of poetry from &quot;Sand and Foam&quot; (1926), which reads &quot;Half of what I say is meaningless, but I say it so that the other half may reach you,&quot; was used by John Lennon and placed, though in a slightly altered form, into the song &quot;Julia&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; 1968 album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The White Album&quot;).

Johnny Cash recorded &quot;The Eye of the Prophet&quot; as an audio cassette book, and Cash can be heard talking about Gibran&#x27;s work on a track called &quot;Book Review&quot; on his 2003 album &quot;Unearthed&quot;. British singer David Bowie mentioned Gibran in the song &quot;The Width of a Circle&quot; from Bowie&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;. Bowie used Gibran as a &quot;hip reference&quot;, because Gibran&#x27;s work &quot;A Tear and a Smile&quot; became popular in the hippie counterculture of the 1960s. In 1978 Uruguayan musician Armando Tirelli recorded an album based on &quot;The Prophet&quot;. In 2016 Gibran&#x27;s fable &quot;On Death&quot; from &quot;The Prophet&quot; was composed in Hebrew by Gilad Hochman to the unique setting of soprano, theorbo and percussion, and it premiered in France under the title &quot;River of Silence&quot;.

Gibran&#x27;s influence extends far beyond the artistic world. In his 1961 inaugural address, President John F. Kennedy might have drawn inspiration from Gibran&#x27;s 1925 essay The New Frontier. Echoing Gibran&#x27;s rhetoric for the newly recreated Lebanon, &quot;Are you a politician asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking what you can do for your country?&quot;, Kennedy delivered the iconic line &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country&quot;.   

His most famous work, &quot;The Prophet&quot;, was also the target of a collective adaptation as an eponymous film in 2014. Moreover, in 2018, Nadim Naaman and Dana Al Fardan devoted their musical &quot;Broken Wings&quot; to Kahlil Gibran&#x27;s novel of the same name. The world premiere was staged in London&#x27;s Theatre Royal Haymarket.

===Memorials and honors===

A number of places, monuments and educational institutions throughout the world are named in honor of Gibran, including the Gibran Museum in Bsharri, the Gibran Memorial Plaque in Copley Square, Boston, the Gibran Khalil Gibran Garden in Beirut, the Kahlil Gibran Memorial Garden in Washington, D.C., the Khalil Gibran International Academy in Brooklyn, and the Khalil Gibran Elementary School in Yonkers, New York.

A crater on Mercury was named in his honor in 2009.

==Family==
American sculptor Kahlil G. Gibran (1922–2008) was a cousin of Gibran. The Katter political family in Australia was also related to Gibran. He was described in parliament as a cousin of Bob Katter Sr., a long-time member of the Australian parliament and one-time Minister for the Army, and through him his son Bob Katter, founder of Katter&#x27;s Australian Party and former Queensland state minister, and state politician Robbie Katter.

<doc id="182082" wikidata="Q237833" url="?curid=182082" title="George Santayana">
<text>George Santayana (born Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás, December 16, 1863 – September 26, 1952) was a Spanish-American philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. Born in Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified as an American, yet always retained a valid Spanish passport. At the age of 48, he left his academic position at Harvard University and permanently returned to Europe; his last will was to be buried in the Spanish Pantheon in the Campo di Verano, Rome.

As a philosopher, Santayana is known for aphorisms, such as &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;, and &quot;Only the dead have seen the end of war&quot;, and his definition of beauty as &quot;Pleasure objectified&quot;. Although an atheist, Santayana valued the culture of the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview, in which he was raised. As an intellectual, George Santayana was a broad-range cultural critic in several academic disciplines.

==Early life==
George Santayana was born on December 16, 1863, in Calle de San Bernardo of Madrid and spent his early childhood in Ávila, Spain. His mother Josefina Borrás was the daughter of a Spanish official in the Philippines and he was the only child of her second marriage. Josefina Borrás&#x27; first husband was George Sturgis, a Boston merchant with the Manila firm Russell &amp; Sturgis. She had five children with him; two of them died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband&#x27;s death in 1857; in 1861, she moved with her three surviving children to Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A colonial civil servant, Ruiz de Santayana was a painter and minor intellectual. The family lived in Madrid and Ávila, and Jorge was born in Spain in 1863.

In 1869, Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, because she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the US. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her to Boston in 1872. His father, finding neither Boston nor his wife&#x27;s attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila, and remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered Harvard College and began to take his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, Jorge&#x27;s first name was anglicized to its English equivalent: George.

==Education==
Santayana attended Boston Latin School and Harvard College, where he studied under the philosophers William James and Josiah Royce and was involved in eleven clubs. He was founder and president of the Philosophical Club, a member of the literary society known as the O.K., an editor and cartoonist for &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;, he joined one of Harvard&#x27;s &quot;Final CLubs - the Delphic Club and co-founder of the literary journal &quot;The Harvard Monthly&quot;. In December, 1885, he played the role of Lady Elfrida in the Hasty Pudding theatrical &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, followed by the production &quot;Papillonetta&quot; in the spring of his senior year. He received his A.B. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1886 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. in 1886, Santayana studied for two years in Berlin. He then returned to Harvard to write his dissertation on Hermann Lotze (1889). He was a professor at Harvard from 1889 to 1912, becoming part of the Golden Age of The Harvard University Department of Philosophy. Some of his Harvard students became famous in their own right, including Conrad Aiken, W. E. B. Du Bois, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Horace Kallen, Walter Lippmann and Gertrude Stein. Wallace Stevens was not among his students but became a friend. From 1896 to 1897, Santayana studied at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

==Later life==

Santayana never married. His romantic life, if any, is not well understood. Some evidence, including a comment Santayana made late in life comparing himself to A. E. Housman, and his friendships with people who were openly homosexual and bisexual, has led scholars to speculate that Santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual, but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships.

In 1912, Santayana resigned his position at Harvard to spend the rest of his life in Europe. He had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother. After some years in Ávila, Paris and Oxford, after 1920, he began to winter in Rome, eventually living there year-round until his death. During his 40 years in Europe, he wrote 19 books and declined several prestigious academic positions. Many of his visitors and correspondents were Americans, including his assistant and eventual literary executor, Daniel Cory. In later life, Santayana was financially comfortable, in part because his 1935 novel, &quot;The Last Puritan&quot;, had become an unexpected best-seller. In turn, he financially assisted a number of writers, including Bertrand Russell, with whom he was in fundamental disagreement, philosophically and politically.

Santayana&#x27;s one novel, &quot;The Last Puritan&quot;, is a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, centering on the personal growth of its protagonist, Oliver Alden. His &quot;Persons and Places&quot; is an autobiography. These works also contain many of his sharper opinions and &quot;bons mots&quot;. He wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, literary criticism, the history of ideas, politics, human nature, morals, the influence of religion on culture and social psychology, all with considerable wit and humour.

While his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult, his other writings are more accessible and pithy. He wrote poems and a few plays, and left ample correspondence, much of it published only since 2000. Like Alexis de Tocqueville, Santayana observed American culture and character from a foreigner&#x27;s point of view. Like William James, his friend and mentor, he wrote philosophy in a literary way. Ezra Pound includes Santayana among his many cultural references in &quot;The Cantos&quot;, notably in &quot;Canto LXXXI&quot; and &quot;Canto XCV&quot;. Santayana is usually considered an American writer, although he declined to become an American citizen, resided in Fascist Italy for decades, and said that he was most comfortable, intellectually and aesthetically, at Oxford University. Although an atheist, Santayana considered himself an &quot;aesthetic Catholic&quot; and spent the last decade of his life in Rome under the care of Catholic nuns. In 1941, he entered a hospital and convent run by the Little Company of Mary (also known as the Blue Nuns) on the Celian Hill at 6 Via Santo Stefano Rotondo in Roma, where he was cared for by the sisters until his death in September 1952. Upon his death, he did not want to be buried in consecrated land, which made his burial problematic in Italy. Finally, the Spanish consulate in Rome agreed that he be buried in the Pantheon of the Obra Pía Española, in the Campo Verano cemetery in Rome.

==Philosophical work and publications==
Santayana&#x27;s main philosophical work consists of &quot;The Sense of Beauty&quot; (1896), his first book-length monograph and perhaps the first major work on aesthetics written in the United States; &quot;The Life of Reason&quot; (5 vols., 1905–06), the high point of his Harvard career; &quot;Scepticism and Animal Faith&quot; (1923); and &quot;The Realms of Being&quot; (4 vols., 1927–1940). Although Santayana was not a pragmatist in the mold of William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, or John Dewey, &quot;The Life of Reason&quot; arguably is the first extended treatment of pragmatism written.

Like many of the classical pragmatists, Santayana was committed to metaphysical naturalism. He believed that human cognition, cultural practices, and social institutions have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment. Their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness. The alternate title to &quot;The Life of Reason&quot;, &quot;the Phases of Human Progress&quot;, is indicative of this metaphysical stance.

Santayana was an early adherent of epiphenomenalism, but also admired the classical materialism of Democritus and Lucretius. (Of the three authors on whom he wrote in &quot;Three Philosophical Poets&quot;, Santayana speaks most favorably of Lucretius). He held Spinoza&#x27;s writings in high regard, calling him his &quot;master and model&quot;.

Although an atheist, he held a fairly benign view of religion and described himself as an &quot;aesthetic Catholic&quot;. Santayana&#x27;s views on religion are outlined in his books &quot;Reason in Religion&quot;, &quot;The Idea of Christ in the Gospels&quot;, and &quot;Interpretations of Poetry and Religion&quot;.

He held racial superiority and eugenic views. He believed superior races should be discouraged from &quot;intermarriage with inferior stock&quot;.

==Legacy==
Santayana is remembered in large part for his aphorisms, many of which have been so frequently used as to have become clichéd. His philosophy has not fared quite as well. He is regarded by most as an excellent prose stylist, and John Lachs (who is sympathetic with much of Santayana&#x27;s philosophy) writes, in &quot;On Santayana&quot;, that his eloquence may ironically be the very cause of this neglect.

Santayana influenced those around him, including Bertrand Russell, whom Santayana single-handedly steered away from the ethics of G. E. Moore. He also influenced many prominent people such as Harvard students T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Gertrude Stein, Horace Kallen, Walter Lippmann, W. E. B. Du Bois, Conrad Aiken, Van Wyck Brooks, Felix Frankfurter, Max Eastman, and Wallace Stevens. Stevens was especially influenced by Santayana&#x27;s aesthetics and became a friend even though Stevens did not take courses taught by Santayana.

Santayana is quoted by the Canadian-American sociologist Erving Goffman as a central influence in the thesis of his famous book &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot; (1959). Religious historian Jerome A. Stone credits Santayana with contributing to the early thinking in the development of religious naturalism. English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead quotes Santayana extensively in his magnum opus &quot;Process and Reality&quot; (1929).

Chuck Jones used Santayana&#x27;s description of fanaticism as &quot;redoubling your effort after you&#x27;ve forgotten your aim&quot; to describe his cartoons starring Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner.
==In popular culture==
Santayana&#x27;s passing is referenced in the lyrics to singer-songwriter Billy Joel&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.

The quote &quot;Only the dead have seen the end of war&quot; is frequently attributed or misattributed to Plato; an early example of this misattribution (if it is indeed misattributed) is found in General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s Farewell Speech given to the Corps of Cadets at West Point in 1962.

<text>Timberline Lodge is a mountain lodge on the south side of Mount Hood in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States, about east of Portland. Constructed from 1936 to 1938 by the Works Progress Administration, it was built and furnished by local artisans during the Great Depression. Timberline Lodge was dedicated September 28, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The National Historic Landmark sits at an elevation of , within the Mount Hood National Forest and is accessible through the Mount Hood Scenic Byway. Publicly owned and privately operated, Timberline Lodge is a popular tourist attraction that draws two million visitors annually. It is notable in film for serving as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel in &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980).

The lodge and its grounds host a ski resort, also known as Timberline Lodge. It has the longest skiing season in the U.S., and is open for skiers and snowboarders all 12 months of the year. Activities include skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, hiking, biking, and climbing.

== Design and construction ==

Timberline Lodge, a mountain lodge and resort hotel, is a four-story structure of about . The ground-level exterior walls are heavy rubble masonry, using boulders from the immediate area, and heavy timber is used from the first floor up. The central head house section is hexagonal and in diameter, with a six-sided stone chimney stack high and in diameter. Each of the six fireplace openings—three on the ground floor, three on the first floor—is wide and high. Two wings, running west and southeast, flank the head house. Oregon woods used throughout the building include cedar, Douglas fir, hemlock, western juniper and ponderosa pine.

The architect of Timberline Lodge is Gilbert Stanley Underwood, noted for the Ahwahnee Hotel and other lodges in the U.S. national park system. He produced the designs. Then, his central head house was modified from an octagon to a hexagon by U.S. Forest Service architect W. I. (Tim) Turner and the team of Linn A. Forrest, Howard L. Gifford and Dean R. E. Wright. A recent graduate of the University of Washington, forest service engineer Ward Gano was structural designer.
Timberline Lodge was constructed between 1936 and 1938 as a Works Progress Administration project during The Great Depression. Eighty percent of the WPA&#x27;s $695,730 total expenditure on building costs went toward labor. Skilled building trade workers received ninety cents an hour; unskilled laborers received fifty-five cents an hour. Some of the skilled stonemasons on the project were Italian immigrants brought in after working on The Historic Columbia River Highway and other roads in Oregon. About a hundred construction workers were on site at a given time, and lived at a nearby tent city. Jobs were rotated to provide work.

Materials costs were minimized by the skillful use of recycled materials. Women wove draperies, upholstery, and bedspreads. Hooked rugs were made from strips of old Civilian Conservation Corps camp blankets. Discarded cedar utility poles became newel-posts with their crowns hand-carved into birds, bears, and seals. Fireplace screens were fashioned from tire chains. Andirons and other iron work were forged from railroad tracks. WPA workers used large timbers and local stone from the site.

&quot;All classes, from the most elementary hand labor, through the various degrees of skill to the technically-trained, were employed,&quot; reported the WPA&#x27;s Federal Writers&#x27; Project. &quot;Pick and shovel wielders, stonecutters, plumbers, carpenters, steam-fitters, painters, wood-carvers, cabinet-makers, metal workers, leather-toolers, seamstresses, weavers, architects, authors, artists, actors, musicians, and landscape planners, each contributed to the project, and each, in his way, was conscious of the ideal toward which all bent their energies.&quot;

===Federal Art Project===
Federal Art Project contributions to the project were directed by Margery Hoffman Smith, Oregon Arts Project administrator. Smith created many designs for textiles and rugs. She designed the iconic &quot;snow goose&quot;, the bronze weather vane above the head house. Smith based the abstract forms incised into the lodge chimney on the art of the local Tenino people. Likely-acquainted with William Gray Purcell, a fellow resident of Portland, Smith saw the Prairie School aesthetic carried through in tables, chairs, sectional sofas, columns, bedspreads, draperies, lampshades, and pendant lighting fixtures. She commissioned murals, paintings and carvings from Oregon&#x27;s WPA artists.

==Dedication==
During an inspection tour of government activities in the western U.S., President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated Timberline Lodge on September 28, 1937. In his speech, he said:

This Timberline Lodge marks a venture that was made possible by WPA, emergency relief work, in order that we may test the workability of recreational facilities installed by the Government itself and operated under its complete control.
Here, to Mount Hood, will come thousands and thousands of visitors in the coming years. Looking east toward eastern Oregon with its great livestock raising areas, these visitors are going to visualize the relationship between the cattle ranches and the summer ranges in the forests. Looking westward and northward toward Portland and the Columbia River, with their great lumber and other wood using industries, they will understand the part which National Forest timber will play in the support of this important element of northwestern prosperity.
Those who will follow us to Timberline Lodge on their holidays and vacations will represent the enjoyment of new opportunities for play in every season of the year. I mention specially every season of the year because we, as a nation, I think, are coming to realize that the summer is not the only time for play. I look forward to the day when many, many people from this region of the Nation are going to come here for skiing and tobogganing and various other forms of winter sports.&quot;

He dedicated the lodge, saying, &quot;I am here to dedicate the Timberline Lodge and I do so in the words of the bronze tablet directly in front of me on the coping of this wonderful building: &#x27;Timberline Lodge, Mount Hood National Forest dedicated September 28, 1937, by the President of the United States as a monument to the skill and faithful performance of workers on the rolls of the Works Progress Administration&#x27;&quot;.

FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt enjoyed a celebratory luncheon including salmon and huckleberry pie. In her &quot;My Day&quot; column, Mrs. Roosevelt praised the lodge&#x27;s architectural features: &quot;It is built exclusively of native products and by WPA labor. The interesting central fire place with its many openings is a feature I have seen in no other building of its kind and no where have I seen such big timbers used. All the furniture, all the hangings, all the iron work as well, were made by WPA workers. Here is a group of workers who have the makings of a handcraft organization, and I hope their work will be appreciated. Mr. Griffith, the state WPA administrator, must be happy over the work done here.&quot;

Most work was complete at the time of the dedication. After some interior details were finished, the lodge opened to the public February 4, 1938.

==Operation==

Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s vision of winter sports at Timberline Lodge took hesitant steps the following year. A portable rope tow was installed, and construction began on the Magic Mile chairlift, which opened November 1939.
In the lodge&#x27;s early years, none of its four operators were willing or able to maintain it. By 1955, Timberline Lodge was closed.

Richard Kohnstamm, the next operator, recalled difficulties due to financing problems because the government claimed they owned it. Kohnstamm decided to maintain the place as if he owned it; he lost money during his first five years of operation, but his timing was fortuitous. He took over only a few years before skiing exploded in popularity in the late 1950s. That popularity helped the family generate a profit starting in 1960. Kohnstamm, &quot;the man who saved Timberline&quot;, died at the age of 80 on April 21, 2006. Kohnstamm&#x27;s son Jeff is the Area Operator of Timberline Lodge.

=== As a shooting location ===
==== Film ====

Exterior views of Timberline Lodge were used in &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s 1977 novel set at the fictional Overlook Hotel. The staff and owners were concerned that guests would be reluctant to stay in Room 217 if it were featured in a horror movie; the management requested the room number be changed to the fictional Room 237, which Kubrick granted.
Other feature films shot at or around Timberline Lodge include &quot;Jingle Belles&quot; (1941), &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952), &quot;All the Young Men&quot; (1960), &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1973), &quot;Ski School&quot; (1991), &quot;Hear No Evil&quot; (1993), and &quot;Wild&quot; (2014).

==== Television ====
Brief exterior views of a snowy Timberline Lodge were used as a stand-in for a &quot;Bavarian Ski Resort&quot; in multiple episodes of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. Director Boris Sagal was killed in an accident on the third day of filming the NBC-TV miniseries &quot;World War III&quot; (1982), after he walked into the tail rotor blades of a helicopter in Timberline Lodge&#x27;s parking lot.

==Events==
In 2017, the inaugural Overlook Film Festival was held at Timberline Lodge. The following year, the festival moved to New Orleans, Louisiana.

On April 18, 2024 a fire broke out at the lodge requiring multiple fire agencies to respond.

<doc id="182093" wikidata="Q369911" url="?curid=182093" title="Athlone">
<text>Athlone (; ) is a town on the border of County Roscommon and County Westmeath, Ireland. It is located on the River Shannon near the southern shore of Lough Ree. It is the second most populous town in the Midlands Region with a population of 22,869 in the 2022 census.

Most of the town lies on the east bank of the river, within the townland of the same name; however, by the terms of the Local Government Act of 1898, six townlands on the west bank of the Shannon, formerly in County Roscommon, were incorporated into the town, and consequently, into the county of Westmeath.

Around 100 km west of Dublin, Athlone is near the geographical centre of Ireland.

==History==

Athlone Castle, situated on the western bank of the River Shannon, is the geographical and historical centre of Athlone. Throughout its early history, the ford of Athlone was strategically important, as south of Athlone the Shannon is impassable until Clonmacnoise, where the Esker Riada meets the Shannon, while to the north the Shannon flows into Lough Ree. In 1001 Brian Bóru sailed his army up river from Kincora and through Lough Derg to attend a gathering in Athlone. The following year, Brian met the High King of Ireland Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill at Athlone, intending to engage him in a battle for the High Kingship – only to have Máel Sechnaill, abandoned by his kinsmen of the Northern Uí Néill, submit to Brian without a fight.

A bridge was built across the river in the 12th century, approximately south of the current structure. In 1129, to protect the bridge, the High King Turloch Mór Ó Conor constructed a fort on the river&#x27;s west bank, within Athlone. On a number of occasions both the fort and bridge were subject to attacks, and towards the end of the 12th century the Anglo-Normans constructed a motte-and-bailey fortification there. This earthen fort was followed by a stone structure built in 1210 by Justiciar John de Gray. The 12-sided donjon, or tower, dates from this time; however, the rest of the original castle was largely destroyed during the 1691 Siege of Athlone and subsequently rebuilt and enlarged.

In 1607, Athlone was granted a municipal charter by James I. This entitled it to send two MPs to the Irish House of Commons.

Throughout the wars that wracked Ireland in the 17th century, Athlone contained the vital, main bridge over the River Shannon into Connacht. During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–53), the town was held by Irish Confederate troops until it was taken in late 1650 by Charles Coote, who attacked the town from the west, having crossed into Connacht at Sligo.

Forty years later, during the pan-European War of the Grand Alliance (1688–97), the town was again of key strategic importance. In the Irish phase of the conflict (the Williamite War in Ireland of 1688–1691), Athlone was one of the Jacobite strongholds that defended the river-crossings into the Jacobite-held Province of Connacht following the Battle of the Boyne on 1 July 1690. That same year, Colonel Richard Grace&#x27;s Jacobite forces in Athlone repelled an attack by 10,000 men led by Commander Douglas. In the following year&#x27;s campaign, the Siege of Athlone saw a further assault by a larger allied force, during which the invading troops of King William and Queen Mary eventually overran the entire city. The defenders were forced to flee further west, toward the River Suck, at such speed that eyewitness accounts record that they &quot;flung their cannons into the morass&quot; as they fled. The most recently discovered account of the Siege of Athlone, written after the attack, on 5 July 1691, was found in 2004 in an archive in the Netherlands. The account was penned by the victorious commanding officer from the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, general lieutenant Godard van Reede, in letters written to his family in mainland Europe. In the account, the commanding allied officer reported that half of Athlone&#x27;s defenders retreated westward, towards the rest of their army, leaving almost 2,000 dead within the city walls and more than 100 taken prisoner, including dozens of officers.

Following the Acts of Union 1800, Athlone continued as a constituency, sending one MP to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1885.

In the 1970s the Republican Éire Nua programme proposed making Athlone the capital of a federal United Ireland.
==Location and access==

With the two counties divided by the river, the part of the town that lies east of the Shannon is in the province of Leinster, the county of Westmeath, the barony of Brawny, and the civil parish of St Mary&#x27;s. Unusually, the barony is coterminous with a single civil parish. In terms of ecclesiastical boundaries, the eastern part of the town is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise and the parish of St Mary&#x27;s. There are several other churches in the town including a Church of Ireland (St. Mary&#x27;s, Anglican), the Church of Saints Peter and Paul, a Franciscan friary and a chapel of the Society of Saint Pius X.
However, seven townlands, or sections of the town, lie west of the Shannon: Athlone and Big Meadow, Bellaugh, Bogganfin, Canal and Banks, Doovoge, part of Monksland, and Ranelagh. Although surrounded by County Roscommon in the province of Connacht, they are designated as part of County Westmeath to preserve the integrity of the town. These townlands lie in St Peter&#x27;s civil parish in the barony of Athlone South. In terms of ecclesiastical boundaries, the townlands west of the Shannon are part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Elphin and the parish of Saints Peter and Paul.

===River===

Athlone is a common stop for pleasure craft along the River Shannon. Lough Ree, the largest lake on the Shannon, is a short distance upstream from Athlone, and many boat companies are based out of the town. For craft to pass through Athlone, it is necessary to use a lock in the river, which is beside the weir and downstream of the current road bridge. The lock, weir, and bridge were all constructed by the Shannon navigation commissioners in the 1840s. Before then, boats used a canal, about a mile and a half long, to the west of the river. The canal was built by Thomas Omer for the Commissioners of Inland Navigation. Work started in 1757 and involved the work of over 300 men. Omer built a single lock, 120&#x27; X 19&#x27; with a rise of 4.5&#x27;, but there was also a guard lock, further upstream, with a single set of gates to protect the canal against floods. There were also two lay-bys, or harbours, one above the lock and another at the upstream end. The old canal is no longer navigable.

===Rail===
Athlone railway station opened on 3 October 1859, with Irish Rail services travelling eastwards to Portarlington, Kildare and Dublin Heuston and westwards to the Westport/Ballina lines as well as to Athenry, Oranmore and Galway.

Connections from Athlone via a train transfer at Athenry railway station extend to Ennis and Limerick, while a transfer at Portarlington connects Limerick Junction and Limerick. There are trains from Portarlington to Mallow, and from Mallow to Cork, Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee. Travel between Athlone and Killdare enables connections to Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford.

===Bus===
For many years state-owned bus operator Bus Éireann provided hourly services to Dublin and Galway from its bus station in Athlone located beside the railway station, but in July 2021 these routes, 20 and X20 Expressway, were cancelled indefinitely. The company cited &quot;continuing losses [..] resulting from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&quot; as the reason. Bus Éireann services between Dublin and Belfast, Cork and Limerick were also cut following a &quot;viability review&quot; of 18 routes in September 2020. It was noted that from July 2021 onwards, bus journeys between Athlone and Galway, Ballinasloe, Moate, Dublin city or Dublin airport would be operated by private companies only, with passengers being dropped off or picked up at the Arcadia Retail Park and Athlone Institute of Technology rather than the bus station. Such private bus companies that stop in Athlone include Citylink and a new Aircoach bus route (Galway-Athlone-Dublin) which was established soon after Bus Éireann&#x27;s decision, to cope with the demand.

There are also services to Limerick, Dundalk, Waterford, Cavan, Belfast, Longford and Roscommon. The town is also home to a number of privately operated services, including the Flagline bus company, which operates local bus routes as well as service to Tullamore.

Transport for Ireland (TFI), the national public transport brand managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA), operates a local Athlone bus service in and around the town. The local services are as follows: Route A1: Bus Station, Willow Park (Norwood Court) via Golden Island Shopping Centre, Dublin Road and Athlone Institute of Technology; and Route A2: Monksland (River Village); Garrycastle (Moydrum Road) via Galway Road, St. Peter&#x27;s Avenue, Saint Anne&#x27;s Terrace, the Batteries, Connaught Street, Northgate Street, Bus Station, Golden Island Shopping Centre, Dublin Road and Athlone Institute of Technology. The Athlone Town service became Ireland&#x27;s first fully electric bus service in January 2023.

===Road===
The town is located alongside the N6 dual carriageway, which is effectively a section of the M6 motorway connecting Galway to Dublin. The N6 passes along the northern side of the town, crossing the River Shannon into County Roscommon. A number of national secondary roads connect Athlone with other towns and regions, namely the N55 to Ballymahon and Cavan, the N61 to Roscommon and the N62 to Birr, Roscrea, and Southern Ireland.

==Administration==
Athlone was granted a municipal charter by James I in 1607. This created a parliamentary borough with a right to elect two MPs to the Irish House of Commons until 1801. After the Acts of Union 1800, it was represented in the United Kingdom House of Commons by one MP. A commissioners&#x27; report dated 1833 stated: &quot;To the prosperity of Athlone the corporation have at no time contributed, nor is it likely that, as at present constituted, they ever will. The strongest feeling of hostility exists between the inhabitants and its members.&quot; The municipal corporation was abolished under the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. It was disfranchised by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

Athlone was later granted town commissioners under the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854. Following the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, Athlone was designated as an urban sanitary district. Under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, the town became an urban district and the board of commissioners was upgraded to an urban district council. The portion of the urban sanitary district which had been in County Roscommon was transferred to County Westmeath. In 2002, the urban district council became a town council. In 2003, the area of jurisdiction of the town was enlarged. In 2014, in common with all town councils in Ireland, it was abolished. The urban district council was based at the old civic offices, which had been crudely extended over time and were demolished to make way for the new Athlone Civic Centre, which was completed in 2004.

In County Roscommon, Athlone is a six-seat local electoral area (LEA) to Roscommon County Council which forms its own municipal district. In County Westmeath, Athlone is a five-seat LEA to Westmeath County Council which is part of the municipal district of Athlone—Moate.

==Culture==

Theatres in Athlone include the Dean Crowe Theatre &amp; Arts Centre and the Little Theatre.

A cultural and history festival focused on the town&#x27;s connection to the Shannon, the Athlone River Festival, was held in 2019 and again in early August 2024. The festival is also planned for the August Bank Holiday weekend in 2025.

The Athlone Literary Festival is an annual event which began in 1999, originally as a weekend celebration of the life and works of John Broderick, but which was later expanded to feature a variety of speakers and debaters.

The tenor John McCormack was born in Athlone and, for many years, an annual festival was held in the town to celebrate his life.

Athlone School of Music opened in 2005 and is a grant-aided project aimed at developing music education and services in the Midlands region.

Abbey Road Artists&#x27; Studios launched in 2011 in a building constructed in 1841. These artists&#x27; studios, which provide a dedicated space for local and visiting artists, consist of four individual studios as well as a multi-purpose space which is used community cultural events, exhibitions, performances and workshops. The Abbey Road artists&#x27; studios work closely with the Luan Art Gallery.

In 1954, Athlone became the first branch of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland and the town had a large part in the organisation&#x27;s creation.

==Literature==
American crime writer James M. Cain refers to Athlone in his 1937 book, &quot;Serenade&quot;, in a passage where two characters discuss tenor John McCormack:
&quot;--There&#x27;s the language he was born to. John McCormack comes from Dublin&quot;.
&quot;He does not. He comes from Athlone&quot;.
&quot;Didn&#x27;t he live in Dublin?&quot;.
&quot;No Matter. They speak a fine brogue in Athlone, almost as fine as in Belfast&quot;.
&quot;It&#x27;s a fine brogue, but it&#x27;s not brogue. It&#x27;s the English language as it was spoken before all the other countries of the world forgot how to speak it. There are two things a singer can&#x27;t buy, beg or steal, and that no teacher, coach or conductor can give him. One is his voice, the other is the language that was born in his mouth. When McCormack was singing Handel he was singing English, and he sings it as no American and no Englishman will ever sing English&quot;.

The Irish poet Aubrey Thomas de Vere wrote a poem &quot;The Ballad of Athlone&quot; which is an account of an incident in the 1691 siege.

===Public art===
Examples of public art and sculpture in Athlone include the IRA Memorial which was erected near the corner of Church Street and Custume Place in the early 1950s. It is dedicated to the Athlone Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that participated in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921) and Irish Civil War (1922–1923). The limestone statue consists of a life-sized male figure, dressed in a typical IRA uniform from the period, and was created by Dublin-based sculptor Desmond Broe.

Also on Custume Place is a sculpture, the &quot;Mask of the Shannon&quot;, which was erected in 2020 - despite some controversy about the choice of figure used to personify the River Shannon. A figurative statue, representing the &quot;contributions the Marist Brothers have made to the town of Athlone&quot;, was unveiled on St. Mary&#x27;s Square in 2012.

It was planned to comprise a total of nine exhibition halls, nine smaller independent exhibition buildings, one temporary exhibition space, several offices, administrative services, some living quarters, hotels, shops, restaurants, pubs, a school and railway station. It was never built.

==Broadcasting==
Between 1931 and 1975 the main radio transmission centre for Irish radio was located at Moydrum, Athlone (). The original call sign was 2RN, a wordplay on the song &quot;Come back to Erin&quot;. The station subsequently became known as &quot;Radio Athlone&quot; and could clearly be heard throughout Europe, and as far away as Moscow. This changed as bandwidth allocations were accorded at the Helsinki Declaration.

The station originally operated at a power of 60 kW, which during the 1950s, was increased to 100 kW. For an antenna, a T-antenna was and is still used, which spins between two 100-metre tall guyed masts with square cross-sections and which are insulated against ground. Many old radio sets in Europe had the &quot;Athlone&quot; dial position marked near the end of their tuning scales.

In the late 1970s the station reopened on a new dial position of 612 kHz for &quot;Radio 2&quot;, later known as RTÉ 2fm. Moydrum was also the location of Ireland&#x27;s short-lived Shortwave international radio service, which was closed down in 1948 due to lack of money. Today, RTÉ&#x27;s Midlands studios are located in Athlone, at St. Mary&#x27;s Square. The local radio station is Midlands 103. Many also tune into the Shannonside station.

A radio station, i102-104FM, was launched in 2008, geared to the 15–34 age group of the Midlands and Northeast.

The Athlone Community Taskforce and several members of the Roscommon community radio station, RosFM, have begun broadcasting from the Athlone area under the banner of Athlone Community Radio. Their first broadcast was on 15 March 2008 and the broadcasts were originally set to run every Saturday and Sunday for the following 15 weeks, until their temporary licence expired. They received a 10-year licence on 14 January 2011 from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and they currently broadcast on the frequency of 88.4 FM.

==Print==
Local newspapers include the &quot;Westmeath Independent&quot; located on Sean Costello Street which was established in 1846 and the &quot;Athlone Topic&quot;.

==Sport==
In addition to being home to the Athlone Regional Sports Centre, a number of sporting organisations are based in the town. These include Athlone Town Football Club, who play their home games at Athlone Town Stadium in Lissywollen, an arena with a 5,000 person capacity. Athlone Town FC won the League of Ireland Championship in 1981 and 1983, as well as the FAI Cup in 1924. The team also qualified for the 1975–76 UEFA Cup, where they played 0–0 against AC Milan.

The Athlone IT International Arena, which cost to ten million Euro to build, was opened in 2013 as Ireland&#x27;s first &quot;world-class&quot; indoor athletics arena. It has a floor space of nearly 10,000 square metres. The opening of the arena, which was opened by Taoiseach Enda Kenny, was described by Senator Eamonn Coghlan as the &quot;best news story in Irish athletics history&quot;. The stadium hosts the annual AIT Grand Prix event, broadcast by TG4 in Ireland and internationally via Vinco and Runnerspace.

Athlone hosted the European Triathlon Championships in 2010 when approximately 5,000 athletes participated in the event. Alistair Brownlee of Great Britain won the event.

<text>Long Buckby is a large village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire, England. In the 2021 census the parish of Long Buckby, which includes the hamlet of Long Buckby Wharf, was recorded as having a population of 4,511.

Long Buckby is a hill top village, located around north-east of the town of Daventry, and roughly midway between Northampton and Rugby, with each being around to the south-east and north-west respectively. The west of the parish has the A5 road, Grand Union Canal, West Coast Main Line railway and M1 motorway all passing through the Watford Gap, with Watford, Northamptonshire being the next village to the north.

Just south of the village is Long Buckby railway station on the Northampton Loop corollary of the West Coast Main Line.

== History ==
The origin of the name of the village is uncertain. &#x27;Bukki&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27; or &#x27;Bucca&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;. Alternatively, &#x27;billy-goat farm/settlement&#x27;.

Long Buckby has a history going back approximately 1,000 years to the Vikings when all of northern, central and eastern England came under the Danelaw. The village was recorded in Domesday Book as &quot;Buchebei&quot; and its prefix was first recorded in the Elizabethan era in reference to the length of the village.

Near the centre of the village are the remaining earthworks of a medieval castle, which was probably built by the lords of the manor, the de Quincy family, in the 12th century. The castle was likely an earth and timber construction, built by 1150 AD and occupied until some time after 1200 AD. The surviving earthworks, known locally as The Mounts, consist of an oval ring surrounded by a ditch.

The tower of the parish church of St Lawrence dates to the 12th century, with the rest of the building added later.

Long Buckby was once a thriving industrial village: In the 17th century a woollen industry was established and Long Buckby became a centre of weaving and woolcombing. After 1800 this went into decline and was replaced by a thriving shoemaking industry. This was enhanced by the arrival of the Grand Union Canal in the early 19th century, upon which Long Buckby had a busy wharf. The shoemaking industry went into gradual decline in the 20th century and had died out by 2000.

Since the 1960s the construction of the nearby M1 motorway has spurred expansion of the village from around 2,500 inhabitants to more 4,000 and has caused the nature of the village to change into a residential and commuter village.

Nonconformity was a strong tradition in the village, with a chapel of the United Reform Church built here in 1707. The present building was built in 1771.

The small hamlet of Long Buckby Wharf is separate from the main village but within the parish. It is located alongside the Grand Union Canal and was once a thriving community with its own post office, church and village hall.

The village offers a wide range of amenities and services, including a doctor&#x27;s surgery, two dentists, four churches, two schools, a public library, a veterinary surgery, a boarding cattery, a post office, a community centre, Long Buckby Mill Park Nature Reserve and Cotton End Park. There are three pubs in the village (The Pigeon, Old King&#x27;s Head &amp; a micro-pub Badger&#x27;s Arms). A fourth pub, The Admiral Rodney, is closed and now a hair salon and rented flats. Local shops include two grocery stores, a butcher’s, several hairdressers, a card and gift shop, a chemist and a wide range of restaurants and take-aways.

The English comedian Stanley Unwin moved to Long Buckby in 1940 when he got a job with the BBC at the nearby Borough Hill transmitting station. He lived there until his death in 2002.

Long Buckby railway station was opened in 1881 on the Northampton Loop Line. Until the mid-1960s Long Buckby boasted its own goods-marshalling yard, which played a very significant role in the once thriving village economy, providing for the import of fuel and consumables for local business and residents as well as delivering the mail and packages to the village post office and newspapers to the village newsagents. Local agricultural produce and to a lesser extent livestock were exported from the facility.

Long Buckby railway station, as the nearest stop to Althorp, was the final stop on the rail journey by the then Prince of Wales, his two sons and others following the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales and as such it was seen on television across the world.

<doc id="182108" wikidata="Q2361652" url="?curid=182108" title="Braunston">
<text>Braunston is a village and civil parish in the West Northamptonshire unitary authority area of Northamptonshire, England, next to the border with Warwickshire. At the 2011 Census, the parish had a population of 1,759. Braunston is situated just off the A45 main road and lies between the towns of Daventry and Rugby. Braunston is a hilltop village, most famous for its canal junction between the Oxford Canal and the Grand Union Canal, and associated marina.

==Description==
The villages name means &#x27;Brant&#x27;s farm/settlement&#x27;.

The main village of Braunston is situated on a hill above the road and the canals, and formerly had a windmill, the building of which still stands but without any sails. The village contains several pubs (&quot;The Boathouse&quot;, &quot;The Admiral Nelson&quot;, &quot;The Plough&quot;, and &quot;The Wheatsheaf&quot;), a selection of shops - excellent butchers, hairdressers and village stores incorporating the post office, a fish and chip shop, car servicing garage and a primary school. The Braunston Manor Hotel has now closed with the main house reverting to residential use and the outhouse buildings redeveloped for a housing development. In 1374, the manor itself was the subject of one of a number of property disputes involving the landowning Corbet family.

Braunston&#x27;s main claims to fame are its canal and church.

==Church==
All Saints&#x27; Church Braunston has overlooked the village and the villagers for over 10 centuries and the canals and the boat people for over 300 years.

Otherwise known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Canals&quot;, it has existed since the early 13th century. However, the land on which is stands has been sacred for longer still, as it was used as an ancient tumulus for the local farmsteads as early as the 10th century, although little evidence to this time is available.
Although the original Norman structure was nearly demolished when the site was polluted by several murders in 1290, the church was later rebuilt in the 14th century. The second incarnation of the church served the area for over 400 years, until the site was demolished, with authority from Rev. Alfred Butler Clough in 1848, due to dilapidation of the structure.

The third incarnation of the church cost £6,800, money raised primarily through donations and aided by grants from the Church Building Society and the Peterborough Diocesan Society. Notable contributors to the funds also include Her Majesty the Queen Dowager and the Oxford Canal Company.

In outline the new church was similar to its mediaeval predecessor in having no north chancel. The body of the church was made wider to provide accommodation for the enlarged population which had followed the coming of the canals. The new church had the number of seats increased from 363 to 732. Despite the overwhelming impression of space and light the interior design of the church was rather austere.
The biggest change made was in the appearance of the chancel itself which was transformed by redecoration. This was the work of the leading High Church designer, William Butterfield, architect of Rugby School.

Today the church still provides regular services to the area, and often allows visitors to tour the ancient grounds, on non-service days.
Several relics have been kept by the church since its original incarnation, such as:

*A sculpture, almost certainly in memory of William, Fourth Baron Ros, who died on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1352. The De Ros family held the Braunston Manor from 1200 to 1508.
*The Church Chest, which once housed the Parish Records dating from 1538 and now deposited in the County Records Office in Northampton.
*The Norman Font, the only remaining part of the first church on the site.
*The Piscina, a stone basin used for draining water used in the Mass pre-Reformation.
*The Head of the Churchyard Cross, possibly fourteenth century which has on the four sides the remains of carvings of the Crucifixion, the Madonna and Child, a robed ecclesiastic and a warrior.

==Canals==

The canal alongside Braunston is a junction between the Oxford Canal and the Grand Union Canal, which was once an important part of the national transport system. Many former boating families have links to Braunston, the churchyard in the village having many graves of boatmen and women.

The village thrived for over 150 years on the canal trade - carrying goods from the Midlands to London. Now it is a centre for leisure activities and boasts by far and away the busiest stretch of canal anywhere in the country.

The unique triangular junction between the two canals has two bridges made at Horseley Ironworks carrying the towpath over the canal. This was not the original meeting point of the Grand Junction and Oxford Canals: the junction was moved in the course of improvements to the Oxford Canal in the 1830s, prior to which the junction was near where the marina is today, and where a third Horseley Ironworks bridge can be seen.

The canals are no longer used for carrying freight, but are now used mostly by pleasure boats. Braunston has a marina filled with these pleasure boats and is usually quite busy.

From the marina, six locks carry the Grand Union Canal up to Braunston Tunnel, some long.

==Railways==
Despite its small size, Braunston was once served by two railway stations, both now closed. The first, Braunston London Road was on the former LNWR Weedon to Leamington Spa branch line, via Daventry, was located near the marina and closed in September 1958. A couple of miles north-west of Braunston was Braunston and Willoughby station on the former Great Central Main Line, which served Braunston and the village of Willoughby, which it was closer to. This was the last main line to be constructed from the north of England to London and opened in March 1899. Braunston and Willoughby station closed in April 1957 and the line itself in September 1966. To the south of the station was the 13-arch Willoughby viaduct crossing the River Leam: the viaduct was demolished about 1980.

==Braunston Primary School==
Braunston C.E. Primary School is located in the middle of the village.
It is a one form entry school. It has one class for each age group from Reception to Year 6, with the capacity for 30 children in each class. The curriculum is divided up into stages according to age: Foundation Stage – The Reception Class, Key Stage 1 - Years 1 and 2, Key Stage 2 - Years 3, 4, 5 and 6.

==Nearby settlements==
Nearby is the small hamlet of Little Braunston. Also close to the village are the three lost settlements of Braunston Cleves or Fawcliff, Braunstonbury and Wolfhampcote.

==Twin village==
The village is twinned with Quincy-Voisins in France.

<text>A parliamentary system, or parliamentary democracy, is a form of government where the head of government (chief executive) derives their democratic legitimacy from their ability to command the support (&quot;confidence&quot;) of a majority of the legislature, to which they are held accountable. This head of government is usually, but not always, distinct from a ceremonial head of state. This is in contrast to a presidential system, which features a president who is not fully accountable to the legislature, and cannot be replaced by a simple majority vote.

Countries with parliamentary systems may be constitutional monarchies, where a monarch is the head of state while the head of government is almost always a member of parliament, or parliamentary republics, where a mostly ceremonial president is the head of state while the head of government is from the legislature. In a few countries, the head of government is also head of state but is elected by the legislature. In bicameral parliaments, the head of government is generally, though not always, a member of the lower house.

Parliamentary democracy is the dominant form of government in the European Union, Oceania, and throughout the former British Empire, with other users scattered throughout Africa and Asia. A similar system, called a council–manager government, is used by many local governments in the United States.

==History==
The first parliaments date back to Europe in the Middle Ages. The earliest example of a parliament is disputed, especially depending how the term is defined. 

For example, the Icelandic Althing consisting of prominent individuals among the free landowners of the various districts of the Icelandic Commonwealth first gathered around the year 930 (it conducted its business orally, with no written record allowing an exact date).

The first written record of a parliament, in particular in the sense of an assembly separate from the population called in presence of a king was 1188 Alfonso IX, King of Leon (Spain) convened the three states in the Cortes of León. The Corts of Catalonia were the first parliament of Europe that officially obtained the power to pass legislation, apart from the custom. An early example of parliamentary government developed in today&#x27;s Netherlands and Belgium during the Dutch revolt (1581), when the sovereign, legislative and executive powers were taken over by the States General of the Netherlands from the monarch, King Philip II of Spain. Significant developments Kingdom of Great Britain, in particular in the period 1707 to 1800 and its contemporary, the Parliamentary System in Sweden between 1721 and 1772, and later in Europe and elsewhere in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the expansion of like institutions, and beyond

In England, Simon de Montfort is remembered as one of the figures relevant later for convening two famous parliaments. The first, in 1258, stripped the king of unlimited authority and the second, in 1265, included ordinary citizens from the towns. Later, in the 17th century, the Parliament of England pioneered some of the ideas and systems of liberal democracy culminating in the Glorious Revolution and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689.

In the Kingdom of Great Britain, the monarch, in theory, chaired the cabinet and chose ministers. In practice, King George I&#x27;s inability to speak English led to the responsibility for chairing cabinet to go to the leading minister, literally the &quot;prime&quot; or first minister, Robert Walpole. The gradual democratisation of Parliament with the broadening of the voting franchise increased Parliament&#x27;s role in controlling government, and in deciding whom the king could ask to form a government. By the 19th century, the Great Reform Act 1832 led to parliamentary dominance, with its choice &quot;invariably&quot; deciding who was prime minister and the complexion of the government.

Other countries gradually adopted what came to be called the Westminster system of government, with an executive answerable to the lower house of a bicameral parliament, and exercising, in the name of the head of state, powers nominally vested in the head of state – hence the use of phrases such as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s government&quot; (in constitutional monarchies) or &quot;His Excellency&#x27;s government&quot; (in parliamentary republics). Such a system became particularly prevalent in older British dominions, many of which had their constitutions enacted by the British parliament; such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Irish Free State and the Union of South Africa. Some of these parliaments were reformed from, or were initially developed as distinct from their original British model: the Australian Senate, for instance, has since its inception more closely reflected the US Senate than the British House of Lords; whereas since 1950 there is no upper house in New Zealand. Many of these countries such as Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados have severed institutional ties to Great Britain by becoming republics with their own ceremonial presidents, but retain the Westminster system of government. The idea of parliamentary accountability and responsible government spread with these systems.

Democracy and parliamentarianism became increasingly prevalent in Europe in the years after World War I, partially imposed by the democratic victors, the United States, Great Britain and France, on the defeated countries and their successors, notably Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic and the First Austrian Republic. Nineteenth-century urbanisation, the Industrial Revolution and modernism had already made the parliamentarist demands of the Radicals and the emerging movement of social democrats increasingly impossible to ignore; these forces came to dominate many states that transitioned to parliamentarism, particularly in the French Third Republic where the Radical Party and its centre-left allies dominated the government for several decades. However, the rise of Fascism in the 1930s put an end to parliamentary democracy in Italy and Germany, among others.

After the Second World War, the defeated fascist Axis powers were occupied by the victorious Allies. In those countries occupied by the Allied democracies (the United States, United Kingdom, and France) parliamentary constitutions were implemented, resulting in the parliamentary constitutions of Italy and West Germany (now all of Germany) and the 1947 Constitution of Japan. The experiences of the war in the occupied nations where the legitimate democratic governments were allowed to return strengthened the public commitment to parliamentary principles; in Denmark, a new constitution was written in 1953, while a long and acrimonious debate in Norway resulted in no changes being made to that country&#x27;s strongly entrenched democratic constitution.

==Characteristics==
A parliamentary system may be either bicameral, with two chambers of parliament (or houses) or unicameral, with just one parliamentary chamber. A bicameral parliament usually consists of a directly elected lower house with the power to determine the executive government, and an upper house which may be appointed or elected through a different mechanism from the lower house.

===Types===
Scholars of democracy such as Arend Lijphart distinguish two types of parliamentary democracies: the Westminster and Consensus systems.

====Westminster system====
* The Westminster system is usually found in the Commonwealth of Nations and countries which were influenced by the British political tradition. These parliaments tend to have a more adversarial style of debate and the plenary session of parliament is more important than committees. Some parliaments in this model are elected using a plurality voting system (first past the post), such as the United Kingdom, Canada, India and Malaysia, while others use some form of proportional representation, such as Ireland and New Zealand. The Australian House of Representatives is elected using instant-runoff voting, while the Senate is elected using proportional representation through single transferable vote. Regardless of which system is used, the voting systems tend to allow the voter to vote for a named candidate rather than a closed list. Most Westminster systems employ strict monism, where ministers must be members of parliament simultaneously; while some Westminster systems, such as Bangladesh, permit the appointment of extra-parliamentary ministers, and others (such as Jamaica) allow outsiders to be appointed to the ministry through an appointed upper house, although a majority of ministers (which, by necessity, includes the prime minister) must come from within (the lower house of) the parliament.

====Consensus system====
* The Western European parliamentary model (e.g., Spain, Germany) tends to have a more consensual debating system and usually has semi-circular debating chambers. Consensus systems have more of a tendency to use proportional representation with open party lists than the Westminster Model legislatures. The committees of these parliaments tend to be more important than the plenary chamber. Most Western European countries do not employ strict monism, and allow extra-parliamentary ministers as a matter of course. The Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden outright implement the principle of dualism as a form of separation of powers, where Members of Parliament have to resign their place in Parliament upon being appointed (or elected) minister.

===Appointment of the head of government===

Implementations of the parliamentary system can also differ as to how the prime minister and government are appointed and whether the government needs the explicit approval of the parliament, rather than just the absence of its disapproval. While most parliamentary systems such as India require the prime minister and other ministers to be a member of the legislature, in other countries like Canada and the United Kingdom this only exists as a convention, some other countries including Norway, Sweden and the Benelux countries require a sitting member of the legislature to resign such positions upon being appointed to the executive.

* The head of state appoints a prime minister who will likely have majority support in parliament. While in the majority of cases prime ministers in the Westminster system are the leaders of the largest party in parliament, technically the appointment of the prime minister is a prerogative exercised by the head of state (be it the monarch, the governor-general, or the president). This system is used in:
** 
** 
** 
** 
* The head of state appoints a prime minister who must gain a vote of confidence within a set time. This system is used in:

* The head of state appoints the leader of the political party holding a plurality of seats in parliament as prime minister. For example, in Greece, if no party has a majority, the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an &quot;exploratory mandate&quot; to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If said leader fails to obtain the confidence of parliament, then the leader of the &quot;second&quot;-largest party is given the &quot;exploratory mandate&quot;. If that fails, then the leader of the &quot;third&quot;-largest political party is given the &quot;exploratory mandate&quot;, and so on. This system is used in:

* The head of state &quot;nominates&quot; a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment. Example: Spain, where the King sends a proposal to the Congress of Deputies for approval. Also, Germany where under the German Basic Law (constitution) the Bundestag votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In these cases, parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state. This system is used in:
** 

* Parliament &quot;nominates&quot; a candidate whom the head of state is constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister. Example: Japan, where the Emperor appoints the Prime Minister on the nomination of the National Diet. Also Ireland, where the President of Ireland appoints the Taoiseach on the nomination of Dáil Éireann. This system is used in:
** 

* A public officeholder (other than the head of state or their representative) &quot;nominates&quot; a candidate, who, if approved by parliament, is appointed as prime minister. Example: Under the Swedish Instrument of Government (1974), the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the Speaker of Parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (&quot;statsminister&quot;) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote against the candidate (i.e. they can be elected even if more members of parliament vote &quot;No&quot; than &quot;Yes).&quot; This system is used in:

* Direct election by popular vote. Example: Israel, 1996–2001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation, and whose procedure can also be described as of a semi-parliamentary system. This system was used in:

** (1996–2001)

===Power of dissolution and call for election===
Furthermore, there are variations as to what conditions exist (if any) for the government to have the right to dissolve the parliament:
* In some countries, especially those operating under a Westminster system, such as the United Kingdom, Denmark, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, the prime minister has the &quot;de facto&quot; power to call an election, at will. In Spain, the prime minister is the only person with the &quot;de jure&quot; power to call an election, granted by Article 115 of the Constitution.
* In Israel, parliament may vote to dissolve itself in order to call an election, or the prime minister may call a snap election with presidential consent if his government is deadlocked. A non-passage of the budget automatically calls a snap election.
* Other countries only permit an election to be called in the event of a vote of no confidence against the government, a supermajority vote in favour of an early election or a prolonged deadlock in parliament. These requirements can still be circumvented. For example, in Germany in 2005, Gerhard Schröder deliberately allowed his government to lose a confidence motion, in order to call an early election.
* In Sweden, the government may call a snap election at will, but the newly elected Riksdag is only elected to fill out the previous Riksdag&#x27;s term. The last time this option was used was in 1958.
* In Greece, a general election is called if the Parliament fails to elect a new head of state when his or her term ends. In January 2015, this constitutional provision was exploited by Syriza to trigger a snap election, win it and oust rivals New Democracy from power.
* In Italy the government has no power to call a snap election. A snap election can only be called by the head of state, following a consultation with the presidents of both houses of parliament.
* Norway is unique among parliamentary systems in that the Storting always serves the whole of its four-year term.
* In Australia, under certain, unique conditions, the prime minister can request the Governor General to call for a double dissolution, whereby all rather than only half of the Senate, is dissolved – in effect electing all of the Parliament simultaneously.

The parliamentary system can be contrasted with a presidential system which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of—nor is appointed by—the parliamentary or legislative body. In such a system, parliaments or congresses do not select or dismiss heads of government, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments (although the parliament may still be able to dissolve itself, as in the case of Cyprus). There also exists the semi-presidential system that draws on both presidential systems and parliamentary systems by combining a powerful president with an executive responsible to parliament: for example, the French Fifth Republic.

Parliamentarianism may also apply to regional and local governments. An example is Oslo which has an executive council (Byråd) as a part of the parliamentary system. The devolved nations of the United Kingdom are also parliamentary and which, as with the UK Parliament, may hold early elections – this has only occurred with regards to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2017 and 2022.

===Anti-defection law===
A few parliamentary democratic nations such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have enacted laws that prohibit floor crossing or switching parties after the election. Under these laws, elected representatives will lose their seat in the parliament if they go against their party in votes.

In the UK parliament, a member is free to cross over to a different party. In Canada and Australia, there are no restraints on legislators switching sides. In New Zealand, waka-jumping legislation provides that MPs who switch parties or are expelled from their party may be expelled from Parliament at the request of their former party&#x27;s leader.

=== Parliamentary sovereignty ===

A few parliamentary democracies such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand have weak or non-existent checks on the legislative power of their Parliaments, where any newly approved Act shall take precedence over all prior Acts. All laws are equally unentrenched, wherein judicial review may not outright annul nor amend them, as frequently occurs in other parliamentary systems like Germany. Whilst the head of state for both nations (Monarch, and or Governor General) has the de jure power to withhold assent to any bill passed by their Parliament, this check has not been exercised in Britain since the 1708 Scottish Militia Bill.

Whilst both the UK and New Zealand have some Acts or parliamentary rules establishing supermajorities or additional legislative procedures for certain legislation, such as previously with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA), these can be bypassed through the enactment of another that amends or ignores these supermajorities away, such as with the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 – bypassing the 2/3rd supermajority required for an early dissolution under the FTPA -, which enabled the early dissolution for the 2019 general election.

=== Metrics ===
Parliamentarism metrics allow a quantitative comparison of the strength of parliamentary systems for individual countries. One parliamentarism metric is the Parliamentary Powers Index.

==Advantages==
=== Adaptability ===
Parliamentary systems like that found in the United Kingdom are widely considered to be more flexible, allowing a rapid change in legislation and policy as long as there is a stable majority or coalition in parliament, allowing the government to have &#x27;few legal limits on what it can do&#x27; When combined with first-past-the-post voting, this system produces the classic &quot;Westminster model&quot; with the twin virtues of strong but responsive party government. This electoral system providing a strong majority in the House of Commons, paired with the fused power system results in a particularly powerful government able to provide change and &#x27;innovate&#x27;.

=== Scrutiny and accountability ===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s fused power system is often noted to be advantageous with regard to accountability. The centralised government allows for more transparency as to where decisions originate from, this contrasts with the American system with Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon saying &quot;the president blames Congress, the Congress blames the president, and the public remains confused and disgusted with government in Washington&quot;. Furthermore, ministers of the U.K. cabinet are subject to weekly Question Periods in which their actions/policies are scrutinised; no such regular check on the government exists in the U.S. system.

=== Distribution of power ===
A 2001 World Bank study found that parliamentary systems are associated with less corruption.

=== Calling of elections ===

In his 1867 book &quot;The English Constitution&quot;, Walter Bagehot praised parliamentary governments for producing serious debates, for allowing for a change in power without an election, and for allowing elections at any time. Bagehot considered fixed-term elections such as the four-year election rule for presidents of the United States to be unnatural, as it can potentially allow a president who has disappointed the public with a dismal performance in the second year of his term to continue on until the end of his four-year term. Under a parliamentary system, a prime minister that has lost support in the middle of his term can be easily replaced by his own peers with a more popular alternative, as the Conservative Party in the UK did with successive prime ministers David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak.

Although Bagehot praised parliamentary governments for allowing an election to take place at any time, the lack of a definite election calendar can be abused. Under some systems, such as the British, a ruling party can schedule elections when it believes that it is likely to retain power, and so avoid elections at times of unpopularity. (From 2011, election timing in the UK was partially fixed under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which was repealed by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022.) Thus, by a shrewd timing of elections, in a parliamentary system, a party can extend its rule for longer than is feasible in a presidential system. This problem can be alleviated somewhat by setting fixed dates for parliamentary elections, as is the case in several of Australia&#x27;s state parliaments. In other systems, such as the Dutch and the Belgian, the ruling party or coalition has some flexibility in determining the election date. Conversely, flexibility in the timing of parliamentary elections can avoid periods of legislative gridlock that can occur in a fixed period presidential system. In any case, voters ultimately have the power to choose whether to vote for the ruling party or someone else.

== Disadvantages ==
===Incomplete separation of power===
According to Arturo Fontaine, parliamentary systems in Europe have yielded very powerful heads of government which is rather what is often criticized about presidential systems. Fontaine compares United Kingdom&#x27;s Margaret Thatcher to the United States&#x27; Ronald Reagan noting the former head of government was much more powerful despite governing under a parliamentary system. The rise to power of Viktor Orbán in Hungary has been claimed to show how parliamentary systems can be subverted. The situation in Hungary was according to Fontaine allowed by the deficient separation of powers that characterises parliamentary and semi-presidential systems. Once Orbán&#x27;s party got two-thirds of the seats in Parliament in a single election, a supermajority large enough to amend the Hungarian constitution, there was no institution that was able to balance the concentration of power. In a presidential system it would require at least two separate elections to create the same effect; the presidential election, and the legislative election, and that the president&#x27;s party has the legislative supermajority required for constitutional amendments. Safeguards against this situation implementable in both systems include the establishment of an upper house or a requirement for external ratification of constitutional amendments such as a referendum. Fontaine also notes as a warning example of the flaws of parliamentary systems that if the United States had a parliamentary system, Donald Trump, as head of government, could have dissolved the United States Congress.

=== Legislative flip-flopping ===
The ability for strong parliamentary governments to push legislation through with the ease of fused power systems such as in the United Kingdom, whilst positive in allowing rapid adaptation when necessary e.g. the nationalisation of services during the world wars, in the opinion of some commentators does have its drawbacks. For instance, the flip-flopping of legislation back and forth as the majority in parliament changed between the Conservatives and Labour over the period 1940–1980, contesting over the nationalisation and privatisation of the British Steel Industry resulted in major instability for the British steel sector.

=== Political fragmentation ===
In R. Kent Weaver&#x27;s book &quot;Are Parliamentary Systems Better?&quot;, he writes that an advantage of presidential systems is their ability to allow and accommodate more diverse viewpoints. He states that because &quot;legislators are not compelled to vote against their constituents on matters of local concern, parties can serve as organizational and roll-call cuing vehicles without forcing out dissidents.&quot;

=== Democratic unaccountability ===

All current parliamentary democracies see the indirect election or appointment of their head of government. As a result, the electorate has limited power to remove or install the person or party wielding the most power. Although strategic voting may enable the party of the prime minister to be removed or empowered, this can be at the expense of voters first preferences in the many parliamentary systems utilising first past the post, or having no effect in dislodging those parties who consistently form part of a coalition government, as with the current Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and his party the VVD&#x27;s 4 terms in office, despite their peak support reaching only 26.6% in 2012.

<text>Napton on the Hill is a village and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon District of Warwickshire, England. 
The population of the civil parish taken at the 2021 census was 1,416.

==Manor==
The toponym Napton is derived from the Old English &quot;cnæpp&quot; meaning &#x27;hilltop&#x27; and &quot;tūn&quot; meaning &#x27;settlement&#x27; in the Old English language. In 1086 the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded the village as &quot;Neptone&quot;. The hill on which the village is built is just over above sea level, commanding the remainder of the parish which for the most part is at a height of about . The &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records that in 1086 Robert de Beaumont, Count of Meulan held the principal manor of Napton. In 1107 Henry I made de Beaumont Earl of Leicester and de Beaumont&#x27;s manor at Napton became part of the honour of Leicester Castle. When Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester died in 1204 leaving no male heir his estates were divided between his two sisters. 

Napton was included in the half that passed to his younger sister Margaret, and thereby to her husband Saer de Quincy who in 1207 was made Earl of Winchester. Napton was still part of the honour of Winchester Castle in 1271 but Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester had died in 1265 with no male heir, leaving his estates to his three daughters. In 1285 the husbands of two of these, Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan and William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby, jointly claimed view of frankpledge over Napton. There are further references to Napton&#x27;s feudal overlordship in the 14th century and in 1413.

==Parish church==
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Lawrence include the chancel, which was built in the 12th century and still has three Norman windows in its north wall. The south doorway of the nave is also from the end of the 12th century. Prof. Louis Salzman considered that the north and south transepts were also 12th century but Prof. Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandra Wedgwood proposed a later date of about 1275, noting their triplets of Early English Gothic lancet windows. The north and south aisles were added in the 13th century after the transepts. The lower stages of the bell tower date from about 1300. The east window of the south transept is a later Perpendicular Gothic addition. 

The south porch reuses a mixture of Early English and Perpendicular masonry and has puzzled historians. Louis Francis Salzman thought it could have been built either at the end of the 16th century or in the 17th century but Nikolaus Pevsner and Alexandra Wedgwood suspected the involvement of J. Croft, the architect who restored the church in 1861. The vestry may also have been added in the 17th century and the upper stage of the tower was rebuilt early in the 18th century. After this rebuilding a ring of five bells was cast in 1731 and hung in the tower. 

The tenor was recast in 1874 and John Taylor &amp; Co rehung all the bells in 1958. The ring was increased to six bells by the addition of the treble cast by Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1963. St. Lawrence&#x27;s is at the top of the hill, making it a local landmark and giving it commanding views over the surrounding countryside, especially from the top of the tower. St. Lawrence&#x27;s parish is now part of a single Church of England benefice with the parishes of Lower Shuckburgh and Stockton, part of the Bridges Group of parishes. Actor Ed Bishop is buried in the churchyard.

==Economic and social history==

In the 14th century Napton was granted a market charter by King Edward II and throughout the Middle Ages it was one of the largest settlements in Warwickshire. However the market died out, and the population of the village today of around 1,000, is roughly the same as it was in the year 1400. Napton had a windmill by 1543. The present stone-built tower mill is a later structure, dating from the 18th or early 19th century that was derelict in 1966 but has since been restored. It is a Grade II listed building.

Napton had separate schools for girls and boys until 1948 when they were merged to form the current St. Lawrence Church of England Primary School, which moved to its current premises in 1997.

==Canals==
The first section of the Oxford Canal from Hawkesbury Junction was completed in 1771 and it reached Napton in 1774. This made Napton the head of navigation for coal supplies to be forwarded by road to Banbury, Bicester, Woodstock and Oxford until 1777, when the canal reached Fenny Compton which then took over as the trans-shipment point. The Oxford Canal&#x27;s chief engineer, Samuel Simcock, designed the canal to be a contour canal as much as possible, so he routed it around three sides of Napton Hill to minimise the number of locks needed. Even so, to climb from Napton Wharf to the summit pound at Marston Doles required eight locks around the hill (nos. 8–15) and another at Marston Doles (no. 16), that between them raise boats by a total of .

The long summit pound between Marston Doles and Claydon suffered from a shortage of water so Parliament passed an Act in 1786 authorising the company to use any water supply within of the canal. Just over south of Napton it sank a well that fed the summit pound &quot;via&quot; a feeder arm westwards to the canal between locks 11 and 12 and then a channel beside the canal from there to just above Marston Doles lock. An engine house with a steam engine and pump were built at the well-head () and the well seems to have begun operation in 1793. The boiler needed replacement as early as 1794 and an accident with the engine killed a workman in 1796.

In 1800 the Warwick and Napton Canal (W&amp;N) was completed, joining the Oxford Canal at Napton Junction. To reach the same level as the Oxford Canal the W&amp;N ascended three locks at Calcutt just north of Napton parish. With each passage of a narrowboat through Calcutt Lock the Oxford Canal lost a certain amount of water so the W&amp;N agreed to pay the Oxford 2 shillings (2/-) (10 new pence) for each such passage. In 1805 the Grand Junction Canal was completed, joining the Oxford Canal at Braunston east of Napton and completing the direct canal route between Birmingham and London. Between 1808 and 1811 the W&amp;N built a reservoir at Ashby St Ledgers from Napton to feed both the Oxford and the W&amp;N &quot;via&quot; the Grand Junction Canal. This enabled the Oxford to cease regular pumping at Napton and stop charging the W&amp;N two shillings for each boat through Calcutt Locks.

A century later, in autumn 1911, the canals again suffered a water shortage so the Oxford Canal brought its well at Napton back into use. The old pumping engine had long been out of action so the company hired two Oxford Steam Plough Company steam ploughing engines to work the pump. In 1974 there was another water shortage and British Waterways resorted to back-pumping water up Napton Locks. In 1928 the Grand Junction Canal took over the W&amp;N and Warwick and Birmingham Canals to form the Grand Union Canal. The Grand Union wanted to widen its route to enable it to take barges wide, so in 1931 an Act of Parliament gave the Grand Union special powers over the Oxford Canal to widen the section between Braunston and Napton Junctions. Between 1932 and 1947 it widened bridges between Braunston and Napton and increased the depth of the canal to . The canals are now primarily a leisure facility and Napton Junction has a marina that offers moorings and narrowboats for hire.

==Napton Festival==
On 16 September 2006 the first Napton Festival was held at Holt Farm on Holt Road. The headline act was the hard rock band Girlschool. The festival was repeated in the same place in 2007, with two stages and with The Sweet and the Hollies as its main acts. In 2008 the main acts were Bad Company on the main stage and Aynsley Lister in the marquee. The 2008 festival extended to the Friday night with Jilted Generation performing in the marquee. Smaller events were held in Napton village in 2009 and 2010, both headlined by Whole Lotta DC. In 2011 the festival was held in a new site on the edge of Napton village. It was a two-day event with bands including the Ripps on the Friday night and the Bluetones and the Total Stone Roses headlining the Saturday night.

==Notable people==
The BBC&#x27;s Rural Affairs Correspondent and Director of &quot;Checked Shirt TV Limited&quot;, Thomas John Gillespie &quot;Tom&quot; Heap, the son of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#x27;s John Arnfield Heap, lives in the village. The American actor Ed Bishop (1932–2005) is buried in the parish churchyard, having lived in the village for several years.

<text>A Fantasy Love Affair is the debut album by Peter Brown. The album was recorded in 1976–77 and released in 1978. It was mastered by Ted Jensen of Sterling Sound. It charted #9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B charts and #11 on the Pop chart. It was successful on the disco charts as well and spawned four singles, three of which were hits, including &quot;Do Ya Wanna Get Funky with Me&quot; and &quot;Dance with Me&quot;.
In the UK the album was titled &quot;Do You Wanna Get Funky with Me&quot; and featured a backlit silhouette of a nude woman standing in a window as its sleeve cover. Brown also photographed the album&#x27;s somewhat controversial cover and revealed, in a 1978 interview in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, that he had created the cover&#x27;s nude model out of cardboard, sheer fabric and ribbons. Until then, no one ever suspected it was not a real person. The album peaked at number 50 in Australia.

The album was later reissued on Collectables Records.

<doc id="182117" wikidata="Q4455170" url="?curid=182117" title="Social conflict theory">
<text>Social conflict theory is a Marxist-based social theory which argues that individuals and groups (social classes) within society interact on the basis of conflict rather than consensus. Through various forms of conflict, groups will tend to attain differing amounts of material and non-material resources (e.g. the wealthy vs. the poor). More powerful groups will tend to use their power in order to retain power and exploit groups with less power.

Conflict theorists view conflict as an engine of change, since conflict produces contradictions which are sometimes resolved, creating new conflicts and contradictions in an ongoing dialectic. In the classic example of historical materialism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels argued that all of human history is the result of conflict between classes, which evolved over time in accordance with changes in society&#x27;s means of meeting its material needs, i.e. changes in society&#x27;s mode of production.

==Example (sample of the following)==

Consider the relationship between the owner of a housing complex and a tenant in that same housing complex. A consensus theorist might suggest that the relationship between the owner and the tenant is founded on mutual benefit. In contrast, a conflict theorist might argue the relationship is based on a conflict in which the owner and tenant are struggling against each other. Their relationship is defined by the balance in their abilities to extract resources from each other, e.g. rent payments or a place to live. The bounds of the relationship are set where each is extracting the maximum possible amount of resources out of the other.

Conflict can take many forms and involve struggle over many different types of resources, including status. However, formal conflict theory had its foundations in the analysis of class conflict, and the example of the owner and the tenant can be understood in terms of class conflict. In class conflict, owners are likely to have relative advantages over non-owners. For example, the legal system underlying the relationship between the owner and tenant can be biased in favor of the owner. Suppose the owner wishes to keep the tenant&#x27;s security deposit after that tenant has moved out of the owner&#x27;s residence. In legal systems based on English common law, the owner is only required to notify the tenant that the security deposit is being withheld. To regain the security deposit, the tenant must file a lawsuit. The tenant bears the burden of proof and is therefore required to prove that the residence was adequately cleaned before move-out. This can be a very difficult or even impossible task.

To summarize the example, conflict theorists view the relationship between the owner and tenant as being built primarily on conflict rather than harmony. Even though the owner-tenant relationship may often appear harmonious, any visible harmony is only a product of the law and other elements of the superstructure which constrain the relationship and which are themselves a product of an even deeper conflict, class conflict. A conflict theorist would say that conflict theory holds more explanatory power than consensus theory in this situation since consensus theory cannot explain lawsuits between owners and tenants nor the legal foundations of the asymmetrical power relationship between the two.

==Social conflict theories==
From a social-conflict theorist/Marxist point of view social class and inequality emerges because the social structure is based on conflict and contradictions. Contradictions in interests and conflict over scarce resources between groups is the foundation of social society, according to the social conflict theory. The higher class will try to maintain their privileges, power, status and social position—and therefore try to influence politics, education, and other institutions to protect and limit access to their forms of capital and resources. Whereas the lower class—in contradiction to the higher class—has very different interests. They do not have specific forms of capital that they need to protect. All they are interested in is in gaining access to the resources and capital of the higher class. For example, education: the lower class will do everything to gain access to the higher class resources based on democratizing and liberalizing education systems because these forms of capital are thought to be of value for future success. The various institutions of society such as the legal and political system are instruments of ruling class domination and serve to further its interests. Marx believed that western society developed through four main epochs—primitive communism, ancient society, feudal society and capitalist society. Primitive communism is represented by the societies of pre-history and provides the only example of the classless society. From then all societies are divided into two major classes—master and slaves in ancient society, lords and serfs in feudal society and capitalist and wage laborers in capitalist society.

Weber sees class in economic terms. He argues that classes develop in market economies in which individuals compete for economic gain. He defines a class as a group of individuals who share a similar position in market economy and by virtue of that fact receive similar economic rewards. Thus a person&#x27;s class situation is basically his market situation. Those who share a similar class situation also share similar life chances. Their economic position will directly affect their chances of obtaining the things defined as desirable in their society.

Social conflict theory is also used to understand gender inequalities. One theory that is based on social-conflict ideas is radical feminist theory and feminism in general. According to a professor of political science in Belgrade, Jelena Vukoičić, radical feminism is a feminist theory that starts from the idea of conflict between the sexes as a fundamental conflict, and oppression against women as a direct implication of patriarchy. This theory rests on the assumption that all social activity is the result of certain restrictions and coercion, and although every social system contains specific forms of interactive constraints, they do not have to cause repression.

<doc id="182127" wikidata="Q1425151" url="?curid=182127" title="Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film">
<text>This is a list of films by year that have received an Academy Award together with the other nominations for best documentary short film. Following the Academy&#x27;s practice, the year listed for each film is the year of release: the awards are announced and presented early in the following year. Copies of every winning film (along with copies of most nominees) are held by the Academy Film Archive. Fifteen films are shortlisted before nominations are announced.

==Rules and eligibility==

Per the recent rules of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a Short Subject Documentary is defined as a nonfiction motion picture &quot;dealing creatively with cultural, artistic, historical, social, scientific, economic or other subjects&quot;. It may be photographed in actual occurrence, or may employ partial reenactment, stock footage, stills, animation, stop-motion or other techniques, as long as the emphasis is on fact, and not on fiction. It must have a run time of no more than 40 minutes and released during a special eligibility period which may vary from year to year, but generally begins the month of October of the prior year and ends in September of the award year. (This eligibility differs from most other Academy Award categories which only includes films released between January and December of the award year.) The documentary&#x27;s release must also occur within two years of the film&#x27;s completion, and there are also rules governing the formatting of audio and video used to produce and exhibit the picture.

In addition, to be eligible the film must meet one of the following criteria:

* complete a commercial showing of at least 7 days in either Los Angeles County, California or anywhere in New York City before being released to other non-theatrical venues such as DVD or TV; or
* regardless of any public exhibition or nontheatrical release the film must have won a qualifying award at a competitive film festival, as specified by the Academy; or
* win a Gold, Silver or Bronze Medal award in the Documentary category of the Academy&#x27;s Student Academy Award Competition.

The film must run daily for seven days, open to the public for paid admission, and must be advertised in one of the city&#x27;s major circulars during its run, with screening times included. Additionally, the film must be shown at least once during every day of its qualifying run. Unlike the Best Documentary Feature award, whose rules mandate at least one screening starting between noon and 10 pm local time on each day of the qualifying run, there is no restriction on the start time of any screening. The film must have narration or dialogue primarily in English or with English subtitles, and must be the whole of an original work. Partial edits from larger works and episodes from serialized films are not eligible.

Eligibility rules for prior years may have differed from these.

===Nomination process===

The Documentary Branch of the Academy first votes to select ten pictures for preliminary nomination, after which a second round of balloting is conducted to select the five documentary nominees. The entire Academy membership will then vote for one of these five for the Oscar. A maximum of two people involved with the production of the documentary may be nominated for the award, one of whom must be the film&#x27;s credited director. One producer may also be nominated, but if more than one non-director producer is credited the Academy Documentary Branch will vet the producers to select the one they believe was most involved in the creation of the film.

<text>American Gods (2001) is a fantasy novel by British author Neil Gaiman. The novel is a blend of Americana, fantasy, and various strands of ancient and modern mythology, all centering on the mysterious and taciturn Shadow.

The book was published in 2001 by Headline in the United Kingdom and by William Morrow in the United States. It gained a positive critical response and won the 2002 Hugo and Nebula awards.

A special tenth anniversary edition, which includes the &quot;author&#x27;s preferred text&quot; and 12,000 additional words, was published in June 2011 by William Morrow. Two audio versions of the book were produced and published by Harper Audio: an unabridged version of the original published edition, read by George Guidall, released in 2001; a full cast audiobook version of the tenth anniversary edition, released in 2011. In March 2017, The Folio Society published a special collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;American Gods&quot;, with many corrections to the author&#x27;s preferred text version.

In April 2017, Starz began airing a television adaptation of the novel. Bryan Fuller and Michael Green served as showrunners, and Gaiman is an executive producer. Fuller and Green departed the show after the first season.

==Plot summary==
Shadow Moon is an ex-convict set to be released from prison. Just as he is released, he learns that his wife, Laura, has been killed in a car accident. Shadow is devastated by her death, and is distraught to learn that she died alongside his best friend Robbie, with whom she had been having an affair. As he was supposed to get a job from Robbie upon his release from prison, Shadow is out of luck and has to figure out what to do now. With nowhere to go, Shadow takes a job as a bodyguard for a mysterious con man, Mr. Wednesday, and travels with him across the United States. Shadow meets a leprechaun named Mad Sweeney, who gives Shadow a magical gold coin after Shadow beats him in a fight. Shadow later tosses the coin into Laura&#x27;s grave at her funeral, inadvertently bringing her back from the dead as a revenant. Shadow meets Czernobog and the three Zorya Sisters. One of the sisters gives Shadow a silver coin, coming from the Moon, to protect him. Shadow learns that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin the All-Father, and that he is recruiting American manifestations of the Old Gods, whose powers have waned as their believers have decreased in number, to participate in a battle against the New Gods – manifestations of what humanity now worships, such as technology, media, pop-culture, and modern means of transport. Shadow meets many of Wednesday&#x27;s allies, including Mr. Nancy, Easter, Whiskey Jack, and John Chapman.

The New Gods henchmen, the Spooks, abduct Shadow; Laura rescues him, killing several Spooks in the process. Wednesday tells Shadow to hide with Mr. Ibis and Mr. Jacquel (Thoth and Anubis, respectively), who run a funeral parlor in Cairo, Illinois. Sweeney appears and asks Shadow to give back the coin, which holds all of Sweeney&#x27;s power. Shadow admits that he no longer has the coin and Sweeney dies. His body is tended to by Ibis and Jacquel, who lament the loss of another Old God. On the way to the Wisconsin community of Lakeside, Shadow picks up the hitchhiker Samantha Black Crow and drops her off at her house. Once in Lakeside, Shadow hides under the alias &quot;Mike Ainsel&quot; and spends time with several Lakeside residents who all live simple but happy and prosperous lives. Wednesday periodically takes Shadow on jobs to meet other gods. They are pursued all the while by the Spooks, particularly Mr. Town, who blames Shadow for the death of his friends. When a teenager in Lakeside goes missing, Shadow helps the other residents search for her, to no avail. Shadow learns that children and teenagers often go missing from Lakeside. He is then arrested for breaking his parole, but escapes with help from Czernobog and Mr. Nancy.

The New Gods seek to parley with Wednesday, but murder him at the meeting. This act is witnessed by and galvanizes the Old Gods, and they rally to face their enemies in battle at Rock City. While retrieving Wednesday&#x27;s body, Shadow is surprised to discover his old prison cellmate and mentor, Low Key Lyesmith, is working as a driver for the New Gods. Shadow is bound by his contract with Wednesday to hold his vigil by re-enacting Odin&#x27;s time hanging from a &quot;World Tree&quot; while pierced by a spear for nine days. During these nine days, he is visited by Horus, who has become mad from living too long as a hawk. Shadow dies and visits the land of the dead, where he is judged by Anubis. Shadow learns that he is Wednesday&#x27;s (Odin&#x27;s) son, conceived as part of the deity&#x27;s plans. During this time, Mr. Town arrives at the World Tree, ordered by Mr. World to cut a branch from it.

Horus finds Easter and convinces her to bring Shadow back to life. Shadow realizes Mr. World is actually Low Key (Loki) Lyesmith, and that Odin and Loki have been working a &quot;two-man con&quot;. They orchestrated Shadow&#x27;s birth, his meeting of Loki in disguise in prison, and Laura&#x27;s death. Loki had arranged for Odin&#x27;s murder, thus making the battle between the New and Old Gods a sacrifice to Odin, restoring Odin&#x27;s power, while also allowing Loki to feed on the chaos of the battle.

Laura chooses to hitchhike to Rock City and meets Mr. Town, who does not realize who she is, and they agree to travel together. During their travels, Laura learns who Mr. Town is and, once they arrive at their destination, kills him and takes the branch he took from the World Tree. She meets with Loki and manages to stab him with the World Tree branch, which turns into a spear as she stabs.

Shadow arrives at Rock City and confronts Loki, now gravely wounded, and the ghost of Odin, who reveal their plans. Shadow travels to the site of the battle and explains that both sides have nothing to gain and everything to lose, with Odin and Loki as the only true winners. Shadow tells them the United States is a bad place for Gods, and he recommends they return to their original homelands. The gods depart, Loki dies, and Odin&#x27;s ghost fades. Laura asks Shadow to take the coin from her, which he does, and she finally dies.

After resting with Mr. Nancy, Shadow remembers a dream where the Hindu god Ganesha told him to &quot;look in the trunk&quot;. He returns to Lakeside and walks onto the thinning ice toward the car resting there. He picks the lock and opens the trunk to find the body of the missing teenager inside. He falls through the ice and, while trapped beneath, sees cars from past winters resting on the lake floor. Each one presumably has a child&#x27;s body locked inside. Shadow is saved by Hinzelmann, who takes him to his house and treats him for hypothermia. Shadow realizes that Hinzelmann is a god and is also responsible for the children&#x27;s kidnappings and deaths. Hinzelmann explains that he regretfully must take one child as a sacrifice each year in exchange for the town&#x27;s prosperity. The townspeople are unaware of this and Hinzelmann&#x27;s control of the town as he tries to sacrifice children that no one will greatly miss. Shadow thinks of killing Hinzelmann, but finds he cannot as Hinzelmann saved his life. However, Chad Mulligan overhears the conversation and shoots Hinzelmann, killing him. Shadow and Chad drive away, with Chad guilty to the point of suicide. Shadow concludes this is a fail-safe created by Hinzelmann so that whoever killed him would die soon after. Using magic, Shadow takes Chad&#x27;s memory of overhearing Hinzelmann and the killing. He leaves Chad and Lakeside behind, understanding that the town&#x27;s prosperity will likely wither away without Hinzelmann&#x27;s protection.

In Iceland, Shadow meets another incarnation of Odin (created by the belief of the original settlers of Iceland), who is much closer than Wednesday to the Odin of mythology. Shadow accuses Odin of Wednesday&#x27;s actions, but Odin retorts: &quot;He was me, yes. But I am not him.&quot; He indicates that Wednesday was the part of him that went with his followers when they traveled to the new world and became corrupted as he was gradually forgotten. Shadow gives Wednesday&#x27;s glass eye to Odin, which Odin places in a leather bag as a keepsake. Shadow performs a simple sleight-of-hand coin trick, which delights Odin, who asks for a repeat performance. Shadow then performs a small piece of real magic, pulling a golden coin from nowhere like Mad Sweeney did when they first met. He then flips the coin up into the air and walks away, wondering if the coin will ever come back down.

Shadow states that, compared to the other old Gods, he still has a lot of influence. However, the bearded man worries that his teachings have been applied to everything, and as a result also apply to nothing. Gaiman has removed and replaced this section of the book numerous times.
*The Elephant God – Ganesha, the Hindu god of new beginnings; appears to Shadow during the world tree dream sequences. Shadow eventually realizes Ganesha&#x27;s role is to remove obstacles, and that his cryptic message to &#x27;look in the trunk&#x27; is in fact a clue to the location of Alison McGovern&#x27;s body.
*The Forgettable God – An unknown god whom Mr. Wednesday meets in Las Vegas along with Shadow, whose name slipped from Shadow&#x27;s mind whenever Mr. Wednesday said it. He has a liking for Soma, a Vedic ritual drink. Gaiman has never confirmed the identity of this god.

===New Gods===
* Technical Boy – New God of technology and the Internet, personified as an adult-sized fat child.
* Media – New Goddess of television and pop culture. She often communicates by hijacking whatever is showing on television, for example communicating with Shadow via Lucy Ricardo from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and the cast of &quot;Cheers&quot;.

==Influences==
The novel&#x27;s dedication reads &quot;for absent friends – Kathy Acker and Roger Zelazny and all points in between.&quot;

Gaiman has discussed the origin point for &quot;American Gods&quot; as a novel, citing his experience as an immigrant in America in 1992, where he began to form the vague idea of the book in his mind. Additionally, while experiencing a layover in an airport in Reykjavik in 1998, Gaiman states that he thought “I wonder if they brought their gods with them, when they went to America?”

The Discworld novel &quot;Small Gods&quot; explores a similar origin of deities (thoughtform). While Gaiman says that he did not read the book by Terry Pratchett, he thought they shared a worldview due to their same geographic origins and, more importantly, their daily phone conversations. He had also sought advice from Pratchett on resolving plot elements of &quot;American Gods&quot;.

According to Gaiman, &quot;American Gods&quot; is not based on Diana Wynne Jones&#x27;s 1975 novel &quot;Eight Days of Luke&quot;, &quot;although they bear an odd relationship, like second cousins once removed or something.&quot; When working on the structure of a story linking gods and days of the week, he realised that this idea had already been used in &quot;Eight Days of Luke&quot;. He abandoned the story, but later used the idea when writing &quot;American Gods&quot; to depict Wednesday and Shadow meeting on the god&#x27;s namesake day.

Of John James&#x27; 1966 novel &quot;Votan&quot;, Gaiman stated: &quot;I think probably the best book ever done about the Norse was a book that I couldn&#x27;t allow myself to read between coming up with the idea of &quot;American Gods&quot; and finishing it. After it was published, I actually sat down and allowed myself to read it for the first time in 15 years, and discovered it was just as good as I thought it was.&quot;

In his introduction to Fritz Leiber&#x27;s &quot;The Knight and Knave of Swords&quot;, Gaiman acknowledges Leiber&#x27;s portrayal of Odin and Loki had &quot;definitely smudged into&quot; and informed his take on the characters.

== Writing and promotion ==

While Gaiman was writing &quot;American Gods&quot;, his publishers set up a promotional web site featuring a weblog in which Gaiman described the day-to-day process of writing, revising, publishing, and promoting the novel. After the novel was published, the website evolved into a more general Official Neil Gaiman Web Site. Gaiman sporadically adds to the weblog, describing the writing, revising, publishing, or promoting of his current projects; but tends to use social media like Tumblr or Twitter for more personal details or reader questions.

On 28 February 2008, Gaiman announced on his journal that for one month the complete text of &quot;American Gods&quot; would be available to the public on his publisher&#x27;s website.

== Reception ==

The book won the 2002 Hugo, Nebula, Locus, &quot;SFX&quot; and Bram Stoker Awards, all for Best Novel, and likewise received nominations for the 2001 BSFA Award, as well as the 2002 World Fantasy, International Horror Guild and Mythopoeic, and British Fantasy awards. It won the 2003 Geffen Award. According to &quot;Book Marks&quot;, based on American publications, the book received &quot;positive&quot; reviews based on nine critic reviews, with two being &quot;rave&quot; and four being &quot;positive&quot; and two being &quot;mixed&quot; and one being &quot;pan&quot;. 

In May 2010, &quot;American Gods&quot; was selected in an online poll to be the first &quot;One Book One Twitter&quot; book. In 2014, when the television show adaptation was announced, author Abraham Riesman criticized the move as being a &quot;bad idea&quot;, highlighting the aspects of the book that did not age well or were offensive to some cultures. Beyond this, academics have claimed the work has ontological and epistemic implications, and, as part of the body of Gaiman&#x27;s work, explored the appropriative style.

==Publishing history==
The book was published in 2001 by Headline in the United Kingdom and by William Morrow in the United States.

A special tenth anniversary edition, which includes the &quot;author&#x27;s preferred text&quot; and 12,000 additional words, was published in June 2011 by William Morrow. The tenth anniversary text is identical to the signed and numbered limited edition released in 2003 by Hill House Publishers, and to the edition from Headline, Gaiman&#x27;s publisher in the UK since 2005. The tenth anniversary edition marked the first time the author&#x27;s preferred text had been available in wide release outside the UK.

Two audio versions of the book were produced and published by Harper Audio: an unabridged version of the original published edition, read by George Guidall, was released in 2001. A full cast audiobook version of the tenth anniversary edition, including the author&#x27;s preferred text and 12,000 additional words, was released in 2011.

A comic book series, &quot;American Gods: Shadows&quot;, was published by Dark Horse Comics starting in March 2017. A book of the same name, collecting issues 1 through 9 of the comic book series, was published by Dark Horse Books in February 2018.

In March 2017, The Folio Society published a special collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;American Gods&quot;, with many corrections to the author&#x27;s preferred text version. Gaiman described this edition as &#x27;the cleanest text there has ever been&#x27; of the novel.

==In other media==
===Comics===

Dark Horse Comics publishes a series of comic books based on the novel. The comic books were co written by Gaiman and P. Craig Russell. With art by Russell and Scott Hampton, among others.

===Television===

Starz developed a television series from the novel with Bryan Fuller and Michael Green. The series debuted in April 2017. At the end of season 1, Fuller stepped down as showrunner and was replaced by Jesse Alexander. The two had previously worked together on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

===Music===
The power metal band Blind Guardian wrote a song titled &quot;Secrets of the American Gods&quot; based on the novel, on their 2022 album The God Machine.

==Related works==

Gaiman&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Anansi Boys&quot; (2005), was conceived before &quot;American Gods&quot; and shares a character, Mr. Nancy (Anansi, the spider god of African legend).

In an interview with MTV News published on 22 June 2011, Gaiman said that he had plans for a direct sequel to &quot;American Gods&quot;. Gaiman had plans for a sequel even while writing the first book and has said that he is likely to focus on the New Gods in the sequel.

In addition to the planned sequel, Gaiman has written two short story sequels featuring Shadow Moon. &quot;The Monarch of the Glen&quot;, a novella first published in the 2003 anthology &quot;Legends II&quot;, takes place in Scotland two years after &quot;American Gods&quot;. The second short story, &quot;Black Dog&quot;, was collected in Gaiman&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Trigger Warning&quot;. It takes place a year later in Derbyshire&#x27;s Peak District. In the introduction for &quot;Trigger Warnings&quot; Gaiman said that he had one final standalone story that would take Shadow to London before he returns to the US and the start of American Gods 2.

<doc id="182135" wikidata="Q1509709" url="?curid=182135" title="Tentsuyu">
<text>is Japanese tempura dip. 

The recipe for tentsuyu depends on the seasons and on the ingredients for which tentsuyu is being prepared. A general, all-purpose, tentsuyu might consist of three parts dashi, one part mirin, and one part soy sauce. For ingredients with strong odors or flavors, however, sake and sugar might be used instead of mirin, or more or less shōyu might be used.

Similar ingredients make up the simmering sauce for donburi and the broth for dishes like &quot;agedashi tofu&quot; (deep-fried tofu in broth) and soba (buckwheat noodles).

Tentsuyu in concentrated form is commonly sold in a small bottles in supermarkets and grocery stores throughout Japan—and also in Asian grocery stores in the US. 

When used for tempura, tentsuyu is commonly served with grated daikon white radish.

<text>Sunoco LP is an American master limited partnership organized under Delaware state law and headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Dating back to 1886, the company has transformed from a vertically integrated energy company to a distributor of fuels and operator of energy infrastructure. It was previously engaged in oil, natural gas exploration and production, refining, chemical manufacturing, and retail fuel sales, but divested these businesses.

Its current operational focus dates back to 2018 when it divested the noncore convenience store operations to 7-Eleven for $3.2 billion, which allowed for Sunoco LP to improve its financial position. The transaction also provided a long-term take or pay fuel supply agreement with 7-Eleven to generate consistent earnings and cash flows. As of 2024, Sunoco still operates 76 retail locations, all of which are located in New Jersey and Hawaii (branded as Aloha Petroleum, Ltd.).

As of 2024, the company distributes over 8 billion gallons of fuel across more than 40 U.S. states and territories, making it one of the largest independent fuel distributors in the United States. Its midstream operations include a network of approximately 14,000 miles of pipeline and over 100 terminals. 

The partnership was known as Sun Company, Inc. from 1886 to 1920 and 1976 to 1998, and as Sun Oil Co. from 1920 to 1976. (The Sunoco name is a condensation of SUN Oil COmpany.)

==History==
===1800s to 1950s: founding and growth===

The partnership began as The Peoples Natural Gas Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1886, its partners Joseph Newton Pew, Philip Pisano, and Edward O. Emerson decided to expand their fuel business with a stake in the new oil discoveries in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Four years later, the growing enterprise became the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. Sun Oil diversified quickly and became active in the production and distribution of oil as well as processing and marketing refined products. By 1901, the company was incorporated in New Jersey as Sun Company, Inc.

In 1902, the Sun Oil Refining Company was chartered in Texas, as it turned its interest to the new Spindletop field in Texas. Joseph Newton Pew&#x27;s nephew, J. Edgar Pew, was able to buy the storage and transportation assets of Lone Star and Crescent Oil Company at a receivership auction. Spindletop oil was then shipped to the company&#x27;s Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, refinery.

Pew&#x27;s sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr. would take over the company after their father&#x27;s death.

With a growing portfolio of oil fields and refineries, Sun opened its first service station in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, in 1920. In 1922, it changed its name back to Sun Oil Company and, in 1925, it became a public company via an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Sun Oil ranked 39th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts. The company expanded internationally following the war. Its first Canadian refinery was built in 1953 in Sarnia, Ontario, home to a burgeoning new petrochemical industry. Sun Oil established a facility at Venezuela&#x27;s Lake Maracaibo in 1957, which produced over a billion barrels (160,000,000 m3) before the operation was nationalized in 1975.

In 1956, the company introduced &quot;CustomBlended&quot; fuel pumps, an innovation that allowed customers of Sunoco service stations to choose from several octane ratings through a single pump. Sunoco stations offered as many as eight grades of &quot;CustomBlended&quot; fuels from its &quot;Dial A Grade/Blend Selector&quot; pumps ranging from subregular Sunoco 190 to Sunoco 260 and super-premium grade of 102 octane. The Sunoco 260 was advertised as &quot;The Highest Octane Fuel You Can Buy!&quot; and very popular with operators of V8powered muscle cars of the 1960s.

===1960s to 1990s: acquisitions and branding===
In 1967, Sun Oil established its Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited facility in northern Alberta, Canada to access the estimated 300 billion barrels (48 km3) of extractable oil in the Athabasca oil sands.

In 1968, Sun Oil merged with Tulsa, Oklahomabased Sunray DX Oil Company, which refined and marketed fuel under the DX brand in several midwestern states, and included several refineries. Its Tulsa refinery was operated by the company until its sale in June 2009 to Holly Corporation of Dallas. This move expanded Sun Oil&#x27;s marketing area into the midcontinent region.

The company continued marketing its petroleum products under both the Sunoco and DX brands through the 1970s and into the 1980s. In the late 1980s, it began rebranding DX stations in the Midwest to the Sunoco brand, but by the early 1990s, they pulled out of virtually all areas in the southeastern U.S. and west of the Mississippi, resulting in the closing and rebranding of service stations and jobbers to other brands in those areas, notably Sinclair in Oklahoma and Kerr-McGee in Arkansas.

With increased diversification, Sun Oil Company was renamed Sun Company in 1976. In 1980, Sun acquired the U.S. oil and gas properties of Texas Pacific Oil Company, Inc., a subsidiary of The Seagram Company Ltd, for U.S.$2.3 billion the second largest acquisition in U.S. history to that date.

Through the 1980s, Sun developed oil interests in the North Sea and offshore China and expanded its holdings in both oil and coal with additional U.S. business acquisitions. In 1983, the company launched Sunoco ULTRA 94, the market&#x27;s highest octane unleaded fuel. Then in 1988, Sun undertook a restructuring to segregate its domestic oil and fuel exploration and production business and focus the company on its refining and marketing business. This led to the acquisition of Atlantic Refining and Marketing (and, in effect, that company&#x27;s convenience store chain, APlus), including its Philadelphia refinery which was later merged with the former Gulf Oil refinery that Sunoco acquired from Chevron.

By the 1990s, the company had departed the international exploration business and was fully dedicated to its branded products and services. In 1994, Sun acquired the Philadelphia Chevron Oil refinery consolidating operations with its own adjacent which it had acquired with Atlantic. It sold its remaining interest in Canada&#x27;s Suncor Energy in 1995 but markets products from two refineries one in Toledo, Ohio, and the other Sarnia, Ontario in joint ventures. In 1998, Sun Company, Inc. became Sunoco, Inc. In 2011 the Toledo facility was sold to PBF Energy, Inc.

In 1998, Sunoco acquired the chemical business of Allied Signal, including a phenol plant. The business was renamed as &quot;Sunoco Chemicals, Inc.&quot; In 2011, the plant was acquired by Honeywell for $85 million.

===2000s===
In 2003, Speedway LLC, then a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum, sold 193 convenience stores to Sunoco. It also acquired service stations from Coastal Petroleum.
In 2004, Sunoco replaced the ConocoPhillips&#x27; 76 brand as the &quot;Official Fuel of NASCAR&quot;.

After ConocoPhillips abandoned the marketing of the Mobil brand name in the Washington, D.C. area, Sunoco purchased these rights, converted Maryland and Virginia Mobil stations to the Sunoco brand, bringing the APlus convenience store with them prior to this, these stations had convenience stores under the Circle K or On the Run brands.

In September 2009, Sunoco sold its retail heating oil and propane distribution business to Superior Plus for $82.5 million in cash.

In Canada, the Sunoco brand was licensed for the Ontario retail fuel station operations of Suncor Energy until 2010. Following Suncor&#x27;s acquisition of Petro-Canada, all Canadian Sunoco outlets were converted to PetroCanada branding, except for one location in Port Colborne, Ontario, which closed in 2023.

In December 2010, Sunoco sold its refinery in Toledo, Ohio, to PBF Energy, Inc. for $400 million. Effective September 6, 2011, Sunoco announced that it would exit the crude oil refining business and seek to sell its Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania refineries by mid-2012. The company stated that its cost for exiting the refining business could be as high as $2.7 billion. According to one report, it had lost some $800 million on refining operations since 2009; an earlier report provided a figure of $772 million.

On December 1, 2011, Sunoco announced it would accelerate closure of the Marcus Hook facility. The Marcus Hook facility, founded in 1902 and covering 781 acres, was dedicated exclusively to the processing of light sweet crude oil; this processing focus combined with volatility in crude oil prices are considered contributing factors to both this refinery&#x27;s closure and Sunoco&#x27;s exit from the refinery business.

In 2012, Sunoco demolished its Eagle Point refinery complex in West Deptford Township, New Jersey, which had been idle since 2010.

In September 2012, Sunoco formed a joint venture with The Carlyle Group, allowing for the continuation of operations at the Philadelphia refinery, and temporarily saving over 800 jobs. However, on January 22, 2018, the joint venture, named Philadelphia Energy Solutions, filed for bankruptcy. 

===Environmental record===
On June 21, 2019, a damaging fire occurred at a 30,000 bpcd alkylation unit in Philadelphia. The explosion of the alkylation unit triggered a massive fireball and caused nearby homes to shake. A few days later, on June 26 the refinery complex announced it would cease operations and shut down.

In 2014, Sunoco was one of 50 companies sued by Pennsylvania, which alleged that the companies polluted waters with MTBE, a fuel additive.

In 2000, Sunoco leaked 190,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Pennsylvania through a cracked pipe. Sunoco claimed their systems did not detect the leak; the leak was reported by a hiker in the Wildlife Refuge. Afterwards, the company installed advanced leak detection systems while removing the defective joints on this and associated pipelines.

In 1993, Sunoco became the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the CERES principles (Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies). The 10point conduct code includes public reporting of environmental record.

On April 4, 1991, Pennsylvania U.S. Senator H. John Heinz was killed when his airplane collided with a Sun Company helicopter in what is known as the Merion air disaster. Falling debris killed two children at the Merion Elementary School in the Lower Merion School District. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident included poor judgment and errors on the behalf of both pilots.

=== Purchase by Energy Transfer Partners and creation of Sunoco LP as masterlimited partnership ===
In 2012, Dallasbased energy company Energy Transfer Partners purchased Sunoco. Sunoco would subsequently move its corporate headquarters to Dallas in 2016.

On August 29, 2014, Energy Transfer Partners acquired Susser Holdings Corporation, owner of Stripes Convenience Stores and general partner of Susser Petroleum Partners LP (SUSP). On October 27, 2014, Susser Petroleum Partners LP changed its name to Sunoco LP and its ticker symbol from SUSP to SUN. From 2014 to 2016, Energy Transfer Partners sold the combined retail and marketing assets of Sunoco and Susser Holdings to Sunoco LP.

In Texas, Sunoco replaced Valero at the Stripes locations; Stripes and APlus remained separate brands.

===Current Operation: Focus on fuel distribution and energy infrastructure===
Also in 2014, Sunoco LP acquired Aloha Petroleum, Ltd., a retail and wholesale fuel business with six terminals in Hawaii. Additionally, it purchased eight Pico convenience stores in south central Texas. In December 2015, the company completed its acquisition of Alta East, Inc., a wholesale motor fuel distribution business serving the northeast United States. In 2015, Aloha Petroleum, Ltd. acquired stores including a Subway in Hawaii.

In June 2016, Sunoco LP purchased Valentine Convenience stores, consisting of 18 locations selling more than 20 million gallons of fuel, as well as Texasbased Kolkhorst Petroleum, Inc. Kolkhorst operated 14 convenience stores under the Rattler&#x27;s brand and distributed more than 46 million gallons of fuel. Denny Oil, a convenience store and wholesale distributor operator, was purchased by Sunoco LP in October 2016, adding an additional 90 million gallons of fuel to its distribution business.

Sunoco diversified its portfolio in August 2016 with the acquisition of Emerge Energy Services LP, entering into the business of processing transmix fuels.

In April 2017, Sunoco introduced at all of its stations Sunoco UltraTech, a high-detergent fuel blend that met Top Tier standards. Sunoco UltraTech contains the same detergent level as the fuel Sunoco makes for NASCAR.
In January 2018, the company sold 1,030 retail stores to 7-Eleven and agreed to supply 2.2 billion gallons of fuel to 7Eleven convenience stores annually for 15 years. This included Sunoco&#x27;s contract to the service plazas along the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Sunoco LP announced the completion of the acquisition of the refined terminaling business from American Midstream Partners, LP on December 20, 2018.

On April 2, 2018, Sunoco announced the completion of the conversion of its 207 retail sites located in central west Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico markets to a single commission agent, Cal&#x27;s Convenience, Inc. That month also saw the acquisition of Superior Plus Energy Services, adding three terminals and approximately 200 million gallons to Sunoco LP&#x27;s wholesale fuels business. Additional 2018 acquisitions included Sandford Energy, LLC., BRENCO Marketing Corp., and Schmitt Sales, Inc.

In 2019, Sunoco LP announced a 50 percent ownership joint venture with Energy Transfer on the J.C. Nolan diesel fuel pipeline that connects west Texas to the Gulf Coast. On January 18, 2019, Sunoco LP announced the execution of a definitive asset purchase agreement with Attis Industries, Inc. for the sale of Sunoco LP&#x27;s ethanol plant, including the grain malting operation in Fulton, New York.

In 2021, the company expanded its midstream footprint with the construction of a terminal in Brownsville, Texas along with the purchase of a terminal in Maryland from Cato Incorporated and eight terminals in Illinois, Maryland, Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia from NuStar Energy LP.

In 2022, Sunoco acquired Gladieux Capital Partners, LLC, a transmix plant in Indiana that included a wholesale fuel business, and Peerless Oil &amp; Chemicals, a terminal and wholesale fuel business in Puerto Rico.

In May 2023, the company completed the acquisition of 16 refined product terminals located across the East Coast and Midwest from Zenith Energy.

In January 2024, Sunoco announced the sale of 204 convenience stores in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and West Texas to 7-Eleven for $1.0 billion. 

On March 13, 2024, Sunoco LP announced its acquisition of Zenith Energy Netherlands Amsterdam B.V., which included liquid fuels terminals in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Bantry Bay, Ireland.

On May 3, 2024, Sunoco LP acquired NuStar Energy LP for $7.3 billion. As reported by J.P. Morgan analysts, the acquisition “represented a transformative shift in strategy to a more diversified and vertically integrated business.” Assets added in the acquisition included a network of approximately 9,500 miles of pipeline and 63 terminals.

In July 2024, Sunoco LP announced the formation of a joint venture with Energy Transfer to combine their crude oil and produced water-gathering assets in the Permian Basin. The joint venture now operates more than 5,000 miles of crude oil and water gathering pipelines along with crude oil storage capacity of over 11 million barrels. Energy Transfer holds a 67.5% interest in the joint venture, with Sunoco LP holding the remaining 32.5% interest.

In August 2024, the company acquired a liquid fuels terminal in Portland, Maine.

<text>Mitchell Parish (born Michael Hyman Pashelinsky; July 10, 1900 – March 31, 1993) was an American lyricist, notably as a writer of songs for stage and screen.

==Biography==
Parish was born to a Jewish family in Lithuania, Russian Empire in July 1900. His family emigrated to the United States, arriving on February 3, 1901 aboard the when he was less than a year old. They settled first in Louisiana where his paternal grandmother had relatives, but later moved to New York City, where he grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and received his education in the public schools.

He attended Columbia University and N.Y.U. and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He eventually abandoned the notion of practicing law to become a songwriter. He served his apprenticeship as a writer of special material for vaudeville acts, and later established himself as a writer of songs for stage, screen and numerous musical revues. By the late 1920s, Parish was a well-regarded Tin Pan Alley lyricist in New York City.

Parish&#x27;s grandnephew, Steve Parish, was a roadie for the band Grateful Dead. He described Mitchell Parish&#x27;s meeting with Jerry Garcia in his autobiography, &quot;Home Before Day Light&quot;.

==Career==

His first steady employer was the music publisher Jack Mills, brother of Irving Mills, who signed him for $12 a week to write comedy lyrics for vaudeville acts and to be a song-plugger. His first hit, &quot;Carolina Rolling Stone&quot;, was recorded by the musical comedy team Van and Schenck for Columbia Records in 1922. Parish tended to write his lyrics to completed melodies, hits that originated in other languages, or adaptations of classical music.

Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington, Peter De Rose, Leroy Anderson, Glenn Miller, Sammy Fain, and Benny Goodman were among the composers. As one of the first inductees into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the romantic quality of many of his lyrics such as &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Stairway to the Stars&quot;, &quot;Deep Purple&quot;, and &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; contributed to his being called by other songwriters &quot;the poet laureate of the profession&quot;. In an interview in 1987, Parish claimed to have written the lyrics to the Duke Ellington standard &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, though they were credited to Irving Mills. He remained &quot;somewhat rueful, though no longer bitter&quot; about it.

His best-known works include the lyrics to songs such as &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot;, &quot;Deep Purple&quot;, &quot;Stars Fell on Alabama&quot;, &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, the translation to English lyrics of &quot;Volare&quot; and &quot;Blue Skirt Waltz&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;, &quot;Mr. Ghost Goes to Town&quot;, &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, &quot;One Morning in May&quot;, and &quot;Louisiana Fairy Tale&quot;, which was the first theme song used in the PBS Production of &quot;This Old House&quot;.

Besides providing the lyrics to Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot;, the two collaborated on standards such as &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot; and &quot;One Morning in May&quot;.

In 1949, Parish added lyrics to bandleader Al Goodman&#x27;s tune &quot;The Allen Stroll&quot;, which was played as radio comedian Fred Allen took a stroll down &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot;, a featured segment of Allen&#x27;s weekly show. The new song, &quot;Carousel of Love&quot;, premiered on &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; on April 4, 1949. It was sung by the DeMarco Sisters and played by Al Goodman and his Orchestra.

In 1950, he wrote lyrics to Leroy Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot;. In 1951, he wrote the English lyrics of the French song &quot;Maître Pierre&quot; which was written in 1948 by Henri Betti (music) and Jacques Plante (lyrics). The title song became &quot;The Windmill Song&quot; and the song was recorded by The Andrews Sisters with Gordon Jenkins and his Orchestra.

He participated in the episode of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; aired on December 25, 1956, as a challenger.

In 1972, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is the recipient of their Johnny Mercer Award.
