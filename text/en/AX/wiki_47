<text>Orillia () is a city in Ontario, Canada, about 30 km (18 mi) north-east of Barrie in Simcoe County. It is located at the confluence of Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe. Although it is geographically located within Simcoe County, the city is a single-tier municipality. It is part of the Huronia region of Central Ontario. The population in 2021 was 33,411.

It was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the Huron and Iroquois peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by Aboriginal peoples for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.

Known as the &quot;Sunshine City&quot;, the city&#x27;s large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area&#x27;s largest employer is Casino Rama, overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.

Orillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching. Both lakes are part of the Trent-Severn Waterway. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three locks and the only marine railway (Big Chute Marine Railway) still in use in North America leads to Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many locks (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, Peterborough Lift Lock and Kirkfield Lift Lock) eventually leads to Lake Ontario. From either of these Great Lakes one can connect to the St. Lawrence and thence to the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the &quot;Narrows&quot;, a small waterway that connects Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, there is marine archaeological evidence of ancient fishing weirs used by Huron and Iroquois people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by Indigenous people. The Mnjikaning Fish Weirs are, in fact, believed to be the original source of the Name of Toronto; the weirs were known as &quot;ouentaronk&quot; by the Huron people and &quot;tkaronto&quot; by the Mohawk, and due to the site&#x27;s importance as a site of trade between the indigenous peoples and the colonial French settlers, the name came to be transferred first to the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail river and portage route from the weirs to Lake Ontario, then to Fort Toronto near the route&#x27;s end at Lake Ontario, and finally to the civilian settlement that grew around the fort.

Although the site of what is now Orillia was originally a settlement of the Huron-Wendat people, it was later inhabited by the Ojibwe people, who settled the land under the leadership of Chief William Yellowhead. The Ojibwe people remained on the land until the arrival of European settlers.

Also of historical note, the famed French explorer Samuel de Champlain visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French, and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster). Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a National Historic Site of Canada.

The government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815, and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans. In 1840, the government bought extra land from the First Nations and laid out the settlement of Orillia. The population in 1846 was about 200. The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers. A grist mill could be found about a mile away.

In 1869, the population was 1200. Construction of the Monck Road began in 1866 and was completed in 1873. A 100-mile stretch allowed for travel to Bancroft, Ontario where other roads could be found for travel to Ottawa.

Transportation links with Toronto and Georgian Bay stimulated Orillia&#x27;s development as a commercial centre and summer resort.
The village of Orillia was incorporated in 1867 (sharing the same birth year as Canada). By 1875, the population was 2,000 and Orillia became a town with a mayor, reeve, deputy reeve, and nine councillors.
Orillia was designated a city in 1969.

In Stephen Leacock&#x27;s 1912 book &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot;, Orillia was used as the basis for the fictional town known as &quot;Mariposa&quot;, although Leacock stated that the fictional town could really be any town. The book was based on Leacock&#x27;s experiences in the town and since the book&#x27;s release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the National Historic Sites of Canada.

William E. Bell&#x27;s 1989 novel &quot;Five Days of the Ghost&quot; was also set in Orillia, with many readers recognizing popular local spots, including the Guardian Angels Catholic Church, the Samuel de Champlain statue in Couchiching Beach Park as well as Chiefs Island in the middle of Lake Couchiching.

Orillia was the first municipality in North America to introduce daylight saving time and had the first municipal hydroelectric transmission plant in North America.

===Etymology===
The first recorded use of the name to describe the region, which until then had no officially sanctioned designation, was in 1820 when the name was given in York, Upper Canada by then Lieutenant-Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland. Maitland was a veteran of the British campaign against the French in Spain, called the Peninsular War, during the Napoleonic Wars where he served under the command of the Duke of Wellington.

While there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the Spanish, &quot;orilla,&quot; which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, &quot;oreeya,&quot; and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, &quot;i,&quot; it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city&#x27;s name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include Oro for gold, Mariposa for butterfly, and Mono for monkey. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a clerical error.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Orillia had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median household income in 2015 for Orillia was $55,802, which is below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.

==Government==
Orillia is governed by the Orillia City Council, which consists of eight city councillors and a mayor.

There are four wards in the city.

From 1875 to 1969, the council was led by a reeve or mayor. Since 1969 the head of the council is the mayor.

==Grape Island==
Grape Island is a lake island located off Victoria Point in the north end of Lake Simcoe.

Today the island is occupied by about 40 private homes or cottages and residences are part of the &quot;Grape Island Property Owners Association&quot; (c. 1952). Access is restricted to residents of the island with access by boat from Forest Avenue South dock to private docks on the island. The heavy traffic at the mainland docks have resulted in tensions between island residents and residents of Victoria Point. The city of Orillia is working on finding a solution for access to the island without inconveniencing residents in Victoria Point.

There are no vehicular roads on the island. Only Ivy Lane, a road allowance, serves as path to homes on the island. Water taxi is the main means of transportation to the island (unless residents have their own private vessels) from the GIPOA-owned mainland dock to the island dock (on a vacant lot).
==Economy==

Initial interest in Orillia came from fur traders who used the gathering place at the Narrows to do business with the many tribes that came there each spring and fall. Subsequently, Orillia&#x27;s economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first &quot;campers&quot; (a pop-up tent in a car).

Economic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service, and tourism. The largest employer in the area is Casino Rama, located in the nearby reserve land of the Chippewas of Rama First Nation. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation (petrochemical industry components), Parker Hannifin (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining), and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia on Memorial Drive along with the regional headquarters.

Heywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.

G.W.B. Rope &amp; Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996–97. G.W.B. Rope and Twine&#x27;s founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&amp;B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&amp;B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia&#x27;s newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)

Large public-sector employers include the headquarters for the Ontario Provincial Police, which is located in Orillia. The Huronia Regional Centre, formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area&#x27;s largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.

==Recreation and culture==
Orillia is known as the &quot;Sunshine City&quot;, taking the moniker from its role as the fictional &quot;Mariposa&quot; in the book &quot;Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town&quot; by Stephen Leacock. Many local businesses also use &quot;Mariposa&quot; in their names.

The city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain &quot;small town&quot; look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017, plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.
Orillia&#x27;s &quot;Arts District&quot; is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E., and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art &amp; History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.

The museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.

Many tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in Muskoka, Algonquin Provincial Park, the Trent–Severn Waterway, and other natural attractions. The city&#x27;s waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children&#x27;s train.

The city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a &quot;retirement community&quot;, although less than 18% of the city&#x27;s population is actually over 65 (see below).

Orillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a &quot;perch fry&quot;. Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.

The Port of Orillia holds an annual &quot;Christmas in June&quot;, which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.

Orillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park. The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.

Orillia is the original site of the popular Mariposa Folk Festival. Beginning in 1961, it is (as of 2024) the longest-running folk festival in Canada.

The Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist Stephen Leacock&#x27;s memory since 1947 with the annual Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year. The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.

The Royal Canadian Legion sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year. Marching bands from around the country participate.

Since 1963, the Webers hamburger restaurant has been approximately 1 km north of Orillia, next to Ontario Highway 11.
Lake St. George Golf Club is ten minutes north of Orillia.

==Education==
Both French and English public education is offered in Orillia.

There is one Catholic French-language elementary school, &quot;École élémentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain&quot;, operated by the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud.

Students from this elementary school attend &quot;École secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance&quot;, which is operated by the same board and is located in Barrie.

English public education in Orillia is provided via the Simcoe County District School Board, which has nine elementary and three secondary schools in the city. The secondary schools are Twin Lakes Secondary School and Orillia Secondary School, formerly OD/Park Secondary School and created by the amalgamation of Orillia District Collegiate and Vocational Institute and Park Street Collegiate Institute. The schools joined together in the summer of 2013. There is also an alternative secondary school, known as OASIS.

Publicly funded Catholic English-language education is available via the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board through four elementary schools and one secondary school, Patrick Fogarty Catholic Secondary School.

Private schools include the Orillia Christian School.

There are two post-secondary institutions that are based in Orillia. The Orillia campus of Georgian College offers applied arts and technology programmes to 1,600 students. Lakehead University operates a small campus downtown, with the main campus on University Ave. The Orillia campus opened in the downtown in 2006 and the campus on University Ave. opened in September 2010. The Lakehead University campus located on University Avenue is the first in North America that has been built to meet all LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification standards.

There is also an Adult Learning Centre, where adults may upgrade to receive high school diplomas.

==Health care==
The Orillia Soldiers&#x27; Memorial Hospital is a 230-bed hospital in the city. Opened in 1908 as the 20-bed Orillia General Hospital, it took its current name in 1922 to honour those who died fighting in World War I. Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital celebrated its 100th anniversary on May 28, 2008. The hospital is located at 170 Colborne Street West, Orillia, ON L3V 2Z3.

==Transit==

Orillia Transit provides service on five routes throughout the city. All of these routes run on loops which depart and end at the downtown bus terminal at the intersection of West and Mississaga Streets, in front of the Orillia Public Library and Opera House. Orillia Transit services commence at 6:15 a.m., ending at 10:15 p.m. on weekdays with all final departures from the terminal and shorter operating hours on weekends with no holiday service.

In August 2019, Simcoe County LINX began a bus route that connects Orillia with Barrie on weekdays, excluding statutory holidays.

Ontario Northland provides intercity bus service, connecting Orillia to Toronto, Barrie, North Bay and Sudbury, among other destinations. The bus stop was originally located at the site of the former train station, but was moved to the Knights Inn on Front Street in 2020, and subsequently moved to the Orillia Transit terminal in 2024.

Orillia was once a stop for the Northlander train but re-routing resulted in termination of service. The station that served the Northlander still exists but re-adapted for commercial use.

==Climate==
==Environmental issues==
In 2012, Orillia won the highest municipal honour for its waste diversion efforts. The City of Orillia had a waste diversion rate of 61% in 2011. The Recycling Council of Ontario awarded the city its highest award, the Platinum Municipal Diversion Award.

==Ontario Provincial Police headquarters==

As part of an initiative to decentralise its services, the provincial government relocated the headquarters of the Ontario Provincial Police to Orillia. The office was initially located in the Tudhope Building downtown (part of which is currently used as the Orillia City Hall) until the new building was opened in 1995. The headquarters, known as the Lincoln M. Alexander Building, is located on Memorial Avenue near the Huronia Regional Centre. The building houses the assorted bureaus and divisions that make up the general headquarters, as well as the Provincial Police Academy, and The OPP Museum.

OPP Central Region Headquarters is located on Hurtubise Road, near the intersection of Hwy 12 and Memorial Avenue.

The OPP also provides municipal policing to the City of Orillia under contract from a detachment located on University Avenue. The city&#x27;s police force was disbanded when the policing contract began in 1996.

<text>Dorestad (&quot;Dorestat, Duristat&quot;) was an early medieval emporium, located in the present-day province of Utrecht in the Netherlands, close to the modern-day town of Wijk bij Duurstede. 
It flourished during the 8th to early 9th centuries, as an important port on the northeastern shipping routes due to its proximity to the fork in the Rhine, with access to Germany via the Nederrijn (the northernmost branch of the Rhine), to the southern Netherlands, northern France, and England (via the Lek), and to the northern Netherlands, northern Germany, and Scandinavia (via the Kromme Rijn).

==History==
The township was established at the base of the former Roman fortress of &quot;Levefanum&quot; in the 7th century.

The Frankish Carolingian Empire and the Frisians fought for control of the territory, until the Franks gained control of the Frisian Coast in 719.

Dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century. The settlement was well known for minting coins under the control of several Frankish rulers. 
In the 7th century, it was clear that Dorestad had the potential to become a major port. It was the meeting point for traders at the time. As a result, the Franks and the Frisians fought over control of the township. The Franks won out at the end of the 7th century and closely monitored the growth of Dorestad, which led to Dorestad&#x27;s economic expansion via international trade and the establishment of a mint in the Upper town. It is assumed that there was a toll as well as harbour fees, collected by the king&#x27;s representatives at Dorestad. Over time, many coins have been discovered in the Dorestad area, supporting the idea of rapid growth and control of the harbour as well as the presence of a mint. Many of the coins that have been discovered bear resemblance to other Frankish coins of the period. The numismatic evidence supports the victory of the Franks over the Frisians.

It seems that the expansion of Dorestad, Lower Town in particular, lasted until the early 9th century, when the strength of the international trade of luxury items was weakened by the rise of regional trade. The shift in the character of trade occurred as more and more trading towns popped up in the region. The Franks seemed to be networking with Byzantium and the Muslim world. As the trade increased across the board, the Franks required more trading settlements to support the economy.
As a result, the Franks slowly lost interest in the town and granted the Church of Utrecht responsibility over a sizeable portion of Dorestad. By expanding the power of the Church, the local élite was weakened providing substantial security for the Franks.
It is generally believed that the township reached its peak around the 820s and 830s and declined considerably thereafter. It is thought that the decline occurred because of Viking raids as well as a decline in the economy.

By the 830s, under the control of Louis the Pious, the expansion of the harbour had halted altogether, but coins continued to be minted for some time. A division occurred in the Frankish Empire, and Louis the Pious was removed from the throne by his son. However, Lothair I was unable to protect Dorestad and the other Frankish territories from economic turmoil. As a result, Louis the Pious quickly took back Dorestad and exiled his son to Italy. At this time, two things occurred in Dorestad that led to its eventual downfall. The first was that the Franks lost even more interest in Dorestad and as a result, even more control was transferred to the Church. The second was that Lothair I was stirring up trouble for the Franks by encouraging Viking raids on the Frisian coast when he was exiled.

Between 834 and 839, there were extensive raids. Although Dorestad was raided only once, in 834, it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards.
To protect the Frisian coastline, Frankish kings enlisted the help of the Danes and appointed Haraldr Junior and his brother, Hroerekr, to protect the emporium.
The Franks allowed Hroerekr to take control of the land as long as he protected the coast from Viking invasions. The coast was battered by Viking attacks, but it seems that Dorestad was left relatively unscathed. The Danish rulers held court on the coast for quite some time despite being not well liked by the people that they ruled.

By the 9th century, it seems that the need for international trade was waning as regional trade gained importance.
Under Danish control, Dorestad became less significant. Trading had slowed and now was almost nonexistent. The mint was shut down when Hroerekr took control of the lands. As the settlement no longer held much economic or cultural significance.
From around 840, the threat of the Vikings receded, as a truce was reached. The Franks no longer needed the help of the Danes and began to look for ways to dispose of them. That created conflict between the Franks and the Danes as Hroerekr established a gang of men to attack the coast.

In 846, Dorestad and two other settlements were plundered once again. While Frankish defence was organized, that did not stop the Danes from capturing Dorestad and a large portion of the Frisian Coast in 850.

According to Forte, Oram, and Pedersen, Dorestad, &quot;...despite the slaughter and sack of the 830s seems quickly to have recovered its prosperity after each episode, and its disappearance in the 860s was a consequence of a shift in the course of the river channel along which its trade flowed rather than a result of Viking raids.&quot;

The site remained uninhabited from the later 9th until the construction of a keep, the nucleus of Duurstede Castle, in around 1270, about 800 m south of the old settlement. 
The modern settlement of Wijk bij Duurstede grew up around the castle, gaining city rights in 1300.

==Location==
Dorestad grew to be a lively trade city (&quot;emporium&quot;) because of its location at the crossing of two important river trade routes. Along one route, Dorestad was connected to the Dutch mudflats and Frisian area in the north of the Netherlands via the Kromme Rijn, the Utrechtse Vecht and the Almere Lake. It was a connection of the German Rhineland via the Rhine with Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea. The second trade route ran from the Lek to the west coast and formed the connection between the Rhineland and England. This route could also be used to reach the Scheldt river, through which Neustria could be reached.

==Vikings==

Because of its wealth and success as a trade centre, Dorestad got the attention of Vikings in the 9th century. This resulted in large groups of Vikings attacking and looting the city. The first attack took place in 834 and the last attack in 863.

The Danish King Sigfred felt threatened by the advancement of the Franks under the leadership of Charlemagne. Charlemagne&#x27;s attempt to subject the Saxons east of the Elbe by annexing Nordalbingia led to a feud between the factions of Halfdan and Godfred, two supposed sons of Sigfred. The throne of Denmark was briefly under control of the son of Halfdan, Harald Klak, but he was driven away by the sons of Godfred.

The eldest son of Louis the Pious, Lothair, made use of the services provided by the Danish clan of the former King Harald Klak, who fled to Francia in 814. Harald was a vassal of King Louis with a place in Saxony. In the year 819 Harald became one of multiple kings in Denmark by the hand of Louis&#x27; negotiations with the Danes. In 826 Harald and his clan were baptised in Mainz, after which he received the East-Frisian county Rüstringen, of which the Gaus Östringen, Wangerland, Harlingerland and a part of Norderland may have consisted. Harald was driven from Denmark and spent his last 25 years of his life in the county.

When Lothair got in a feud with his father Louis over his reassignment of the Empire in 829, he gave orders to Harald the Younger, the nephew of Harald Klak, to make Frisia an unviable asset to King Louis by means of making crucial trade routes unsafe to travel and burning Dorestad to the ground. This would stagnate the transport of goods to the main areas of Francia, therefore forcing Louis to admit to the demands of Lothair. This resulted in Dorestad undergoing many attacks and lootings until Louis and Lothair came to terms in Worms in 839. Frisia got divided between Lothair and his half-brother Charles the Bald, where the river Meuse became the border. Lothair gave Dorestad to Harald the Younger and his brother Rorik. With the Treaty of Verdun in 843 the feud between the brothers ended and the Empire got divided once again, and Lothair got to rule over all of Frisia north of the Schelde, which became part of Middle Francia.

After the death of Louis the Pious in 840 a new feud developed between his three sons, but over in Frisia, Lothair had a strong position because of the Danish Warlords that were situated in Rüstringen, Dorestad and Walcheren. The devastating effects of the civil wars were much worse than that of the &#x27;modest&#x27; Viking attacks. The Frisians and Danes got along well, and went as far as to exchange goods. Frisia stayed related to the Heathen Baltic Sea culture, and felt threatened and repressed by the centralized way of leadership and the Christian beliefs. The Frisians did not defend Walcheren when the Danes attacked in 837. The Frisian count Gerulf I of Frisia in Westergo was accused of neglect, but regained his possessions in 839.

 One of the most famous archaeological finds in the Netherlands is the (see image). It was found in an old well in Dorestad in 1969. The valuable piece of jewellery may have been placed in the well to protect it from danger, for example the attacks of the Vikings on Dorestad.

==Excavation==
To find out more about the settlement and its prominence in the early Middle Ages the site was excavated. Some excavations took place in the middle of the nineteenth century and the finds from them are now in the National Museum of Antiquities and the British Museum. The most important findings were discovered during an excavation that took place between 1967 and 1977. About 30 hectare were exposed during the excavation and much was learned about the physical parameters of the settlement. It was discovered Dorestad was situated one mile north of Wijk bij Duurstede and was approximately 3 square kilometres in size. This is considered a large settlement for the time period.

It is believed that the settlement was separated into three districts: a harbour (&quot;Lower town&quot;), a trading centre located on the left bank (&quot;Upper town&quot;), and an agricultural area located further inland. Upper and lower town were connected by a single road which acted as the &#x27;backbone&#x27; of the town. The remnants of this road can still be seen today.

Only the &quot;lower town&quot; was excavated by archaeologists as much of Dorestad was eroded away by the river bend. When the harbour was excavated the remains of wooden causeways which would have allowed for easy unloading of goods were discovered. These findings correlate to the development of trade on the Rhine. It is believed that wine from the vineyards South of Mainz was one of the most prominent products traded in Dorestad. Old wine barrels have been excavated in Dorestad. It is also thought that glassware and lava querns for grinding corn were also transported to Dorestad for trading. The existence of these imports allowed Dorestad&#x27;s economy to grow substantially.

While the &quot;upper town&quot; was never excavated, the soil of the site has been examined and tested positive for phosphates that confirm its existence. Some Carolingian artefacts have been found over the years in the trading centre; however, the majority of items discovered date back to the Roman fortress that was established prior to the 7th Century. This may be because the residents of Dorestad used the tufa blocks from the Roman fortress as building material. It is thought that the royal administrators were situated in the Upper Town.

The Christian church was granted a piece of land in both the Upper and Lower Town. Next to the agricultural sector remains of a building were found as well as many graves. It is assumed that this area comprised the Lower church.

The conception of the Upper and Lower township is supported not only by archaeological evidence, but a poem was discovered by the English clergyman Alcuin, written at the end of the 8th century, referring to the town as &quot;Dorstada&quot; which is a pluralization of the name.

:Hinc tua vela leva, fugiens Dorstada relinque:
:Non tibi forte niger Hrotberct parat hospita tecta,
:Nec amat ecce tuum carmen mercator avarus.

:Hoist your sails, flee and leave behind the (towns of) Dorestad:
:You do not have the fortune of a hospitable roof offered by Black Hrotberct,
:Nor does the greedy merchant love your poem.

<text>Oshawa is a city in Ontario, Canada, on the Lake Ontario shoreline. It lies in Southern Ontario, approximately east of downtown Toronto. It is commonly viewed as the eastern anchor of the Greater Toronto Area and of the Golden Horseshoe. It is the largest municipality in the Regional Municipality of Durham. The name Oshawa originates from the Ojibwa term &quot;aazhawe&quot;, meaning &quot;the crossing place&quot; or just &quot;a cross&quot;.

Founded in 1876 as the McLaughlin Carriage Company by Robert McLaughlin, and then McLaughlin Motors Ltd by his son, Sam, General Motors of Canada&#x27;s headquarters are located in the city. The automotive industry was the inspiration for Oshawa&#x27;s previous mottos: &quot;The City that Motovates Canada&quot;, and &quot;The City in Motion&quot;. The lavish home of the automotive company&#x27;s founder, Parkwood Estate, is a National Historic Site of Canada is located in the city.

Once recognized as the sole &quot;Automotive Capital of Canada&quot;, Oshawa is now considered to be an education and health sciences hub, although General Motors still plays a significant role in the city&#x27;s economy. After having been closed for about 2 years, the Oshawa car assembly plant reopened on 10 November 2021, when the first Canadian-made Chevy Silverado was completed. GM invested C$1.3bn into plant retooling. Prior to reopening, GM said that the site would continue to be used for autonomous vehicle testing and production of vehicle stampings and other sub-assemblies.

The city is home to three post-secondary institutions, including Durham College, Trent University Durham, and Ontario Tech University, formerly the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). The Lakeridge Health Oshawa operates the Lakeridge Health Education and Research Network (LHEARN) in Oshawa as well. Key labour force sectors include advanced manufacturing, health technology, logistics, energy and IT. In 2016, Oshawa was the sixth best place in Canada to find full-time employment based on data from StatsCan.

Downtown Oshawa is identified as an Urban Growth Centre in the Government of Ontario&#x27;s Places to Grow initiative. More than 5,000 people work and more than 2,400 university students study in the downtown core. The downtown is a prominent centre for entertainment and sporting events (Regent Theatre and Tribute Communities Centre), food (50+ restaurants and cafes) and culture (The Robert McLaughlin Gallery and Canadian Automotive Museum). Oshawa is home to a Regional Innovation Centre and offers start-up facilities for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Co-working offices are also located in the downtown.

==History==
Historians believe that the area that would become Oshawa began as a transfer point for the fur trade. Beaver and other animals trapped for their pelts by local natives were traded with the coureurs des bois (voyagers). Furs were loaded onto canoes by the Mississauga Natives at the Oshawa harbour and transported to the trading posts located to the west at the mouth of the Credit River. Around 1760, the French constructed a trading post near the harbour. This location was abandoned after a few years, but its ruins provided shelter for the first residents of what later became Oshawa. Most notably, one of the fur traders was Moody Farewell, an early resident of the community who was to some extent responsible for its name change.

In the late 18th century a local resident, Roger Conant, started an export business shipping salmon to the United States. His success attracted further migration into the region. A large number of the founding immigrants were United Empire Loyalists, who left the United States to continue to live under British rule. Later, Irish and then French Canadian immigration increased as did industrialization. Oshawa and the surrounding Ontario County were also the settling grounds of a disproportionate number of 19th century Cornish immigrants during the Cornish emigration which emptied large tracts of that part of England. As well, the surveys ordered by Governor John Graves Simcoe, and the subsequent land grants, helped populate the area. When Col. Asa Danforth laid out his York-to-Kingston road, it passed through what would later become Oshawa.

In 1822, a &quot;colonization road&quot; (a north–south road to facilitate settlement) known as Simcoe Street was constructed. It more or less followed the path of an old native trail known as the Nonquon Road, and ran from the harbour to the area of Lake Scugog. This intersected the &quot;Kingston Road&quot; (present-day King Street) at what would become Oshawa&#x27;s &quot;Four Corners.&quot; In 1836, Edward Skae relocated his general store approximately 800 m east to the southeast corner of this intersection; as his store became a popular meeting place (probably because it also served as the Post Office), the corner and the growing settlement that surrounded it were known as Skae&#x27;s Corners. In 1842, Skae, the postmaster, applied for official post office status, but was informed the community needed a better name. Moody Farewell was requested to ask his native acquaintances what they called the area; their reply was &quot;Oshawa,&quot; which translates to &quot;where we must leave our canoes&quot;. Thus, the name of Oshawa, one of the primary &quot;motor cities&quot; of Canada, has the meaning &quot;where we have to get out and walk&quot;. The name &quot;Oshawa&quot; was adopted and the post office named accordingly. In 1849, the requirements for incorporation were eased, and Oshawa was incorporated as a village in 1850.
The 1846 Gazeteer indicates a population of about 1,000 in a community surrounded by farms. There were three churches, a post office, tradesmen of various types and some industry: a foundry, a grist mill and a fulling mill, a brewery, two distilleries, a machine shop and four cabinet makers.

The newly established village became an industrial centre, and implement works, tanneries, asheries and wagon factories opened (and often closed shortly after, as economic &quot;panics&quot; occurred regularly). In 1878, Robert Samuel McLaughlin Sr. moved his carriage works to Oshawa from Enniskillen to take advantage of its harbour and of the availability of a rail link not too far away. He constructed a two-story building on Simcoe Street, just north of the King&#x27;s Highway. This building was heavily remodelled in 1929, receiving a new facade and being extended to the north using land where the city&#x27;s &quot;gaol&quot; (jail, firehall and townhall) had once stood. The village became a town in 1879, in what was then called East Whitby Township. Around 1890, the carriage works relocated from its Simcoe Street address to an unused furniture factory a couple of blocks to the northeast, and this remained its site until the building burned down in 1899. Offered assistance by the town, McLaughlin chose to stay in Oshawa, building a new factory across Mary Street from the old site. Rail service had been provided in 1890 by the Oshawa Railway; this was originally set up as a streetcar line, but c. 1910 a second &quot;freight line&quot; was built slightly to the east of Simcoe Street. This electric line provided streetcar and freight service, connected central Oshawa with the Grand Trunk (now Canadian National) Railway, and with the Canadian Northern (which ran through the very north of Oshawa) and the Canadian Pacific, built in 1912–13. The Oshawa Railway was acquired by the Grand Trunk operation around 1910, and streetcar service was replaced by buses in 1940. After GM moved its main plants to south Oshawa in 1951, freight traffic fell and most of the tracks were removed in 1963, although a line to the older remaining &quot;north&quot; plant via Ritson Road remained until 2000.

===Start of the automotive industry===

Col. R. S. McLaughlin and &quot;Billy&quot; Durant signed a 15-year contract in 1907, under which the McLaughlin Motor Car Company began to manufacture automobiles under the McLaughlin name, using Buick engines and other mechanical parts. 1908 Buick was merged into General Motors Holding shortly after, and in 1915 the firm acquired the manufacturing rights to the Chevrolet brand. Within three years, the McLaughlin Motor Car Company and the Chevrolet Motor Car Company of Canada owned the General Motors Holding in 1916 he in 1918 merged his Chevrolet and Buick, creating General Motors of Canada in 1918 with McLaughlin as President. The factory expanded rapidly, eventually covering several blocks. The growing usage of the automobile in the 1920s generated rapid expansion of Oshawa, which grew in population from 4,000 to 16,000 during this decade, and of its land area. In 1924, Oshawa annexed the area to its south, including the harbour and the community of Cedardale. This growth allowed Oshawa to seek incorporation as a city, which took place on 8 March 1924.

With the wealth he gained in his business venture, between 1915 and 1917, McLaughlin built one of the most stately homes in Canada, &quot;Parkwood&quot;. The 55-room residence was initially designed by Toronto architect firm Darling and Pearson as well as John M. Lyle in the late 1930s. McLaughlin lived in the house for 55 years with his wife and they raised five daughters. The house replaced an older mansion, which was about 30 years old when it was demolished; the grounds of the earlier home had been operated as Prospect Park, and this land was acquired by the town and became its first municipal park, Alexandra Park. Parkwood today is open to the public as a National Historic Site. Tours are offered.

===Strike: 1937===
On 8 April 1937, disputes between 4,000 assembly line workers and General Motors management led to the Oshawa Strike, a salient event in the history of Canadian trade unionism. As the weight of the Great Depression slowly began to lift, demand for automobiles again began to grow. The workers sought higher wages, an eight-hour workday, better working conditions and recognition of their union, the United Auto Workers (Local 222). The then-Liberal government of Mitchell Hepburn, which had been elected on a platform of being the working man&#x27;s friend, sided with the corporation and brought in armed university students to break up any union agitation. These much-derided &quot;Hepburn&#x27;s Hussars&quot; and &quot;Sons of Bitches&quot; were never needed as the union refused to be drawn into violent acts. The union and workers had the backing of the local population, other unions and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party and, on 23 April, two weeks after the strike started, the company gave in to most of the workers&#x27; demands, although it pointedly did not recognize the union.

===Post-war===
In 1950, the city annexed a portion of East Whitby Township west of Park Road. Some of this area had been developed during the 1920s boom period, although it was not within the boundaries of the city. The opening of the Oshawa Shopping Centre (now the Oshawa Centre) fewer than two kilometres west of the &quot;four corners&quot; in 1956 struck a blow to Oshawa&#x27;s downtown from which it has never been able to recover. The shopping centre was built on land which had been an unproductive farm; when its owner gave up on agriculture, this released a very large area of land for the construction of a mall. The opening of what later became Highway 401, then known as Highway 2A, shortly after World War II sparked increased residential growth in Oshawa and the other lakeshore municipalities of Ontario County, which led to the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham in 1974. Oshawa was amalgamated with the remaining portions of East Whitby Township and took on its present boundaries, which included the outlying villages of Columbus, Raglan and Kedron. Much of Oshawa&#x27;s industry has closed over the years; however, it is still the headquarters of GM Canada and its major manufacturing site. Current industries of note include manufacturing of railway maintenance equipment, mining equipment, steel fabrication, and rubber products. Oshawa is also recognized as an official port of entry for immigration and customs services.

==Climate==
Similar to all of southern Ontario, Oshawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with vast, but not extreme, seasonal temperature differences. Summers are generally warm, while winters are cold, but not extreme by Canadian standards. Oshawa receives one of the lowest yearly snowfall totals in all of Ontario.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Oshawa had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Oshawa CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
Oshawa is headquarters to General Motors Canada, which has large-scale manufacturing and administrative operations in the city and employs many thousands both directly and indirectly. Since Windsor, Ontario houses Chrysler Canada headquarters, the two cities have something of a friendly rivalry for the title of &quot;Automotive Capital of Canada&quot;, which is now held by Oshawa. While the company&#x27;s once essential role in the local economy has diminished, it remains the largest local employer. In November 2018, General Motors announced the closing of the plant, with the layoff of both salaried and hourly workers. On 20 December 2018 the last car was assembled at the Oshawa plant. On 4 November 2020, GM announced &quot;Subject to ratification of the 2020 agreement with Unifor, General Motors plans to bring pickup production back to the Oshawa Assembly Plant. Construction will begin immediately at Oshawa Assembly and will include a new body shop and flexible assembly module, to support a fast response to strong customer demand for GM&#x27;s new family of pickup trucks. Oshawa pickup production started on 10 November 2021 when the first Canadian-made Silverado was completed.

The revenue collection divisions of the Ontario Ministry of Finance occupy one of the main office buildings in the city&#x27;s downtown. Oshawa City Hall, Tribute Communities Centre, The Robert McLaughlin Gallery are also in the downtown core. Ontario Tech University occupies five buildings in downtown. More than 1,900 Ontario Tech University students and staff attend class and work in downtown Oshawa.

The city&#x27;s older southern neighbourhoods tend to be considerably less affluent than its more suburban northern sections, which are rapidly expanding as Toronto commuters move in. The southern half of the city consists of industrial zones and compact housing designed for early 20th century industrial workers, while the northern half has a suburban feel more typical of later decades. High wages paid to unionized GM employees have meant that these workers could enjoy a relatively high standard of living, although such jobs are much scarcer today than they once were. During its heyday after World War II, General Motors offered some of the best manufacturing jobs available in Canada and attracted thousands of workers from economically depressed areas of the country, particularly the Maritimes, Newfoundland, rural Quebec and northern Ontario. The city was also a magnet for European immigrants in the skilled trades, and boasts substantial Polish, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Croatian, German, Slovak and Russian ethnic communities.

Oshawa has become one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada, although statements to this effect are often in reference to the Census Metropolitan Area, which includes neighbouring Whitby and Clarington. Oshawa achieved a record-setting year of growth in 2015 with over a half a billion dollars in construction value (breaking its previous record in 2014). Many commuters have been enticed to Oshawa by comparatively low housing prices and the regular rail service into downtown Toronto provided by GO Transit and Via Rail.

The growth of subdivisions to house Toronto commuters will likely accelerate with the Highway 407 East extension. Highway 407 East (407E) opened to Harmony Road in Oshawa on 20 June 2016, including a tolled north–south link to Highway 401 known as Highway 412. The Highway 407 extension to Highway 35/Highway 115 in Clarington was opened on 9 December 2019, with a second tolled link to Highway 401 known as Highway 418 opened simultaneously. On 5 April 2022, Highways 412 and 418 became toll-free.
In spring 2016, Oshawa was ranked No. 1 city for jobs in Canada when compared to 33 cities across the country. The trend suggests major social and demographic changes for Oshawa, which has long had a vigorous labour union presence, a mostly white demographic, and a largely blue collar identity.

The city has been attracting film and television producers who have made parts of a number of movies and TV series in Oshawa, most recently &quot;It&quot; (based on the Stephen King book), but also &quot;Billy Madison&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;X-Men&quot;. The most popular location in the city for film makers is Parkwood Estate.

==Politics==

The dominant presence of General Motors (and its autoworkers) meant that Oshawa was well known as a bastion of unionist, left-wing support during the decades following the Second World War. The city played an important role in Canada&#x27;s labour history, including the 1937 &quot;Oshawa Strike&quot; against General Motors and the considerable financial support provided by the city&#x27;s autoworkers to the New Democratic Party (NDP) and its predecessors.

However, Oshawa was part of the Ontario (County) riding when Michael Starr served. Starr was a high ranking Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) and Cabinet Member during the Diefenbaker era. Starr served the new Oshawa-Whitby riding for one term, before being narrowly defeated by future federal NDP leader Ed Broadbent in 1968. Broadbent then represented the city in the House of Commons until 1989, and in the 1980s led the NDP to its greatest electoral successes.

By the end of the 1990s, the city&#x27;s changing economy and demographics led many voters to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and the Canadian Alliance, a conservative party at the federal level. Conservative candidates have won recent provincial and federal elections, whereas from 1968 to 1993 the city was a safe NDP seat in both the federal and provincial legislatures.

The city&#x27;s shifting social and political dynamics were seen in the 2004 federal election the riding of Oshawa (not coterminous with the City of Oshawa, but containing most of it) was the country&#x27;s most competitive. The candidate of the new Conservative Party of Canada, Colin Carrie, edged out his NDP rival Sid Ryan by several hundred votes; it was an atypical and ideologically stark race that left Louise Parkes of the Liberals in third place.

In 2006, Whitby-Oshawa also became a Conservative seat Jim Flaherty followed Starr (after over 40 years) into the Cabinet of Canada as Minister of Finance.

In 2014, Jennifer French of the Ontario New Democratic Party was elected as Member of Provincial Parliament in the provincial riding of Oshawa with over 40% of the vote.

==Sports==

===Hockey===

Oshawa is home to the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League. In 2015, the Oshawa Generals won the Ontario Hockey League Championship, and ended their season winning the 2015 Memorial Cup.

Famous alumni of this team include Bobby Orr, Alex Delvecchio, Wayne Cashman, Tony Tanti, Dave Andreychuk, Marc Savard, Eric Lindros, and John Tavares. The team moved from the Oshawa Civic Auditorium into the new General Motors Centre in November 2006. In 2016 the city of Oshawa partnered with Tribute Communities for naming rights and the General Motors Centre was renamed the Tribute Communities Centre.

The Oshawa Generals&#x27; home arena has been destroyed by fire twice in the franchise history. In June 1928, the Bradley Arena was destroyed by fire. Then, 25 years later, in September 1953 the Hambly Arena was also destroyed by fire.

Oshawa hosted Ron MacLean and the Rogers Hometown Hockey Tour on 26–27 December 2015.

In September 2018, the city hosted its first National Hockey League preseason game, when the Buffalo Sabres and New York Islanders played an exhibition contest.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===


GO Transit trains connect the city with Toronto, Hamilton and points between. GO Transit buses provide service from Oshawa along the Highway 401 and Highway 2 corridors in Durham Region and to Toronto and York Region. GO Transit bus service is also provided from Oshawa Train station to Clarington and Peterborough via the downtown bus terminal. The Oshawa Station is owned by the national rail carrier Via Rail, which operates a service along the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. Other services from the station include GO Buses, and the regional transit system Durham Region Transit provides local bus service. It replaced Oshawa Transit on 1 January 2006.

The province announced in June 2016 an extension of the GO train service from Oshawa to Bowmanville, including extending the train network by nearly and building four new stations. The new GO rail service is expected to begin by 2023–24. The four new stations will be at Thornton Road in Oshawa, Ritson Road in Oshawa, Courtice Road in Courtice and Martin Road in Bowmanville.

Private intercity buses are provided by TOK Coachlines (formerly Can-ar Coach Service) daily to/from Lindsay and Toronto.

Rail freight is carried on the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways which traverse the city.

Other than Highway 2 (King and Bond Streets), which was downloaded in 1998, the city had no provincially maintained highways until the original section of Highway 401 opened in 1947 (as Highway 2A). The highway originally terminated at Ritson Road, and was extended east through the remainder of the city to Newcastle in 1952. Oshawa was the only city that Highway 401 was built directly through, rather than bypassing. This resulted in the demolition of several streets and hundreds of homes in the 1930s and 1940s.

Highway 407, a tolled 400-series highway, opened to Harmony Road in Oshawa on 20 June 2016, including a tolled north–south link to Highway 401 known as Highway 412. A recently completed segment east of the city opened in 2020, connecting to Highway 35 / Highway 115 in Clarington by 2020, with a second link to Highway 401 known as Highway 418.

The Port of Oshawa is a major stop for the auto and steel industries as well as winter road salt handling and agricultural fertilizer. A marine rescue unit (COMRA) is also stationed at the port. On 21 May 2009, Canadian Transportation Minister John Baird announced that the status of Oshawa&#x27;s port would be changed from a harbour commission to a full-fledged Port Authority. The creation of a federal port authority has caused some controversy as there are others who wish to see the port transferred to municipal ownership and recreational use.

Oshawa Executive Airport is a municipal airport owned by the city that operates all private general aviation and charter services for eastern Toronto, with customs and immigration officers on-site. Oshawa Executive does not offer any scheduled airline services. The closest international airports with scheduled service is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located west by road in Mississauga or Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport in downtown Toronto.

===Health care===
Oshawa is the site of Lakeridge Health Oshawa, formerly Oshawa General Hospital. Lakeridge Health is one of Ontario&#x27;s largest community hospitals. The facility also houses the RS. McLaughlin Durham Regional Cancer Centre.

LHEARN is the academic home for Queen&#x27;s University family physician residency program and for pediatric residency and training. LHEARN Centre provides training and testing medical professionals, including doctors, nurses and first responders (including Ornge critical care air ambulance paramedics).

Oshawa is also home to the Oshawa Clinic, the largest, multi-specialty medical group practice in Canada.

On 24 April 2020, General Motors Canada reopened the city&#x27;s local plant in order to manufacture Personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients infected with COVID-19 during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.

===Emergency services===
Policing in Oshawa is provided by the Durham Regional Police Service. There are two police stations in Oshawa one at 77 Centre Street North in the downtown area, and a South Oshawa Community Policing Centre on Cedar Street. EMS/Ambulance services are also operated by the Region of Durham. Oshawa Fire Services operated by the city operates from six fire stations located throughout the city.

Oshawa was the first city in Ontario to provide paramedic services. In 1979, 16 ambulance attendants were given specialized training to treat cardiac related problems in the pre-hospital setting. The program was called the Pre-hospital Cardiac Care (PHCC) program. From this single service, paramedic training was expanded to Toronto, Hamilton and the Provincial air ambulance service. The program has been the source of all paramedic programs in Ontario.

==Education==
Public education in Oshawa is provided by the Durham District School Board. As of June 2015, there were 28 elementary schools and six secondary schools. The Durham Catholic District School Board, which has its headquarters in Oshawa, oversees public Catholic education in Durham Region. There are 11 Catholic elementary schools and two secondary schools. The Conseil scolaire Viamonde operates one French public elementary school, while the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud runs one publicly funded French-language Catholic elementary school. Private schools include Durham Elementary School, Immanuel Christian School, Kingsway College and College Park Elementary School.

Oshawa is home to 22,000 full-time students studying at three post-secondary institutions Durham College, Trent University Durham and University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT). Oshawa is a Community Teaching Site for Queen&#x27;s University School of Medicine at Lakeridge Health.

The main campus of Durham College is located in the city. The college has grown and expanded since it opened in 1967 and now offers more than 140 full-time programs.

The University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) opened in 2003. Given the city&#x27;s industrial heritage, the university&#x27;s courses emphasize technology, manufacturing and engineering themes. UOIT has ten buildings at two stand-alone campus locations (north Oshawa and Downtown Oshawa) and houses more than 70 specialized research laboratories and research facilities. It is the only university in Canada to offer a degree program in Automotive Engineering.

Trent University Durham has a long history in Oshawa. In 2010, the university opened a stand-alone campus in Oshawa (beside the Oshawa Civic Recreation Complex).

==Media==
Oshawa has few media outlets of its own due to its proximity to Toronto. The city has one AM station, CKDO (1580), which is rebroadcast on 107.7 FM, and one FM station, 94.9 CKGE. Both stations are owned by Durham Radio, which also owns CJKX, which is licensed to the nearby community of Ajax, although all three stations are operated from the same studios at the Oshawa Executive Airport. CKDO has officially been licensed as a clear-channel station since 2006 and is the only full-power station in Canada on 1580 kHz it nonetheless operates at a fifth of the usual power of a clear-channel outlet with a directional signal that is pointed away from the United States.

Oshawa has a Global O&amp;O station, CHEX-TV-2 (Channel 12), which is a sister station of Peterborough&#x27;s CHEX-DT. It airs a daily supper hour news and current affairs program targeted to Durham Region viewers. Although a larger city than Peterborough then and now, Oshawa was not granted a television station in the original 1950s assignments as it was geographically too close to Toronto, since the original spacings were nominally set at . Rogers Cable, the local cable television service provider, operates Rogers TV: a community channel with local television programming for cable subscribers.

Oshawa is served by several community newspapers, including the &quot;Oshawa Express&quot;, an independent which is published every Wednesday, and &quot;Oshawa This Week&quot;, published two times per week by Metroland. The long-standing daily newspaper, the &quot;Oshawa Times&quot; (also known at various times as the &quot;Oshawa Daily Times&quot; and &quot;Times-Gazette&quot;), was closed by its owner Thomson Newspapers, after a lengthy strike in 1994.

John Short Larke was the proprietor of the &quot;Oshawa Vindicator&quot;, a strongly pro-Conservative newspaper, in the late 19th century.

Oshawa is home to &quot;Artsforum Magazine&quot;, a not-for-profit magazine of arts and ideas launched in Fall 2000 by John Arkelian, its publisher and editor-in-chief. Topics in the magazine range from foreign policy to film.

In the latter, his brother Michael played the character &quot;God&quot; in several episodes. While scouting a location for a film, Buscemi visited the Philadelphia Eastern State Penitentiary and found the building so interesting that he later provided the majority of the narration for the audio tour there.
== Reception and image ==
In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Buscemi was adamant about not altering his misaligned teeth, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve had dentists who have wanted to help me out, but I say, &#x27;You know, I won&#x27;t work again if you fix my teeth. Buscemi is noted for wrinkles around his eyes, giving them an aged appearance. &quot;Buscemi eyes&quot; describes the result when his eyes are photo-edited onto others&#x27; faces. He has stated that although he did not find this amusing, his wife Jo Andres did.

The author Eiichiro Oda was inspired by Mr. Pink, Buscemi&#x27;s character in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992), when creating one of the primary characters (Vinsmoke Sanji) for his manga &quot;One Piece&quot;.

Buscemi guest-starred in season 6 episode 8 of &quot;30 Rock&quot; as a private investigator. Playing against his image, during a flashback he appears to be disguised as a teenager as he says that he was &quot;part of a special task force of very young-looking cops who infiltrated high schools&quot;. His character&#x27;s disguise and quote of &quot;how do you do, fellow kids?&quot; became an internet meme.

The 1999 song &quot;Hey Leonardo&quot; by Blessid Union of Souls referenced Buscemi as &quot;that guy who played in &quot;Fargo&quot;…I think his name is Steve.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Buscemi grew up pronouncing his name as , in an anglicised way. In Sicily, where his ancestors are from, it is pronounced as . He once quipped, &quot;I had to go to Sicily to find out I pronounce my name wrong.&quot;

Buscemi married Jo Andres in 1987; they were married until her death on January 6, 2019. They had one son named Lucian (b. 1990).

Buscemi was stabbed multiple times in April 2001 at the Firebelly Lounge in Wilmington, North Carolina, while shooting the film &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot;. He had intervened in a bar fight between Vince Vaughn, Scott Rosenberg, and two local men. He was released from the hospital after treatment.

Buscemi is a noted fan of the musical group Beastie Boys. He appears in the music video for the band&#x27;s 2011 song &quot;Make Some Noise&quot;, which was nominated for MTV Video of the Year. He also has a post-credit scene in the Spike Jonze–directed documentary &quot;Beastie Boys Story&quot; in which he pokes fun at the commercial failure of the group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;; &quot;When the tree fell in the forest, nobody heard that shit,&quot; jokes Buscemi. Buscemi sang in &quot;The Broadway Song&quot; for Lou Reed&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;The Raven&quot;.

Buscemi currently resides in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he was given the key to the city in 2021. He previously resided in Sunset Strip, Los Angeles.

On May 8, 2024, Buscemi was the victim of an unprovoked attack in Midtown Manhattan, New York, when he was punched in the face. The 66-year-old was taken to a nearby hospital with bruising, swelling and bleeding to his left eye. His publicist said later in a statement that Buscemi had recovered from the attack.

===Firefighter===
Buscemi was a firefighter from 1980 to 1984, with the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Company No. 55, in Little Italy, Manhattan, while secretly taking acting classes and dabbling in stand-up on the side. The day after the September 11 attacks in New York, he returned to his old firehouse to volunteer; he worked twelve-hour shifts for a week, digging through rubble to search for missing firefighters. On May 25, 2003, Buscemi was arrested with nineteen other people while protesting the closing of a number of firehouses, including Engine 55. In the middle of 2011, Buscemi joined rallies against the threat of closing eight Brooklyn firehouses during the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He argued that closing these firehouses &quot;is no way to protect New York.&quot;

In 2014, Buscemi starred in and narrated the HBO documentary &quot;A Good Job: Stories of the FDNY&quot;, in which he revisited his work with fellow firefighters, sharing their stories, including those from September 11.

In 2021, Buscemi spoke to podcast host Marc Maron about his issues with PTSD, a consequence of the five days he spent volunteering in the aftermath of 9/11. He served as executive producer of the documentary &quot;Dust: The Lingering Legacy of 9/11&quot;, which discussed the continuing toxic health effects of dust from the collapsed towers that many people, especially firefighters, have experienced.

<text>Owen Sound (2021 Census population 21,612) is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The seat of government of Grey County, it is located at the mouths of the Pottawatomi and Sydenham Rivers on an inlet of Georgian Bay.

The primary tourist attractions are the many waterfalls within a short drive of the town.

==History==

The area around the upper Great Lakes has been home to the Ojibwe people since prehistory. In 1815, William Fitzwilliam Owen surveyed the area and named the inlet after his older brother Admiral Edward Owen. The name of the area in Ojibwe language is &quot;Gchi-wiigwedong&quot;.

A settlement called &quot;Sydenham&quot; was established in 1840 or 1841 by Charles Rankin in an area that had been inhabited by First Nations people. John Telfer settled here at that time and others followed. By 1846, the population was 150 and a sawmill and gristmill were operating. The name Sydenham continued even as the community became the seat for Grey County in 1852.

An Ontario historical plaque explains that a First Nations Band, led by Chief Newash had a reserve in the area totalling about . In 1842, they established the village of Newash which initially contained fourteen log houses, a school and a barn; the population was served by Wesleyan Methodist missionaries. In 1857, the government took over the reserve area and moved most of the Chippewa inhabitants of Newash to the Cape Croker Hunting Ground 60B reserve north of Owen Sound.

Over the years, Owen Sound was a major port best known for its taverns and brothels. The community acquired names as the Chicago of the North, Corkscrew City, and Little Liverpool because of its rowdy reputation. Supporting this reputation was a tavern named &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot;, located on the corner of an intersection known as &quot;Damnation Corners&quot;, because of taverns on all four corners, but this location was also only a block away from an intersection with four churches called &quot;Salvation Corners&quot;.

Sydenham was renamed Owen Sound in 1851; by then, it was served by a direct road to Toronto Township (today Mississauga), the Toronto-Sydenham Road; which still exists as Highway 10 and the southern portion of Hurontario Street. The community became an incorporated town in 1857, with a population of nearly 2000. In 1873, the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway from Weston arrived and allowed for shipping goods to and from the community. 

Louis&#x27; Steakhouse, a popular upscale restaurant just outside town, was opened by the Gavaris family in the 1980s in a historic building which changed hands several times before being demolished in 2016. It was originally a home (built in 1881), but became a brothel from 1907 to 1915, where the madam would stand in its castle-like tower and watch the port for a ship to come in, and she would ready her prostitutes to excite the sailors. This reputation for vice and villainy, and the problems that came with it, caused the city to ban all drinking establishments for several decades. The city was &quot;dry&quot; until 1972.
One of the city&#x27;s most famous sons was World War I flying ace and Victoria Cross winner, William Avery &quot;Billy&quot; Bishop, born in Owen Sound, and Canada&#x27;s leading pilot in the war. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force. In 1917 and 1918, Bishop was credited with downing 72 enemy aircraft. He was awarded the Victoria Cross, the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross. After the war, he was promoted to Air Marshall and worked as director of recruiting for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Bishop is also one of the few to have tangled with Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron) and survived, forcing the German pilot to retreat in a damaged aircraft. Bishop later recalled that it was a &quot;close shave, but a wonderful, soul-stirring flight.&quot; Bishop&#x27;s boyhood home, one of the National Historic Sites of Canada, is a museum with artifacts from his life.

The former Billy Bishop Regional Airport in the nearby Municipality of Meaford was named after him. His modest gravesite can be visited in the city&#x27;s Greenwood Cemetery by those willing to take the time to locate the stone. His boyhood home is now a museum dedicated to his life and to Canada&#x27;s aviation history. The town was also the home of National Hockey League (NHL) Hall of Fame goaltender Harry Lumley and the artist Tom Thomson (buried in the nearby village of Leith). Surgeon Norman Bethune, an avowed communist and pioneer of public medicine who gained notoriety in his innovative medical work with the Chinese army during the Second Sino-Japanese War, is an alumnus of the Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute. Legendary hockey broadcaster Bill Hewitt was once sports director of the local AM radio station, CFOS. Thomas William Holmes, another Victoria Cross winner, was also from Owen Sound, and the city&#x27;s armoury bears his name.

In 2005, Owen Sound became the National Communities in Bloom champion in the cities of 20,001–50,000 category in Canada for its beauty, natural landscape, and strong sense of community. Owen Sound has been recently recognized as a good retirement community due to its cultural, sports and natural amenities.

==Geography and climate==
Owen Sound experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) that is moderated by Lake Huron. Winters are cold and very snowy, while summers are warm and humid, but cooled by the lake waters (Georgian Bay and Lake Huron on either side) more than most other areas of southwestern Ontario. Precipitation is moderately high, as Owen Sound is in the direct line of the Great Lakes snowbelt, with an annual average precipitation of . Summer thunderstorms are a common occurrence.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Owen Sound was on July 3, 1911. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 6, 1895.

The Sydenham River is a waterway that connects to Owen Sound Bay and was formed from a pre-glacial river cutting into the limestone of the Niagara Escarpment.

==Culture and events==
The City of Owen Sound was a 2004 Cultural Capital of Canada and is home to a number of cultural events and facilities.

== Jail ==

The County of Grey opened a complex in 1854, including a courthouse and police services, a land registry office and a county jail. In 1960, the County of Grey moved the courthouse and land registry to another location at the edge of present-day Owen Sound, Ontario. At that time, March 11, 1960, the County of Grey and the City of Owen Sound signed a two-part agreement that was subsequently passed into bylaw. The first part required that the City of Owen Sound immediately purchase the courthouse portion of the complex. Part two of the agreement requires the City of Owen Sound to purchase the jail portion when the County of Grey no longer needs it for its own use. This occurred in 1978, when the province of Ontario transferred the county jails to provincial entities. The County of Grey and the City of Owen Sound escaped the latter part of the 1960 agreement to purchase the property by signing a 5-year renewable lease with the Province of Ontario and have profited greatly ever since. The County of Grey receives a monthly payment (approximately $12,000 as of 2011) for which they have no obligation to maintain the property; the City of Owen Sound kept the police services in the old courthouse until 1987/88 and then leased it to an arts council. In doing so, the jail lost all of their former entrances and moved all activities to the side of the jail, immediately beside the adjacent residence.

The jail was slated to close in 1996 and again in 2001 (the provincial jail system was overcrowded so prisoners were transferred to the smaller jails) and finally was closed down at the end of 2011, with the last three prisoners leaving by van on December 4, 2011 (3 pm). The jail was finally transferred firstly to the County of Grey (as the landlord) then to the City of Owen Sound, per the March 1960 agreement, in November 2014, after it was de-commissioned. As of March 4, 2018, the City of Owen Sound has been unable to find a purchaser, despite reducing the price from $249,000 for each portion (courthouse and jail) to the current price of $99,000 for the total property. Southbridge Properties did purchase the property for $1 in May 2015 with a clause allowing it to rescind the deal within the next four years if several conditions were not met—it backed out in March 2016. In the meantime, the property continues to deteriorate with complaints from the community regarding its safety and negative impact on property values. In August 2017, the City of Owen Sound put out inquiries for costs to demolish the jail portion, after putting the property on the real estate market for another six months. The deadline for offers on the property is March 5, 2018.

<text>Christian Legal Society (CLS) is a non-profit Christian organization headquartered in Virginia, United States. The organization consists of lawyers, judges, law professors, and law students. Its members are bound to follow the &quot;commandment of Jesus&quot; and to &quot;seek justice with the love of God.&quot;

==History ==
The organization was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1961 by four lawyers (Paul Bernard, Gerrit P. Groen, Henry Luke Brinks, and Elmer Johnson) who met to pray together at a 1959 convention of the American Bar Association.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the organization formed a Christian Conciliation Ministry, which later became Peacemaker Ministries and the Institute for Christian Conciliation. 

Currently, there are over 50 attorney chapters, 120 law school chapters, and 60 Christian legal aid clinics which are assigned to the organization. The Christian Legal Society is organized into three different branches: the network for attorneys and law students (Attorney Ministries and Law Student Ministries), the Center for Law &amp; Religious Freedom, and the Christian Legal Aid.

The Christian Legal Society holds an annual convention in the United States as well as various regional conferences. It also publishes a bi-annual magazine called &quot;The Christian Lawyer&quot;, a scholarly journal called &quot;The Journal of Christian Legal Thought&quot;, &quot;CLS Bible Studies&quot;, and &quot;CLS E-Devotionals&quot;. Its former publications include the &quot;Quarterly, The Defender, and the Religious Freedom Reporter.&quot;

=== Finances ===
CLS is a tax-exempt, non-profit organization, supported by dues, donations and gifts. Its donors include Alliance Defending Freedom who gave CLS over $420,000 in 2008.

== Membership ==
The organization&#x27;s members includes attorneys, judges, law students, and others who profess their commitment to the CLS Statement of Faith. These members, which are claimed to be found in 1100 cities, are organized into attorney chapters, law student chapters, and fellowships throughout the United States.

It is stated that to become a member of Christian Legal Society, one must &quot;believe in and sign&quot; CLS’ Statement of Faith.

=== Goals of the organization ===
Since its foundation in 1961, CLS has proclaimed nine organizational objectives, as set forth in its amended articles of incorporation:
* To proclaim Jesus as Lord through all that we do in the field of law and other disciplines;
* To provide a means of society, fellowship and nurture among Christian lawyers;
* To encourage Christian lawyers to view law as ministry;
* To clarify and promote the concept of the Christian lawyer and to help Christian lawyers integrate their faith with their professional lives;
* To mobilize, at the national and local levels, the resources needed to promote justice, religious liberty, the inalienable right to human life, and biblical conflict reconciliation
* To encourage, disciple and aid Christian students in preparing for the legal profession;
* To provide a forum for the discussion of problems and opportunities relating to Christianity and the law;
* To cooperate with bar associations and other organizations in asserting and maintaining high standards of legal ethics; and,
* To encourage lawyers to furnish legal services to the poor and needy, and grant special consideration to the legal needs of churches and other charitable organizations.

==Important legal cases==

=== University of Florida (2007) ===
On March 16, 2007, the Upsilon chapter at the University of Florida was officially recognized by the Beta Upsilon Chi (BYX) national board. The University of Florida, however, refused to recognize BYX. The university had refused to recognize the chapter as a registered student organization because the fraternity accepts only men and would not recognize the chapter as a social fraternity because the fraternity accepts only Christians.

On July 10, 2007, the Alliance Defense Fund Center for Academic Freedom and the Christian Legal Society filed suit (&quot;Beta Upsilon Chi Upsilon Chapter v. Machen, 586 F.3d 908, 911-912 (11th Cir. 2009)&quot;) on behalf of BYX against various officials from the University of Florida for various constitutional violations including unlawful discrimination. During the course of the proceedings, the 11th Circuit Court (United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on appeal from the Northern District of Florida, Leon County) ordered that the chapter be recognized pending the disposition of the appeal. The case was ultimately dismissed as moot when the university amended its policies to permit the registration of the chapter.

=== University of California, Hastings College of the Law (2010) ===
Their case &quot;Christian Legal Society v. Martinez&quot; reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 2010. It was argued on April 19, 2010 and decided June 28, 2010 against the CLS by a vote of 5-4. The court upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, the policy of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law governing official recognition of student groups, which required the groups to accept all students regardless of their status or beliefs in order to obtain recognition.

<doc id="180499" wikidata="Q287137" url="?curid=180499" title="University Challenge">
<text>University Challenge is a British television quiz programme which first aired in 1962. &quot;University Challenge&quot; aired for 913 episodes on ITV from 21 September 1962 to 31 December 1987, presented by quizmaster Bamber Gascoigne. The BBC revived the programme on 21 September 1994, the programme&#x27;s 32nd anniversary, with Jeremy Paxman as the quizmaster. Paxman relinquished his role as host following the conclusion of the 52nd series in 2023, and was succeeded by Amol Rajan.

The current title holders are Imperial College London, who won a record fifth title in the final of the 2023-24 series on 8 April 2024. On 21 April 2023, the BBC unveiled a new set and title card, which debuted on Rajan&#x27;s first episode, aired on 17 July 2023.

The show has always been produced by the same company (originally named Granada Television, renamed ITV Studios in 2009 and renamed again Lifted Entertainment in 2021), under licence from Richard Reid Productions and the College Bowl Company. It was recorded at Granada Studios in Manchester from its inception until the studios closed in 2013; it is now recorded at Dock10 studios in Salford.

==History==
===Format continuity===
Despite periodic changes to the sets, studio layout, and presentation, &quot;University Challenge&quot; has preserved a high level of continuity from 1962 to the present. Some commentators have cited this as an essential element of its success. Elements of this continuity include:
*The longevity of its quizmasters, with only three presenters in the programme&#x27;s history;
*The split-screen presentation during the starter question phase, which appears to place one team physically above the other. In the final years of the original Bamber Gascoigne era, the studio set genuinely was two-tiered, although the split-screen effect returned for the revived series and has been used ever since;
*Long serving voiceover announcers, with only three in the programme&#x27;s history – Don Murray-Henderson from 1962 until his death in 1971, then Jim Pope until his death in 2001, then Roger Tilling. Tilling&#x27;s delivery typically becomes increasingly high-pitched as the episode progresses;
*The theme tune &quot;College Boy&quot; by Derek New, which has been with the series since the 1960s (although the first series used &quot;Ting A Ling&quot; by Duke Ellington). &quot;College Boy&quot; was originally scored for an ensemble of tubular bells, flugelhorn, harpsichord, brushed hi-hat, bass drum and double bass. The original theme returned for the early Paxman-era episodes and was later replaced by a string quartet arrangement of the theme recorded by the Balanescu Quartet.

===ITV (1962 to 1987)===

The programme had its beginnings in an American television quiz show called &quot;College Bowl&quot;. Cecil Bernstein, brother of Sidney Bernstein who founded Granada Television in 1954, had seen the programme in the United States and liked the format. It was decided that Granada would produce a similar programme with competing teams from universities across the United Kingdom. From its inception in 1962, &quot;University Challenge&quot; was hosted by Bamber Gascoigne, who died in 2022. The programme&#x27;s first match was a match between the University of Leeds (featuring a pre-famed Ian Channell, better known as The Wizard of New Zealand) and the University of Reading. The show was a cult favourite with a small but loyal core audience, and was one of a select few ITV programmes that was transmitted without any advertising breaks. Originally, the series started off in many areas, being broadcast at peak times or just after the nightly news around 22:30; by the early 1970s, the series was relegated to irregular timeslots by the various ITV regional companies, with some broadcasting the show during daytime, at weekends or late at night. In the absence of a regular networked slot, audience figures would often fall, leading the producers to make changes to the long-standing format of the programme. LWT stopped broadcasting the show in October 1983, with Thames following suit shortly afterwards. Thames resumed screening the series in 1984 however they only screened the Quarter-finals To the final in December 1984, when it was networked for the first time. 

The programme was not broadcast in 1985 and returned in April 1986, when it continued to networked by ITV and broadcast at 15:00 on weekdays. The gameplay was revised, initial games were staged over two legs; the first in the classic format and the second played as a relay, where contestants selected questions from specific categories such as sport, literature and science, passing a baton between players whenever a &quot;lap&quot; of two correct answers was scored. The final series was also networked, but broadcast around 11:00 during the summer holiday period. Even so, the new networked time did little to save the series from the axe. The last ITV series was broadcast in 1987.

The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge could each enter up to five of their constituent colleges as separate teams, which are not themselves universities: they have far fewer students – numbering in the hundreds rather than thousands – than most universities. This was one ostensible inspiration for a 1975 protest, in which a team from the University of Manchester (which included David Aaronovitch) came second to Downing College, Cambridge, when they started a round by answering every question &quot;Che Guevara&quot;, &quot;Marx&quot;, &quot;Trotsky&quot; or &quot;Lenin&quot;, in the hope of making the resulting show unbroadcastable.
It was, however, broadcast, although only portions of the episode still exist in the Granada Television archives. Granada subsequently banned the University of Manchester for several years.

===BBC===


&quot;University Challenge&quot; was revived by the BBC in 1994, although still produced by Granada Television (branded since 2009 as ITV Studios), using the original format, with minor differences, and presented by Jeremy Paxman.

During the show&#x27;s hiatus, a special edition of the show was made by the BBC, as part of a themed evening of programmes dedicated to Granada Television. It was presented by Bamber Gascoigne and broadcast on BBC2 on 28 December 1992. The teams included one of students from Keble College, Oxford, which had fielded the winning team in the final 1987 season, and a graduates team of celebrity alumni who had previously appeared on the programme as students, including journalist John Simpson and actor Stephen Fry. This show was preceded by a short documentary about the show&#x27;s history. Bamber Gascoigne&#x27;s final appearance as host was in &quot;Universe Challenge&quot; in 1998 (see below).

Paxman relinquished his role as host following the conclusion of the 52nd series in 2023, after which he was succeeded by Amol Rajan. In October 2022, an ITV documentary, &quot;Paxman: Putting Up With Parkinson&#x27;s&quot;, explored how Parkinson&#x27;s disease has impacted him and revealed that Paxman recorded his last episode of &quot;University Challenge&quot; on 15 October 2022, which aired on 29 May 2023.

On 21 April 2023, the BBC unveiled a new set and title card, which debuted on Rajan&#x27;s first episode, which aired on 17 July 2023.

====Postgraduates====
Since its revival in 1994, the programme has featured a number of teams of postgraduate and mature students, whose participation has been criticised. The Open University won the 1999 series with a team with an average age of 46. In the quarter-final, they narrowly beat a slightly younger team from part-time and mature student specialist Birkbeck, University of London. Birkbeck won the competition in 2003, also with a substantially mature team. Host Jeremy Paxman said that the Open University team was &quot;not in the spirit&quot; of the competition. The team publicly replied by challenging him to specify in what way this was &quot;contrary to the spirit of the quiz – or of the university&quot;.

====Ineligible contestants====
In 2009, Sam Kay, part of the team from Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was accused of not being a student when the show was filmed. Kay, who had completed a chemistry degree the previous summer, had been planning to go on to study for a Doctor of Philosophy, but dropped out as he did not have sufficient funding. He then became an accountant. The team, whose captain Gail Trimble was dubbed the &quot;human Google&quot;, won the competition but was subsequently disqualified and the trophy awarded to the runners-up, the University of Manchester.

A few days later, it was also revealed that Charles Markland, a member of the 2008 winning team from Christ Church, Oxford, had transferred his studies to Balliol College halfway through the series. He said that his team captain had contacted a researcher concerning the situation, and had been told that this was not a problem and that the same team should be maintained for continuity purposes. It was also revealed that Freya McClements, captain of the 2004 winning team from Magdalen College, Oxford, was at the time studying at Trinity College, Dublin. Although it was mentioned in a BBC news story at the time, no action was taken because the BBC stated that the facts had not been brought to their attention.

====Editing====
In 2016, at the Henley Literary Festival, Jeremy Paxman said that, when students were unable to answer several consecutive starter questions, those questions were often deleted before the show is broadcast.

===In popular culture===
*In an episode of the BBC comedy series &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, first broadcast on 15 December 1980, Griff Rhys Jones plays Bamber Gascoigne in a sketch that pitches two teams of criminals representing prisoners from Wormwood Scrubs and Parkhurst. The teams score &quot;points&quot; (remission of sentence) by &quot;grassing&quot; on possible suspects involved in a crime.
*In 1984 an episode of &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, entitled &quot;Bambi&quot; (a play on Bamber Gascoigne&#x27;s name), centred on a parody of &quot;University Challenge&quot; with a match between the fictitious teams of Scumbag College and Footlights College, Oxbridge. The cast included Stephen Fry, who participated in the real competition in 1980 while at Cambridge, and fellow alumni and Footlights members Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie as part of the &quot;Footlights College&quot; team, and Griff Rhys Jones as the host. The teams are arranged physically one above the other, in a parody of the show&#x27;s split-screen format.
*A quiz themed around BBC science fiction situation comedy &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, broadcast in 1998, is entitled &quot;Universe Challenge&quot;. It opens as if it were a regular episode, but with Chris Barrie impersonating Jeremy Paxman. Gascoigne comes from behind with a blaster gun and blows him out of the chair to take over as host. This was Gascoigne&#x27;s last appearance as host.
*In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, &quot;University Challenge&quot; was placed 34th.
* &quot;Starter For Ten&quot; is the title of a novel, first published in 2003, by British author David Nicholls. The plot is about a first-year student, Brian Jackson, who attempts to join his university team competing in &quot;University Challenge&quot;. Nicholls also adapted the novel into the film &quot;Starter for 10&quot; in 2006, starring James McAvoy as Jackson, with Mark Gatiss portraying Gascoigne.
*In 2006 Armando Ianucci&#x27;s &quot;Time Trumpet&quot; presented a parody of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, set in a future where students are &#x27;too lazy to learn&#x27;; this parody was later referenced in an episode of the 2007–08 series of &quot;University Challenge&quot; by the team captain of SOAS, Joe Perry, who, not knowing the real answer, simply answered &quot;Venezuela?&quot;
*The quiz was the subject of the hour-long BBC Two documentary &quot;The Story So Far&quot;, first broadcast in November 2006. 
* In 2014, a two part documentary narrated by Richard Osman called &#x27;Class of 2014&#x27; outlined a brief history of the programme and the team selection process both within the universities and by the production staff. The documentary attracted some criticism due to the large emphasis on Oxbridge and Manchester during the programme.
* In March 2017 semi-finalist team captains Bobby Seagull of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and Eric Monkman of Wolfson College, Cambridge, appeared on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;. In August 2017 the two were featured on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme ahead of hosting their own show, &quot;Monkman and Seagull&#x27;s Polymathic Adventure&quot;, on 21 August.
*In 2024, Amol Rajan&#x27;s reply &quot;We need jungle, I’m afraid&quot; was widely sampled by music producers, becoming a viral phenomenon.

==Gameplay==
===Teams===
Teams consist of four members and most represent a single university. The exceptions to this are colleges of the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, the University of London and formerly the University of Wales which enter independent teams. While a number of other British universities have constituent colleges, only those where some teaching is undertaken at the college level may enter independent teams. The competing teams each year are selected by the show&#x27;s producers, based both on scores from a general trivia quiz and the producers&#x27; judging of the suitability of the teams for television. Oxford and Cambridge (&quot;Oxbridge&quot;) colleges are prevalent in the competition: for instance, of the Christmas series between 2011 and 2022, Oxbridge colleges represented one-quarter of teams and three-quarters of winners.

The contestants are identified by their surnames during gameplay, apart from at the beginning when they introduce themselves with their full names, where they are from and what they are studying.

The teams generally consist of mixed genders, mostly young adults but with some mature students also appearing.

===Tournament structure===
The current tournament format used for each series is that of a direct knockout tournament starting with 28 teams. The fourteen first-round winners progress directly to the last sixteen. Two repechage matches, involving the four highest scoring losing teams from the first round, whose losing scores often exceed winning scores in other first-round matches, fill the remaining places in the last sixteen. Teams in the quarter-final round (last eight teams) have to win two matches in the round to progress to the semi-finals. Equally, teams must lose two quarter-final matches in order to be eliminated from that round. The pairings for matches are often chosen in order to keep stronger teams apart.

===Question format===
Starter questions are answered individually and are worth ten points. The catchphrase &quot;your starter for ten&quot; inspired David Nicholls&#x27; 2003 novel &quot;Starter for Ten&quot; and the 2006 film based on it starring James McAvoy. An incorrect interruption of a starter question incurs a five-point penalty; during the ITV series this took the form of five points being awarded to the opposing team, whereas in the BBC series five points are deducted from the interrupting team.

The team answering a starter correctly gets a set of three bonus questions worth a potential fifteen points, for which they can confer. Sets of bonus questions are thematically linked. They rarely share a connection with the preceding starter question, except when they are bonuses following a picture or music question. Generally, there are three separate bonus questions worth five points each, but occasionally a bonus will require the enumeration of a given list with five, ten or fifteen points given for correctly giving a certain number of items from the list (for example, &quot;there are seven fundamental SI units. Give five for five points, six for ten points or all seven for fifteen points&quot;). It is the team captain&#x27;s responsibility to give the answer to the bonus questions unless another member of the team is specified with the phrase &quot;Nominate [name]&quot;. The team member so named may then give the answer instead.

In the course of a game there are two picture rounds (occurring roughly one quarter and three-quarters of the way through) and one music round (at the halfway point), where the subsequent bonuses are connected thematically to the starter; if a picture or music starter is not correctly answered, the accompanying bonus questions are held back until a normal starter is correctly answered. Usually, in the recent contests, the first picture round focuses on science and technology, geography, and languages, while the second picture round focuses on art, film, television, and literature. Pieces of music played for the music round may be classical or popular – for example, on 25 July 2011, the pieces played were winners of the Eurovision Song Contest. Occasionally, audio clips other than music (e.g. speech, animal sounds or other field recordings) are used. The 2010 Manchester University team included a visually impaired student, Rachael Neiman, and the picture rounds in episodes involving the team were word puzzles for which she was provided with Braille transcriptions. In the 7th episode of the 2024 Christmas series, three audio rounds replaced the usual picture rounds to accommodate two visually impaired participants, Jamie MacDonald and Halima Begum. These audio rounds included identifying bird songs, depictions of snow in classical music and songs featured on the 1974 Pazz &amp; Jop list.

The pace of questioning gradually increases through the show. The sound of a gong signals the end of the game. At this point, the game immediately ends, even if the quizmaster is halfway through asking a question. In the event of a tied score at the sound of the gong, a sudden death question is asked, the first team to answer correctly being deemed the winner; this is repeated until a team either gives a correct answer to a question or is deducted five points for an incorrect interruption to a question. The ending of the programme is usually signified with the quizmaster saying, &quot;It&#x27;s goodbye from ([name of losing team], who say goodbye), it&#x27;s goodbye from ([name of winning team], likewise), and it&#x27;s goodbye from me: goodbye!&quot; Afterwards, during the closing credits Rajan sometimes walks over and confers with the losing team.

===Production===
While the starter questions are being read out, the teams are shown on screen one above the other by means of a split-screen effect. When a player buzzes in, the shot zooms in to that player, accompanied by a voiceover identifying the player by team and surname, for example &quot;Nottingham, Munro&quot;. The voiceovers are performed live in the studio by Roger Tilling and become more energetic towards the end of the programme. The 1986 series experimented with an actual two-tier set, which was discontinued the following year.

==Winners==
The University of Manchester and Magdalen College, Oxford have both enjoyed four wins each, with Imperial College London having won a record five times. The University of Manchester and Magdalen College, Oxford are also the only teams to successfully defend the title the year after their win (Manchester&#x27;s 2009 win came only after the original winner was disqualified). Trinity College, Cambridge and Durham University hold three titles, and a further six institutions have two titles: Sussex, the Open University, Sidney Sussex–Cambridge, Keble–Oxford, University–Oxford and Warwick. At the time of Magdalen College, Oxford&#x27;s third win in 2004, no other institution had won more than twice; the trophy in use since 1994 was given to the college in perpetuity and a new once created for use from 2005.

===Lowest scores===
Little is known about the lowest scores from the Bamber Gascoigne series, except that the lowest score ever was in the 1971–72 season, when the University of Sussex, fresh from two series wins, managed only 10 points. However, a low score was also achieved by Victoria University of Manchester in their first round match in 1975 when, for much of the recording, they answered only with the names of Marxists as a protest against the Oxford and Cambridge colleges being able to enter separate teams.

Under Jeremy Paxman, the lowest score achieved by a student team was also 10 which, coincidentally, was also achieved by a team from the University of Sussex, in the first round of the 2021–22 series when they faced the University of Birmingham who scored 245. In the same series, the lowest winning score for a student team was achieved, by Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who scored 85 in a quarter final against King&#x27;s College London who scored 80. The second lowest losing score is 15, which was achieved by the University of Exeter in a 2008–09 quarter-final against Corpus Christi, Oxford, whose team captain Gail Trimble answered 15 starter questions correctly. However, the Corpus Christi team were later disqualified from the competition after it was found that team member Sam Kay had been ineligible for the last three matches. Therefore, the second lowest score officially achieved against eligible opponents under Paxman was by Lincoln College, Oxford, who totalled 30 in a semi-final against the eventual series champions the University of Manchester, in an episode televised on 9 February 2009, just two weeks after the Corpus Christi vs Exeter match; this was also matched in the grand final by St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, against Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 18 April 2016.

Before these matches, the lowest Paxman-era score was 35, reached by New Hall, Cambridge, 1997. This score would have been lower if all deductions for incorrect interruptions had been applied.

The lowest score under Amol Rajan&#x27;s chairmanship so far is 25, scored by Wadham College, Oxford in the second round of the 2024–25 series against the then-defending champions Imperial College London, who scored 345.

The lowest score during the &quot;Professionals&quot; series was achieved by the House of Commons team, who scored 25 in 2003.

In the 2014 &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot; series, a team of alumni from Newcastle University finished with 25. An all-time record low score for the series was achieved in the final of the 2017 &quot;Christmas&quot; series, when Keble College, Oxford, beat the University of Reading 240–0. The previous year&#x27;s &quot;Christmas&quot; series saw the lowest winning score of all time, 75, scored by the University of Nottingham, who defeated their opponents, the University of Bristol, by just five points.

===Highest scores===
University College, Oxford, scored 520 points in the final ITV season in 1987.
In the Jeremy Paxman era, the team from Open University scored the highest score, 415, in the semi-final in 1997 against Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School.

==Spin-off shows==
The producers of the programme have taken the more recent inclusion of mature students to its logical conclusion by making two series without any student participants: &quot;University Challenge Reunited&quot; (2002) brought former teams back together, while &quot;University Challenge: The Professionals&quot; (from 2003) matched occupational groups such as civil servants, architects and doctors against each other. In 2003, the former was won by the 1979 team from Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, the latter by a team from the Inland Revenue. The 2004 &quot;Professionals&quot; series was won by the British Library, and the 2005 series by the Privy Council Office. In 2006, &quot;Professionals&quot; was won by staff of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford.

The show has seen numerous specials, including those for specific professions and celebrity editions, such as &quot;Universe Challenge&quot;, presented by former host and Red Dwarf fan, Bamber Gascoigne, where the cast of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; challenged a team of their &quot;ultimate fans&quot; to celebrate &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s 10th anniversary on the air. The cast was Chris Barrie (captain), Danny John-Jules, Robert Llewellyn, Chloë Annett and Craig Charles. The cast, who at times seemed amazed at the fans&#x27; knowledge, lost, but by only 15 points, 280–295.

===Similar programmes===
&quot;Sixth Form Challenge&quot;, hosted by Chris Kelly, appeared briefly between 1965 and 1967. The sixth form contestants represented leading public schools and grammar schools. An untelevised version, &quot;Schools&#x27; Challenge&quot;, continues to run at junior and senior secondary school levels.

&quot;Challenging Times&quot; was a quiz show for teams representing higher education institutes in Ireland, televised by RTÉ from 1991 to 2001.

===Other countries===
&quot;University Challenge&quot; ran in New Zealand for 14 seasons, from 1976 until 1989, with international series held between the previous years&#x27; British and New Zealand champions in both 1986 and 1987. It originally aired on TVNZ 1 and was hosted by Peter Sinclair from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1989. From 1978 to 1979, Sinclair was briefly dropped from the show and was replaced by University of Otago lecturer Charles Higham, Sinclair returned in 1980 and from 1981 to 1982, the show briefly moved to TVNZ 2, it moved back to TV1 in 1983 and remained on the network until the series original conclusion in 1989. The series was revived in 2014 by Cue TV and aired on Prime with Cue TV owner Tom Conroy as host and ran until its second conclusion in 2017.

&quot;University Challenge&quot;, hosted by Magnus Clarke, ran in Australia on the ABC from 1987 until 1989. In the 1988 series, the University of New South Wales defeated the University of Melbourne in the final by 245 points to 175.

&quot;University Challenge India&quot; started in summer 2003, with the season culminating in the finals of March 2004 where Sardar Patel College of Engineering (SPCE), Mumbai, beat Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad. The 2004–2005 season finale saw a team of undergraduate engineering students from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT), Delhi, beat a team of management students from the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode. The Indian winners of the 2003–2004 season went on to beat the finalists from the UK show, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. UC India is produced by BBC World India, and Synergy Communications, co-owned by Siddhartha Basu, who also hosted the show.

University Challenge inspired the format of two Dutch-language shows: &quot;Universiteitsstrijd&quot; (the Netherlands), which ran for one season in 2016 on NTR, and (Belgium), which ran since 2019 on Canvas.

<text>Dennis David Coles (born May 9, 1970), better known by his stage name Ghostface Killah, is an American rapper and a member of the hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan. After the group achieved breakthrough success in the aftermath of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, the members went on to pursue solo careers to varying levels of success. Ghostface Killah debuted his solo career with &quot;Ironman&quot;, which was well received by music critics, in 1996. He has enjoyed continued success in the years that have followed, releasing critically acclaimed albums such as &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot; (2000) and &quot;Fishscale&quot; (2006). His stage name was taken from one of the characters in the 1979 kung fu film &quot;The Mystery of Chess Boxing&quot;. He is the founder of his own record label, Starks Enterprises.

Ghostface Killah is critically acclaimed for his loud, fast-paced flow, and his emotional stream-of-consciousness narratives containing cryptic slang and non-sequiturs. In 2006, MTV included him as an &quot;honourable mention&quot; on their list of the &quot;Greatest MCs of All Time&quot;, while the editors of About.com placed him on their list of the &quot;Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)&quot;, calling him &quot;one of the most imaginative storytellers of our time.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine called him &quot;rap&#x27;s finest storyteller&quot;. Pitchfork Media has stated that &quot;Ghostface has unparalleled storytelling instincts; he might be the best, most colorful storyteller rap has ever seen.&quot; NPR has called him &quot;a compulsive storyteller&quot;, and asserts that &quot;his fiction is painterly.&quot;

==Early life==
Ghostface grew up in the Stapleton Houses housing project in Staten Island, New York City, helping with daily care of two younger brothers who had muscular dystrophy. The 2019 series Wu-Tang: An American Saga depicts a feud between him and fellow Clan member Raekwon; however the feud was purely fictional and never took place in reality. Raekwon and Ghostface attended junior high school together.

==Career==
===Early work===
A roommate of Wu-Tang founder RZA, Ghostface helped bring together the other seven members. In 1995, Ghostface guest-starred extensively on fellow Clan member Raekwon&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot;, appearing on almost every song and receiving nearly equal billing. &quot;It felt good to have my boy next to me, Ghostface, who basically comes from the same lifestyle as I come from. And we were able to sit down and concoct an idea that we both were able to respect and basically get everybody in the crew involved...&quot;, said Raekwon about Ghostface&#x27;s involvement in the project. Raekwon intended &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; to play like a film, with himself as the &quot;star&quot;, Ghostface Killah as the &quot;guest star&quot; and producer RZA as the &quot;director&quot;. He also contributed songs to the &quot;Sunset Park&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood&quot; soundtracks; both songs were included on his first solo LP, &quot;Ironman&quot;, in 1996. The album, which debuted at #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, had a more pronounced soul influence (particularly 1970s soul) than previous Wu-Tang releases, and Ghostface&#x27;s future albums would continue to feature this stylistic trait. He readily and regularly took on the role of executive producer for many collective efforts as well along with RZA and Oli Power Grant. 

In the year 2000, Ghostface released his second studio album, &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;. The album was well received by critics, and peaked at #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It included &quot;Apollo Kids&quot;, a popular single which featured Raekwon and had a sample of &quot;Cool Breeze&quot; by Solomon Burke. &quot;Cherchez La Ghost&quot;, another single off the album, became a minor club hit. &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot; marked a turning point in terms of RZA&#x27;s influence on Ghostface&#x27;s sound, as only six songs on it are produced by RZA, whereas on &quot;Ironman&quot;, its predecessor, every song but one is produced by RZA. Although he contributed fewer beats to the project than to &quot;Ironman&quot;, RZA personally oversaw the mixing and production of the album as a whole, thereby contributing to &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;″s unified sound.

Ghostface wasted little time in recording his next album, the heavily R&amp;B-influenced &quot;Bulletproof Wallets&quot;, released a year after &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;. Its main single, &quot;Never Be the Same Again&quot;, featured Raekwon and Carl Thomas. It produced another minor club hit, &quot;Flowers&quot;, which featured guest vocals from fellow Wu-Tang members Method Man and Raekwon, and a popular single, &quot;Ghost Showers&quot; which featured Madame Majestic, whose other key claim to fame is that she sings on the popular Wu-Tang track &quot;Gravel Pit&quot;.

===Def Jam===
In 2003, Ghostface signed with Def Jam Records. After temporarily dropping &quot;Killah&quot; from his stage name, Ghostface released &quot;The Pretty Toney Album&quot; in April 2004. The album, while containing two RZA productions, featured none of the Clan; instead, it featured collaborations with Missy Elliott, D-Block, and Jacki-O. The singles &quot;Tush&quot; and &quot;Run&quot;, which were collaborations with Missy and Jadakiss respectively, achieved moderate success in the clubs and on the charts, and the album was featured on numerous &quot;best of the year&quot; lists; for instance, it was Pitchfork Media&#x27;s #9 album of the year. Ghostface also appeared on the track &quot;On My Knees&quot; by UK R&amp;B group the 411; the song became a hit in the UK and Australia. Ghostface then released an album entitled &quot;718&quot; (after the Staten Island area code) with a group of his protégés, the Theodore Unit. Ghostface also appeared on &quot;He Comes&quot; by De La Soul, on &quot;The Grind Date&quot;. In November 2005, Ghostface and Theodore Unit&#x27;s breakout star Trife Da God released a joint project, &quot;Put It on the Line&quot;.
In 2006, Ghostface teamed up with underground artist MF Doom for a still-unreleased album entitled &quot;Swift &amp; Changeable&quot;. MF Doom also produced several songs for Ghostface&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Fishscale&quot;, on which he chose to revert to the stage name &quot;Ghostface Killah&quot;, rather than just &quot;Ghostface&quot;. The album debuted strongly, appearing at the #4 position on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at #2 on the R&amp;B charts, the rapper&#x27;s most auspicious chart showing since the heyday of the Wu-Tang Clan and the release of his solo debut. The album also received near-unanimous positive reviews. Ghostface embarked on a limited-date tour of U.S. venues in support of the album, performing several of his concerts together with most of the other members of the Wu-Tang Clan.

In 2007, Ghostface provided the theme song for the Irish animated series &quot;Skunk Fu!&quot; that ran on &quot;Kids&#x27; WB&quot;. On December 4, 2007, Ghostface released his seventh solo studio album, &quot;The Big Doe Rehab&quot;.

In a May 2008 interview, Ghostface Killah stated that he would make an R&amp;B-inspired album in the vein of certain tracks he had done before with artists such as Ne-Yo and Jodeci. That album would become his eighth studio album, &quot;&quot;, which won good reviews from music critics. It featured singles such as &quot;Baby&quot; and &quot;Do Over&quot;. In March 2009, Ghostface responded to the Rihanna/Chris Brown controversy by recording a song, &quot;Message from Ghostface&quot;, which was dedicated to women in abusive relationships.

In a May 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Raekwon indicated that Ghostface Killah was preparing to release a new album. In response to a question asking if the Wu-Tang Clan were going to release a follow-up to &quot;8 Diagrams&quot;, Raekwon stated, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s doing different things right now — you got Meth [Method Man] coming out with an album, you got Ghostface coming out with an album, some guys working on their projects, some guys getting into the film world, everybody is multi-tasking right now.&quot; Ghostface appeared on a total of 8 songs on Raekwon&#x27;s highly anticipated release of &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot;.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II&quot;, Def Jam contracted Raekwon to work with their label artists Method Man and Ghostface Killah on an album which later received the title &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot;. Production began in November 2009. &quot;Wu-Massacre&quot; was released March 30, 2010 to generally positive reviews from music critics; this time, however, reviews were more mixed, with some critics objecting to the 30-minute-long album&#x27;s rushed feel. With heavy promotion, it sold 37,900 units in its first week; it has sold 64,000 units as of May 12, 2010. It features production from Scram Jones, Mathematics, and The RZA, who produced the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Our Dreams&quot;. 

In 2010, Ghostface confirmed that he would be releasing two new studio albums, &quot;Apollo Kids&quot; and one which would serve as a sequel to his 2000 album &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;. In 2011, Ghostface Killah featured on UK artist Josh Osho&#x27;s debut single &quot;Redemption Days&quot;.

===Post Def Jam===
Ghostface released a collaborative album with D-Block member Sheek Louch called &quot;Wu Block&quot;. The album was released on November 27, 2012, on E1 Music and debuted at number 73 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 8,600 copies in the United States. It fell to #152 in its second week selling 4,200 more copies. In January 2017, Ghostface and Sheek Louch announced on their respective social media accounts that a second collaborative album was in the works.

In an interview with &quot;Complex Magazine&quot; on November 17, 2012, Ghostface confirmed that he had left Def Jam, making &quot;Apollo Kids&quot; his last album on the label. In the same interview, he also stated that &quot;Blue &amp; Cream&quot;, the sequel to his critically acclaimed album &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot;, was 80-85 percent done. On April 16, 2013, Ghostface released his tenth album &quot;Twelve Reasons to Die&quot; which was produced by Adrian Younge and executive produced by RZA. The album was released in various formats such as CD, vinyl and cassette under RZA&#x27;s Soul Temple Records. The deluxe digital and CD versions also came with a comic book.

He would later announce that the sequel to &quot;Supreme Clientele&quot; would be released between July and September 2013 and that his collaborative album with MF Doom would be released around Halloween 2013 though neither projects materialized. In January 2014, he appeared on the VH1 series &quot;Couples Therapy&quot; with his girlfriend Kelsey Nykole. Later that year Ghostface announced he would be releasing his eleventh album titled &quot;36 Seasons&quot; in December 2014. He collaborated with Canadian jazz band BADBADNOTGOOD on an album titled &quot;Sour Soul&quot;, which was released in 2015 which earned a nomination for the 2015 Polaris Music Prize.

A sequel to &quot;Twelve Reasons to Die&quot;, simply titled &quot;Twelve Reasons to Die II&quot;, was released on July 10, 2015.

Ghostface had a string of UK and European tour dates scheduled in 2016.

Ghostface provided vocals on the song &quot;Purple Hearts&quot; from Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s album &quot;Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers&quot; in 2022.

In January 2023, Ghostface partnered with Kano Computing to release exclusive music, videos, meetings, and concerts on the Stem Player.

In May 2024, Ghostface released his 12th studio album, &quot;Set the Tone (Guns &amp; Roses)&quot;.

==Lawsuits and criminal charges==
In 1995, Coles was issued an arrest warrant for robbery. In December 1997, Coles was arrested for weapons possession after being pulled over for a traffic violation whereby police claimed that Coles got out of the car and became verbally abusive. He was wearing a bulletproof vest which gave them probable cause to search him and his car where they found a .357 Magnum handgun and he was charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon. In February 1999, Coles was issued a 6-month sentence for attempted robbery, and later pleaded guilty to an additional charge of weapons possession and was issued five years of probation with four months of prison time.

In July 2011, Coles was sued by Jack Urbont for copyright violation stemming from the &quot;improper use&quot; of the 1960s &quot;Iron Man&quot; theme song, which Urbont claimed as his own. Urbont also took issue with Coles&#x27; appropriation of the Iron Man brand name. Coles was granted summary judgment on the lawsuit in April 2015, which stated that Marvel Entertainment, owners of the Iron Man character and brand, owned the &quot;Iron Man&quot; theme song, not Urbont.

In August 2011, Coles filed a lawsuit against Universal Music for unpaid royalties.

==Personal life==
Like fellow Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon, Coles is a convert to Islam, having converted in 2004. Ghostface is the father of rappers Sun God, Supreme, and singer Infinite.

==Aliases==

Ghostface Killah, like most members of the Wu-Tang clan, rapped under several personae, each with their own name, mythology and influences. Some recurring aliases:

:*Ghostface (shortened stage name during &quot;The Pretty Toney Album&quot; era)
:*Ghost Deini
:* Ironman, Tony Starks, or just Starks
:: Ghostface has frequently assumed the names of both Ironman and Tony Starks [sic], a reference to the Marvel Comics character Iron Man and his true identity, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark.

<text>Arthur Bamber Gascoigne (, 24 January 1935 – 8 February 2022) was an English television presenter and author. He was the original quizmaster of &quot;University Challenge&quot;, which initially ran from 1962 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
Gascoigne was born in Richmond, Surrey (now in London), on 24 January 1935. He was the elder son of Lieutenant-Colonel Derek Ernest Frederick Orby Gascoigne by his marriage in 1934 to Mary (&quot;Midi&quot;) Louisa Hermione O&#x27;Neill.

Gascoigne was educated at Sunningdale School in Berkshire before winning successive scholarships to Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge (1955), where he read English literature. He initially wanted to become an actor, though found it tiresome to have to play the same part for more than a week, so instead turned to writing. Whilst at Magdalene he initially submitted scripts to the Footlights sketch troupe, though these were never performed. However, in his second year he wrote a college revue that was seen by the producer Michael Codron. Codron liked it enough to put it on in the West End in 1957, as a musical titled &quot;Share My Lettuce&quot;. It was performed by Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams (with music by Keith Statham and Patrick Gowers). 

Gascoigne then spent a year as a Commonwealth Fund scholar at Yale University (1958–59). He carried out his National Service in the Grenadier Guards, including six months of duty at Buckingham Palace, before being posted to Germany. After completing his National Service he became employed as a theatre critic, firstly for &quot;The Spectator&quot; and later &quot;The Observer&quot;. 

He met his wife, Christina Ditchburn, at Cambridge, and they married in 1965.

==Ancestry==
Gascoigne&#x27;s family were originally Norman, arriving in England in the early 13th century. Gascoigne&#x27;s mother was a daughter of Captain the Hon. Arthur O&#x27;Neill and Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes.

His father was the son of Brigadier-General Sir Ernest Frederick Orby Gascoigne and Laura Cicely, daughter of General Edward Henry Clive, of that family of Styche Hall, Shropshire, from which also came the soldier and administrator of India Robert Clive (Clive of India).

Gascoigne&#x27;s great-grandfathers included Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe, and Edward O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Baron O&#x27;Neill. He was a nephew of Sir Julian Gascoigne, who was in charge of the Household Division during the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and of Terence O&#x27;Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (1963–1969).

Gascoigne was a direct descendant of the 18th-century Lord Mayor of London Sir Crisp Gascoyne and the Tory politicians Bamber Gascoyne (the elder) and Isaac Gascoyne. Isaac&#x27;s son General Ernest Frederick Gascoyne, of Raby Hall, Liverpool (1796–1867), was his great-great-great-grandfather. The name &quot;Bamber&quot; was the surname of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s wife, and was given to their son.

==&quot;University Challenge&quot;==
Gascoigne was the original presenter (from 1962) of the television quiz show &quot;University Challenge&quot;, based on the US series &quot;College Bowl&quot;. He held the position for 25 years, until the end of the initial run in 1987. As well as presenting the show, he also set all the questions in its first series. His questioning manner was regarded as firm yet polite. Phrases he often used which became catchphrases include: &quot;Fingers on buzzers&quot;, &quot;your starter for ten&quot;, &quot;no conferring&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll have to hurry you.&quot; The show was at first planned to last for only 13 episodes, but was such a hit that Gascoigne eventually presented 913 episodes. Some contestants later became notable in their careers, including David Lidington (whose team won) and Miriam Margolyes. When the show was revived in 1994, Gascoigne declined to apply to present it again, for he was involved with other projects; Jeremy Paxman took on the role.

In 1984 &quot;University Challenge&quot; was lampooned in the &quot;Bambi&quot; episode of the alternative comedy series &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, in which Griff Rhys Jones parodied Gascoigne. In 1998, Gascoigne presented a parody titled &quot;Universe Challenge&quot;, based on the sci-fi comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

Gascoigne is portrayed by actor Mark Gatiss in the 2006 comedy-drama film &quot;Starter for 10&quot;.

==Television and books==
Gascoigne was the author of &quot;Murgatreud&#x27;s Empire&quot;, a 1972 satirical novel concerning an entrepreneur who finds an island of pygmies and trades them arms for treasure, recreating the development of European medieval weaponry and armour. This was originally written as a script, although the play was abandoned because of the impossibility of finding suitable performers for a cast of forty pygmies.

In 1977, Gascoigne wrote and presented &quot;The Christians&quot;, a 13-hour television documentary series on the history of Christianity, produced by Granada Television and broadcast on ITV. The same year he wrote a companion book, under the same title, with photography by his wife, Christina Gascoigne, published by Jonathan Cape. In 2003 it was revised and republished as &quot;A Brief History of Christianity&quot; by Robinson Publishing.

Gascoigne wrote &quot;Quest for the Golden Hare&quot;, a 1983 account of the internationally publicised treasure hunt associated with the publication in 1979 of Kit Williams&#x27; book &quot;Masquerade&quot;. On 8 August 1979, Gascoigne was witness to the burial by Williams, in an earthenware jar &quot;somewhere in Britain&quot;, of a unique jewelled, solid gold pendant in the design of a hare. The book documents the search and a scandal associated with the pendant&#x27;s eventual discovery.

In 1987, Gascoigne presented a documentary series of six 30-minute programmes on Victorian history, &quot;Victorian Values&quot;, produced by Granada Television. The programmes looked at how Victorian society put in place the infrastructure of the modern welfare state.

In 1988, Gascoigne devised and presented a BBC Two arts quiz called &quot;Connoisseur&quot;, for which he also set the questions.

Gascoigne was the writer and presenter of the TV series &quot;The Great Moghuls&quot; (1990), a study of the Mughal Empire of India. The series was based on Gascoigne&#x27;s 1971 book of the same name, which features photographs by his wife.

In 1994 Gascoigne held the Sandars Readership in Bibliography and presented &quot;From priceless perfection to cheap charm: stages in the development of colour printing.&quot;

==Other activities==
Gascoigne established an online history encyclopaedia, &quot;HistoryWorld&quot;, based on British history. He had already published a hard copy of this encyclopaedia, but he saw the internet as an opportunity to reach millions more people than would see the book. He also established &quot;TimeSearch&quot;, which presents multiple searchable timelines collected from various websites.

Gascoigne was a lifelong supporter of the Liberal Party and subsequently the Liberal Democrats. He publicly endorsed the latter during their 2019 general election campaign. In August 2014, Gascoigne was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

On the death of his great-aunt Mary Innes-Ker, Duchess of Roxburghe, in 2014, Gascoigne inherited an estate at West Horsley, Surrey, including West Horsley Place, a large country house dating from the 16th century. Gascoigne sold some of the late Duchess&#x27;s possessions and used the proceeds to restore the house. This was followed by the building of an opera house in its grounds, the Theatre in the Woods, which serves as the home base of the Grange Park Opera. An original pencil-and-chalk study for the painting &quot;Flaming June&quot; by Sir Frederic Leighton was found on the back of a bedroom door in the house. Art historians knew a sketch had existed, for it was published in an art magazine in 1895, but did not know who had owned it; it was probably bought by the Duchess&#x27;s paternal grandfather after Leighton&#x27;s death. From 2018 until 2023, West Horsley Place was used as the filming location for the fictional Button House in the BBC TV comedy series &quot;Ghosts&quot;.

==External interests==
Gascoigne was elected in 1976 as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was a trustee of the National Gallery, a trustee of the Tate Gallery, a member of the council of the National Trust, and a member of the board of directors of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He was also a patron of the Museum of Richmond.

==Personal life, honours and death==
Gascoigne was married, for 57 years, to Christina (&quot;née&quot; Ditchburn), daughter of civil servant Alfred Henry Ditchburn. He met Christina at Cambridge. They lived in Richmond, London, from the late 1960s onward. She is an artist working in ceramics, silks and other media. The couple did not have any children. With regard to religion, he described himself as &quot;a perfectly friendly agnostic&quot;. 

Gascoigne was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to the Arts.

In January 2022, Gascoigne was hospitalised for three weeks with pneumonia. Following his hospitalisation, his health drastically declined. He died at his home in Richmond on 8 February 2022, at the age of 87. Stephen Fry, another famous &quot;University Challenge&quot; alumnus, led the tributes to Gascoigne, saying he was &quot;such an elegant, intelligent man&quot;. Victoria Coren Mitchell, host of BBC quiz show &quot;Only Connect&quot;, said: &quot;No quiz host has ever seemed more like they could answer all the questions themselves.&quot;

<text>Claude Honoré M&#x27;Barali (; born 5 March 1969), professionally known as MC Solaar (), is a French rapper of Senegalese and Chadian origin. He is one of France&#x27;s most famous and influential hip hop artists. Some consider him the best French rapper of all time.

MC Solaar is known for his complex lyrics and distinctive flows, which rely on word play, lyricism, and inquiry. He is one of the best in France. In the English-speaking world, Solaar was signed by London-based acid jazz record label Talkin&#x27; Loud and recorded with British band Urban Species and rapper Guru, who was a member of New York-based rap band Gang Starr. Solaar has released eight studio albums and one live album. His eighth studio album, &quot;Géopoétique&quot;, produced by Alain Etchart and mixed by sound engineer David Gnozzi, won best album of the year at the Victoires de la Musique awards in 2018.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Claude M&#x27;Barali was born in Dakar, Senegal, to parents from Chad. When he was six months old, his parents immigrated to France where they settled in the Parisian suburbs; initially in Saint-Denis, subsequently Maisons-Alfort and finally Villeneuve-Saint-Georges. When he was twelve, he went to live with an uncle in Cairo, Egypt for nine months where he discovered the Universal Zulu Nation and became fascinated with the rapping styles of Afrika Bambaataa. Upon his return to France, he passed the baccalauréat. The constant support from his mother was one of the reasons that he was able to pass the baccalauréat and still make music. He coined the stage name &quot;MC Solaar&quot; during his adolescence from his graffiti tags &quot;SOAR&quot; and &quot;SOLAAR&quot;.

He studied languages at the Jussieu university campus and was a postgraduate in philosophy. He released his first single in 1990. MC Solaar went to Paris in the summer of 1991 with his friend Jimmy Jay in hopes of succeeding in the music industry. Success came quickly when his first single, &quot;Bouge de là&quot; (&quot;Get Out of There&quot;), based on a sample from Cymande&#x27;s song &quot;The Message&quot; (1973) became a hit in the early 1990s. Many rappers who came out of Africa at the time spoke a lot about slavery and other topics in order to bring the history of their people into light. Nevertheless, the song went platinum in France and reached #5 on the national charts.

===1991–1997: Early success and &quot;Prose Combat&quot; breakthrough===
After the success of &quot;Bouge de là&quot;, Solaar went on to support the American rap group De La Soul when they performed at the Olympia in Paris in September 1991. At the close of 1991, Solaar released &quot;Qui Sème le Vent Récolte le Tempo&quot; which went on to sell over 400,000 copies in France. With the success of his debut album in France, Solaar embarked upon extensive tours of Poland and Russia. In December 1992, he performed in twelve countries across West Africa, where his French rap style proved popular with African music fans.

MC Solaar released &quot;Prose Combat&quot; in 1994. It sold 100,000 copies in the first week of being released and became a bestseller in 20 other countries. In February 1995 he received an award for Best Male Singer of the Year at the 10th edition of the French &quot;Victoires de la Musique&quot; awards. Also in 1994, MC Solaar appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as Album of the Year by &quot;Time&quot;.

Solaar returned to the studio in 1997 with longtime friend and producer Jimmy Jay to record his third album, &quot;Paradisiaque&quot;. The album was another success, which led to an extensive European tour starting on 9 January 1998 at the Zénith in Paris. MC Solaar toured internationally, including Germany, Japan and the United States. He was included as a guest on American rapper Guru&#x27;s &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; project and one of Solaar&#x27;s songs was included in the Tommy Boy rap compilation in the United States.

Early in Solaar&#x27;s career, it was important for him to share the struggles and the different hardships for black people that had emigrated to France and tried to make a better life. Most of his music was dedicated to enlightening the population of a specific deeper message that connected to him in his life. &quot;[...] he addresses the conditions under which Black people have emigrated to and settled in France. In the piece &quot;Leve-toi et rap,&quot; he describes his Chadian parents&#x27; migration from Senegal to a Parisian suburb, the main stages of his teenage years and how he finally came to discover rap.&quot; In an interview, MC Solaar described the feeling of making a song and the thought process while just writing any part of lyrics that go into his music. &quot;I write quickly, because of the music, he tells me. It&#x27;s much easier if you have the music, the rhythm, but I am fast. First, I have taken in &quot;everything&quot;. Do you never write before the music? Ah. I used to, he admits. But when I met the music, I changed.&quot;

===1997–2004: &quot;Cinquième As&quot; and &quot;Mach 6&quot;===
Solaar released &quot;Cinquième As&quot; in 2001, to critical acclaim and &quot;Mach 6&quot; in 2003. In the album&#x27;s third track, &quot;Lève-Toi et Rap&quot;, Solaar describes his parents&#x27; move to France as well as his own roots growing up in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges and Cairo.
Critic Dan Gennoe attests to Solaar&#x27;s &quot;flow et vocabulaire&quot; by noting &quot;the flow of his words is staggering, as are the low-slung grooves that they roll to; deftly vaulting all language barriers.&quot;

In 1998, MC Solaar embarked on a tour beginning at the Zénith de Paris. The concert he presents is a show with DJs and dancers (as the hip-hop dancer Bintou Dembélé) which overpasses the musical frame. The cover of &quot;Cinquieme As&quot; depicts Solaar topless, and draws comparisons to captives about to be taken onto a slave ship. However, a look at the inside cover reveals Solaar to be in a wrestler&#x27;s costume, along with the other men in the picture. As Veronique Helenon discusses in her article concerning the French hip hop scene, references to Africa and &quot;blackness&quot; are a very important part of Solaar&#x27;s music. Solaar recognises and pays tribute to the African presence in France by using boxing and wrestling references. Senegalese boxer Battling Siki is referenced in the album&#x27;s booklet. Although Siki won the light heavyweight boxing championship in 1922, he still faced racism from journalists. This image combined with songs concerning colonial oppression and the migration experience from Africa to France show Solaar&#x27;s &quot;blackness,&quot; something that is extremely important in the French hip-hop scene. For example, in his song &quot;Les Colonies&quot;, Solaar discusses the similarities between the oppression of Africans by colonialists to the modern day exploitation of &quot;third world&quot; countries. &quot;Cinquième As&quot; includes lyrics in French, English, and Spanish, which represents his ideals that rap should be inclusive of all people. In early 2004, his 2001 song &quot;La Belle et Le Bad Boy&quot; was featured on the final episode of the U.S. television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. The MTV series &quot;The Hills&quot; featured the song as well.

===2005–present: &quot;Chapitre 7&quot; and international acclaim===
&quot;Da Vinci Claude&quot;, the first single from Solaar&#x27;s album &quot;Chapitre 7&quot;, was launched in March 2007. The album was released on 18 June 2007. MC Solaar is best known outside France for his work on Guru&#x27;s &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot; project and as a featured artist on the Missy Elliott track &quot;All N My Grill&quot;. His collaboration with her propelled him to higher popularity in the U.S market. The single &quot;Le Bien, Le Mal&quot; (The Good, The Bad) has been a hip hop/dance crossover hit and has received playtime on MTV, which characterizes his work this way: &quot;His fluid phrasing makes up for his lack of English, and the production on his solo work (by DJ Jimmy Jay and Boom Bass of La Funk Mob) surpasses that of most of his hip-hop contemporaries.&quot;

MC Solaar is one of the few French rappers having success in the English-dominated American hip hop culture. American rapper will.i.am admitted he prefers MC Solaar to American rapper Tupac Shakur.

==Personal life==
MC Solaar studied humanities in highly selective preparatory classes (&quot;hypokhâgne&quot;). On 7 December 2003, MC Solaar married Chloé Bensemoun and on 7 May 2004, she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a son named Roman. In 2007, she gave birth to a daughter named Bonnie. They divorced in 2012.

<text>Mitchelstown () is a town in the north of County Cork, Ireland with a population of over 3,740. It is situated in the valley to the south of the Galtee Mountains. Mitchelstown is 13 km south-west of the Mitchelstown Cave, 53 km north of Cork City, 56 km south-east of Limerick City and 15 km north of Fermoy. The town is close to the M8 motorway which links Cork and Dublin.

Mitchelstown has been described as one of the &quot;finest Georgian planned towns&quot; in Ireland. The River Gradoge runs by the town into the River Funshion, which in turn is a tributary of the River Blackwater. Mitchelstown is within the Dáil constituency of Cork East.

==Name==
Prior to the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland, the area around Mitchelstown was known as &quot;Caoille&quot;, a territory bounded by the Kilworth Mountains to the south and the Galtee Mountains to the north. It was occupied by a people known as the &quot;Fir Muighe&quot; – the &quot;men of the plain&quot;.

The name of Mitchelstown originates from the Anglo-Norman family called &quot;de St Michel&quot; who founded a settlement close to the site of the present town in the 13th century. Their family name was well attested among Anglo-Normans in this area of Munster. (A reference in 1288 to a Geoffrey &quot;Michel&quot; in the &#x27;vill of Michel&#x27;, appears to refer to Mitchelstown townland in County Limerick.) Today&#x27;s Mitchelstown and &quot;Baile Mhistéala&quot; names evolved from several varied spellings, a number of which are listed in the Placenames Database of Ireland. The database records 1618 as the earliest instance of today&#x27;s standard English version.

==History==

Before the development of Mitchelstown, a 7th-century settlement was established in the nearby townland of Brigown. Brigown (Irish: &quot;Brí Ghabhann&quot;, meaning &quot;hill of the smiths&quot;) was founded by a monk named Fionnchú (Findchú in Old Irish), now popularly known as Saint Fanahan. On the eastern side of the town is a holy well associated with the saint that is traditionally visited on 25 November, his annual pattern day. By the 9th century, Brigown had a round tower (this tower was damaged in a lightning strike in 1720 and demolished in 1807).

Mitchelstown itself is based at or near the site of a 13th-century Norman settlement called &quot;Villa Michel&quot;. During the 13th century, &quot;Villa Michel&quot; was granted market rights giving it a commercial focus within the region. From about 1300 to 1600, the town was the property of the White Knights, Chiefs of the Clan Gibbon (FitzGibbons), a branch of the Earls of Desmond. The White Knights were lords over large portions of modern-day counties Cork, Limerick and Tipperary consisting of an estate of over 40,000 hectares. The first Mitchelstown Castle was built by the White Knights sometime in the 14th century and it lasted until the 1770s. The original town itself appears to have evolved from a cluster of cabins and laneways around this castle probably starting in the late-thirteenth or early-fourteenth centuries.

The area known as Kingston College (or &quot;King&#x27;s Square&quot;) was built around 1764 by James King, 4th Baron Kingston for the cost of £12,000. It was initially established as housing for elderly, impoverished Protestants. When James died in 1764, his 10-year-old granddaughter Caroline FitzGerald inherited the estate. Five years later she married her 15-year-old cousin, Robert King, Viscount Kingsborough who himself later inherited large estates in counties Roscommon and Sligo. For a time, their joint land ownership was around 70,000 hectares. The revolutionary writer Mary Wollstonecraft, briefly worked as a governess to three of their daughters.

Unlike other landlords of the time, who had a &quot;hands off&quot; management style, Caroline and Robert King undertook a number of progressive projects in their Mitchelstown estate from the mid-1770s onwards. The demesne wall, reputed to be the longest park wall in Ireland, took 16 years to build. It is 10 km long, encloses 500 hectares and was originally over 3 metres in height in most places.

The medieval town was demolished and replaced by the present town which is centred more to the south-east. The town was laid out in a grid pattern of two main streets intersected by a number of smaller streets.

Some of its streets are named after members of the King family, namely Robert, George, Edward, James, Thomas and also King (the family name). The other streets of the Georgian town are Church Street, Baldwin Street, Alley Lane, Chapel Hill, Convent Hill, King Square, New Square and Mulberry Lane.

The layout established by the second and third Earls of Kingston, between 1776 and 1830, utilised the natural features of the site to give views of the Galtee Mountains. This is best illustrated by how George Street was designed with Saint George&#x27;s Arts and Heritage Centre (formerly Saint George&#x27;s Church) closing the view on the southern end, and the northern view being terminated by Kingston College and Temple Hill on the Galtee Mountains.

Mitchelstown Castle was rebuilt between 1823 and 1825 by George King, 3rd Earl of Kingston.

During the Irish Civil War in 1922, the castle was occupied by the Irish Republican Army. During six weeks of occupation, its contents were looted and the building was burnt on the night 12 and 13 August 1922 – ostensibly to prevent it from being used by the Irish Free State army. However, there is no evidence to support that claim. Another motive, put forward for the fire, was to cover up the looting and destruction of the building. The ashlar limestone of the house stood as a ruin until about 1930 when it was bought by the monks of Mount Melleray Abbey who used it to build their new monastery in County Waterford.

===Mitchelstown massacre===

Between 1879 and 1881, and again between 1886 and 1888, local tenantry, led by John Mandeville and William O&#x27;Brien, MP, organised a rent strike on the Mitchelstown Estate, then owned by Anna, Dowager Countess of Kingston and her second husband, William Downes Webber. On 9 September 1887, a protest was held later in the day in New Market Square outside the Market House where Mandeville and O&#x27;Brien were being tried. Neither man appeared in court. After the court ended, approximately 8,000 demonstrators paraded into New Square. As the speeches began from a wagon in the square, the police attempted to get an official police notetaker closer to the platform so that he could hear and record what was being said. Their motives were misunderstood, and they were held back by the crowd. They retreated, returning moments later with fifty reinforcements. This time, they fixed bayonets and used the butts of their rifles to hit horses that had been placed around the edge of the crowd to prevent their access to the wagon. In the melee that followed, hand-to-hand combat involving police being beaten with sticks and stones being thrown at them. The police retreated to their barracks, which was on a house that overlooked part of the square. As the last constable arrived at the barracks, he drew his revolver and fired a single shot into the air. This created confusion amongst the police inside the barracks, who by that time had been placed at the upstairs windows with carbine rifles. Several shots were fired into the crowd. Three men were killed and several more injured. The dead men were John Shinnick of Fermoy, John Casey of Kilbehenny and Michael Lonergan of Galbally, County Limerick. The incident generated considerable international attention and became known as the &quot;Mitchelstown Massacre&quot;. The phrase &quot;Remember Mitchelstown&quot; (first coined by William Gladstone) became a rallying cry for Irishmen at home and abroad. The memorial to Mandeville that stands in Market Square was unveiled in 1906 by William O&#x27;Brien MP. It also commemorates the names of the three men killed in 1887.

==Economy==
===Co-operative===

Up to 1990, Mitchelstown was the headquarters for Mitchelstown Co-operative Agricultural Society Ltd, one of the largest co-operatives in Ireland. This farmers co-op was founded in 1919. Between 1919 and 1990, Mitchelstown Co-op Creameries became the largest dairy processing business on the island of Ireland. While it became known for its processed cheese brands, it was better known in overseas dairy industry circles for its natural cheeses, which were exported around Europe and for which it earned several international prizes.

In the 1930s, the co-op promoted the introduction of intensive pig production in the area as another source of farm income, and several of Ireland&#x27;s largest industrial pig farms were subsequently based in the Mitchelstown area.

In October 1990, Mitchelstown Co-operative merged with Ballyclough Co-operative (based in Mallow, County Cork) to create an enlarged Dairygold Co-Operative. The co-op is now the largest farmer owned co-operative in Ireland and has its headquarters in Mitchelstown. One of the first managers of Mitchelstown Creameries was Eamon Roche, who was credited with the organisation&#x27;s massive growth.

Today Mitchelstown is home to Kerrygold Park, a €40 million butter production and packing facility supplying the Kerrygold butter brand worldwide.

==Transport==
===Road===

Mitchelstown is situated close to the M8 Dublin to Cork motorway, which runs to the east and can be accessed from Junctions 12 and 13.

A relief road, located to the west of the town, serves to filter N73 traffic towards Mallow and R513 traffic towards Limerick. The construction of the relief road to the west and north, and its connection in 2009 to the M8 to the east of Mitchelstown, means that the town has become the smallest in Ireland to have a full 360-degree ring road. Prior to the opening of the relief road in 2006, the N8 ran through Mitchelstown itself, seriously congesting the main street. The R665 road connects Mitchelstown to Clonmel, while the former N8 now redesignated as the R639 provides an alternative route from Mitchelstown to Cork, Fermoy and Cahir.

===Bus===
Bus Éireann runs intercity services through the town providing a service to both Dublin and Cork. Since late 2022, there is an expanded bus service between the town and Limerick city, which serves several intermediate towns and villages.

===Rail===
Mitchelstown railway station opened on 23 March 1891, closed to passenger and goods traffic on 27 January 1947, and closed on 1 December 1953.

==Mitchelstown caves==

The Mitchelstown Caves are limestone caves located near the R639, between Mitchelstown and Cahir. One cave, Mitchelstown Cave itself, is privately owned and has been developed as a show cave, with a number of caverns open to the public through a guided tour. Some of the speleothems are noteworthy including the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; formation. Various other stalactites, stalagmites and rock formations are also named for their unique structures.

==Events==
Indiependence, an annual three-day festival weekender, typically takes place on the outskirts of Mitchelstown over the August Bank Holiday. The event has previously hosted acts like Editors, Bastille, Lewis Capaldi, Hozier, Public Enemy, Picture This, The Coronas, Ash, and Feeder.

<text>De Nederlandsche Bank (, , abbr. DNB) is the Dutch member of the Eurosystem and has been the monetary authority for the Netherlands from 1814 to 1998, issuing the Dutch guilder. Since 2014, it has also been the country&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision. It was originally founded by King William I, and has been since transformed into a state-owned public limited company (, abbreviated NV).

==History==
On 2 May 1998, the European heads of state or government decided that the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) would begin on 1 January 1999 with eleven member states of the European Union (EU), the Netherlands included. As from 1 June 1998, the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank N.V., forms part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). On the same day, the new Bank Act (of 1998) came into force. Nearly 185 years into its existence, the Nederlandsche Bank has entered a new phase.

== Tasks ==

Under the 1998 Bank Act – replacing that of 1948 – the bank has the following tasks:

* Within the framework of the ESCB, the bank shall contribute to the definition and implementation of monetary policy within the European Community (EC). The bank has the objective to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to this objective, the bank shall support the general economic policy in the EC.
* The bank shall hold and manage the official foreign reserves, and shall conduct foreign-exchange operations.
* The bank shall collect statistical data and produce statistics.
* The bank shall promote the smooth operation of payment systems; it shall take care of the banknote circulation.
* The bank shall supervise banks, investment institutions and exchange offices.
* The bank may, subject to permission by royal decree, perform other tasks in the public interest. The European Central Bank (ECB) may also ask the bank to perform extra tasks.

The first two tasks – also known as the ESCB tasks – ensue entirely from the Maastricht Treaty. Decisions in these areas are taken at the European level by the ECB Governing Council, on which the president of the Nederlandsche Bank has a seat. Promoting the smooth operation of payment systems has both a European and a national dimension. The statistical task is also partly ESCB-related and partly a national concern. The DNB is responsible for international macro-economic statistical analysis for countries outside the EU. These two tasks will not be transferred to ESCB level at the start of EMU. Here the Nederlandsche Bank remains fully in control. However, in a Europe where economies are becoming increasingly interlocked, many banking supervisory rules are drawn up at the international level. DNB serves as the banker&#x27;s bank to general Dutch banks.

One of the government appointed members of the Social-Economic Council is always a representative of DNB.

==Head office==

The bank was established from the start on , where it occupied 17th-century houses. In the 1860s, a purpose-built head office, designed by architect , was erected on the same location and inaugurated in 1869. Nearly a century later in 1968, as the bank has left the building for its new seat, it was taken over by the University of Amsterdam which had long been established just nearby, and subsequently repurposed as the location of the Allard Pierson Museum, which opened there in October 1976.

In the 1960s, a new head office complex was constructed on and inaugurated by Queen Juliana in May 1968. Architect &#x27;s stark design of 1961 consisted on a low square base and a rectangular office tower. In the late 1980s, as the bank was running out of space, it was complemented with a second, oval tower designed in 1984 by architects and Marc a Campo, whose construction was finished in 1989. In 2008, Marc a Campo designed a further extension by adding an extra floor to the square base. In a comprehensive renovation during the early 2020s, the oval tower was demolished and the base remodeled to return the building to an exterior appearance more similar to the original one of the 1960s.

<text>Melissa Arnette &quot;Missy&quot; Elliott (born July 1, 1971), also known as Misdemeanor, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. She began her musical career as a member of the R&amp;B girl group Sista during the 1990s, who were part of the larger musical collective Swing Mob—led by DeVante Swing of Jodeci. The former group&#x27;s commercially unsuccessful debut album, &quot;4 All the Sistas Around da World&quot; (1994), was released by Elektra Records and met with positive critical reception. She collaborated with album&#x27;s producer and Swing Mob cohort Timbaland to work in songwriting and production for other acts, yielding commercially successful releases for 702, Aaliyah, SWV, and Total. 

Elliott re-emerged as a solo act with numerous collaborations and guest appearances by 1996, and in July of the following year, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot; (1997). As her mainstream breakthrough, the album was met with critical and commercial success, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawning the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 20 single &quot;Sock It 2 Me&quot; (featuring Da Brat). Her second album, &quot;Da Real World&quot; (1999) produced the singles &quot;She&#x27;s a Bitch&quot;, &quot;All n My Grill&quot; (featuring Big Boi and Nicole Wray), and &quot;Hot Boyz&quot; (remixed featuring Lil&#x27; Mo, Nas, Eve and Q-Tip). The latter song set a 19-year record for most weeks atop the Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Songs by January 2000 (until Lil Nas X&#x27;s 2019 single &quot;Old Town Road&quot;), and spent 18 weeks atop the Hot Rap Songs chart from December 1999 to March 2000. 

Elliott&#x27;s third and fourth albums, &quot;Miss E... So Addictive&quot; (2001) and &quot;Under Construction&quot; (2002) made her the sole recipient of both Grammy Awards for Best Female Rap Solo Performance with their respective songs &quot;Scream a.k.a. Itchin&quot; (featuring Timbaland) and &quot;Work It&quot;. Furthermore, the albums peaked at numbers two and three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively, while &quot;Work It&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her fifth album, &quot;This Is Not a Test!&quot; (2003) was followed by &quot;The Cookbook&quot; (2005), her sixth album which matched &quot;Under Construction&quot; as her highest charting release while spawning the Hot 100 top three single, &quot;Lose Control&quot; (featuring Ciara and Fatman Scoop). Following a long-term hiatus, her debut extended play, &quot;Iconology&quot; (2019) marked her first release in 14 years.

Elliott has received numerous accolades, including four Grammy Awards. Her overall discography has sold 40 million records worldwide, making her the best-selling female rapper in Nielsen Music history according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. She was the first female rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and received the MTV VMAs Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for her impact on the music video landscape. In 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her at No. 5 on their list of the 100 greatest music video artists of all time. In 2021, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2023, she became the first female rapper to be nominated and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2024, Elliot was honored as the 2022 recipient of the National Medal of Arts.

== Early life ==
Melissa Arnette Elliott was born on July 1, 1971, at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Portsmouth, Virginia, the only child of power company dispatcher Patricia and former Marine Ronnie Elliott. She grew up in an active church choir family, where singing was a normal part of her youth. At the age of four, she wanted to be a performer, with biographer Veronica A. Davis later writing that she &quot;would sing and perform for her family&quot;. In later years, she feared no one would take her seriously because she was always the . While her father was an active Marine, the family lived in a manufactured home community in Jacksonville, North Carolina. She blossomed during this part of her life, enjoying school for the friendships that she formed even though she had little interest in schoolwork. When her father returned from the Marines, the family moved back to Virginia, where they lived in extreme poverty.

Life in Virginia saw many hardships, and Elliott has talked about seeing her mother suffer domestic abuse at the hands of her father; she refused to attend sleepovers at her friends&#x27; homes out of fear that she would find her mother dead upon returning home. When she was eight, she was sexually abused by a cousin. In one violent incident, her father dislocated her mother&#x27;s shoulders; during another, Elliott herself was threatened by her father with a gun. When Elliott was 14, her mother decided to end the situation and fled with Elliott on the pretext of taking a joyride on a local bus. In reality, the pair had found refuge at a family member&#x27;s home, where their possessions were stored in a loaded U-Haul truck. Elliott told her mother that she feared her father would kill them both for leaving. She later stated, &quot;When we left, my mother realized how strong she was on her own, and it made me strong. It took her leaving her home to be able to realize that.&quot; She and her mother lived in the Hodges Ferry neighborhood of Portsmouth, where Elliott graduated from Manor High School in 1990. She later said that she occasionally speaks to her father, but has not forgiven him for abusing her mother.

==Career==

=== 1988–1995: Early work and Sista ===

In 1988, Elliott formed an all-women R&amp;B group called Fayze (later renamed Sista) with friends La&#x27;Shawn Shellman, Chonita Coleman, and Radiah Scott. She was introduced to her neighborhood friend Timothy Mosley (Timbaland) by Melvin Barcliff (Magoo) who was trying to recruit his Dj Timbaland to be the group&#x27;s producer and began making demo tracks, among them included the 1991 promo &quot;First Move&quot;. Later in 1991, Fayze caught the attention of Jodeci member and producer DeVante Swing by performing Jodeci songs a cappella for him backstage after one of his group&#x27;s concerts. In short order, Fayze moved to New York City and signed to Elektra Records through DeVante&#x27;s Swing Mob imprint and also renaming the group Sista. Sista&#x27;s debut song was titled &quot;Brand New&quot;, which was released in 1993 Elliott took Mosley &amp; Barclif whom DeVante re-christened the duo as Timbaland &amp; Magoo.

All 20-plus members of the Swing Mob—among them future stars such as Ginuwine, Playa, and Tweet—lived in a single two-story house in New York and were often at work on material both for Jodeci and their own projects. While Elliott wrote and rapped on Raven-Symoné&#x27;s 1993 debut single, &quot;That&#x27;s What Little Girls Are Made Of&quot; which was her first big musical breakthrough, peaking at #68 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, she also contributed, credited and uncredited, to the Jodeci albums &quot;Diary of a Mad Band&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Show, the After Party, the Hotel&quot; (1995). Timbaland and DeVante jointly produced a Sista album, entitled &quot;4 All the Sistas Around da World&quot; (1994). Though videos were released for the original and remix versions of the single &quot;Brand New&quot;, the album was shelved and never released. One of the group&#x27;s tracks, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; featuring Craig Mack did however make the cut on the soundtrack of the 1995 motion picture &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; but by the end of 1995, Swing Mob had folded and many of its members dispersed. Elliott, Timbaland, Magoo, Ginuwine, and Playa remained together and collaborated on each other&#x27;s records for the rest of the decade as the musical collective The Superfriends.

=== 1996–1998: &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot; ===

After leaving Swing Mob, Elliott and Timbaland worked together as a songwriting/production team, crafting tracks for acts including SWV, 702, and most notably Aaliyah. The pair wrote and produced nine tracks for Aaliyah&#x27;s second album, &quot;One in a Million&quot; (1996), among them the hit singles &quot;If Your Girl Only Knew&quot;, &quot;One in a Million&quot;, &quot;Hot Like Fire&quot;, and &quot;4 Page Letter&quot;. Elliott contributed background vocals and/or guest raps to nearly all of the tracks on which she and Timbaland worked. &quot;One in a Million&quot; went double platinum and made stars out of the production duo. Elliott and Timbaland continued to work together for other artists, later creating hits for artists such as Total (&quot;What About Us?&quot;; 1997), Nicole Wray (&quot;Make It Hot&quot;; 1998), and Destiny&#x27;s Child (&quot;Get on the Bus&quot;; 1998), as well as one final hit for Aaliyah, &quot;I Care 4 U&quot;, before her death in 2001. Elliott also wrote the bulk of Total&#x27;s second and final album &quot;Kima, Keisha, and Pam&quot; and Nicole Wray&#x27;s debut &quot;Make It Hot&quot; (both released in 1998). Elliott began her career as a featured vocalist rapping on Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs&#x27;s Bad Boy remixes to Gina Thompson&#x27;s &quot;The Things That You Do&quot;, (which had a video featuring cameo appearances by Notorious B.I.G and Puff Daddy), MC Lyte&#x27;s 1996 hit single &quot;Cold Rock a Party&quot; (backup vocals by Gina Thompson), and New Edition&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Worry&quot;. In 1996, Elliott also appeared on the Men of Vizion&#x27;s remix of &quot;Do Thangz&quot; which was produced by Rodney Jerkins (coincidentally the producer of the original version of &quot;The Things That You Do&quot;).

Combs had hoped to sign Elliott to his Bad Boy record label. Instead, she signed a deal in 1996 to create her own imprint, The Goldmind Inc., with East West Records, which at that time was a division of Elektra Entertainment Group, for which she would record as a solo artist. Timbaland was again recruited as her production partner, a role he would hold on most of Elliott&#x27;s solo releases. Missy continued to work with other artists and appeared on LSG&#x27;s song &quot;All the Time&quot; with Gerald Levert, Keith Sweat, Johnny Gill, Faith Evans, and Coko in 1997 on Levert Sweat Gill classic album. The same year, she rapped in &quot;Keys To My House&quot; with old friends group LeVert. In the center of a busy period of making guest appearances and writing for other artists, Elliott&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot;, was released in mid-1997; the success of its lead single &quot;The Rain&quot; led the album to be certified platinum. Elliott wore an oversized trash-bag looking jumpsuit in the music video, and at Lilith Fair, an outfit media articles have considered one of her most recognizable &quot;fashion moments&quot;.

The success was also a result of the music videos of her single releases, which were directed by Harold &quot;Hype&quot; Williams, who created many groundbreaking hip hop, Afro-futuristic videos at the time. The album was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards, but lost to Puff Daddy&#x27;s &quot;No Way Out&quot;. The year also saw Elliott perform live at the MTV Video Music Awards show on a remix to Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s &quot;Ladies Night&quot; with fellow rappers Da Brat, Angie Martinez and TLC-rapper Left Eye. Elliott continued her successful career in the background as a producer and writer on Total&#x27;s single &quot;Trippin&#x27;&quot;, as well as working with several others in the hip-hop and R&amp;B communities. Elliott co-wrote and co-produced two tracks on Whitney Houston&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, providing vocal cameos for &quot;In My Business&quot; and &quot;Oh Yes&quot;. Elliott also produced and made a guest appearance on Spice Girl Melanie Brown&#x27;s debut solo single, &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, which topped the UK Singles Chart in Brown&#x27;s native United Kingdom and is Elliott&#x27;s only chart-topping song in that country.

=== 1999–2001: &quot;Da Real World&quot; and &quot;Miss E... So Addictive&quot; ===
Although a much darker album than her debut, Elliott&#x27;s second album was just as successful as the first, selling 1.5 million copies and 3 million copies worldwide. She remarked, &quot;I can&#x27;t even explain the pressure. The last album took me a week to record. This one took almost two months...I couldn&#x27;t rush it the second time because people expect more.&quot; &quot;Da Real World&quot; (1999) included the singles &quot;All n My Grill&quot;, a collaboration with Nicole Wray and Big Boi (from OutKast), a remix to &quot;Hot Boyz&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Bitch&quot;. Also in 1999, Elliott was featured, alongside Da Brat, on the official remix to a Mariah Carey single &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. A music video was filmed for the remix, shot in black and white and featuring a cameo appearance by Dogg. The Desert Storm Remix is acclaimed by music critics and became a cult remix .

Missy Elliott next released &quot;Miss E... So Addictive&quot; on May 15, 2001. The album debuted at number two in the United States and sold 250,000 copies in its first week. It spawned the massive pop and urban hits &quot;One Minute Man&quot; (as to which MTV wrote: &quot;Missy Elliott Plays Dr. Ruth On New Single&quot;), featuring Ludacris and Trina, and &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot;, as well as the international club hit &quot;4 My People&quot; and the less commercially successful single &quot;Take Away&quot;. The double music video for &quot;Take Away/4 My People&quot; was released in the fall of 2001, shortly after the sudden death of Elliott&#x27;s close friend Aaliyah on August 25 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The &quot;Take Away&quot; video contained images of and words about Aaliyah, and the slow ballad acted as a tribute to her memory. The remainder of the video was the more upbeat &quot;4 My People&quot;, contained scenes of people dancing happily in front of American flags and Elliott dressed in red, white and blue. Though &quot;Take Away&quot; was not a success on radio, &quot;4 My People&quot; went on to become an American and European club hit due to a popular remix by house music duo Basement Jaxx in 2002.

Tweet&#x27;s appearance on Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Take Away&quot; as well as her cameo at Elliott&#x27;s house on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; helped to create a buzz about the new R&amp;B singer. Tweet&#x27;s own debut single, &quot;Oops (Oh My)&quot;, was co-written by Elliott and released through Goldmind in February 2002. The single was a top ten hit, thanks partially to Elliott&#x27;s songwriting and guest rap, and to Timbaland&#x27;s unusual production on the track. Elliott co-produced the Christina Aguilera, Lil&#x27; Kim, Mýa and Pink cover of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; for the album &quot;Moulin Rouge! Music from Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Film&quot;, which went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 2001.

=== 2002–2004: &quot;Under Construction&quot; and &quot;This Is Not a Test!&quot; ===
For her next outing, Elliott and Timbaland focused on an old school sound, utilizing many old school rap and funk samples, such as Run–DMC&#x27;s &quot;Peter Piper&quot; and Frankie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Double Dutch Bus&quot;. Elliott&#x27;s fourth album, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Under Construction&quot; (see 2002 in music) is known as the best selling women rap album with 2.1 million copies sold in the United States. In 2002, Elliott won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Under Construction&quot; received Grammy nominations for Best Rap Album and Album of the Year. &quot;The New York Times&quot; designated &quot;Under Construction&quot; &quot;this year&#x27;s best hip-hop album&quot;. Elliott released two singles off of Under Construction. The lead single, &quot;Work It&quot; reached No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart and won the &quot;Video of the Year&quot; award at MTV&#x27;s Video Music Awards. The second single, &quot;Gossip Folks&quot; featuring Ludacris, became a Top 10 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart, was one of the most-played music videos on MTV, MTV2, MTV Jams, and BET in 2003 and was embraced by the dance community, as well as the mainstream, due to a Fatboy Slim remix. A third single was never released, though a video was shot for &quot;Back In The Day&quot; featuring Jay-Z and Elliott was.

In between albums, Elliott produced the &quot;American Dream Remix&quot; (featuring Tweet&#x27;s additional vocals) of Madonna&#x27;s single &quot;American Life&quot;, was featured rapper on Timbaland &amp; Magoo&#x27;s return single, &quot;Cop That Shit&quot;, and produced &quot;Fighting Temptation&quot; (featuring herself, Beyoncé, Free and MC Lyte) for the soundtrack to the Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé Knowles movie of the same name. The track reached No. 1 in Japan but failed to chart in the U.S. Hot 100. Elliott was also featured on Wyclef Jean&#x27;s &quot;Party to Damascus&quot; and Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Tush&quot; singles, the latter of which became a minor 2004 dance hit, and had a pivotal role in the film &quot;Honey&quot;. Gap approached Elliott later in the year to co-star in a commercial with Madonna, which received much media attention. Elliott furthered her relationship with Madonna by performing the controversial 2003 MTV Video Music Awards show opening alongside Madonna, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Also in September 2003, Elliott performed the theme song &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; for the UPN sitcom &quot;Eve&quot; starring her good friend and fellow rapper Eve. It lasted for three seasons.

A year after Elliott&#x27;s most successful album to date was released, Elliott felt pressured by her label to release another album hoping to capitalize on her recent success. Elliott&#x27;s singles, &quot;Pass That Dutch&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Really Hot&quot;, from her fifth album, &quot;This Is Not a Test!&quot; (released November 2003), both rose the urban charts. However, both were not as successful at pop radio in comparison to many of her previous efforts. &quot;This Is Not A Test&quot; sold 690,000 copies in the United States and has been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Elliott has since stated that &quot;the album &quot;This Is Not A Test&quot; came out extremely too quickly for me. I didn&#x27;t want it to come out when it did.&quot; In 2004, Elliott was featured on Ciara&#x27;s hit single &quot;1, 2 Step&quot;, with her verse interpolating Teena Marie&#x27;s single, &quot;Square Biz&quot;. Elliott premiered her own reality show on the UPN Network, &quot;The Road to Stardom with Missy Elliott&quot; in 2005 even though it was not renewed for a second season. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, she sold more than 7.6 million copies in the United States, being a woman rapper with best-selling albums in the country, followed by Lauryn Hill (seven million), Lil&#x27; Kim (four million), and Eve (four million) at the time.

=== 2005–2006: &quot;The Cookbook&quot; ===

Elliott wanted to &quot;give people the unexpected&quot; by utilizing producers other than Timbaland and a &quot;more to the center&quot; sound not as far left as her other music. Her sixth solo album, &quot;The Cookbook&quot; was released on July 4, 2005, debuted at number two on the U.S. charts and was later certified platinum in 2022 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. Elliott&#x27;s work during &quot;The Cookbook&quot; era was heavily recognized. Elliott received 5 Grammy nominations in 2005, including one for Best Rap Album for &quot;The Cookbook&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Lose Control&quot;, won a Grammy for Best Short Form Video and was nominated for Best Rap Song. &quot;Lose Control&quot; also garnered Elliott six 2005 MTV VMA award nominations (winning Best Dance Video and Best Hip-Hop Video). Elliott won Best Female Hip Hop Artist at the 2005 American Music Awards, and was nominated for Best International Female Artist at the 2006 BRIT Awards.

&quot;Lose Control&quot; featuring Ciara and Fatman Scoop, became a Top 5 hit in the midyear (peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). The second single, Teary Eyed, did not chart, although the video charted on MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; for a few weeks, and BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; for a few days. The third single, &quot;We Run This&quot;, was released with heavy airplay on VH1, MTV, and BET. It served as the lead single for the soundtrack to the gymnastics-themed film &quot;Stick It.&quot; The song was also nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Rap Solo Performance category in 2006. &quot;Respect M.E.&quot;, Elliott&#x27;s first greatest hits album, was released outside the United States and Canada on September 4, 2006, only in South Africa, Australia, Europe, Japan, and Brazil. The collection became her second top ten album in the UK and her highest-charting album to date, peaking at number seven there.

=== 2007–2014: Production focus ===
Elliott was an honoree of the 2007 VH1 Hip Hop Honors. In honor of her career, many artists performed some of her biggest hits. Timbaland and Tweet performed &quot;The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)&quot;, Eve and Keyshia Cole performed &quot;Hot Boyz&quot; and &quot;Work It&quot;, Fatman Scoop and Ciara performed &quot;Lose Control&quot;, and Nelly Furtado performed &quot;Get Ur Freak On (The Remix)&quot;. Since 2007, Elliott&#x27;s seventh studio album has had several different forms with extensive delays. In 2007, she worked with Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, Danja, T-Pain and DJ Toomp and planned to release an album at the beginning of 2008. In January 2008, &quot;Ching-a-Ling&quot; was released as the lead single for the &quot;Step Up 2: The Streets&quot; soundtrack, which also featured &quot;Shake Your Pom Pom&quot; produced by Timbaland. Elliott released the song &quot;Best, Best&quot; in the same year and renamed the albums previous title &quot;FANomenal&quot; to its tentative title &quot;Block Party&quot;. She later decided against &quot;Block Party&quot; and four years later, in 2012, Elliott released two Timbaland-produced singles (&quot;9th Inning&quot; and &quot;Triple Threat&quot;) exclusively to iTunes. Though the songs managed to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Digital Songs, in an interview with Yahoo&#x27;s The Yo Show, Missy talked about her hiatus from making records: &quot;Your brain needs time to refresh! Things happen in your life where you can then write something else instead of the same three topics. Like, how many times we gonna talk about the club? I gotta feel like what I&#x27;m giving the fans is 100 percent and that it&#x27;s game-changing. I don&#x27;t just throw out microwave records.&quot;

In between the recording of her seventh album, Missy Elliott found success behind the scenes. Elliott&#x27;s writing and production helped her reach No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs with Keyshia Cole&#x27;s &quot;Let It Go&quot; (2007), Jazmine Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Need U Bad&quot; (2008), and Monica&#x27;s &quot;Everything to Me&quot; (2010). Since 2008, songs written and/or produced by Elliott for Fantasia (&quot;Free Yourself&quot;), Jennifer Hudson (&quot;I&#x27;m His Only Woman&quot;), Monica (&quot;Everything to Me&quot;), Keyshia Cole (&quot;Let It Go&quot;), and Jazmine Sullivan (&quot;Need U Bad&quot; and &quot;Holding You Down (Goin&#x27; in Circles)&quot;) have all received Grammy nominations. Both Fantasia&#x27;s &quot;Free Yourself&quot; (2005) and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Holding You Down (Goin&#x27; In Circles)&quot; reached No. 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. In mid-2010, Elliott embarked on a two-part tour with stops in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, while she also performed at VH1&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop Honors: The Dirty South&quot; in a tribute to Timbaland, performing &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot; and &quot;Work It&quot;. In 2008 she made an appearance in &quot;Whatcha Think About That&quot; by The Pussycat Dolls, and performed live in different places with them. In 2011 and 2012, Elliott made guest appearances on &quot;All Night Long&quot; by Demi Lovato, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot; by J. Cole, the remix of &quot;Why Stop Now&quot; by Busta Rhymes with Chris Brown and Lil Wayne, and a remix of Katy Perry&#x27;s &quot;Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)&quot; that helped catapult &quot;T.G.I.F&quot;. to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She also produced Monica&#x27;s singles &quot;Anything (To Find You)&quot; and &quot;Until It&#x27;s Gone&quot;.

Throughout 2013, Missy Elliott was featured on Eve&#x27;s album cut &quot;Wanna Be&quot;, as well as international artists singles, Little Mix&#x27;s &quot;How Ya Doin&#x27;?&quot; and &quot;NiLiria&quot; with K-pop musician G-Dragon, which was named by &quot;Complex&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;50 Best Songs of 2013&quot;. Elliott also contributed to her protégée Sharaya J&#x27;s two releases, &quot;Banji&quot; and &quot;Smash Up The Place/Snatch Yo Wigs&quot;. In December 2013, Elliott received a Grammy nomination with Fantasia and Kelly Rowland for their song &quot;Without Me&quot;. As early as July 2013, Missy Elliott and Timbaland held recording sessions for Kat Dahlia&#x27;s debut, &quot;My Garden&quot; (2015). In August 2013, R&amp;B singer Faith Evans revealed that Missy Elliott would be featured on her sixth studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Incomparable&quot;. In March 2014, Evans revealed one of the tracks was named &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, featuring Missy and her protégée Sharaya J, in which Evans cited it as a &quot;banger&quot; and &quot;feel good&quot; record. Evans also revealed that in total Elliott contributed three tracks to her album. On July 7, 2014, fellow R&amp;B singer Monica confirmed that Elliott would be a feature on her upcoming eighth studio album. On July 29, 2014, a snippet of a Missy Elliott–produced song, nickname &quot;I Love Him&quot;, premiered on Monica&#x27;s official Instagram account.

=== 2015–2018: Super Bowl XLIX halftime show and singles ===
In 2015, Elliott performed at the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show with Katy Perry. Elliott performed a medley of &quot;Get Ur Freak On&quot;, &quot;Work It&quot;, and &quot;Lose Control&quot;. The performance was well-received, and boosted digital sales of Elliott&#x27;s work that week, with a twenty-five-fold increase in album sales (to 2,000 units) and a ten-fold increase in sales of the three songs she performed (to 71,000 units) compared to the week before. It also became the most watched Super Bowl halftime show in NFL history, receiving 118.5 million viewers in the United States. On February 3, 2015, it was confirmed that Elliott would be a feature on the upcoming remix to Diplo and Skrillex&#x27;s &quot;Take Ü There&quot;. On February 11, Elliott stated that she was still in the process of recording her seventh studio album, &quot;Block Party&quot;, with Timbaland. On April 2, 2015, Pharrell Williams confirmed that he was working on Elliott&#x27;s album during an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. On November 12, 2015, &quot;WTF (Where They From)&quot; and its music video were simultaneously released to digital outlets. By November 19, the song and its video had been streamed 6.1 million times in the US alone, with an additional count of 16 million views per YouTube viewing.

On February 7, 2016, the day of the fiftieth Super Bowl, Elliott released a promotional single, &quot;Pep Rally&quot;. Later that month, Elliott reunited with former protégée Tweet and frequent collaborator Timbaland on the cut &quot;Somebody Else Will&quot; taken from the former&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Charlene&quot;. By March 15, 2016, First Lady Michelle Obama proclaimed that she had assembled a collaborative track featuring vocals from Missy Elliott, Kelly Clarkson, Janelle Monáe and Zendaya alongside production credit from pop songwriter Diane Warren and Elliott titled &quot;This Is for My Girls&quot;. The iTunes-exclusive record will be used to both coincide with Ms. Obama&#x27;s SXSW speech and to promote her third-world educational initiative Let Girls Learn.

Following a surprise appearance with TLC on the 2016 televised special &quot;Taraji&#x27;s White Hot Holidays&quot;, Elliott announced plans to release a documentary chronicling her impact on the production scene in both audio and video. The midnight of January 27, 2017, saw the full-length release to a new Elliott single titled &quot;I&#x27;m Better&quot;, featuring production and vocal assistance from recurring sideman Lamb and shared directing credit by Elliott and longtime colleague Dave Meyers.

In July 2018, Missy Elliott teased fans by appearing on a snippet nicknamed &quot;ID&quot; by Skrillex, released in 2023 as RATATA. One month later, Elliott appeared on the Ariana Grande number &quot;Borderline&quot;, taken from the singer&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Sweetener&quot; (2018). In October 2018, Elliott announced that she is working on her new album, which would be released in 2019. On March 20, 2019, Lizzo released a collaboration with Elliott titled &quot;Tempo&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Extended play and current work===
On June 13, 2019, Elliott was inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame, becoming the first female rapper to receive this honor. Elliott received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. She was also the first female rapper to receive the award. Elliott received the Women&#x27;s Entrepreneurship Day Music Pioneer Award at the United Nations in 2019 in recognition for her achievements in music and being a leader. This award was placed in the Congressional Record.

Elliott released her first extended play on August 23, 2019, titled &quot;Iconology&quot;. The five-track EP features a variety of musical genres that cover the breadth of her career as an artist and has received favorable reviews from critics. Upon release of the album, she also released the lead single, &quot;Throw It Back&quot;, with a music video featuring Teyana Taylor. Musically, &quot;Iconology&quot; is a pop, hip hop and R&amp;B EP reminiscent of Elliott&#x27;s previous work. The opening track, &quot;Throw It Back&quot; contains &quot;trap snares and a serpentine bassline&quot;, which along with the second track, &quot;Cool Off&quot;, were described as &quot;woozy, futuristic romps&quot; containing &quot;distorted bass lines and frenetic production&quot;. Lyrically, &quot;Throw It Back&quot; contains references to Elliott&#x27;s history, as well as previous collaborators Tweet and Heavy D. Maura Johnson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described &quot;Cool Off&quot; as calling &quot;back to hip-hop&#x27;s two-turntables-and-a-mic early days&quot;. &quot;DripDemeanor&quot; has been described as a slow jam that explores Elliott&#x27;s &quot;sensuous side&quot;. Musically, it contains &quot;plush synths [that] skip-step underneath&quot; the song&#x27;s beat. &quot;Why I Still Love You&quot; is a doo-wop song with gospel influences and jazz influence that lyrically chronicles the singer&#x27;s &quot;conflicted emotions about holding on to a cheating lover&quot;. The EP closes with an a cappella version of &quot;Why I Still Love You&quot;.

Elliott was motivated to write uplifting music to counter mainstream trends and encourage more dance music to feel good. &quot;DripDemeanor&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on October 22. &quot;Why I Still Love You&quot; was released as the third single on January 17, 2020. &quot;Cool Off&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from the EP on April 21, 2020. On June 26, 2020, Elliott appeared on the official remix to Toni Braxton&#x27;s single &quot;Do It&quot;.
Elliott co-produced the track alongside Hannon Lane. On August 13, 2020, Elliott appeared on the remix single &quot;Levitating&quot; by Dua Lipa which also featured Madonna. The remix was produced by the Blessed Madonna. Unlike Madonna, Elliott appeared in the video. The music video was directed by Will Hooper.

On January 11, 2021, Elliott appeared on the single &quot;ATM&quot; by Bree Runway. She directed the music video for &quot;Twerkulator&quot; by the City Girls in July 2021.

On February 17, 2023, Elliott appeared on the track &quot;RATATA&quot; produced by Skrillex and Mr. Oizo, the second track on Skrillex&#x27;s LP &quot;Quest For Fire&quot;. This release confirmed rumors from 2018 regarding this collaboration, rumors that resurfaced in the months before the track&#x27;s release as both Skrillex and Elliot teased the track on social media. On 23 March 2023, British group Flo released the single &quot;Fly Girl&quot;, featuring Elliott; the song interpolates Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Work It&quot;, plus new rap section.

On April 8, 2024, Elliott announced “Out of This World: The Missy Elliott Experience Tour,” the rapper&#x27;s first headlining tour of her career. The tour began on July 4 in Vancouver, Canada and featured Timbaland, Busta Rhymes and Ciara as its opening acts.

== Other ventures ==

=== Film ===
In 2005, there were plans to make a biographical film about the life story of Elliott. It was to be co-produced by Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal, and written by Diane Houston. In mid-June 2007, Elliott said she was still working on the script with Houston in order &quot;to come up with the right stuff &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t want it to be watered down. I want it to be raw and uncut the way my life was.&quot; Initially, it seemed Timbaland would not be a part of the movie. When Missy asked him, he refused, believing this dramatized his character; &quot;the movie is about her life, her story, that goes deeper than putting me into the movie&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2002, Elliott wrote a letter on behalf of PETA to the mayor of her hometown Portsmouth, Virginia, asking that all shelter animals be neutered/spayed before being adopted. For the reality TV show &quot;The Road to Stardom&quot;, there was a contest for viewers to create a public service ad for the Break the Cycle fund.

In 2004, she joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to promote their &quot;Viva Glam&quot; campaign. In addition to the ad campaign, Elliott promoted the MAC Viva Glam V lipstick from which 100% of the sale goes to the MAC AIDS Fund.

In 2007, Elliott appeared on an ABC&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Makeover&quot; and awarded four scholarships for a weight loss program to four underprivileged teens.

In August 2017, a 27-year-old Virginia man named Nathan Coflin began a Change.org petition that gained over 30,000 signatures in support of a statue to honor Elliott&#x27;s philanthropic endeavors to be erected in her hometown of Portsmouth, Virginia. On the petition&#x27;s proposed site for this statue a Confederate Monument previously stood. This led to widespread media coverage in several national publications including The Washington Post, HuffPost, Newsweek and &quot;Time Magazine&quot;.

In October 2022, a portion of McLean Street in Portsmouth, Virginia was renamed &quot;Missy Elliott Boulevard&quot;.

== Legacy and impact ==

Elliott has been referred to as the &quot;Queen of Rap&quot;, the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop&quot;, and the &quot;First Lady of Hip Hop&quot; by several media outlets. Elliott&#x27;s experimental concepts in her music videos changed the landscape of what a hip-hop video had as themes at the time. Her catalogue of songs have included themes of feminism, gender equality, body positivity and sex positivity since the beginning of her career, being one of the first to center on these topics among hip-hop and R&amp;B performers. &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; considered her America&#x27;s first Black female music mogul, as she gained in 2001 total control over her image and music, and the opportunity to sign artists. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Ted Kessler stated that, with her studio albums, she has &quot;revolutionized the sound of R&amp;B and hip-hop&quot; and reintroduced the notion &quot;of fun and fantasy&quot; to urban Black music—a style that matched the &quot;futuristic, much-copied new sound&quot; of her 1997 debut album, &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot;. Destiny&#x27;s Child, Eve and Macy Gray have credited her for &quot;clearing a path&quot; in the American music industry towards &quot;their own pop pre-eminence&quot; as Black female R&amp;B/hip-hop performers. The Recording Academy and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; have called her a &quot;hip hop icon&quot;. &quot;The Economist&quot; considered that Elliott &quot;is to rap what Prince was to R&amp;B&quot; due to their &quot;impact upon the genre&quot; and her ability to &quot;weave in styles and strands from outside it.&quot;

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated that Elliott became the first Black female rapper to reach the mainstream in Middle America. An article from &quot;Vibe&quot; credits Elliott&#x27;s debut album &quot;Supa Dupa Fly&quot; for &quot;changing the rap game for women&quot;, noting the rapper&#x27;s &quot;refusal to be pigeonholed&quot; with her image, and instead, embraced &quot;the complexities inherent with Black womanhood&quot;, with the author commenting that female rappers tend to be placed into one of two categories: androgyny or hyper-sexualization. &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Bulletin&quot; have called her the &quot;Queen of the Beats&quot;. Jem Aswad of &quot;Variety&quot; commented that Elliott and longtime collaborator Timbaland &quot;reshaped the sound of hip-hop&quot;, as they made songs &quot;out of pings and bips and bloops (both vocal and electronic) that quickly became part of the foundation of virtually all that followed.&quot; Similarly, Doreen St. Félix of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that her debut album &quot;expanded the definition of rap&quot; and &quot;defined a new hip-hop aesthetic&quot;, with Elliott and Timbaland developing a grammar by &quot;collecting extra-musical noises&quot;, &quot;crafting&quot; a new R&amp;B sound, and incorporating a &quot;singsong technique&quot; in her flow. The author noted that, a generation later, the majority of rappers &quot;are also vocalists&quot;. For &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Gerrick D. Kennedy, Elliott &quot;ushered in a new era of creatively ambitious music videos.&quot; The aesthetic for the music video for &quot;The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)&quot; inspired several others released afterward. Commercially, Missy Elliott led female hip hop album sales during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Missy Elliott in addition to Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and The Clipse are considered to have an intricate part of establishing Virginia as one of the East Coast&#x27;s strongholds in hip hop. As of 2015, she has remained the best selling female rap album artist in the US. ABC website editor Gab Burke expressed that Elliott &quot;railed against the male-dominated mainstream rap scene throughout her career, constantly pushed the boundaries, and cemented a place for women in hip hop.&quot;

Elliott has influenced various musicians, both visually and vocally. Her work has been cited as an inspiration by acts such as Cardi B, Lil Wayne, Lizzo, Tyler, the Creator, Solange Knowles, Chloe Bailey, M.I.A., Janelle Monáe, Anderson .Paak, Rapsody, Ciara, Bree Runway, Doja Cat, Ivy Queen, Ari Lennox, Tayla Parx, Sean Bankhead, ASAP Ferg, Leikeli47, Tierra Whack, Noname, Okenyo, Little Simz, Coda Conduct, Dawn Richard, Banks, Rich the Kid, Crystal Caines, Coi Leray, Lady Leshurr, Stefflon Don, Flo Milli, Krept and Konan, Rye Rye, Le1f, Qveen Herby and Erica Banks.

== Achievements ==

Elliott has won four Grammy Awards, eight MTV Video Music Awards, two American Music Awards, six BET Awards, and a Billboard Women in Music award for Innovator. On June 13, 2019, Elliott was inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame, becoming the first female rapper to receive this honor, and the third overall, following Jay-Z and Jermaine Dupri. Also in 2019, Elliott received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music, and became the first female rapper to receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award by MTV.

In 2018, Elliott received &quot;Essence&quot; magazine&#x27;s Black Women In Music honor, and in 2019, she was presented with the Women&#x27;s Entrepreneurship Day Music Pioneer Award at the United Nations. In 2020, Urban One presented her with the Music Innovation Award.

In May 2021, Elliott was among the inaugural inductees for the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. In November 2021, Elliott was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 

In December 2022, Elliott received a second honorary doctorate, this time from Norfolk State University, who also helped rename a Portsmouth street after her. She was also presented with a key to the city of Portsmouth.

In 2023, she became the first female hip-hop artist to receive a nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, when she was nominated in her first year of eligibility. In November 2023, Elliot became the first female rapper in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

== Personal life ==
Elliott said in 2008 that she wanted to start a family but was afraid of giving birth, stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can take that kind of pain. Maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and it&#x27;d be fine. But right now I&#x27;d rather just adopt.&quot;

In June 2011, Elliott told &quot;People&quot; magazine that her absence from the music industry was due to having Graves&#x27; disease, with which she was diagnosed after she nearly crashed her car from having severe leg spasms while driving. She experienced severe symptoms from the condition and could not even hold a pen to write songs. After treatment, her symptoms stabilized.

<text>ITV Channel Television, previously Channel Television, is a British television station which has served as the ITV contractor for the Channel Islands since 1962. It is based in Jersey and broadcasts regional programmes for insertion into the network ITV schedule. Until November 2011, Channel Television was one of four ITV companies independent from ITV plc alongside the two STV regions in Scotland and UTV in Northern Ireland. The station has been owned by ITV plc since 2012 and the licence was transferred to ITV Broadcasting Limited in March 2017.

Until the takeover by ITV plc, Channel Television also had a responsibility to ensure independent productions for ITV complied with the regulator Ofcom&#x27;s broadcasting rules. Until the regulations changed, Ofcom could only impose a maximum fine of 5% of the revenue of the company responsible for compliance, and as Channel was by far the smallest ITV contractor, this minimised the potential fines to which ITV as a whole would be exposed. Channel handled compliance for programmes including &quot;The X Factor&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and the &quot;British Comedy Awards&quot;.

The station&#x27;s main competitor is the BBC, which operates an opt-out of the South West England news programme &quot;Spotlight&quot;.

== History ==
=== Launch ===
Channel Television was awarded the licence for the islands in 1960 by the then regulator the Independent Television Authority (ITA). However, the ITA pointed out that the Television Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 55) that established ITV did not include provision for the Channel Islands and as a result, if the ITA was to operate an ITV service there, it would have to be permitted by means of extending the act to the islands with an Order in Council, which was granted as the Television Act 1954 (Channel Islands) Order 1961 (SI 1961/2039). In addition, the new station faced difficulties connecting to the rest of the ITV network. The solution was the construction of a microwave relay station on the northern island of Alderney that would connect with another ITV station, initially Westward Television. At first, the station received difficulties in getting permission for the new mast, but these were overcome in September 1961.

Channel Television finally went on the air on 1 September 1962, the 16th ITV station to launch. It served the smallest population of any ITV station with only around 150,000 people in 54,000 households.

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
The size of Channel&#x27;s audience made the station initially vulnerable to any disputes and disturbances to the ITV network as a whole. When technicians went on strike in the summer of 1968, Channel was the only station not to be affected. While Channel did survive the 1968 strike, it was badly affected by the Three-Day Week of 1973-4 which restricted the hours of television stations to save electricity. However, Channel managed to escape the large ITV strike that blacked out the rest of the network in August–October 1979, on the same understanding as before. Channel managed to provide a service based mainly on films, imports, extended local news coverage and regional programming, with the biggest problem coming from difficulties in transporting film to the Jersey studios.

Channel also made advances during this period to enhance its service. In 1970, Channel formalised its relationship with South West England ITV franchisee holder Westward Television allowing a greater share of programming between the two franchise holders. Channel finally converted to colour television on Monday 26 July 1976, the last region to do so (five years after the next to last contractor, Grampian Television, began colour transmissions) and seven years after the first. Delays were due to the cost of upgrading the studios and purchasing new equipment and the need to provide a stronger network feed as the region&#x27;s northernmost areas got better signals from Southern and Thames/London Weekend. All local programmes were being made in colour by the following year with Channel donating all of its old cameras to local museums. Just before the 1979 ITV strike began, Channel became only the second TV station in Europe to introduce electronic news-gathering (ENG) to its local news operation (BBC1 had used ENG for London-originated news since at least 1978), ending the use of film.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
The new decade began with a new franchise round for the islands in which Channel was unopposed. However, there was to be a change of franchise in the South West of England with Westward being replaced by Television South West (TSW), requiring a new agreement with TSW. However, in 1986 Channel changed from whom it sourced its network feed, instead changing to Television South (TVS) which served the South and South East of England from Southampton and Maidstone. A side-effect of this change was a disruption to serials airing on the station in the afternoon due to the serial having begun on TVS at a different time to TSW so that they were at a different point through the serial&#x27;s run. For instance, Channel had to miss over 100 episodes of &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, the first nine episodes of &quot;Prisoner Cell Block H&quot; which had been screened on TVS in 1985, and it had to re-show 60 episodes of &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; as TVS was behind TSW. The new feed also meant that Channel simulcast TVS&#x27;s night time schedule following the launch of this programming area in 1988. Channel&#x27;s night time schedule from that point onwards always simulcast the service seen on TVS and its successor Meridian.

During this period, the station began to invest in technology. A local service for the Oracle teletext service began in 1981, delivering local news and information. Local news was also enhanced with the first underwater ENG camera, created for footage of a Roman shipwreck, and a year later with the introduction of a computerised newsroom, the first of the ITV regions to convert.

In 1991, the station faced a new challenge: that of a new franchise round. Following the Broadcasting Act of the previous year, the allocation of regional franchises had changed to become a blind auction in which the franchise went to the highest bidder. This process was further complicated by a quality threshold, in which a higher bidder could be disqualified for having a poor business plan or if its high bid would result in a lack of funds for the programmes themselves. In the franchise round, Channel bid £1,000 (the lowest bid accepted) and was out-bid by challenge consortium CI3. CI3, formed in part of ex-Channel employees, bid £102,000, but was disqualified as it failed to pass the quality threshold. Channel had won the right to continue broadcasting beyond 1993. As another consequence of the franchise round, Channel began local news broadcasts during breakfast time as part of GMTV&#x27;s new service.

In 1996, Channel began a subtitling service for its local programmes.

=== 2000 to present ===
In 2001, Channel was bought by the Yattendon Investment Trust, although the buy-out did not lead to a noticeable change on screen. The buy-out occurred at the same time as the full scale amalgamation of ITV with many of the regional franchises becoming owned by one of four consortia: Carlton, Granada, United News and Media and Scottish Media Group. Channel subsequently remained one of two franchises to be not part of a consortium (the other being UTV). When Carlton and Granada (which by then also included the United News and Media franchises) merged to form ITV plc in 2004, Channel remained separate from this new merger. Channel&#x27;s independence from ITV plc also saw it retain its much loved regional non-news programmes when other regions saw this type of programming dropped.
Despite being a small station, Channel took on a role in ensuring that ITV&#x27;s independently produced programmes complied with the UK&#x27;s guidelines and laws. On 18 May 2008, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper reported that ITV plc was using Channel&#x27;s compliance role as a loophole, enabling it to lessen a possible fine for breaching Ofcom regulations during the 2005 &quot;British Comedy Awards&quot;. During the programme Robbie Williams presented an award to Ant and Dec which should have gone to Catherine Tate who had received a greater number of phone-in votes. For this breach, Ofcom fined the broadcaster, which was worked out as a maximum of 5% of the offending broadcaster&#x27;s advertising revenue. However, as the programme was independently produced Channel is seen as the offending broadcaster for not ensuring compliance, despite Channel having no role in commissioning the programme. Therefore, any fines received are minimal as Channel&#x27;s advertising income was by far the smallest of all the ITV companies.

In early 2008, Channel began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen, approximately a decade after the rest of the network became widescreen capable with the launch of digital terrestrial television. The Channel Islands also completed the switchover from analogue to digital television signals in November 2010.

In 2011, Channel Television was bought from the Yattendon Group by ITV plc. The deal was announced on 18 October, subject to approval from the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority, and was completed on 23 November. Although not announced, the deal was thought to have been worth at least £10 million. Following ITV&#x27;s 2013 rebrand, Channel&#x27;s presentation and the title of its news programme have been brought into line with the other ITV regions, although sporadic non-news programming remains.

== Studios ==
Channel Television operates two studios: the Jersey headquarters at Castle Quay on the St Helier waterfront and a Guernsey studio at Television House in Bulwer Avenue in St. Sampson, a building shared with BBC Radio Guernsey.

In Jersey, Channel&#x27;s first headquarters were a purpose-built centre at the corner of Rouge Bouillon and Val Plaisant, housing one main 1,000 sq.ft. studio for all local productions and a continuity suite. As the company expanded, Channel moved into larger facilities in 1988 at La Pouquelaye, converted from the former offices of Rediffusion&#x27;s Jersey operation. Initially, the La Pouquelaye centre housed two production studios (the smaller studio B was latterly converted into offices) and a continuity studio, later used exclusively for &quot;Puffin&#x27;s Pla(i)ce&quot;. Channel moved to its current, smaller premises at Castle Quay in June 2015.

Channel&#x27;s Guernsey operation was founded upon the station&#x27;s launch in a hotel in Saint Peter Port, moving to Market Square in 1967, from where a microwave link with the Jersey headquarters was established in 1971, allowing live studio contributions from the island to be broadcast for the first time. In 1983, Channel in Guernsey moved again to larger facilities at St George&#x27;s Esplanade, from where &quot;Channel Report&quot; was presented on a regular basis. The current Guernsey base in St. Sampson, including a small multi-camera studio, was opened in 1997.

Channel also previously had a London office, latterly based near to The London Studios, from where it ran its third-party compliance business.

== Identity ==
Channel Television&#x27;s first on screen logo featured six hexagons, laid out five below linked together with one on top with a stylised cat&#x27;s head inside it. The five hexagons below represent the five main channel islands: Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark and Herm. The ident was animated so that each hexagon appeared in turn accompanied by one note of the jingle along with the name. This ident lasted until colour came to the region in the mid-1970s with only one slight variation in the positioning of the channel name.

The first colour ident used by Channel involved a striped CTV, which would serve as the station logo until 1999. The first ident featured this static logo made of orange stripes on a white outline against a blue background with a soundtrack of a brass fanfare titled &quot;Superstar Fanfare&quot;, composed by Keith Mansfield. This same fanfare was later used when Channel launched its next ident, featuring the lines of the CTV logo spinning into place, coloured gold against a black background. This was introduced around 1985 and was utilised for the station&#x27;s 25th Anniversary in 1987, when each line of the CTV logo was drawn out before spinning back to be joined by a striped 25.

In the early 1990s Channel aired its first computer generated ident, featuring the CTV logo, initially silver but turned gold by two sideways flashes, falling backwards onto the gradiented blue background. This logo was accompanied by a dramatic score which was later improved, along with the ident, in 1993. The improvements kept the theme and repositioned the logo, changed the background to a navy blue, made the logo itself bigger and gold throughout and, most noticeably, improved the music making it less dramatic and giving it a softer feel.

Both during this period and before, Channel used an on-air clock. The other ITV regions in the 1970s up to the very early 1990s, commonly used a clock as well, but it had been gradually been dropped. Channel kept the clock up to 2002, using it to introduce news and, more unusually, announce the local temperature and tide times prior to the following programme (something not seen elsewhere in the ITV network).

In 1998, Channel adopted a different style of presentation. The CTV logo remained, both on end captions and as the company logo, while on screen Channel utilised the device of the word &#x27;Channel&#x27; written in a variety of fonts arranged in circles and moving, spinning and pulsating to a tune of a simple jingle. This look was not to last as the second ITV generic look occurred in 1999, which Channel adopted. This look, based on the theme of hearts, also provided Channel with a new logo, featuring a globe with the Channel Islands on it being orbited by two comets whose trails make a heart shape. Channel used the generic look, albeit with its own soundtrack, until 2002. The generic look was used for network programmes with regional ones using a large Channel logo over the spinning hearts background. When the celebrity idents came Channel used a variation, where the left side of the screen was taken up by its logo. A number of idents were used featuring different celebrities and some local ones made by Channel themselves were used; in 2002 a special ident to celebrate the channels 40th Anniversary was introduced featuring former station logos.

In late 2004 Channel used idents of scenes from around the Channel Islands, with the logo in a stripe down the left side of the screen. Some elements of the network branding were also used.
In 2006, Channel, whilst being fiercely independent and regional, adopted a variation of the national ITV1 network branding and shared continuity, due to it receiving a non-clean feed of networked programming from ITV Meridian. While the branding was very similar to regions owned by ITV plc Channel Television used an older ITV1 logo with white letters on its idents supplemented by the wording &#x27;Channel Television&#x27; and pre-recorded local continuity announcements are used at key junctions - including prior to national and regional news and on the handover from ITV Breakfast at 9.25am. Typically this is &quot;This is Channel Television, ITV in the Channel Islands&quot;, or at the handover from ITV Breakfast, &quot;It&#x27;s 9.25 and you&#x27;re watching Channel Television, your local ITV station&quot;. These idents also use music from the original emotion idents rather than the updated jingle and music. It was the only ITV company to take the network branding without being a part of ITV plc.

Following the takeover in November 2011, Channel began using ITV1&#x27;s 2010 logo and updated its idents.

On 14 January 2013, the station&#x27;s on-air identity was changed to ITV, along with all other ITV plc-owned franchises. There are no specific idents stating Channel Television but the name is instead verbally referred to at the 6pm junctions before &quot;ITV News Channel TV&quot; and for a time it was used overnight.

<text>Michael Lawrence Tyler (born September 22, 1970), better known by his stage name Mystikal, is an American rapper and actor from New Orleans, Louisiana. He is noted for brash, obstreperous vocal delivery, characterized by a Southern . He signed with local record label Big Boy Records to release his self-titled debut studio album (1994), which was re-released by Jive Records the following year as his major label debut, &quot;Mind of Mystikal&quot; (1995). He then parted ways with the former label in favor of its local competitor, Master P&#x27;s No Limit Records, through which he released his second and third albums, &quot;Unpredictable&quot; (1997) and &quot;Ghetto Fabulous&quot; (1998), as well as &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1999) as a member of its flagship group, 504 Boyz. Following his departure from No Limit, he remained with Jive to release his 2000 singles &quot;Shake Ya Ass&quot; (featuring Pharrell Williams) and &quot;Danger (Been So Long)&quot; (featuring Nivea), which peaked at numbers 13 and 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. Both preceded the release of his fourth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot; (2000), which debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Early life and education==
Tyler grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana&#x27;s 12th Ward. His father, who ran a small neighborhood store, died when Tyler was seven. He attended Cohen High School and afterward joined the United States Army as a combat engineer. As an aspiring rapper, he opened for Run-DMC and Doug E. Fresh at an outdoor concert at the Treme Center. Leroy &quot;Precise&quot; Edwards, the house producer for Big Boy Records, was in the audience, and granted him a contract.

==Career==
===1994–1996: Early career and stint with Big Boy Records===
Mystikal&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mystikal&quot;, was released on New Orleans–based independent record label Big Boy in 1994. The album was one of Big Boy&#x27;s most successful albums and gained major success for Mystikal. In 1995, he found himself involved in conflict with fellow New Orleans rappers signed to rival Cash Money, including U.N.L.V. and The B.G.&#x27;z. They dissed him on tracks like &quot;Drag &#x27;Em in Tha River&quot; by U.N.L.V. and &quot;Fuck Big Boy&quot; by The B.G.&#x27;z. He struck back with &quot;Beware&quot; and &quot;Here I Go&quot; which were on his second album, &quot;Mind of Mystikal&quot;. Mystikal&#x27;s sister, Michelle Tyler, sang the chorus on &quot;Not That Nigga&quot; and her fate became a major influence on Mystikal&#x27;s music after her death in September 1994. The songs &quot;Dedicated to Michelle Tyler&quot;, &quot;Murder&quot; (both on &quot;Mind of Mystikal&quot;), &quot;Murder 2&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot; (both on &quot;Unpredictable&quot;) and &quot;Murder III&quot; (on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot;) refer to her death. Mystikal and Lil Wayne would eventually squash their feud and become collaborators.

===1995–2000: &quot;Mind of Mystikal&quot; and stint with No Limit===
Mystikal signed to Jive and released &quot;Mind of Mystikal&quot; in 1995. He signed to Master P&#x27;s No Limit in 1996 and released &quot;Unpredictable&quot; in November 1997. He appeared on many of the No Limit albums released from 1997 through a chunk of 2000. He also collaborated with Mariah Carey on her &quot;Rainbow&quot; album on the track &#x27;Did I Do That&#x27;. In late 1998, he released &quot;Ghetto Fabulous&quot;. That was his last album with the label, and he and No Limit parted ways in 2000.

===2000–2004: &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot;, &quot;Tarantula&quot; and prison===
In 1999, he had begun recording his fourth album before leaving No Limit. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot; was released in 2000 and contained &quot;Danger (Been So Long)&quot;, which featured rising pop star Nivea, and was the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs number-one single in June 2001. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Ready&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Mystikal&#x27;s only chart-topping album to date. The album also featured the popular, Neptunes-produced hit &quot;Shake Ya Ass&quot;. The song attained cult-like popularity and can be heard in the background of numerous movies.

Mystikal&#x27;s most recent solo release was the 2001 album &quot;Tarantula&quot;, which contained the hit single, &quot;Bouncin&#x27; Back (Bumpin&#x27; Me Against The Wall)&quot;. Though it presented Mystikal&#x27;s typical and funky flow style, which had the distinction of drawing comparison to legendary R&amp;B soul screamers Little Richard and James Brown, the song also saw a blending of jazz and swing elements with hip-hop. The well received album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album in 2003, and Mystikal was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance that same year. Mystikal was also featured prominently in the single, &quot;Move Bitch&quot; by Ludacris as well as &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; by Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz along with Krayzie Bone, both in 2002. In 2003 he starred in the film &quot;13 Dead Men&quot;. In 2003, Mystikal was indicted on charges of sexual battery and extortion. On January 15, 2004, he was sentenced to six years in prison after pleading guilty to forcing his hairstylist to perform sex acts. He served the full six years of his sentence and was released on January 14, 2010.

===Since 2010===

Mystikal headlined a concert at the Mahalia Jackson Theater of the Performing Arts on Mardi Gras, February 16, 2010. Mystikal&#x27;s first song after being released from prison was an underground track with former No Limit labelmate Fiend entitled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like You&quot;. A few weeks later, Atlanta-based, New Orleans–born R&amp;B artist Lloyd released &quot;Set Me Free&quot; featuring Mystikal. The music video for &quot;Set Me Free&quot; was released on May 18, 2010, and was shot in New Orleans, primarily from the Calliope Projects.
In an interview in May 2010, he stated that he was still obligated to Jive Records for one more album and would be taking the necessary time to ensure the album would be his best to date. He made a promo song called &quot;Papercuts&quot; featuring Fiend and Lil Wayne. In 2011, he performed at the Gathering of the Juggalos. Mystikal and Busta Rhymes were signed to Cash Money Records by Birdman on November 16 the same year. His first single for the label, &quot;Original&quot;, was released shortly thereafter and featured new label-mates Birdman and Lil Wayne.

In 2014, Mystikal guest performed on the single &quot;Feel Right&quot; for Mark Ronson&#x27;s album &quot;Uptown Special&quot;. The song and video were released in 2015.

Also in 2015, Mystikal appeared on Stevie Stone&#x27;s Single &quot;Rain Dance&quot; with Tech N9ne from the 2015 release &quot;Malta Bend&quot;.

In January 2016, he performed in shows in Bahrain and Bulgaria with Danny! In February 2016, Mystikal toured the United States.

In April 2016, Mystikal was featured on &quot;Just a Lil&#x27; Thick (She Juicy)&quot; by Trinidad James along with Lil Dicky.

In 2017, he was featured on &quot;FYM&quot; by Joyner Lucas, from his commercial mixtape &quot;508-507-2209&quot;.

==Personal life==
On his 24th birthday, Mystikal found his sister Michelle Tyler dead in her bedroom, having been stabbed and strangled. Her boyfriend at the time, Damion Neville, was charged with murder but later was acquitted due to a lack of evidence and a recanted confession.

===Sexual battery conviction and other legal issues===
On June 26, 2003, Mystikal pleaded guilty to sexual battery and extortion of his hairstylist. On January 15, 2004, Mystikal was sentenced to six years in state prison. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex, and accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. As part of a plea bargain, all three pleaded guilty. Mystikal initially claimed that the incident was consensual, but a videotape of the incident was later found at his home shortly after the charges were made. Negotiations during the trial held the videotape from being entered as evidence and Mystikal agreed to the plea bargain offered by the prosecution, avoiding the mandatory life sentence for sexual battery in Louisiana and expecting to receive probation. However, the case took a twist when the judge viewed the videotape at the sentencing, took into account Mystikal&#x27;s two prior arrests (for drug and gun possession), and had him remanded into custody to begin serving a six-year sentence immediately. Mystikal&#x27;s bodyguards, Leland Ellis and Vercy Carter, also pleaded guilty to sexual battery.

In August 2005, while incarcerated on the state sexual battery and extortion charges, Mystikal was charged federally with two misdemeanor counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999. On January 12, 2006, he was convicted in federal court of the tax offenses, but was allowed to serve the one-year federal sentence concurrent with his six-year state sentence. Mystikal was incarcerated at Louisiana&#x27;s Elayn Hunt Correctional Center. On January 19, 2006, Mystikal was denied parole at a parole board hearing. On January 11, 2007, Mystikal was released from custody on the federal misdemeanor tax convictions (as his one-year sentence had expired), but he remained in custody on the six-year sentence for the Louisiana state felony convictions. The news of his release caused confusion among fans who heard the news and mistakenly thought he had been released on parole. He was released January 14, 2010. After his release, Mystikal was registered as a sex offender.

On February 22, 2012, Mystikal was arrested again following a dispute with his domestic partner and was later given a misdemeanor charge of domestic abuse battery. He was detained for nine days and then released on bail. On April 16, he was given a three-month jail sentence for violating the terms of his probation he was given following his release from prison in January 2010. He was given credit for the nine days already served, reducing his confinement to 81 days. He began serving his sentence on May 14 at the East Baton Rouge Parish Jail. During his incarceration, he appeared in court to be heard on the domestic battery charges as well as for a hearing to determine child support payments for his two youngest children. Mystikal was released from jail in August 2012.

On August 21, 2017, Mystikal turned himself into the Caddo Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Department after a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was subsequently charged with rape. He was held at the Caddo Correctional Center on a $3 million bond until February 14, 2019, when he was able to post bond.

<doc id="180528" wikidata="Q314550" url="?curid=180528" title="Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany">
<text>Geoffrey II (; , ; 23 September 1158 – 19 August 1186) was Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond between 1181 and 1186, through his marriage to Constance, Duchess of Brittany. Geoffrey was the fourth of five sons of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.
==Life==

In the 1160s, Henry II began to alter his policy of indirect rule in Brittany and to exert more direct control. Henry had been at war with Conan IV, Duke of Brittany. Local Breton nobles rebelled against Conan, so Conan sought Henry II&#x27;s help. In 1164, Henry intervened to seize lands along the border of Brittany and Normandy and, in 1166, he invaded Brittany to punish the local barons. Henry then forced Conan to abdicate as duke and to give Brittany to his five-year-old daughter, Constance, who was handed over and betrothed to Henry&#x27;s son Geoffrey. This arrangement was quite unusual in terms of medieval law, as Conan might have had sons who could have legitimately inherited the duchy. Geoffrey and Constance eventually married, in July 1181.

Growing tensions between Henry and Louis VII of France finally spilled over into open war in 1167, triggered by a trivial argument over how money destined for the Crusader states of the Levant should be collected. Louis allied himself with the Welsh, Scots and Bretons and attacked Normandy. Henry responded by attacking Chaumont-sur-Epte, where Louis kept his main military arsenal, burning the town to the ground and forcing Louis to abandon his allies and make a private truce. Henry was then free to move against the rebel barons in Brittany, where feelings about his seizure of the duchy were still running high.

Geoffrey was fifteen years old when he joined the first revolt against his father. He later reconciled to Henry in 1174 when he participated in the truce at Gisors. Geoffrey prominently figured in the second revolt of 1183, fighting against Richard, on behalf of Henry the Young King.

Geoffrey was a good friend of Louis VII&#x27;s son Philip, and the two men were frequently in alliance against King Henry. Geoffrey spent much time at Philip&#x27;s court in Paris, and Philip made him his seneschal. There is evidence to suggest that Geoffrey was planning another rebellion with Philip&#x27;s help during his final period in Paris in the summer of 1186. As a participant in so many rebellions against his father, Geoffrey acquired a reputation for treachery. Gerald of Wales wrote the following of him: &quot;He has more aloes than honey in him; his tongue is smoother than oil; his sweet and persuasive eloquence has enabled him to dissolve the firmest alliances and by his powers of language able to corrupt two kingdoms; of tireless endeavour, a hypocrite in everything, a deceiver and a dissembler.&quot;

Geoffrey also was known to attack monasteries and churches in order to raise funds for his campaigns. This lack of reverence for religion earned him the displeasure of the Church and, as a consequence, of the majority of chroniclers who wrote about his life.

==Family==
Geoffrey and Constance had three children, one born after Geoffrey&#x27;s death:
* Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany (1184–1241)
* Maud/Matilda of Brittany (1185–before May 1189)
* Arthur I, Duke of Brittany (1187–1203?)

==Death==
Geoffrey died on 19 August 1186, at the age of 27, in Paris. There is also evidence that supports a death date of 21 August 1186. There are two alternative accounts of his death. The more common first version holds that he was trampled to death in a jousting tournament. At his funeral, a grief-stricken Philip is said to have tried to jump into the coffin. Roger of Hoveden&#x27;s chronicle is the source of this version; the detail of Philip&#x27;s hysterical grief is from Gerald of Wales.

In the second version, in the chronicle of the French royal clerk Rigord, Geoffrey died of sudden acute chest pain, which reportedly struck immediately after his speech to Philip, boasting his intention to lay Normandy to waste. Possibly, this version was an invention of its chronicler, sudden illness being God&#x27;s judgment of an ungrateful son plotting rebellion against his father, and for his irreligiosity. Alternatively, the tournament story may be an invention of Philip in trying to prevent Henry II discovering a plot; by inventing a social reason, a tournament, for Geoffrey&#x27;s being in Paris, Philip could have obscured their meeting&#x27;s true purpose.

Marie of Champagne, with whom Geoffrey was on good terms, was present at the requiem for her half-brother and established a mass chantry for the repose of his soul.

Geoffrey was buried in the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, but his tombstone was destroyed in 1699. His body was exhumed in 1797 and measured at 5 ft 6.5 in (1.69 m).

==Succession==
After Geoffrey&#x27;s death, Henry II arranged for Constance, Geoffrey&#x27;s widow, to marry Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester. Ranulf would become Duke of Brittany, &quot;jure uxoris&quot;, for a short time before this marriage was annulled.

== Portrayals ==
=== In literature ===
Geoffrey II of Brittany is a major character in the play &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1966) by James Goldman where his portrayal is reminiscent of that made by Gerald of Wales, and in the novel &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brood&quot; (2008) by Sharon Kay Penman. He is also mentioned in the tragedies &quot;The Troublesome Reign of King John&quot; (anonymous, c.1589), &quot;King John&quot; (1593–1596) by William Shakespeare and &quot;King John&quot; by Richard Valpy, the poem &quot;Le petit Arthur de Bretagne à la tour de Rouen&quot; (1822) by Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, the drama &quot;Arthur de Bretagne&quot; (1885) by Louis Tiercelin and the novels &quot;Lionheart&quot; (2011) and &quot;A King&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (2014) by Sharon Kay Penman, as well as in the second volume of the trilogy &quot;Le Château des Poulfenc&quot; (2009) by Brigitte Coppin.

=== In theatre and television ===
Geoffrey has been portrayed by John Castle in the movie &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968) and by John Light in the 2003 made-for-TV remake. He has also been portrayed by Austin Somervell (as a boy) and Martin Neil (as an adult) in the BBC TV drama series &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1978).

<text>Lolita Shante Gooden (born March 8, 1970), better known by her stage name Roxanne Shante, is an American rapper. She first gained attention through the Roxanne Wars and was part of the Juice Crew. The 2017 film &quot;Roxanne Roxanne&quot; is a dramatization of Shante&#x27;s life.

== Early life and career ==
Shante was born March,8 1969 in Queens, New York. In 1984, she met Mr. Magic and Marley Marl outside the Queensbridge housing project. They discussed U.T.F.O., since the rap trio had failed to make an appearance at a concert. U.T.F.O. had recently released a single called &quot;Hanging Out&quot;, which did not gain much critical acclaim; however, the B-side &quot;Roxanne, Roxanne&quot;, about a woman who would not respond to their advances, became a hit. 

Shante, who was a member of the Juice Crew, was contracted to write a track in rebuttal to U.T.F.O.&#x27;s rap, posing as the Roxanne in the U.T.F.O. song. Marley Marl produced the song &quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; using the original beats from an instrumental version of &quot;Roxanne, Roxanne&quot;. The track became an instant hit and made Shante, only 14 at the time, one of the first female MCs to become very popular. Then the &quot;Roxanne Wars&quot; started, and Shante continued to rap and started touring with her producer, Marley Marl.

In 1985, Shante released a record together with rapper Sparky D, who had earlier released a diss track about her called &quot;Sparky&#x27;s Turn, Roxanne You&#x27;re Through&quot;. The record called &quot;Round One, Roxanne Shanté vs Sparky Dee&quot; was released by Spin Records and included six tracks: the two original battle tracks (&quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Sparky&#x27;s Turn&quot;) as well as &quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Profile&quot; by Shante, &quot;Sparky&#x27;s Profile&quot; by Sparky D and a battle track, in which the two rappers freestyle and diss each other, in a censored and an uncensored version. Other hits included &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Go on Girl&quot;. 

In 1985, Shante battled Busy Bee Starski for the title of &quot;best freestyle rapper&quot; but lost due to improper judging. Judge Kurtis Blow later admitted to Shante that he did not vote for her because she was a girl. The ongoing battle with KRS-One hit its height when KRS-One claimed in his 1986 track &quot;The Bridge Is Over&quot; that Shante was nothing more than a sexual appendage to male rappers. 

In 1989, Shante released &quot;Bad Sister&quot;, &quot;The Bitch Is Back&quot; in 1992, and a greatest hits anthology in 1995. In 1997 Roxanne was featured on Frankie Cutlass third single title &quot;The Cypher Part III&quot; which featured some of Marley Marl juice crew rappers, Big Daddy Kane, Big Markie and Craig G. 

== Hiatus ==
By the age of 25 Shante was largely retired from the recording industry. She continued to make occasional guest appearances and live performances, as well as mentor young female hip-hop artists. She made a cameo appearance on VH1&#x27;s hip hop reality show &quot;Ms. Rap Supreme&quot;, giving rap-battle strategies to the finalists of the show. She was in a series of Sprite commercials during the late 1990s.
She returned to performing, and in 2008, her song &quot;Roxanne&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was ranked number 42 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop. Shante re-recorded the song in 2009. In an interview with EmEz in 2015, she said that she had just been proposed to and that she had previously been married. In the same interview, she said that KRS-One was one of her favorite rappers.

== Biographical claims ==
It was reported by &quot;Blender&quot; in 2008, and more extensively in a New York &quot;Daily News&quot; account in 2009, that Shante earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Marymount Manhattan College and a master&#x27;s and Ph.D in psychology from Cornell University. The articles said that a quirk in her recording contract obligated Warner Music to fund her college education. These were not new claims by Shante; she spoke at length about them on the &quot;Beef II&quot; documentary which was released in 2004. 

In 2009, an investigation by lawyer and journalist Ben Sheffner for &quot;Slate&quot; magazine found no evidence of Shante&#x27;s claims. She was never signed to a Warner Music label, but was under contract to the independent label Cold Chillin&#x27; Records, which was distributed by Reprise/Warner Bros. Records from 1987 to 1992. Academic records indicate that she attended only three months at Marymount Manhattan College. Shante never earned a degree and she is unlicensed by New York State officials to practice psychology or similar disciplines. The &quot;Daily News&quot; then ran a five-paragraph correction. Shante apologized in November 2009.

== &quot;Roxanne Roxanne&quot; film ==
A dramatized biopic about Shante&#x27;s life, &quot;Roxanne Roxanne&quot;, was first shown at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. It received critical acclaim and the lead actress Chanté Adams won best breakout performance for her portrayal of Shante. The film was co-produced by Forest Whitaker and Pharrell Williams. It was written and directed by Michael Larnell. It was bought by the film studio Neon for general release later in 2017.

==Legacy==
At the height of her career, Shante was referred to as the &quot;Queen of Rap&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and has been noted as a hip-hop pioneer. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; credited her for popularizing diss tracks. &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Natalie Weiner wrote that Shante&#x27;s &quot;blazingly male-shaming diss track&quot; and &quot;hip-hop&#x27;s first recorded beef&quot; helped move hip-hop further toward the mainstream, calling her &quot;rap&#x27;s first female star.&quot; 

&quot;Consequence&quot; considered her &quot;a mentor for generations of female MCs, and an early advocate in rap for female empowerment.&quot; In 1989, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; stated that the popularity of rappers like Roxanne Shante, Salt-N-Pepa, and MC Lyte created a path for the next generation of female hip hop artists.

<doc id="180530" wikidata="Q6417490" url="?curid=180530" title="Kit Williams">
<text>Christopher&quot;Kit&quot;Williams (born 28 April 1946) is an English artist, illustrator and author best known for his 1979 book &quot;Masquerade&quot;, a pictorial storybook which contains clues to the location of a golden (18 carat) jewelled hare created by Williams and then buried &quot;somewhere in Britain&quot;.

Williams published three other books and was commissioned to create three public clocks with elaborate mechanisms and moving parts, such as animals, for visual interest.

Born in Kent, England, Williams continues to paint figurative art at his studio in Gloucestershire.

==Work==

Kit Williams now primarily works as a figurative painter in which he uses traditional oil-painting techniques, fashioning first a wooden panel covered in linen and oil gesso. He then uses many layers of opaque and transparent Dutch oil paint to create luminous images.

Williams likes to maintain complete control of every aspect of his artwork including making the clothes worn by the models, creating sets and props, and often making mechanisms either within the frame or the painting that reveal moving elements of the artwork and encourage interaction by the viewer.

Using marquetry, he has always made his own frames which enables him to make pictures of any shape and allow elements of the picture to continue into the frame in often intricate detail.

==Past work==

As well as his best-known book, &quot;Masquerade&quot;, Williams wrote &quot;The Bee on the Comb&quot;, a puzzle book with a bee theme. The book was initially published without a visible title, and readers were challenged to work out the title from clues inside the book and send in their answer without using the written word. This competition ran for just a year and a day, and the winner was revealed on the live BBC TV chatshow &quot;Wogan&quot;.

In 1985 Kit Williams designed the Wishing Fish Clock, a centrepiece of the Regent Arcade shopping centre in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. More than 45 feet tall, the clock features a duck that lays a never-ending stream of golden eggs and includes a family of mice that are continually trying to evade a snake sitting on top of the clock. Hanging from the base of the clock is a large wooden fish that blows bubbles every half-hour. Catching one of these bubbles entitles you to make a wish, hence the name of the clock. The clock has undergone essential restoration work and is back in full working order .

Other clocks designed by Williams can be found in Telford Shopping Centre and in the Midsummer Place section of Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre.

Williams was also involved in the design of the Dragonfly Maze in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England, which comprises a yew maze with a pavilion at the centre. The object is not only to reach the pavilion, but to gather clues as one navigates the maze. Correctly interpreting these clues when one reaches the pavilion allows access to the maze&#x27;s final secret.

==&quot;Masquerade&quot; and the Golden Hare==

In August 2009, Kit Williams was reunited with the golden hare from &quot;Masquerade&quot;, which he had not seen for more than 30 years. He was quoted as saying:

:&quot;I had not remembered it being as delicate as it is ... Then when I picked it up the little bells jingled, and it sparkled in a way that I had forgotten as well.&quot;

This reunion was revealed in a 60-minute documentary about Williams&#x27;s work, &quot;The Man Behind the Masquerade&quot;, broadcast on BBC Four on 2 December 2009. The programme began with &quot;Masquerade&quot; and ended with an exhibition of the best 18 pieces of his art from the previous 30 years at the Portal Gallery, which had first exhibited his work in the 1970s. The programme showed Williams being reunited with the golden hare for the first time when it was loaned by its anonymous present owner, who lives in East Asia.

The hare was on display at the V&amp;A Museum, London, as part of its retrospective &quot;British Design 1948–2012&quot; from 31 March to 12 August 2012.

<text>Robert Matthew Van Winkle (born October 31, 1967), known professionally as Vanilla Ice, is an American rapper, actor, and television host. Born in Dallas and raised there and in Miami, he was the first solo white rapper to achieve commercial success following the 1990 release of his best-known hit &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;.

Ice released his debut album, &quot;Hooked&quot;, on the independent Ichiban Records before signing a contract with SBK Records, a record label of the EMI Group, which released a reformatted version under the title &quot;To the Extreme&quot;; it became the fastest-selling hip hop album of all time and &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; was the first hip hop single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Followed by the live album &quot;Extremely Live&quot; (1991), Ice made a cameo appearance on the film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot; (1991) where he performed &quot;Ninja Rap&quot;, which he co-wrote. He was soon offered and starred in his own film, &quot;Cool as Ice&quot; (1991), which included the single &quot;Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)&quot; with Naomi Campbell; the film itself was a box office failure.

His fast rise in popularity was quickly marred by media controversies about his background, and criticism about his appeal of hip hop to a mainstream audience alongside MC Hammer. Ice later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, who had also published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. Ice&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Mind Blowin&#x27;&quot; (1994), featured a major image change but was commercially unsuccessful. Following rap rock performances in the underground scene and playing in a local grunge band, Ice released the dark nu metal album &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot; (1998), followed by the independently released &quot;Bi-Polar&quot; (2001) and &quot;Platinum Underground&quot; (2005).

In the 2000s, Ice began appearing on television reality shows including &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. In 2010, Ice began hosting &quot;The Vanilla Ice Project&quot; on DIY Network which ran for nine seasons until 2019. In 2022, he started another home improvement television program, &quot;The Vanilla Ice Home Show&quot;. He is also involved in motocross racing and real estate.

==Early life==
Robert Matthew Van Winkle was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 31, 1967. Van Winkle has never known his biological father; he was given the family name of the man his mother was married to at the time of his birth. When Van Winkle was four, his mother divorced. Afterward, he grew up moving between Dallas and Miami, where his new stepfather worked at a car dealership. Van Winkle was affected by hip hop at an early age, saying &quot;It&#x27;s a very big passion of mine because I love poetry. I was just heavily influenced by that whole movement and it&#x27;s molded me into who I am today.&quot; Between the ages of 13 and 14, Van Winkle practiced breakdancing, which led to his friends nicknaming him &quot;Vanilla&quot;, as he was the only one in the group who was not black. Although he disliked the nickname, it stuck. Shortly afterward, Van Winkle started battle rapping at parties and because of his rhymes, his friends started calling him &quot;MC Vanilla&quot;. However, when he became a member of a breakdance troupe, Van Winkle&#x27;s stage name was &quot;Vanilla Ice&quot; combining his nickname &quot;Vanilla&quot; with one of his breakdance moves, &quot;The Ice&quot;. When Ice&#x27;s stepfather was offered a better job in Carrollton, Texas, he moved back to Texas with his mother. When Ice was not learning to ride motorbikes, he was dancing as a street performer with his breakdancing group, now called &quot;The Vanilla Ice Posse&quot;. Ice wrote &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; at the age of 16, basing its lyrics on a weekend he had with friend and disc jockey D-Shay in South Florida. The lyrics describe Ice and Shay on a drug run that ends in a drive-by shooting while praising Ice&#x27;s rhyming skills. He attended R. L. Turner High School.

==Career==

===Early career (1985–1989)===
In 1985, he was focusing all of his energy on motocross, winning three championships. After breaking his ankle during a race, Ice was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing. Ice used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls during this time. One evening he visited City Lights, a South Dallas nightclub, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel during an open-mic. He won the crowd over and was asked by City Lights manager John Bush if he wanted to perform regularly, which he accepted. Ice would be joined on stage by his disc jockeys D-Shay and Zero, as well as Earthquake, the local disc jockey at City Lights. The Vanilla Ice Posse or &quot;The V.I.P.&quot; would also perform with Ice on stage. As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for N.W.A, Public Enemy, The D.O.C., Tone Lōc, 2 Live Crew, Paula Abdul, Sinbad and MC Hammer.

In January 1987, Ice was stabbed five times during a scuffle outside of City Lights. After spending ten days in the hospital, Ice signed a contract with the owner of City Lights, Tommy Quon, and his management company, Ultrax. Two years later, Ice would open for EPMD, Ice-T, Stetsasonic, and Sir Mix-A-Lot on the Stop the Violence Tour. Quon saw commercial potential in Ice&#x27;s rapping and dancing skills. Buying studio time with Quon&#x27;s earnings from City Lights, they recorded songs that had been perfected on stage by Ice and his acquaintances with various producers, including Khayree. The two year production was distributed by an independent record company called Ichiban Records in 1989. &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, with &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; appearing as the B-side. Tommy Quon personally sent out the single to various radio stations around the U.S., but the single was seldom played and when it was, it did not get the reaction Quon was hoping for. When disc jockey Darrell Jaye in Georgia played &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; instead of the single&#x27;s A-side, the song gained a quick fanbase and other radio stations followed suit. Quon financed $8,000 for the production of a music video for &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, which received heavy airplay by The Box, increasing public interest in the song.

===Mainstream success (1990–1992)===
On the basis of Ice&#x27;s good looks and dance moves, Public Enemy tried to convince their producer, Hank Shocklee, to sign Ice to Def Jam, but Ice later signed a contract with SBK Records in 1990. During MC Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em World Tour&quot;, Ice served as an opening act. SBK remixed and re-recorded &quot;Hooked&quot; under the title &quot;To the Extreme&quot;. The reissue contained new artwork and music. According to Ice, SBK paid him to adopt a more commercial, conventional appearance. This led Ice to later regret his business agreements with SBK.

&quot;To the Extreme&quot; became the fastest selling hip hop album of all time, spending sixteen weeks at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling eleven million copies. SBK Record executive Monte Lipman stated that he received calls from radio stations reporting over 200 phone calls requesting &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;. SBK wanted Ice on the road as soon as possible. MC Hammer, an old acquaintance from his club days, had Ice on as an opening act on his tour. Reviews of &quot;To the Extreme&quot; were mixed. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Mim Udovitch gave the album a B, citing &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;, &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Party&quot; as the album&#x27;s highlights. Robert Christgau gave the album a C− rating, writing that Ice&#x27;s &quot;suave sexism, fashionably male supremacist rather than dangerously obscene, is no worse than his suave beats&quot;. Criticizing the technique and style of Vanilla Ice, Allrovi reviewer Steve Huey wrote:

==== Media image ====
In late 1990, Ice began an eight-month relationship with Madonna, and appeared in photographs for her book, &quot;Sex&quot;. In the height of Ice&#x27;s popularity, SBK licensed a 12&quot; doll which was made by THQ. In January 1991, he was the musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Ice branched out into the film industry with an appearance in the film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, which he later called &quot;one of the coolest experiences&quot; of his career. Ice was very secretive about his personal life, with the intention of protecting his family. When a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Ice what his mother&#x27;s profession was, he replied, &quot;None of your fucking business.&quot; In an attempt to rectify this, his former label wrote a fake biography in his name and tried to pass it off as his official life story without his knowledge. While on tour in 1991, Ice found out that SBK had instigated the publication of the biography which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with Luther Campbell, and exaggerating his living conditions in Miami, which Ice later had to debunk by himself.

==== Suge Knight incident ====
Following the success of &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, record producer Suge Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Ice was eating. After shoving Ice&#x27;s bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Ice, staring at him before finally asking &quot;How you doin&#x27;?&quot; Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Ice&#x27;s hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by a member of the Los Angeles Raiders football team. According to Ice, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the publishing rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Ice&#x27;s money to help fund Death Row Records.

==== Live album, &quot;Cool as Ice&quot;, and tours ====
Ice&#x27;s second major release was the live album &quot;Extremely Live&quot;, released in March 1991. The album was a live recording during Vanilla Ice&#x27;s performance in Miami during his &quot;To The Extreme World Tour&quot;. Premiering new songs like &quot;Rollin&#x27; in My 5.0&quot;, &quot;Road To My Riches&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, the album peaked at #30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but it received mainly negative reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne called it &quot;one of the most ridiculous albums ever released&quot;, comparing it to &quot;The Best of Marcel Marceau&quot;, an album which consisted of two sides of silence opened by brief applause. According to Browne, &quot;Extremely Live&quot; &quot;affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter [...] and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing.&quot; Monte Lipman later stated that SBK only released the live disc to make more money from Ice&#x27;s fame. In April 1991, Ice began to film the SBK produced &quot;Cool as Ice&quot;, in which he played a leading role.

&quot;Cool as Ice&quot; opened on October 18, 1991, in 393 theaters in the United States, grossing $638,000, ranking at #14 among the week&#x27;s new releases. Reviews of the film were negative. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 8%. Ice received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star. SBK stated that they overexposed Ice and Ice decided to stop taking their business advice, as well as distancing himself from the image that SBK was trying to create for him. In late 1991, Ice appeared in the Circus of the Stars and Sideshow, driving his motorcycle through a wall of fire. While his fame in the United States had severely dropped, Ice continued touring in 1992, playing in South America, Europe, Australia and Asia, and premiering new songs like &quot;Get Loose&quot;, &quot;The Wrath&quot;, &quot;Now &amp; Forever&quot;, &quot;Where the Dogs At? (All Night Long)&quot;, &quot;Minutes of Power&quot; and &quot;Iceman Party&quot;. After a performance in Acapulco, the city honored Ice with a medal that represented &quot;all the respect and admiration to [Ice&#x27;s] music and to [him] as an artist from the Mexican people&quot;. Ice also served as a spokesperson for Nike and Coca-Cola throughout 1991 and 1992.

===&quot;Mind Blowin&quot;, music break and drug abuse (1993–1996)===
In 1993, Ice toured Eastern Europe again and premiered songs off his upcoming album in St. Petersburg, Russia in front of President Boris Yeltsin. After almost non-stop touring for the previous three years, Ice took a break from music in and began competing in jet skiing, as well as resuming Motocross racing. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. Ice then began work on his next album, although by this time he received less publicity and faded from the public spotlight. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, &quot;Mind Blowin&#x27;&quot;. Reviews were unfavorable. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer James Bernard called the album &quot;more clunky than funky&quot;. Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;There isn&#x27;t a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.&quot;

At around this time, Ice began using ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. During periods of heavy drug use, Ice received many tattoos from artist acquaintances. According to Ice, he &quot;was in [his] binge days. [He] didn&#x27;t even realize how many [he] was getting&quot;. Ice attempted suicide with a heroin overdose on July 4, 1994, but was revived by his friends. After being revived, Ice decided that it was time to change his lifestyle. As a symbol of his attempt to begin anew, he got a tattoo of a leaf on his stomach. After expanding his Mind Blowin tour overseas in 1995, Ice sold his estate in California and took a break from music, rather focusing on motocrossing and jet skiing in Florida. By the summer, Ice was the world&#x27;s No. 6-ranked sit-down jet ski racer, competing nearly every weekend and earning a Kawasaki sponsorship.

Uncertain about his future career, Ice studied real estate and started working on the side renovating and selling houses. In late 1995, he set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a grunge band, Pickin Scabz. The name was set to reflect Ice&#x27;s career, and how he was healing from his suicide attempt, and that he was now &quot;picking up the pieces&quot;. In 1996, longtime associate and friend Monte Lipman signed Ice for Universal Republic Records. He did guest vocals with no stage name for the song &quot;Boom&quot; by Bloodhound Gang on their CD &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot;.

===Rock era (1997–2001)===
Ice later developed a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, Robinson was encouraged by their reticence and agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated, &quot;It&#x27;s the most punk-rock thing you could do.&quot; Despite not being happy with his old image, Van Winkle stated that he never had a problem with his older music. He decided against changing his stage name, as he felt no need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it, and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.

Ice&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot;, featured a darker sound and lyrics than Ice&#x27;s previous work, as well as various mixtures of different styles of hip hop and hard rock, which garnered media attention. Ice attracted a whole new audience when he started touring again, some who were even unfamiliar with his more mainstream sound. Reviews were generally negative; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The most earnest new song, &quot;Scars&quot;, condemns an abusive father. The sentiments would sound more genuine if Korn hadn&#x27;t gotten there first.&quot; Richard Torres of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while &quot;nothing, however, can redeem Ice&#x27;s wack boasting,&quot; the album &quot;isn&#x27;t half-bad.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Kemp gave the album three out of five stars, writing that it contained Ice&#x27;s &quot;most convincing music&quot;. In promotion of &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot;, Ice toured with a seven-piece live band which included future Weezer bassist Scott Shriner. The band opened with rock-oriented material from &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot; and concluded with older hip hop songs. The setlist also included &quot;Power&quot;, based upon Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;. Ice said that writing the songs and performing them were like therapy, as he had tried to hide his anger when making his older songs but Robinson was the first producer who told him to use it to create.

Vanilla Ice was a member of the softball team &quot;The Hip Hop Stars&quot; alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Method Man in a 1999 game shown on MTV Rock N&#x27; Jock . Later in 1999, MTV asked Vanilla Ice to join their cast to &quot;retire&quot; the music video for &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; on the MTV special &quot;25 Lame&quot;, in which Ice himself was asked to destroy the video&#x27;s master tape. When Ice was given a baseball bat, he ended up destroying not only the film but the show&#x27;s entire set as well. In 2001, DJ ReAnimator remixed &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; with Vanilla Ice re-doing his vocals for the track. &quot;Ice Ice Baby 2001&quot; was released as a single and music video for the European market, spawning a wave of new overseas interest in Vanilla Ice.

Having attracted a following outside of his former mainstream audience, Ice began recording independently, despite still being signed to Universal. During a recording session, Ice met the all-female American hard rock band from Southern California, Betty Blowtorch. Bianca Halstead bonded with Ice and asked if he wanted to contribute a rap interlude to their track &quot;Size Queen&quot;. On Ice&#x27;s collaboration with the band, lead vocalist and bassist Halstead was quoted saying, &quot;I asked him if he could rap over [the track] and he said he can rap over anything. And he could!&quot; Per his stepfather&#x27;s request, Ice started working with his former manager Tommy Quon again. While hoping to re-create some of the magic that they worked hard on in the early 1990s, Ice denied any interest in trying to become big again, stating that his only passion was music, not fame.

In May 2000, Ice wrestled in a match promoted by Juggalo Championshit Wrestling, filling in for Insane Clown Posse member Shaggy 2 Dope, who had been injured during a match. MTV News reported that Insane Clown Posse would make an appearance on Ice&#x27;s next album, tentatively titled &quot;Bomb Tha System&quot;. In July 2001, Ice performed at the second Gathering of the Juggalos. On October 23, 2001, Ice released the album &quot;Bi-Polar&quot;. Initially conceived as a double album consisting of one disc of rock music (&quot;Skabz&quot;) and one disc of hip hop music (&quot;Bomb Tha System&quot;), both parts were released on one disc. The album also featured La the Darkman, Perla, Insane Poetry and Bob Kakaha. Bradley Torreano of Allrovi disliked the album, criticizing it as &quot;wildly uneven and at times hilariously bad,&quot; but also stating &quot;Vanilla Ice is still better than a lot of the rap-metal bands that erupted in 2000/2001&quot; and that the rap beats on &quot;Bomb Tha System&quot; &quot;are surprisingly solid.&quot; In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Kemp gave the album one out of five stars, calling the album &quot;utterly listless&quot;. According to a Sony BMG executive, sales of &quot;Bi-Polar&quot; were &quot;not bad...for Vanilla Ice. That&#x27;s pretty respectable. Seriously.&quot;

===Independent releases and television (2002–2009)===
With Quon back as manager, Ice was scheduled to appear in various reality TV programs. Ice, still an entertainer at heart, felt that the experience would be good for him. In 2002, he appeared on Celebrity Boxing, fighting Todd Bridges under the name &#x27;Bi-Polar&#x27;. In 2003, he appeared in five episodes of Hollywood Squares, eight episodes of &quot;The Farm&quot; and three episodes of Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge, and made a cameo appearance in The New Guy in 2002. Around this time, Vanilla Ice also returned to the world of motocross. He auditioned for the 2002 X Games in the freestyle division and placed seventh at the 2003 Suzuki Crossover challenge, according to Sports Illustrated. He told the magazine that the track &quot;is where I&#x27;m happiest.&quot;
In 2003, Ice contributed vocals to &quot;Off the Chain&quot; by 7x70, a side project of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain and Anthrax guitarist Dan Spitz. A demo of the song was leaked in June. In 2003, Ultrax reissued &quot;Bomb Tha System&quot; (the second part of &quot;Bi-Polar&quot;) under the title &quot;Hot Sex&quot;, which was a single from the original album.

From January to February 2004, Ice appeared on the reality television series &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. Although much of the series was staged, Ice found the experience to be therapeutic, stating that a comment made by Tammy Faye Messner during filming, &quot;We are who we are because of who we were&quot;, helped him accept his past.

On August 2, 2005, Ice released his fifth studio album, &quot;Platinum Underground&quot;. He stated that the title of the album reflected the fact that he could maintain a fanbase without mainstream airplay. Allrovi reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it &quot;has more bad spots in it than most&quot;. Ice included a song titled &quot;Ninja Rap 2&quot;, which was set to be a hardcore remix. Aside from the name, the song has very little connection to Ice&#x27;s original 1991 single, but rather talks about his appreciation of his fans, his love of performing at clubs and playing at the Gathering of the Juggalos with Insane Clown Posse. &quot;Ninja Rap 2&quot; was the first song to be released from &quot;Platinum Underground&quot; and was available to download for free off of Ice&#x27;s official website.

In 2007, Ice returned to a spin-off of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; titled &quot;The Surreal Life: Fame Games&quot;, where he again trashed the set after being voted off. In September 2008, Ice signed a contract with Cleopatra Records, recording the cover album &quot;Vanilla Ice Is Back!&quot; at the label&#x27;s request. The album was released on November 4, 2008, and contained covers of songs by Public Enemy, House of Pain, Bob Marley, and Cypress Hill. IGN reviewer Spence D. called the album &quot;an embarrassing 
endeavor that sounds like it should have stayed locked inside Ice&#x27;s studio (or at the very least leaked on YouTube and passed off as a piss take).&quot; On February 27, 2009, Ice performed as part of a joint performance with MC Hammer in Orem, Utah, called &quot;Hammer Pants And Ice&quot;, which featured twenty four dancers and a full choir.

===2010–present===
In August 2009, Ice signed a contract with StandBy Records; however, Ice later left the label. Ice was a special musical guest at the 2010 National Television Awards in January, performing with Jedward for their remix and debut single &quot;Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)&quot;. Ice also recorded his verse for their album Planet Jedward and appeared in the music video. He was a part of The Back2Kool concert tour with Turbo B and MC Hammer, playing worldwide in late 2010, and reunited with his former DJ, Floyd &#x27;Earthquake&#x27; Brown, for the shows overseas. In early 2011, Vanilla Ice appeared on the sixth season of the UK show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, as well as various ice skating tours surrounding the show.

In 2009, Ice started filming a reality television series called &quot;The Vanilla Ice Project&quot;, which premiered on DIY Network on October 14, 2010. The season was focused on renovating a house in Palm Beach, Florida, with each episode dedicated to a different room in the house. In 2011, Ice published a book on the subject, &quot;Vanilla Ice Project – Real Estate Guide&quot;, on how to succeed in real estate. The book was made available as a free digital download on his real estate website. The second season began airing in January 2012, the third season in January 2013.

In June 2011, Ice filmed a role in the movie &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot;, starring Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg, (released in 2012). In the film, Ice portrays an exaggerated version of himself called Uncle Vanny. While shooting, he collaborated with Samberg and Sandler musically. In August, Ice performed at the 2011 Gathering of the Juggalos; he signed with Psychopathic Records, but later departed from the label without releasing anything. His sixth studio album, &quot;WTF&quot;, was released on August 19 through Radium Records. While the record featured an array of different styles, like other recent Vanilla Ice albums, it also featured Ice&#x27;s return to Electronica, with songs like &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, &quot;Rock Star Party&quot;, &quot;Nightmare Disco&quot; and &quot;Cadillac Ninjas&quot;. Regarding the new record and its numerous musical genres, Ice said, &quot;It&#x27;s like techno hip-hop. European. I live a lot in Europe, and when I&#x27;m over there I get way into the techno stuff and I get into new music. So I thought I&#x27;d make a record of it. I did the thing and it was a lot of fun&quot;.

In December 2011, Ice played Captain Hook in the Chatham, Kent, Central Theatre pantomime production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, a role that previously belonged to Henry Winkler. He also turned on the Christmas lights for Rochester, Kent, in Rochester Castle, as part of the promotion for the panto. On May 12, 2012, Vanilla Ice helped in the launch of the Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast roller coaster at Six Flags over Texas in Arlington with a free concert for valid daily park ticket or 2012 Season Pass holders. In mid 2013, Vanilla Ice joined the New Kids on the Block tour alongside Boyz II Men.

On September 15, 2013, Vanilla Ice performed at the halftime show of a Houston Texans game. Houston went on to lose the remaining fourteen games of the season, leading some players to blame Vanilla Ice for the losing streak.

In 2015, after Ice repeated his claim of Choctaw identity in response to criticisms of Native American portrayals in &quot;The Ridiculous 6&quot;, Choctaw genealogists researched his family tree, finding his maternal genealogy to be mostly German, with no Choctaw ancestry possible. Ice responded via Twitter that &quot;I&#x27;m not going to pretend I&#x27;m Indian, Just because I have Indian blood. Sorry for any disrespect, to me Indians are American royalty.&quot;

In 2016, Ice&#x27;s wife filed for divorce, saying that the marriage was &quot;irretrievably broken.&quot; His third child with his new wife was born in 2018.

===Legal issues===

On August 8, 1988, Ice was arrested in South Dallas for illegal drag racing.
In 1990, Ice was threatened with copyright infringement for use of samples from &quot;Under Pressure&quot; by Queen and David Bowie. The matter was settled out of court.

On June 3, 1991, he was arrested in Los Angeles on firearm charges after threatening a homeless man, James N. Gregory, with a pistol. Gregory had approached Ice&#x27;s car outside of a supermarket and attempted to sell him a silver chain. Ice and his bodyguard were charged with three weapons offenses. Ice pled no contest.

In January 2001, Ice was arrested by police in Davie, Florida, for assaulting his wife, Laura. According to the criminal complaint, Ice and his wife argued as they drove on Interstate 595. Ice admitted to pulling hair from her head to prevent her from jumping out of the truck&#x27;s window. He pled guilty to charges of disorderly conduct four months later and was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend family therapy sessions.

Ice&#x27;s pet wallaroo, Bucky, and pet goat, Pancho, escaped from his wife&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s home in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in November 2004. After wandering around local streets for over a week, the animals were caught and returned to Ice. He paid a $220 fine for expired pet tags and an undisclosed fine for the escape of the animals.

On April 10, 2008, Ice was arrested in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for allegedly kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day, after she declared that her husband had only pushed her. In court, the couple&#x27;s neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife through telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice&#x27;s lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the charges dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.

In February 2015, Ice was arrested and charged with residential burglary and grand theft after he allegedly stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items from a Florida home that he believed to be vacant. He later accepted a plea deal which would result in the charges being dropped following his completion of 100 hours of community service and payment of restitution to the estate of the homeowner.

==Style and influences==

, Ice&#x27;s live performances feature a mix of newer, rock and techno-influenced material and old-school hip hop. Ice performs with a live drummer and DJ, and sometimes sprays his audience with bottled water. Ice&#x27;s performances often feature an inflatable grim reaper balloon, a dancer in a clown mask, and confetti thrown into the audience. Describing his performances, Ice stated &quot;It&#x27;s high energy, stage diving, pyrotechnics, girls showing their breasts. It&#x27;s crazy party atmosphere.&quot;

Ice stated that his musical style was influenced by underground music, rather than mainstream music, and that his influences included hip hop and funk artists such as Funkadelic, Rick James, Roger Troutman, Egyptian Lover and Parliament. Ice is a big fan of 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s reggae and Bob Marley&#x27;s work and has also stated that he enjoys Rage Against the Machine, Slipknot, and System of a Down.

Ice sometimes plays bass, drums and keyboards on studio recordings. Vanilla Ice referred to his mainstream music as &quot;above-ground&quot; rather than underground, as he tried to make danceable beats and removed expletives so that the songs could reach a wider audience. A lot of his early hits had Ice boasting sexual conquests, in 1991, Ice was quoted &quot;I rap about what I know. Girls and stuff. That&#x27;s what is going through my head.&quot;

When asked about his darker sound in 2002, Ice replied; &quot;Music is about reflection and I&#x27;m just reflecting my life and everything it&#x27;s been and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be able to stress what I want and mean over a break beat, you know, it&#x27;s too emotional and it&#x27;s too intense, so you have to have the intensity of the band, it&#x27;s like a symphony, you know, you have to build on the intense parts, and so it just wasn&#x27;t going to happen, to come extreme over some hip hop record, so to exorcise my demons I had to have the band.&quot;

==Legacy and reception==
Along with Beastie Boys, 3rd Bass, and House of Pain, Ice was one of the earliest white rappers to attain major success. Chuck D has credited Ice as a regional breakthrough, stating &quot;He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn&#x27;t get credit for it.&quot; The other half of Public Enemy, Flavor Flav, has commented &quot;Vanilla Ice, that&#x27;s my man,&quot; .

After signing with Psychopathic Records, Violent J mentioned that Insane Clown Posse were longtime fans of Ice&#x27;s work; &quot;We were bumping him way before &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; blew up. We were bumping him when he had his first record out on Ichiban. Shaggy had the vinyl and we used to bump that shit up in his room. It felt like two summers before that shit blew up.&quot; &quot;Thanda Thanda Pani&quot; (Cold Cold Water) by Baba Sehgal was inspired heavily by Vanilla Ice&#x27;s music and style. Rapper Riff Raff has mentioned in interviews that Vanilla Ice was one of his biggest influences.

The late rapper Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard appeared on stage with Vanilla Ice during the 2004 Gathering of the Juggalos and expressed interest in working on a song together after stating that he was Ice&#x27;s &quot;greatest fan&quot;. Rapper G-Child, best known for her appearance on &quot;ego trip&#x27;s The (White) Rapper Show&quot;, has credited Ice as being a major influence on her work. After meeting Ice in 2000, G-Child performed freestyle raps at six of Ice&#x27;s performances, and opened for him four times.

=== Introspective view ===
In 1998, Vanilla Ice expressed regret over the record deal that led to the success of his debut album. He confessed in the interview that he &quot;I sold out and was forced to play this puppet role with this image laid out. It made me very wealthy but it also turned me into a novelty act. I jumped out of my skin and became a target.&quot;

=== Feuds ===
In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot;, and in the lyrics comparing Ice unfavorably to Elvis Presley. The song&#x27;s music video featured Henry Rollins as Ice, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass. Ice responded to &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; with his 1992 song &quot;The Wrath&quot;. Del tha Funkee Homosapien referred to Ice in the lyrics of &quot;Pissin&#x27; on Your Steps&quot;, which appeared on his 1991 debut album &quot;I Wish My Brother George Was Here&quot;. Similar to &#x27;Pop Goes the Weasel&#x27;, the song negatively makes a connection between Ice and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial. Vanilla Ice answered back to most of his critics in the song &quot;Hit &#x27;em Hard&quot;.

Eminem has often name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles he did with rapper Proof in 1992 where they performed against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot;, Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he is a better rapper. In &quot;Role Model&quot;, Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice&#x27;s dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with &quot;Vibe&quot; saying that Eminem &quot;raps like a girl&quot;. While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot; which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song &quot;Purple Pills&quot; in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice&#x27;s only response in song. On his album &quot;Bi-Polar&quot;, Ice mentions Eminem in a positive light (&quot;Hip Hop Rules&quot;) and in a negative light (&quot;Exhale&quot;), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem&#x27;s references were flattering, going on to say &quot;I give him credit, I think he&#x27;s talented, I think he&#x27;s a killer rapper, you know I don&#x27;t compare myself to him because he&#x27;s another white rapper, I don&#x27;t compare myself to any other rapper period, I don&#x27;t colorize hip hop, it&#x27;s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking through the eyes of a racial standpoint, and it really shouldn&#x27;t be looked at that way, you&#x27;re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don&#x27;t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear &#x27;oh, you think you&#x27;re Vanilla Ice?&#x27;, so I am sure he&#x27;s heard that.&quot; In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;We Made You&quot;. In November 2023, Ice told VladTV that Eminem would be &quot;stupid&quot; to not acknowledge his influence on him.

=== Other appearances ===

<text>Dead Prez (stylized in lowercase) is an American hip hop duo composed of M-1 and stic.man, formed in 1996 in New York City. They are known for their confrontational style, combined with lyrics focused on both militant social justice, self-determination, and Pan-Africanism. The duo maintains an ethical stance against corporate control over the media, especially hip hop record labels.

==Career==

=== Background (1993–2000) ===
In 1993, M-1 headed to Tallahassee, Florida, to attend Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) where he and stic.man met and formed a relationship due to their mutual love of music and similar leftist political ideology. While there, their views solidified, M-1 becoming particularly interested in the Black Panther Party.

M-1 joined the International People&#x27;s Democratic Uhuru Movement in Chicago for three years, while stic.man remained in Florida. Burned out by the arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 and stic.man chose to focus on music. Brand Nubian&#x27;s Lord Jamar discovered them in New York City and signed them a deal with Loud Records. Although dead prez was not always Loud&#x27;s top priority, they built a fan base due to their over-the-top performances (they have been known to ignite dollar bills and toss apples into the audiences, declaring that they must eat healthy).

They had begun contributing songs to film soundtracks and made featurings on high-profile albums. Their first recorded song, &quot;The Game of Life (Score)&quot; appeared on the 1997 soundtrack to the film &quot;Soul in the Hole&quot;. In 1998 their song &quot;D.O.P.E. (Drugs Oppress People Everyday)&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Slam&quot;. Also in 1998, they were featured on the skit &quot;The Rain and the Sun&quot; off Big Pun&#x27;s album &quot;Capital Punishment&quot;, and in 1999 were featured on The Beatnuts&#x27; song &quot;Look Around&quot; off their album &quot;Musical Massacre&quot;.

===Releases (2000–present)===

The duo&#x27;s debut album was 2000&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Free&quot;, with their most popular single to date &quot;Hip-Hop&quot;. The album was well received by critics, and included intense political monologues featuring prominent black activist Omali Yeshitela, as well as &quot;Animal in Man&quot; – a retelling of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. The instrumental version of their song &quot;Hip Hop&quot; was used as Dave Chappelle&#x27;s entrance music for his show on Comedy Central, and can be heard on every episode. &quot;Hip Hop&quot; has also been featured on the soundtrack of the video game skate. as well as underground graffiti art documentaries of the era. The song is also used in the introduction of &quot;Hip Hop Evolution&quot;, a show which is currently on Netflix. In 2001 they collaborated with The Coup, another politically active hip hop outfit, to release &quot;Get Up&quot;.

In 2002, dead prez contributed to &quot;Red Hot + Riot&quot;, a compilation album created by the Red Hot Organization in tribute to the music and work of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. The money raised by the CD was used for various charities devoted to raising AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. They collaborated with fellow hip-hop artists Talib Kweli and Bilal and Brazilian singer Jorge Ben to remake the famous Fela Kuti song &quot;Shuffering and Shmiling&quot; for the album. Also in 2002, dead prez released the independent mix tape &quot;Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 1&quot;, followed by the release of &quot;Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin″&quot; in 2003. Also in 2003, their song &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; was featured in the 2 Fast 2 Furious soundtrack. In 2004, Columbia Records finally released &quot;Revolutionary But Gangsta&quot;. They were featured in the film &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;, in 2006.

In 2006, they and former 2Pac collaborators, the Outlawz, jointly released two new albums: &quot;Can&#x27;t Sell Dope Forever&quot; and &quot;Soldier 2 Soldier&quot;. In 2006, M1 also recorded a solo album titled &quot;Confidential&quot;. From the album, the song &quot;&#x27;Til We Get There&quot; was on the EA Sports video game &quot;NBA Live 07&quot;. In 2007, stic.man released his own solo record named &quot;Manhood&quot; with Boss Up Inc. / Traffic records. M-1 further appeared with ProfessorD.us, of the politically charged Hip Hop group The Dope Poet Society, on the track &quot;Everything&#x27;s Political&quot; off the 2008 album &quot;THIRD WORLD WARriors Vol. 1&quot;. On the track, M-1 and ProfessorD.us trade verses in response to the question &quot;why is your music always so political?&quot;. That same year, Stic.Man appeared on &quot;Changing Weather&quot;, the first single from Marcel Cartier&#x27;s album &quot;Revolutionary Minded 2&quot;.

Dead prez released a mixtape entitled &quot;Pulse of the People: Turn Off Your Radio Vol. 3&quot; on June 23, 2009. The mixtape is hosted by DJ Green Lantern. On Mother&#x27;s Day 2010, dead prez released &quot;The Beauty Within&quot;, a remix of B.o.B and Bruno Mars&#x27; #1 single &quot;Nothin&#x27; On You.&quot; Additionally in 2010, dead prez released a mixtape with DJ Drama entitled &quot;Turn Off the Radio Vol. 4: Revolutionary but Gangsta Grillz&quot;. The album is available for free download on their website, and they announced this release was their ten year commemoration of their most well known and commercially successful album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Free&quot;. The new album &quot;Information Age&quot; was released on October 16, 2012.

==Documentary (2006)==

In June 2006, the cable movie network Starz InBlack began airing an original documentary called &quot;Dead Prez: It&#x27;s Bigger Than Hip Hop&quot; directed by John Threat. The hour-long documentary featured live footage and interviews with dead prez, along with interviews from Kamel Bell, owner of Ankh Marketing and son of incarcerated Black Panther member Herman Bell; Fred Hampton Jr., son of Black Panther Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Chapter Fred Hampton; Bay Area rapper and poet Ise Lyfe, and hip hop activist and radio personality Davey D. Among the topics discussed in the documentary are the inadequacies of the public education system, Black entrepreneurship and social revolution.

M1 stated: 
We&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to express ourselves on this level of magnitude. Starz InBlack taking a chance on us lets us know that the work we are doing is not in vain. That our message is penetrating, it&#x27;s getting through.

<doc id="180537" wikidata="Q61306" url="?curid=180537" title="Guanajuato (city)">
<text>Guanajuato (, Otomi: ) is a municipality in central Mexico and the capital of the State of Guanajuato. It is part of the macroregion of the Bajío. It is located in a narrow valley, which makes its streets narrow and winding. Most are alleys that cars cannot pass through, and some are long sets of stairs up the mountainsides. Many of the city&#x27;s thoroughfares are partially or fully underground. The historic center has numerous small plazas and colonial-era mansions, churches, and civil constructions built using pink or green sandstone. The city historic center and the adjacent mines were proclaimed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.

The growth of Guanajuato resulted from the abundantly available minerals in the mountains surrounding it. Its mines were among the most important during the European colonization of America (along with Zacatecas also in Mexico, Potosí in Bolivia and Ouro Preto in Brazil). One of the mines, La Valenciana, accounted for two-thirds of the world&#x27;s silver production at the height of its production.

The city is home to the Mummy Museum, which contains naturally mummified bodies that were found in the municipal cemetery between the mid 19th and 20th centuries. It is also home to the Festival Internacional Cervantino, which invites artists and performers from all over the world as well as Mexico. Guanajuato was the site of the first battle of the Mexican War of Independence between newly assimilated Mexican insurgent warriors and royalist troops at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas.

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic period===
The first known inhabitants of the area were the Otomi, who were then displaced by the Chichimeca. There was Purépecha presence as well due mostly to ancient trading routes. The oldest known name for the area is “Mo-o-ti,” which means “place of metals.” Later, it was called &quot;Paxtitlán&quot; by the Aztecs, which means “place of Spanish moss.” The current name of Guanajuato comes from Purépecha (or in older orthography &quot;quanax huato&quot;), which means “frog hill”.

Mining had been done in this area long before the Spanish arrived. Late in the pre-Hispanic period the Aztecs had a presence here, specifically to look for metals to make ornamental objects for their political and religious elite. Some stories from this time state that the area was so rich in minerals that nuggets of gold could be picked up from the ground.

===Colonial era===
The Spanish found deposits of gold here in the 1540s and soon they sent soldiers and built forts. In 1548, the outpost was formally established with the name of Real de Minas de Guanajuato by viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza. Despite Chichimeca attacks, the population of the area grew rapidly with the arrival of Spanish and Creole migrants and indigenous and mestizo traders and workers. It was soon declared a town with the name of Santa Fe Real de Minas de Guanajuato, with Preafán de Rivera as mayor. Its first church was consecrated in 1555, and it was named an “alcaldía mayor” in 1574.

Initially, the city was divided into four barrios or neighborhoods called Marfil/Santiago, Tepetapa, Santa Ana and Santa Fe. The last is considered the oldest and is in the current colonia of Pastita. This city was split by a small river that served as a main thoroughfare. The oldest neighborhoods are Rayas y Mellado, Cata, La Valenciana, and Pastita, named after the mines found there.

The very first mineral vein discovered, called San Bernabé, attracted attention not only in New Spain, but in Spain itself. The discovery brought thousands of migrants to the area, which led to the discovery of other deposits, such as at the Rayas mine. The San Bernabé find produced until 1928, when it tapped out. Today, the remains of this mine are found in the small village of La Luz, just outside the city proper.

In 1679, by decree of viceroy of Mexico Fray Payo Enriquez de Rivera, the name was changed to Ciudad de Santa Fe y Real de Minas de Guanajuato (Very Noble and Loyal City of Santa Fe y Real de Minas de Guanajuato). It received an escutcheon in the same year, which is still in use. The city&#x27;s coat of arms has a gold background with an image of a woman in the center referring to the Holy Faith (Santa Fe). It contains other images such as a seashell supported by two laurel branches, blue ribbon and marble columns. It is topped with the royal crown of Castille and acanthus leaves.

In 1741, the city received the title of “The Most Noble and Loyal City of Santa Fe de Minas de Guanajuato” and became an “intendencia” (province) in 1790 because of the abundance of riches coming from its mines. In the 18th century, it was the world&#x27;s leading silver extraction center, making it the richest city in Mexico for much of the early colonial period. The production of the La Valenciana mine alone affected the world economy, and made the counts of Valencianas one of the most powerful families in New Spain. The city was one of the richest and most opulent in New Spain in the 18th century. This wealth is manifested in its civil and religious architecture. The colonial architecture includes some of the best Baroque and Churrigueresque examples in the New World—such as the Valenciana, Cata, and La Compañía (Jesuit) Churches, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guanajuato. Most constructions from this time are of pink or green sandstone. In the churches, the Baroque altars were gilded with gold from local mines. These structures have influenced later buildings throughout central Mexico. According to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the La Compañía and La Valenciana churches are considered among the most beautiful examples of Baroque architecture in Central and South America.

===Independence===
By the end of the 18th century, the lower classes were poor and oppressed despite the great wealth coming out of the mines. One event foreshadowing the Mexican War of Independence was a revolt carried out in the city attacking the heavily militarized Caja Real (building to hold the Crown&#x27;s share of mining production) to protest the high taxes. One year later there were large protests against the expulsion of the Jesuits.

The War of Independence broke out in the state of Guanajuato in the town of Dolores, when Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla shouted the “Grito de Dolores” and raised an insurgent army on September 15 and 16, 1810. This army marched to San Miguel, today San Miguel de Allende, and then on to the city of Guanajuato. Just on the outskirts on September 28, 1810, Hidalgo sent a warning letter to city authorities, but it was ignored. Instead, royalist troops and many of the elite made their stand at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary, an imposing building with few windows and thick walls. After entering the city unopposed, Hidalgo decided to attack the granary. This was the first battle against Spanish troops in the war and is popularly called the &#x27;Siege of the Alhondiga&#x27;. The insurgents were unable to take the heavily defended building as royalist gunfire kept them from approaching the only entrance until a miner by the name of Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, better known as El Pípila, strapped a large flat stone onto his back for protection. Crawling, he carried a flask of tar and a torch. When he reached the wooden doors of the main entrance, he smeared it with the tar and set it on fire. This allowed the insurgents to penetrate the building, defeat the Spanish royalist army and elite, and take over the heavily fortified and defended building. This action is commemorated by a colossal statue of El Pípila on a hill overlooking the city.

After Independence, the province of Guanajuato was made a state, and the city was made its capital in 1824. However, fighting in the state and the rest of the country continued as Liberals, who wanted a Federalist government, fought with Conservatives, who wanted a centralized government under a monarch or dictator. Power in the city and state changed hands between the two factions during much of the 19th century, taking its toll on mining. The city was the provisional capital of the country in 1858 as Liberal president Benito Juárez fought Conservative rebels. In 1863, the French took the city during the French Intervention in Mexico, receiving a visit from the installed Emperor Maximiliano I and his wife, Carlota. French occupation ended in early 1867. The Mexican General Florencio Antillón captured it on January 26, 1868, from the Conservatives.

Mining reactivated around the 1870s due to foreign investments encouraged by the Porfirio Díaz government. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries this renewed economic activity spurred new era Mexican projects such as the Juárez Theater, the Esperanza Dam, the Monumento a la Paz, the Hidalgo Monument and the State Government Palace.

Flooding had been a serious problem through most of the city&#x27;s history, due to the area&#x27;s steep compact hillsides. In 1760 and 1780 two major floods nearly wiped it out. This spurred construction of large ditches and tunnels to contain and divert overflows during the rainy season. These eventually crisscrossed a large part of the city. Dam construction in the 1960s brought the flooding under control, and many of the ditches and tunnels were converted into underground roadways.

The first Festival Internacional Cervantino was held in 1972. The historic city center was declared a World Heritage Site in 1988.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Two climates predominate. One is fairly hot and dominates in the south and southeast portions of the municipality. The other is temperate and dominates the rest of the territory, including the city. In the warmer areas, temperatures can reach as high as in the summer and in the coldest area can get as low as in the winter. Average temperature overall is with an average annual precipitation of between . Most of the rain falls during the monsoon season between June and September.

==Layout and transportation ==

Initially, the city was divided into four barrios or neighborhoods: Marfil/Santiago, Tepetapa, Santa Ana and Santa Fe. The last is considered the oldest and is in the current colonia of Pastita. The city was split by a small river that serves as a main thoroughfare. Because of the extremely hilly terrain, only one main road enters and another one leaves. The main street into the city, called Belaunzarán, now runs for three km underground and follows the original course of the Guanajuato River. Unlike the regular layouts of many other Spanish and Mexican cities, the streets of Guanajuato follow the extreme irregularity of the terrain, with small alleyways, plazas and in some cases steep staircases up hillsides. Most are paved with square cut stone, with only a limited number that are passable to cars. Most of the passageways are really alleys with a limited amount of open space in the way of very small plazas, which gives the city a more European flavor than other Mexican cities.

A number of these alleys have no names and some have whimsical names such as “Sal si puedes” (Exit if you can). Another famous alley is the Callejón Tecolote, through which Ignacio Allende and Miguel Hidalgo entered with their army in 1810. One alley near the State Government Palace is called the Callejón de la Condesa (Alley of the Countess). The name comes from the lady of one of the mansions who lived there in the very late 18th and very early 19th centuries. Ashamed of her husband&#x27;s bad reputation with other women, before and after the marriage, the Countess began to enter and leave her home through the back door into this alley to avoid the glances of the townspeople.

The most famous alley is the Callejón del Beso (Alley of the Kiss). Located on the slopes of the Cerro del Gallo hill in a neighborhood that dates back to the 18th century, it is only wide in places with balconies that nearly touch each other. Folklore states that couples who kiss on the third step (painted in red) are guaranteed seven years of happiness together. The name comes from a legend of two young lovers who come to a tragic end: Doña Carmen and Don Luis. Carmen&#x27;s father forbade the courting of his daughter by the young Luis, threatening to send her to a convent if she left the house to see him. Carmen&#x27;s balcony reached over this alley and nearly touched the balcony of the neighboring house. Luis found out who owned it and arranged access. One evening, while the two were on these balconies, Carmen&#x27;s father discovered them as Luis held Carmen&#x27;s hand between his own. Enraged, Carmen&#x27;s father stabbed her, leaving the shocked Luis holding the hand of his beloved as it grew cold and lifeless, giving it one final kiss.

The narrow streets and alleys have given rise to a pastime called &quot;callejoneadas&quot;. These are roving parties, traditionally held by the students of the University of Guanajuato with live musicians. Today, there are callejoneadas arranged for tourists as well.

Juárez Street is one of the few through streets on the surface. It is filled with stores and restaurants and has a constant flow of people and traffic. The other through streets of town are either partially or fully underground, following the old drainage ditches and tunnels dug during colonial times. Originally they were used for flood control, but modern dams have controlled flooding and left them dry, so they have been turned into thoroughfares in a city with little surface area. The most important of these roads is Miguel Hidalgo or Belaunzarán, which carried the runoff from the river that used to divide the city in two. Guanajuato&#x27;s version of the La Llorona story has the woman wandering its tunnels, some of which had rivers or streams running through them.

The streets and alleys of the city are filled with mostly colonial era buildings, restaurants, bars, cafes with terraces and small plazas. Buildings have been constructed of sandstone in pink and green, adobe and other stone, filling the streets with shades of pink, green, ocher and red. Most of these plazas are in front of or to the side of the many churches, such as the Plaza San Fernando, Plaza San Roque, Plaza de la Valenciana, Plaza de los Ángeles, and Plaza de Mexiamora. Exceptions to these are Jardín Reforma and Jardín Unión.

===The underground tunnels of Guanajuato===
The Guanajuato underground tunnels are a network of wide channels that help lead traffic away from the city center. These tunnels have different layer crossroads and underground junctions. The tunnels are used for traffic which is heading in an eastwards direction. The westward direction passes through the center of Guanajuato. All of the tunnels have footpaths and even some of the bus stops are subterranean.

The tunnel system of Guanajuato was built to prevent flooding. Túnel La Galereña is the longest tunnel of this network and was excavated in the early 19th century to lead the Guanajuato River away from the center of the city. In 1960s the old river tunnels were strengthened, as they were in a bad condition and showed signs of collapse and subsidence. After the reconstruction, they were converted into a road tunnel. The first road journey was in 1961. But the old tunnels were of a suitable size for cars, medium-sized bus and vans but prevented larger transport getting into the city. A second tunnel was dug during the late 1960s, which diverted the river much deeper. Several additional tunnels were excavated during the 1990s.

==Mines==

The mines that made Guanajuato rich are inside and just outside the city proper. A number of these mines gave rise to small communities with their own churches; these still exist with other institutions such as museums. The best-known mines gave their names to a number of the city&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods such as Cata, Rayas y Mellado, La Pastita, San Luisito and Valenciana. Some of these mines are open to the public for tours. The first significant mine was called San Bernabé, which brought thousands of adventurers to Guanajuato and led to the discovery of other mineral deposits. This mine functioned from the 16th century until 1928. The remains of this mine can still be found in the small village of La Luz just outside the city.

The most important of these mining complexes is La Valenciana mine, on the northern edge of the city. It began operation in 1774. From then until the early 19th century it was one of the most productive silver mines in the world, accounting for 2/3 of the world&#x27;s production at its peak. It produced 80% of all silver mined in the state of Guanajuato and one-sixth of all Mexico. For over 250 years, it produced about 30% of the world&#x27;s silver. The mine continues operation today. Production is much diminished, but one ton of rock is still extracted every six minutes. The largest shaft descends for 450 meters and about 10,000 miners have worked it over its history.
The mine made its owners, the Counts of Valenciana, extremely wealthy and powerful. The first Count of Valenciana, Antonio de Obregón y Alcocer had the San Cayetano Church (also known as La Valenciana Church) built near the entrance of this mine. Dedicated to Saint Cajetan, it was built between 1765 and 1788. The church has a Churrigueresque portal, which has been compared to the Mexico City Cathedral and La Santisima Church, both in Mexico City. The interior conserves a number of gilded altarpieces and a pulpit that is encrusted with ivory and precious hardwoods. The interior also contains agraffito work and paintings from the 19th century.

Near La Valenciana Mine is the Guadalupe Mine, established in the 16th century. This complex was built with extremely large and thick stone walls supported by buttresses, giving it the look of a medieval fortress. The mine is no longer in operation but the complex has been undergoing redevelopment as a resort.

La Cata mine is one of the early mines, and a city neighborhood is named after it. The mine is near Don Quijote Plaza. It began operations in 1558 with peak production in the first quarter of the 18th century. It was owned by the Marquis of San Clemente. The center of the neighborhood is Señor de Villaseca Church, more commonly called La Cata Church. This church was built in the 17th century in Mexican Baroque or Churrigueresque style similar to that of La Valenciana Church. The church holds a valued crucifix called the Señor del Villaseca and is registered as a Mexican Federal Historic Monument.

The Bocamina de San Ramón mine is one of the city&#x27;s early mines, with the deposit found by some travelers in the early 16th century. In 1548, its mother lode was found. Today, the mine is a tourist attraction in which visitors can descend into the earth through the old shafts. The complex has a patio area, a gallery of minerals and a bar called El Petardo, which once was the gunpowder storage room.

The Rayas mine gave rise to one of the city&#x27;s original neighborhoods, after having been found in 1550 by Juan Rayas. The mine&#x27;s apogee occurred in the 18th century, giving its owner, José de Sardineta y Legaspi the titles of Viscount of Sardineta and Marquis of Rayas. Today it is found on a section of the Carretera Panorámica (Panoramic Highway) that circles the city. The complex walls are tall and are held up by stone buttresses. It has one of the longest mine shafts in the world, which extends into the earth for 425 meters.

The Castile of Santa Cecilia is a majestic medieval-style construction built on a former 17th century mining hacienda. The current building functions as a hotel.

==Mummies==

The city&#x27;s most famous tourist attraction is the Mummies of Guanajuato, which are in their own museum on the side of the municipal cemetery in the Tepetapa neighborhood. The Mummy Museum contains a collection of specimens that mummified naturally in the adjoining cemetery. Authorities began exhuming bodies in 1870, when a new law required residents to pay a tax for perpetual burial. If survivors didn&#x27;t pay the tax, they exhumed the body. If the body was mummified, they stored it in a building above ground and people began paying to see them in the late 1800s. The burial tax was abolished in 1958. At first, the mummies were displayed in a poorly lit tunnel that visitors entered with a torch or candle. Visitors were allowed to touch the mummies with some even breaking off pieces for souvenirs or to verify the body was real. The modern museum opened in 1970 with proper lighting and ventilation, and the mummies protected behind glass.

The collection contains 111 mummies, mostly women, with some men and about 20 children, but only 59 of these are on display. It is considered the largest collection of mummies in the Western Hemisphere. Almost all of the people were commoners and came from backgrounds such as miners and farmers. The mummies were disinterred from the municipal cemetery between 1870 and 1958, and were people who died between 1850 and 1950. The first of the documented mummies, which has been on display in one form or another since the 1870s, is that of a French doctor named Remigio Leroy. He can be seen at the current museum. Of the children in the collection, one can see evidence of a practice where deceased Catholic children were dressed as angels, if girls, or as saints, if boys, to indicate their purity and assured entrance into heaven. Several are babies, including one considered the smallest mummy in the world. Two of these small bodies were partially embalmed by taking out internal organs and replacing the cavities with packing material. One was a fetus, which probably miscarried at about 24 weeks, and the other is a newborn male infant. This embalming process may have enhanced the natural mummification process but was not the cause. It is not known why these had been embalmed, nor are their years of death exactly known. There is a mummy of a woman who died in childbirth or miscarriage (a dried placenta is attached to her) but it is not known if she is the mother of either of these mummified children.

Although only one out of every 100 bodies interred in the cemetery became naturally mummified, the concentration of this phenomenon has led to theories about how they have come about. Some believe that they are the result of people who had been buried alive, after mistakenly declared dead. These people, according to belief, died of desperation and asphyxiation and as a sign of their pain, convert into mummies. More commonly, it is likely the result of Guanajuato&#x27;s altitude or the abundance of minerals in the soil. However, all of the mummified remains were found in the cemetery&#x27;s above ground cement crypts, not in underground graves. Researchers believe the phenomenon is due to the warm, dry climate of the area, which dried out the bodies rapidly.

One of the main reasons for the mummies’ fame in Mexico is the 1972 film &quot;El Santo contra las momias de Guanajuato&quot;, which featured Mexico&#x27;s most famous lucha libre wrestler, El Santo, as well as two others called Blue Demon and Mil Máscaras. In this movie, the mummies are reanimated by a wrestler known as “Satán” and El Santo fights to defeat them. It was filmed in the Guanajuato cemetery and has since become a cult classic.

A mayor of the city, Dr. Eduardo Hicks, initiated the Guanajuato Mummy Research Project in 2007 to increase knowledge and awareness of the specimens. They have since been extensively studied in Mexico and the United States. The study has found evidence of medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, extreme anemia lung damage from smoke inhalation and tuberculosis. Some of the research looked into the folklore surrounding a number of the mummies such as the man with a misshapen face thought to have been caused by a mortal blow, a woman who was supposedly hanged by her husband and a woman who is thought to have been buried alive. No scientific evidence has been found to support the last two stories. Without records, it is not possible to know exactly when some mummies died. Carbon 14 cannot help because it has a margin of error of 50 years and it is already known that the mummies died between 1850 and 1950. In 2009, 36 of the mummies were displayed for the first time outside of Mexico, at the Detroit Science Center in the United States as part of a tour to last until 2012. They have been the focus of a National Geographic documentary series called &quot;The Mummy Road Show,&quot; which covered 18 of the mummies.

==Festival Cervantino==

The world-famous Festival Internacional Cervantino is an annual cultural event, held in the city of Guanajuato, which sponsors a large number of artistic and cultural events with artists invited from Mexico and all over the world. The event is named in honor of Miguel de Cervantes, author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The festival began in 1972, as short plays performed by University of Guanajuato students based on the works of Cervantes. In 2010, special guests included the state of Querétaro and the country of Colombia. The 2010 edition of the festival included performers such as Tangokineses from Argentina and Cumbia Cienaguera from Colombia. In total there were 424 events over 26 days.

The festival hosts events such as opera, theater productions, film showings, art exhibitions, academic conferences and talks, concerts and dance recitals. The performances occur in 70 venues over most of the month of October. Events are held throughout the city, with some in other locations such as Mexico City, Guadalajara and San Miguel de Allende. The most important venue in Guanajuato for the festival is Juárez Theater, which is located close to Jardín de la Unión (Union Garden). Other important venues in the city are Teatro Principal, Cervantes Theater and facilities of the University of Guanajuato. Events are also held in area churches, plazas and even on the streets. Festival International Cervantino Callejero is a parallel event sponsored by &quot;Centro Libre de Experimentación Teatral y Artística (CLETA)&quot;. In 2010, this event featured 300 performances with social themes. This annual event was begun in 1975, inspired in part by The Beatles’ &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album cover.

==Landmarks==
===Area around Plaza de la Paz, Basilica and the Legislative Palace===

The center of the modern city is Plaza de la Paz (Plaza of Peace), also known as Plaza Mayor (Main Plaza). Since the colonial period, the richest of the city&#x27;s families built their main homes here, along with government buildings and the parish church, now a basilica. This plaza is a garden with a sculpture of a woman representing peace; its placement here in the late 19th century caused the official name to change to Plaza de la Paz. Today, the plaza is surrounded by the basilica, other churches, and governmental and commercial buildings, many of which were once mansions. Still remaining around the plaza are mansions that belonged to local nobility such as the Counts of Rul, Count of Gálvez, and the Count De los Chico. The Rul house was constructed at the end of the 18th century by architect Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras. It is noted for its inner courtyard, with architectural features from ancient Greece. Alexander von Humboldt stayed here in 1803. Later, the house became known as Palacio de Otero. The Casa Real de Ensaye is a Baroque mansion that, on its façade, bears the first noble coat of arms granted in Guanajuato.

The main church of the city is Basílica Colegiata de Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato built between 1671 and 1696. Overall, the church is a sober Mexican Baroque in style but there are popular elements from donations made by the area&#x27;s miners, and other elements that demonstrate the influence of several of the city&#x27;s rich mining nobility. The Marquis of San Clemente and Pedro Lascuráin de Retana were the current building&#x27;s first patrons. Later, the Counts of Valenciana left their influence as well with the donation of a clock for one of the towers and the acquisition of relics related to a saint and martyr named Faustina obtained from the Pope. These relics are in the main altar. The main portal is made of pink sandstone with “estipite” or inverted truncated pyramidal columns. The focus of the main altar is the image of Our Lady of Guanajuato (Nuestra Señora de Guanjuato), who is the patroness of the city. She was donated to the city by Carlos I and his son Felipe II in 1557. In 1696, the church gained minor basilica status and full basilica status in 1957.

The Legislative Palace or state government building was the site of the Aduana or Casas Consistoriales (customs house) in the colonial period. The current building was constructed by Cecilio Luis Long in a European style popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and inaugurated in 1903.The façade has a Neoclassical portal in sandstone of colors typical of the Guanajuato area. It contains the legislative chamber called the Sala de Sessiones, decorated with 19th- and 20th-century paintings and somber furniture.

===Alhóndiga de Granaditas===

Alhóndiga de Granaditas is a very large building covering an entire block. It was originally built to store enough grain to feed the city for a year to protect the population against famines such as those that occurred in 1783, due to crop failure. This gave the building its name, which roughly translates to “house of grain.” The building is two floors, nearly windowless with a very large courtyard in its interior. Construction began in 1798 under an architect named Durán y Villaseñor and terminated under José del Mazo.

The Alhóndiga only served its original function for eight months after it was built. The main reason for its importance today is that it was the site of the first battle of the Mexican War of Independence between insurgents and royalist troops on September 28, 1810. When Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende and the insurgent army approached the city, royalist troops under Lieutenant Riaño and the city&#x27;s elite took refuge in the building, along with millions of pesos of silver and other loot. The insurgents quickly surrounded the building, but the building proved difficult to penetrate due to the lack of openings and royalist gunfire.

The battle remained a stalemate until a miner from San Miguel de Allende devised a way to approach the building&#x27;s main entrance. This miner, whose name was Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, is better known as El Pípila, who had joined the insurgent army as it passed through his hometown. El Pípila strapped a large flat stone over his back and, carrying a flask of tar and a torch, crawled towards the main entrance. The stone protected him from the bullets fired at him. When he reached the heavy wooden door of the entrance, he smeared it with tar and lit it. This allowed insurgents to then take the building.

After the battle it was used as barracks, a tenement and tobacco warehouse. From 1864 to 1949, it was used as the state penitentiary. In 1949 the building was converted into the Museo Regional de Guanajuato, documenting the history of the area and its role in Mexican national history from the pre-Hispanic period to the present divided among fourteen halls on the upper floor. On the ground floor there are large mascarons of José Mariano Jiménez, Vicente Guerrero, Ignacio Allende and Ignacio Aldama. The main hall has mascarons of Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos y Pavón who “guard” the national coat of arms. In front of this is an eternal flame that is renewed each September 28. The walls of the main stairwell contain mural work by José Chávez Morado that alludes to Independence. It houses a large collection of ceramics from western parts of Mesoamerica, especially from Chupícuaro. It contains works by Guanajuato artist Hermeneguildo Bustos and photographer Romualdo García. There are displays related to the building itself, to its construction, its original function as a granary and its role in one of the first battles of the War of Independence. The large courtyard within the Alhóndiga is a traditional place to celebrate Mexico&#x27;s Independence Day with the reenactment of Miguel Hidalgo&#x27;s “El Grito de Dolores.” It is one of the sites for a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino. The museum was restored in 2010 for the Bicentennial by the INAH at a cost of 5.7 million pesos as part of similar museums in Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende to form the Ruta de Independencia (Independence Route). The work was the first renovation of the building in 20 years.

===University of Guanajuato===

The University of Guanajuato began as a Jesuit school for children in the first half of the 18th century. The establishment of this school was sponsored by Josefa Teresa de Busto y Moya, sister of the Marquis of San Clemente, who obtained permission for the school from the Spanish Crown in 1732 and established the institution in her home. She donated a fifth of her fortune toward it and worked to obtain donations from other wealthy families in the city. However, credit for the establishment of the school is most often given to Jesuits. Over time, the school grew and began to offer high school and professional level studies. It held several names over its history, from Real Colegio de la Purísima Concepción (1767), Colegio del Estado (1828), Colegio Nacional de Guanajuato (1867), with its current name adopted in 1945. The Colegio del Estado name was prompted by the fact that the institution became the property of the state in 1828. In 1945, it gained university status.

Today the institution serves approximately 30,000 students at the high school, bachelor&#x27;s and graduate levels. In addition to the main campus in the city, there are nine others in other parts of Guanajuato state. The university hosts a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino, with its famous stairway acting as seating. The best known facility of the institution is the main building in Guanajuato city, which was built in Neoclassical style in green stone. It houses the dean&#x27;s office, administrative offices and a number of the institution&#x27;s departments. The main building is recognized by its long staircase with 113 steps, which empties onto the Callejón del Estudiante. Under the main roof is a 16th-century chapel that was sponsored by Vasco de Quiroga for indigenous mine workers. It&#x27;s called the &quot;Templo de los Hospitales&quot; (Temple of the Hospitals). It received the image of the Virgin of the Rosary, now called the Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato.

The Museo de Historia Natural Alfredo Dugès is on the ground floor of the University of Guanajuato&#x27;s main building. It contains a national-level collection of fossils, plants and animals. The importance of this collection comes from its state of conservation and its age. The collection was gathered by Alfredo Dugés and donated to the university.

===Other plazas and churches===
The city is dotted with a large number of small plazas or squares that were built along with the churches that usually gave them their names. One of the best-known plazas or open spaces is &quot;Jardín de la Unión&quot;, on the south side of San Diego Church. The garden is filled with carefully pruned Indian laurels and, in addition to the church, is surrounded by small cafes, restaurants, and Juárez Theater. It occupies a triangular space that originally was the church atrium. In 1883, wrought iron benches and a kiosk were installed. Today, concerts are held in this kiosk on occasion. It is popular with wandering student musicians performing callejoneadas and functions as the atrium of San Diego Church. This church has a Churrigueresque façade. The interior has paintings from the 18th century, Neoclassical altarpieces and a crucifix called Cristo de Burgos, which was donated to the church by the Count of Valenciana. The current church was built between 1780 and 1784 by the Count of Valenciana after the original was destroyed by a flood. In the 19th century, its original gilded altarpieces were replaced with the current Neoclassical ones. The monastery, which was also destroyed, was never rebuilt, but the site is now home to San Diego Museum. It was created to rescue and display the cultural inheritance of the city, describing its development and changes from its beginnings to the present day. It also contains a computer simulation of what the original monastery looked like.

Located next to the university, the Templo de la Compañía de Jesús (Temple of the Society of Jesus), or Oratorio de San Felipe (commonly known as &quot;La Compañía&quot;), was built in 1746 by José Joaquín Sardaneta y Legazpi. It was completed in 1767, the same year that the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain. The new church remained abandoned until 1804, when the order was allowed to return and reclaim it. The order then worked to renovate the church, replacing Baroque elements with Neoclassical ones, which were then in fashion. It has a façade with narrow estipite columns in Churrigueresque style, but its more famous aspect is a colossal cupola with three levels, which was added in the 19th century by architect Vicente Heredia. Inside, a collection of 180 paintings were recently studied and restored. Some of these paintings are displayed in the church complex, while the rest are kept in a pinacotheca created for the purpose. The main altar and the paintings are by Miguel Cabrera.

Dating from 1726, the oldest plaza still in existence is Plaza de Baratillo. The name comes from a weekly market, once held on Sundays. This market specialized in low prices (baratillo means “very cheap”). In the center is a fountain brought from Florence, Italy. This fountain once provided area residents with potable water from the Olla Dam. Today, it is purely ornamental.

Another important area of the historic center is the San Roque plaza and church. There is a stone cross, which indicates the ground was once used as a cemetery. Starting in the 1950s, this plaza was used for short one-act plays called &quot;Entremeses Cervantinos&quot;, which later developed into the Festival Cervantino. The plaza is still used for these plays as well as events associated with the annual event. San Roque Church dates from 1726. It has a sober Baroque façade and contains an important collection of colonial era paintings.

Other important churches include the Temple of Guadalupe from the 18th century in sober Baroque, and El Pardo Church from the 18th century with a façade covered with sculpted plants. San Francisco Church on Sopeña Street faces a plaza with the same name. It has a Baroque façade of pink stone with a green tint, a staircase with wrought iron railings and a small fountain. Belén Church was built in the 18th century by the Count of Valenciana with a modest façade. It is across from Hidalgo Market and on the street leading to Alhóndiga de Granaditas. El Mellado Church was part of La Merced Monastery. The cloister area is now in ruins but the church remains and is dedicated to the veneration of Our Lady of Mercy. The original Baroque altarpieces were replaced with Neoclassical ones in the 19th century.

Jardín Reforma or Reforma Square was originally a market, built in 1861. When Hidalgo Market opened, most vendors moved out. In 1923, the site was renovated into a garden with a central fountain and Indian laurel, eucalyptus and cypress trees. Jardín Reforma has an arched entryway with a series of thin columns.

Plaza del Quijote is at the old San Antonio bridge and to the side of San Diego Church. The plaza was created to honor the 400th anniversary of the first edition of &quot;Don Quixote of La Mancha&quot; in 1605.

===Other civil constructions===

The Juárez Theater (Teatro Juárez) is located across from the San Diego Church in the city&#x27;s downtown. It is one of the main venues of the Cervantino Festival. It is considered one of the most beautiful theaters in the country, according to Mexico Desconocido. It was built from 1872 to 1903 and is in Neoclassical style with a façade containing nine sculptures depicting the Muses of Greek mythology.

The south façade has a lintel with the word “Tragedia” on it and on the north façade, the matching lintel reads “Comedia.” The interior has an eclectic design richly decorated. The vestibule or foyer (also called the Smoking Room) has columns and garlands. The auditorium is Mauresque with Arabesque detail throughout. The curtain contains an image of Constantinople. The theater was built from 1872 to 1903 by Antonio Rivas Mercado, who designed the Angel of Independence monument in Mexico City, and was inaugurated with the opera Aida by Giuseppe Verdi with President Porfirio Díaz in attendance. It is the only theater in the country that has conserved its original furnishings.

On the side of Juárez Theater, there is Rincón del Arte. Next to this is a cable car that rises up to the Pípila Monument on San Miguel Hill. The monument honors the insurgent who managed to torch the main entrance of Alhóndiga de Granaditas. The monument consists of a giant statue of El Pípila raising a torch over his head. Around the monument, there is an esplanade and overlook which permits a panoramic view of nearly the entire city.

Teatro Principal (Main Theater) was built at the city&#x27;s height when the wealth of the mines attracted entertainers. It was the first theater in the city, built in Neoclassical style and one of the few places where people of different social strata could enter. The theater closed periodically during its early history due to sociopolitical upheavals. After the Mexican Revolution, it was converted into a movie theater. Shortly after this, it suffered a fire and closed for 30 years. Today, it is reconstructed and run by the University of Guanajuato as one of the main venues of the Cervantino Festival.

Unlike other theaters in the city, which were stage theaters converted into movie houses at one point or another, Cervantes Theater was a movie house that was converted into a stage theater. It is used for puppet shows, dance recitals, experimental theater and conferences.

Hidalgo Market was built by Ernesto Brunel in 1910 over what was the site of the old Gavira bullring. It was inaugurated by President Porfirio Díaz to celebrate Mexico&#x27;s Centennial of Independence. The roof has a cupola with a clock tower. The clock has four faces. The interior of the market is a giant metallic nave. The market sells typical candies of the region such as “charamuscas,” which are often shaped as a charro or mummy and wrapped in wax paper. The upper floor of the market contains a large number of crafts and souvenir shops containing products such as baskets, knit items, ceramics, leathercrafts and more. The ground floor has many everyday items such as fresh and packaged food, household goods, wickerwork and hardware.

Museo del Pueblo de Guanajuato was created to exhibit the best of the artwork of the city. It contains an important collection of religious art from the 17th to 19th centuries. It contains collections of works by Olga Costa and José Chávez Morado. This includes three murals by Chávez Morado set up as altars. These murals depict the end of the colonial period and the War of Independence.

Diego Rivera Museum was the house where the painter was born and spent his early childhood. The first floor is dedicated to furniture and other items from the late 19th century. The floors above contain a large collection of paintings, about 100 of which are Rivera&#x27;s early and little known works. It has workshops for arts, literary events, film showings and other cultural activities.

Very near Jardín Unión, on Luis González Obregón Street is Casa de Gobierno, where Benito Juárez made the city the temporary capital of Mexico. Next to Casa de Gobierno is Real Caja de Guanajuato, which dates from 1665. It was the scene of the naming of the first authorities of a Mexico declared liberated from Spanish rule. Later it was used as a women&#x27;s prison and teachers’ college.

Museo Iconográfico del Quijote is on Manuel Doblado Street. It was created in 1987 to honor Don Quixote. The museum contains visual representations of the character, including some created by notable artists such as Pedro Coronel, José Guadalupe Posada and Salvador Dalí.
Museo de Arte Olga Costa y José Chávez Morado is in Pastita neighborhood, installed in a building in the former Guadalupe Hacienda. This was the home of the two artists, who donated the structure and their personal art collection to the city after their deaths. The collection contains their own works as well as works by a number of other artists.

Casa Museo Gene Byron, in the suburb of Marfil, was the former Santa Ana Hacienda and belonged to Canadian artist Gene Byron. Byron began studying Mexican muralists in 1941, but her work was also influenced by contemporary Spanish artists. She and her husband settled in Guanajuato in 1958, and took over this ex-hacienda in 1962. Today the grounds are a cultural center that hosts art exhibitions, theatrical productions, concerts, and book presentations.

Estadio José Aguilar y Maya is a Baseball Stadium in the City.

==Municipality==
As the seat of a municipality, the city of Guanajuato is the local government for over 373 communities, which cover an area of . The total population of the municipality is 194,500. This municipality is in Region I in the northeast of the state. It borders the municipalities of San Felipe, Dolores Hidalgo, Salamanca, Irapuato, Silao and León.

Most of the territory is covered by Sierra of Guanajuato also called Sierra of San Gregorio. Principal elevations include Santa Rosa, Chichíndaro, Sirena, Bufa Picacho and Bufa Peñón all near the city. Others include La Giganta, El Gigante, Los Llanitos and Vaquería in the east and north. These peaks average above sea level. The territory is filled with small streams, arroyos, and rivers, which wind around the steep mountains. These include El Cedeño, La Goya, La Hernia, El Salto and La Cebada.

Ecosystems vary from low rainforest that loses leaves in the dry season, to areas with trees never exceeding 15 meters, grassland and temperate forest, some dominated by trees of the Prosopis family. In most areas, small mammals such as skunks, tlacuache, rabbits, and badgers dominate—with coyotes and deer found in isolated areas. Reptiles such as rattlesnakes, frogs, and lizards can be found, as well as some bird and insect species.

According to INEGI, the only indigenous language spoken in the municipality is Nahuatl and only by 330 people. Almost all of the municipality&#x27;s residents profess the Catholic faith, with most of those who do not following a Protestant or Evangelical Christian creed.

Under 50% of the municipality&#x27;s population is economically active, but of these very few are unemployed. Commerce and services employ the largest number of people followed by construction and mining. Agriculture is extremely limited due to the very rugged terrain. However, some crops of sorghum, alfalfa, peanuts and fruits are produced. Livestock is produced on a very small scale and includes cattle, goats and sheep. Mining is the economic activity that spurred the founding of the city. However, extraction of minerals today is minimal, with gold and silver ores almost exhausted. Kaolin and lead are still mined. Principal mining companies include Las Torres, Santa Fe de Guanajuato and El Cubo. The most important segments of the economy now are tourism and commerce. The city&#x27;s rich cultural and artistic heritage, along with its colonial area constructions, are what attract visitors. For the rural areas around the city, it is the place to shop for supplies not available at home. This includes foods, auto parts and service, banking services and more.

Cerro de la Bufa is very close to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories associated with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. They are on opposite sides of the summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each July 31, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.
Presa de la Olla is a dam that was constructed in the mid 18th century to supply the city with potable water. The area became a popular gathering place for young aristocrats, and later the lower classes as well. The area hosts the Feast of San Juan every June 24. The origin of this event dates from the colonial period when a poor miner came here to give thanks for the recent arrival of rains. The current event culminates with the “opening of the dam,” which attracts hundreds to watch the water flow. Today, the event stretches over the second and third week in June and has taken on new elements such as a beauty contest and dances with techno, reggaetón, Duranguese and Grupero music. The dam is used for water sports, and there is a park named Florencio Antillon Garden next to it.

The Christ the King Monument was constructed on the top of Cubilete Mountain in 1923 by architect Nicolás Mariscal Piña and sculptor Fidias Elizondo. The sculpture stands tall and shows Christ with his arms extended flanked by two angels who hold a crown of thorns and a royal crown. The sculpture weighs . From the plaza, one can see the entire Bajio Valley.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Guanajuato City has reached twin town and sister city agreements with a substantial number of cities for a relatively small city in a Mexican context (123rd largest city in 2015).

<text>Dilated Peoples is an American Los Angeles-based hip hop trio, composed of rapper and record producer Evidence, rapper Rakaa, and Beat Junkies deejay and record producer DJ Babu. The group is better known in the UK, where they reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart with two tracks, &quot;This Way&quot; and &quot;Worst Comes to Worst&quot;. Their songs were featured in the 2003 video games &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; and &quot;NBA Street Vol. 2&quot;, as well as MLB 06: The Show.

==History==
Dilated Peoples began when DJ Babu (from the DJ crew Beat Junkies), Evidence, and Rakaa joined in 1992 and released &quot;Third Degree&quot; (1997) on ABB Records, developing their material in the underground hip hop community. They had previously recorded an album titled &quot;Imagery, Battle Hymns &amp; Political Poetry&quot; (1995) that was never released, although many fans still have it on bootlegged tapes. The group eventually signed with Capitol Records and released &quot;The Platform&quot; (2000).

The second album, &quot;Expansion Team&quot;, was released in 2001 led by the Alchemist–produced &quot;Worst Comes to Worst,&quot; which utilized a vocal sample from Mobb Deep&#x27;s &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; and a musical sample from William Bell&#x27;s &quot;I Forgot to be Your Lover&quot;. &quot;Expansion Team&quot; debuted at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart and number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot;, was released in 2004 and debuted at number 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 143,000 copies in the United States. In addition to the Kanye West-produced single, &quot;This Way,&quot; it featured the singles &quot;Who&#x27;s Who?&quot; and &quot;Sorry? OK&quot;, which were also included as tracks on the &quot;Need for Speed: Underground&quot; and &quot;SSX 3&quot; soundtracks, and peaked at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart. The fourth album, &quot;20/20&quot;, was released in 2006; the debut single, &quot;Back Again&quot;, was featured on the &quot;Fight Night Round 3&quot; soundtrack. This is the third EA Games soundtrack on which the group has been featured. &quot;Back Again&quot; is also featured on Sony&#x27;s &quot;MLB 06: The Show&quot;. In 2012, they collaborated with PlatinumGames to record the track &quot;This is Madness&quot; for the credits of the beat-&#x27;em-up video game, &quot;Anarchy Reigns&quot;. 20/20 was the group&#x27;s &quot;farewell&quot; album on Capitol Records, ending a four album recording contract. They also work with the underground hip hop group, Global Warning, who originated in Anaheim.

Dilated Peoples are affiliated with fellow West Coast hip hop collective the Likwit Crew. Tha Alkaholiks appeared on &quot;The Platform&quot; on the track &quot;Right On&quot; and &quot;Expansion Team&quot; on &quot;Heavy Rotation&quot;. The group also collaborated frequently with west coast emcees Defari and Amad Jamal (an Urban Umpires member) and helped to launch their careers. Defari made one appearance on each Dilated Peoples&#x27; album: &quot;Ear Drums Pop (Remix)&quot; on &quot;The Platform&quot;; &quot;Defari Interlude&quot; on &quot;Expansion Team&quot;; &quot;Closed Session&quot; on &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot;; and &quot;Olde English&quot; on &quot;20/20&quot;. Dilated Peoples also made multiple appearances on Defari&#x27;s album &quot;Odds &amp; Evens&quot;. Another Dilated associate is their long-time producer, the Alchemist, who produced five songs on &quot;The Platform&quot;, three songs on &quot;Expansion Team&quot;, four songs on &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot;, and two songs on &quot;20/20&quot;. Dilated Peoples were featured on a song on the Alchemists&#x27; &quot;1st Infantry&quot; album. Rakaa has also made guest appearances on the songs &quot;Trance Fat&quot; on Looptroop&#x27;s album, &quot;Good Things&quot;, &quot;Zet &#x27;t Blauw&quot; from Dutch rapper Jerome XL&#x27;s album, &quot;De laatste dag&quot; and &quot;Memory Fades&quot; on St. Cule&#x27;s album, &quot;American Beef&quot;.

<text>Niboshi (煮干し), often called iriko (炒り子) in Western Japan, are small dried fish used in Japanese cuisine for making &quot;dashi&quot; (soup stock). They can also be eaten as snacks, or as a side dish. The types of fish used include anchovies, sardines, round herring, and others. Niboshi made of anchovies are the most common.

== Name ==
The word &quot;niboshi&quot; (煮干し) literally means &quot;boiled&quot; or &quot;dried&quot;, and it does not include the specific name of the ingredient. For this reason, &quot;niboshi&quot; is translated both as &quot;dried sardine&quot; and &quot;dried anchovy&quot;.

The translation of the term &quot;niboshi&quot; is an object of confusion among Japanese speakers, in terms of whether it is sardines or anchovies, because in Japanese, both sardine and anchovy are referred to as &quot;iwashi&quot; (イワシ).

== Usage ==
In Japan, &quot;niboshi dashi&quot; is one of the more common forms of dashi. It is especially popular as the base stock when making miso soup. Niboshi dashi is made by soaking niboshi in plain water. If left overnight or brought nearly to a boil, the flavor of niboshi permeates the water to make the stock.

Niboshi are also cooked and served as snacks. They are eaten as one of the symbolic foods during the Japanese New Year, referred to as osechi. &quot;Tazukuri&quot; (fried sweet and savory sardines) are made by frying the dried sardines and then adding a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, mirin, and roasted white sesame seeds.

<doc id="180541" wikidata="Q7696946" url="?curid=180541" title="Television Act 1954">
<text>The Television Act 1954 (2 &amp; 3 Eliz. 2. c. 55) was a British law which permitted the creation of the first commercial television network in the United Kingdom, ITV.

Until the early 1950s, the only television service in Britain was operated as a monopoly by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and financed by the annual television licence fee payable by each household which contained one or more television sets. The new Conservative government elected in 1951 wanted to create a commercial television channel, but this was a controversial subject—the only other examples of commercial television were to be found in the United States, and it was widely considered that the commercial television found there was &quot;vulgar&quot;.

The solution to the problem was to create the Independent Television Authority which would closely regulate the new commercial channel in the interests of good taste, and award franchises to commercial companies for fixed terms.

The first commercial franchises were awarded in 1954, and commercial television started broadcasting in stages between 1955 and 1962. The first advertisement aired by ITV promoted Gibbs SR toothpaste at 8:12pm on 22 September 1955. Household cleaners were the most frequently advertised products over the 1955–1960 period.

The act was extended to the Isle of Man by the &#x27; (SI 1957/602) and to the Channel Islands by the &#x27; (SI 1961/2039).

<doc id="180542" wikidata="Q188754" url="?curid=180542" title="Himeji Castle">
<text>() is a hilltop Japanese castle complex situated in Himeji, a city in the Hyōgo Prefecture of Japan. The castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. The castle is frequently known as &quot;Hakuro-jō&quot; or &quot;Shirasagi-jō&quot; (&quot;White Egret Castle&quot; or &quot;White Heron Castle&quot;) because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight.

As with almost all Japanese castles from the Azuchi-Momoyama period onward, the , the most prominent structure, was used as a storehouse in times of peace and as a fortified tower in times of war, and the &#x27;s government offices and residences were located in a group of single-story buildings near the &quot;tenshu&quot; and the surrounding .

Himeji Castle dates to 1333 when Akamatsu Norimura built a fort on top of Himeyama hill. The fort was dismantled and rebuilt as Himeyama Castle in 1346 and then remodeled into Himeji Castle two centuries later. Himeji Castle was then significantly remodeled in 1581 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who added a three-story castle keep. In 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu awarded the castle to Ikeda Terumasa for his help in the Battle of Sekigahara, and Ikeda completely rebuilt the castle from 1601 to 1609, expanding it into a large castle complex. Several buildings were later added to the castle complex by Honda Tadamasa from 1617 to 1618. For almost 700 years, Himeji Castle has remained intact, even throughout the bombing of Himeji in World War II, and natural disasters including the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.

Himeji Castle is the largest and most visited castle in Japan, and it was registered in 1993 as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country. The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site and five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures. Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan&#x27;s three premier castles. The castle buildings underwent restoration work for several years and reopened to the public on March 27, 2015. The works also removed decades of dirt and grime, restoring the formerly grey roof to its original brilliant white color.

== History ==
Himeji Castle&#x27;s construction dates to 1333, when a fort was constructed on Himeyama hill by Akamatsu Norimura, the ruler of the ancient Harima Province. In 1346, his son Sadanori demolished this fort and built Himeyama Castle in its place. In 1545, the Kuroda clan was stationed here by order of the Kodera clan, and feudal ruler Kuroda Shigetaka remodeled the castle into Himeji Castle, completing the work in 1561. In 1580, Kuroda Yoshitaka presented the castle to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and in 1581 Hideyoshi significantly remodeled the castle, building a three-story keep with an area of about .

Following the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Tokugawa Ieyasu granted Himeji Castle to his son-in-law, Ikeda Terumasa, as a reward for his help in battle. Ikeda demolished the three-story keep Hideyoshi had built in 1581, and completely rebuilt and expanded the castle from 1601 to 1609, adding three moats and transforming it into the castle complex that is seen today. The expenditure of labor involved in this expansion is believed to have totaled 2.5 million man-days. Ikeda died in 1613, passing the castle to his son, who also died three years later. In 1617, Honda Tadamasa and his family inherited the castle, and Honda added several buildings to the castle complex, including a special tower for his daughter-in-law, called &quot;keshō yagura&quot; (Dressing Tower).

In the Meiji Period (1868–1912), many Japanese castles were destroyed. Himeji Castle was abandoned in 1871 and some of the castle corridors and gates were destroyed to make room for Japanese army barracks. The entirety of the castle complex was slated to be demolished by government policy, but it was spared by the efforts of Nakamura Shigeto, an army colonel. A stone monument honoring Nakamura was placed in the castle complex within the first gate, the . Although Himeji Castle was spared, Japanese castles had become obsolete and their preservation was costly.

When the han feudal system was abolished in 1871, Himeji Castle was officially designated for military use in 1872. By 1874, it briefly served as the headquarters for the 10th Infantry Regiment before being replaced by the Osaka Sendai unit later that year. Efforts to preserve the castle began in 1877, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1910 that the government provided funding for a comprehensive restoration project.

Himeji was heavily bombed in 1945, at the end of World War II, and although most of the surrounding area was burned to the ground, the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped on the top floor of the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.

=== Historical recognition ===
Himeji Castle was registered on 11 December 1993 as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Japan. Five structures of the castle are also designated National Treasures: The , , , , and . The area within the middle moat of the castle complex is a designated Special Historic Site.

Along with Matsumoto Castle and Kumamoto Castle, Himeji Castle is considered one of Japan&#x27;s three premier castles. It is the most visited castle in Japan, receiving over 2,860,000 visitors in 2015. Starting in April 2010, Himeji Castle underwent restoration work to preserve the castle buildings, and reopened to the public on March 27, 2015.

== Design details ==
Himeji Castle is the largest castle in Japan. It serves as an excellent example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, containing many of the defensive and architectural features associated with Japanese castles. The curved walls of Himeji Castle are sometimes said to resemble giant , but the principal materials used in the structures are stone and wood. Feudal are installed throughout the architecture of the building, signifying the various lords that inhabited the castle throughout its history.

The specific style of the castle is a &quot;hirayama&quot; (平山城 flat hilltop). Two castles that were built during the same time and shared many of the architectural features are Matsuyama Castle (Iyo) and Tsuyama Castle.

The Himeji Castle complex is located in the centre of Himeji, Hyōgo on top of a hill called Himeyama, which is above sea level. The castle complex comprises a network of 83 buildings such as storehouses, gates, corridors, and . Of these 83 buildings, 74 are designated as Important Cultural Assets: 11 corridors, 16 turrets, 15 gates, and 32 earthen walls. The highest walls in the castle complex have a height of . Joining the castle complex is , a Japanese garden created in 1992 to commemorate Himeji city&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

From east to west, the Himeji Castle complex has a length of , and from north to south, it has a length of . The castle complex has a circumference of . It covers an area of 233 hectares (2,330,000 m2 or 576 acres), making it roughly 50 times as large as the Tokyo Dome or 60 times as large as Koshien Stadium.

The at the center of the complex is high, standing above sea level. Together with the main keep, three form a cluster of towers. Externally, the keep appears to have five floors, because the second and third floors from the top appear to be a single floor; however, it actually has six floors and a basement. The basement of the main keep has an area of , and its interior contains special facilities that are not seen in other keeps, including lavatories, a drain board, and a kitchen corridor.

The main keep has two pillars, with one standing in the east and one standing in the west. The east pillar, which has a base diameter of , was originally a single fir tree, but it has since been mostly replaced.
 The base of the west pillar is , and it is made of Japanese cypress. During the Shōwa Restoration (1956–1964) a Japanese cypress tree with a length of was brought down from the Kiso Mountains and replaced the old pillar. The tree was broken in this process, so another tree was brought down from Mount Kasagata, and the two trees were joined on the third floor.

The first floor of the main keep has an area of and is often called the &quot;thousand-mat room&quot; because it has over 330 Tatami mats. The walls of the first floor have for holding matchlocks and spears, and at one point, the castle contained as many as 280 guns and 90 spears. The second floor has an area of roughly .

The third floor has an area of and the fourth floor has an area of . Both the third and fourth floors have platforms situated at the north and south windows called , where defenders could observe or throw objects at attackers. They also have small enclosed rooms called , where defenders could hide themselves and kill attackers by surprise as they entered the keep. The final floor, the sixth floor, has an area of only . The sixth floor windows now have iron bars in place, but in the feudal period the panoramic view from the windows was unobstructed.

=== Defences ===


Himeji Castle contains advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. in the shape of circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles are located throughout Himeji Castle, intended to allow defenders armed with tanegashima or archers to fire on attackers without exposing themselves. Roughly 1,000 loopholes exist in the castle buildings remaining today. Angled chutes called were also set at numerous points in the castle walls, enabling stones or boiling oil to be poured on the heads of attackers passing by underneath, and white plaster was used in the castle&#x27;s construction for its resistance to fire.

The castle complex included three moats, one of which—the outer moat—is now buried. Parts of the central moat and all of the inner moats survive. The moats have an average width of , a maximum width of , and a depth of about . The is a pond which exists inside the castle; one of the purposes of this moat was to store water for use in fire prevention.

The castle complex, particularly the , contains numerous warehouses that were used to store rice, salt, and water in case of a siege. A building known as the was used specifically to store salt, and it is estimated that it contained as many as 3,000 bags of salt when the castle complex was in use. The castle complex also contained 33 wells within the inner moat, 13 of which remain; the deepest of these has a depth of .

One of the castle&#x27;s most important defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths leading to the castle&#x27;s keep. The gates, baileys, and outer walls of the complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force, causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex on its way to the keep. The castle complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according to the Japanese syllabary &quot;iroha&quot; (&quot;I&quot;, &quot;Ro&quot;, &quot;Ha&quot;, &quot;Ni&quot;, &quot;Ho&quot;, &quot;He&quot;, &quot;To&quot;, etc.). At present, 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according to the Japanese syllabary.

In many cases, the castle walkways even turn back on themselves, greatly inhibiting navigation. For example, the straight distance from the to the is only , but the path itself is a much longer . The passages are also steep and narrow, further inhibiting entry. This system allowed the intruders to be watched and fired upon from the keep during their lengthy approach, but Himeji Castle was never attacked in this manner so the system remains untested. However, even today with the route clearly marked, many visitors have trouble navigating the castle complex.

== Cultural impact ==
Himeji Castle is frequently known as &quot;Hakuro-jō&quot; or &quot;Shirasagi-jō&quot; (&quot;White Egret Castle&quot; or &quot;White Heron Castle&quot;) because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight. The castle has been featured extensively in foreign and Japanese films, including the James Bond movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), and Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Kagemusha&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ran&quot; (1985). In the television miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot; (1980) it served as a stand-in for feudal-era Osaka Castle. In the video games Civilization Revolution and Civilization V, Himeji Castle is available to build as a world wonder. It is also to be found as a Great Building in Forge of Empires.

In 2023 the LEGO Group launched a model of Himeji Castle as part of its LEGO Architecture Series.

=== Lore and legend ===

==== The Dish Mansion at Banchō ====
Himeji Castle is associated with a number of local legends. The well-known &quot;kaidan&quot; (or Japanese ghost story) of is set in Edo (Tokyo), but a variant called is set in Himeji Castle. There is a disputed claim that the castle is the &quot;bona fide&quot; location of the entire legend, and the alleged Okiku&#x27;s Well remains in the castle to this day. According to the legend, Okiku was falsely accused of losing dishes that were valuable family treasures, and then killed and thrown into the well. Her ghost remained to haunt the well at night, counting dishes in a despondent tone.

==== Osakabehime ====
Himeji Castle is said to be inhabited by the yōkai Osakabehime, who lives in the castle tower and avoids humans, whom she hates. In some legends, she takes the form of an old woman (or woman in her 30s) in ceremonial, twelve-layered kimono. She can read human minds and control lesser animal-like yōkai, &quot;kenzokushin&quot;.

==== Ubagaishi ====
The legend of the is another folklore story associated with the castle. According to the legend, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble. She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade. It was said that people who heard the story were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi, speeding up the construction of the castle. To this day, the supposed stone can be seen covered with a wire net in the middle of one of the stone walls in the castle complex.

==== Sakurai Genbei ====
A folklore story is also associated with Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa&#x27;s master carpenter in the construction of the keep. According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast. Eventually, he became distraught and climbed to the top of the keep, where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth.

<text>Daikon or mooli, &quot;Raphanus sativus&quot; var. &quot;longipinnatus,&quot; is a mild-flavored winter radish usually characterized by fast-growing leaves and a long, white, root. Originally native to continental East Asia, daikon is harvested and consumed throughout the region, as well as in South Asia, and is available internationally. In some locations, daikon is planted for its ability to break up compacted soils and recover nutrients and is not harvested.

==Names==
In culinary contexts, &quot;daikon&quot; () or are the most common names in all forms of English. Historical ties to South Asia permit &quot;mooli&quot; () as a general synonym in English. The generic terms white radish, winter radish, Oriental radish, long white radish, and other terms are also used. Other synonyms usually vary by region or describe regional varieties of the vegetable. When it is necessary to distinguish the usual Japanese form from others, it is sometimes known as Japanese radish.

The vegetable&#x27;s Chinese names are still uncommon in English. In most forms of Chinese cuisine, it is usually known as &quot;bái luóbo&quot; (white radish). Although in Cantonese and Malaysian cuisine, it is encountered as &quot;lobak&quot; or &quot;lo pak&quot;, which are Cantonese pronunciations of the general Chinese term for &quot;radish&quot; or &quot;carrot&quot; (). In the cuisines of Hokkien and Teochew-speaking areas such as Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan, it is also known as &quot;chai tow&quot; or &quot;chai tau&quot; (). Any of these may be referred to as &quot;radish,&quot; with the regional variety implied by context. In English-speaking countries, it is also sometimes marketed as icicle radish.

In mainland China and Singapore, the calque white carrot or misnomer &quot;carrot&quot; is sometimes used, owing to the similarity of the vegetables&#x27; names in Mandarin and Hokkien. This variant inspired the title for a popular guidebook on Singaporean street food, &quot;There&#x27;s No Carrot in Carrot Cake&quot;, which refers to &quot;chai tow kway&quot;, a kind of cake made from daikon.

In North America, it is primarily grown not for food but as a fallow crop, with the roots left unharvested to prevent soil compaction; the leaves (if harvested) are used as animal fodder. The official general name used by the United States Department of Agriculture is oilseed radish, but this is only used in non-culinary contexts. Other English terms employed when daikon is used as animal feed or as a soil ripper are &quot;forage radish&quot;, &quot;fodder radish&quot;, and &quot;tillage radish&quot;.

In Hong Kong, the misnomer turnip is also used. This name lends its name to the dish &quot;turnip cake&quot;.

==Varieties==

Several nonwhite varieties occur. The Cantonese &quot;lobak&quot;, &quot;lo pak&quot;, etc., sometimes refer to the usual Chinese form but is also applied to a form of daikon with a light green coloration of the top area of the root around the leaves. The Korean radish, also called &quot;mu&quot;, has a similar pale green shade halfway down from the top and are generally shorter, stouter, and sturdier, with denser flesh and softer leaves. Both are often spicier than the long white radishes.

The heirloom watermelon radish is another Chinese variety of daikon with a dull green exterior but a bright rose or fuchsia-colored center. Its Chinese name &quot;xīnlǐměi luóbó&quot;) is sometimes irregularly romanized as the &quot;shinrimei&quot; radish and sometimes translated as the &quot;beauty heart,&quot; &quot;beautiful heart inside,&quot; or &quot;roseheart&quot; radish.

==Cultivation==

The Chinese and Indian varieties tolerate higher temperatures than the Japanese ones. These varieties also grow well at lower elevations in East Africa. If moisture is abundant, it can grow quickly; otherwise, the flesh becomes overly tough and pungent. The variety &quot;Long White Icicle&quot; is available as seed in Britain and will grow very successfully in Southern England, producing roots resembling a parsnip by midsummer in good garden soil in an average year.

The roots can be stored for weeks without the leaves if lifted and kept in a cool, dry place. If left in the ground, the texture tends to become woody, but the storage life of whole untreated roots is not long.

Certain varieties of daikon can be grown as a winter cover crop and green manure. These varieties are often named &quot;tillage radish&quot; because the plant grows a huge, penetrating root that effectively performs deep cultivation. The roots bring nutrients lower in the soil profile up into the higher reaches and are good nutrient scavengers, so they are good partners with legumes instead of grasses; if harsh winters occur, the root will decompose while in the soil, releasing early nitrogen stores in the spring.

==Culinary uses==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, many types of pickles are made with daikon roots, including &quot;takuan&quot; and &quot;bettarazuke&quot;. Daikon roots can be served raw, in salads, or as &quot;sashimi&quot;&#x27;s , which is prepared by meticulous . is frequently used as a garnish, often mixed into various dippings such as &quot;ponzu&quot;, a soy sauce and citrus juice condiment. The pink spicy is daikon grated with chili pepper. Simmered dishes are also popular such as &quot;oden&quot;. Daikon that has been shredded and dried (a common method of preserving food in Japan) is called . Daikon radish sprouts () are used raw for salad or garnishing &quot;sashimi&quot;. Daikon leaves are frequently eaten as a green vegetable. They are thorny when raw, so softening methods such as pickling and stir frying are common. The daikon leaf is one of the Festival of Seven Herbs, where it is called &quot;suzushiro&quot;.

=== China ===
In Chinese cuisine, turnip cake and &quot;chai tow kway&quot; are made with daikon. The variety called &quot;mooli&quot; has a high water content, and some cookbooks recommend salting (or sweetening, depending on the region and context) and draining it before it is cooked. Sometimes, &quot;mooli&quot; is used as a medium for elaborately carved garnishes. More commonly, daikon is referred as &quot;bailuobo&quot; (白蘿蔔) in Mandarin or &quot;lobak&quot; in Cantonese. &quot;Bailuobo&quot; is used in various dishes for its unique and mild flavour after being boiled and cooked. For soups, &quot;bailuobo&quot; can be seen in daikon and pork rib soup (白蘿蔔排骨湯), daikon and tomato soup (白蘿蔔番茄湯), daikon and tofu soup (白蘿蔔豆腐湯), etc. Delicacies such as &quot;shredded daikon&quot; (白蘿蔔絲) and &quot;cut daikon&quot; (白蘿蔔塊) are popular domestic dishes too. Similar to Japanese cuisine, there are many types of pickles (in Mandarin Chinese: 咸菜 &quot;xiáncài&quot; / 榨菜 &quot;zhàcài&quot;) made with daikon, for example, &quot;sour-sweet cut daikon&quot; (酸甜白蘿蔔塊), &quot;spicy daikon&quot; (麻辣白蘿蔔), &quot;daikon zhacai&quot; (白蘿蔔榨菜), etc.

=== India ===
In North India, daikon is a popular ingredient used to make &quot;sabzi&quot;, stuffed &quot;paranthas&quot;, &quot;pakodas&quot;, salads, pickles, and as garnish. The plant&#x27;s leaves are used to make &quot;dal&quot; and &quot;kadhi&quot;, among other dishes. In South India, daikon is the principal ingredient in a variety of &quot;sambar&quot;, in which roundels of the radish are boiled with onions, tamarind pulp, lentils, and a special spice powder. When cooked, it can release a very strong odor. This soup, called &quot;mullangi sambar&quot; (, ; literally, &quot;radish sambar&quot;) is very popular and is often mixed with rice.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnamese cuisine, sweet and sour pickled daikon and carrots ( or &quot;đồ chua&quot;) are a common condiment in &quot;bánh mì&quot; sandwiches.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the sour stew &quot;sinigang&quot; may include daikon. Daikon is known locally as &quot;labanos&quot;.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistani cuisine, the young leaves of the daikon plant are boiled and flash-fried with a mixture of heated oil, garlic, ginger, red chili, and various spices. The radish is eaten as a fresh salad, often seasoned with either salt and pepper or &quot;chaat masala&quot;. In Punjab province, daikon is used to stuff pan-fried breads known as &quot;paratha&quot;. Daikon&#x27;s seed pods called &quot;moongray&quot; in local languages, are also eaten as a stir-fried dish across the country.

=== Bangladesh ===
In Bangladesh, fresh daikon is often finely grated and mixed with fresh chili, coriander, flaked steamed fish, lime juice, and salt. This light, refreshing preparation served alongside meals is known as &quot;mulo bhorta&quot;.

=== Taiwan ===
In Taiwanese cuisine, both the root and the stems/leaves of the daikon are consumed.

=== South Korea ===
In South Korea, daikon radish is often used in kimchi, a traditional fermented dish. Kimchi is most commonly eaten as a side dish with rice, among other dishes. It is most commonly made with daikon radish, carrots, scallions, and other easily fermented vegetables.

===Nutrition===

Raw daikon is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, and less than 1% each of protein and fat (table). In a reference amount of , raw daikon supplies 18 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin C (27% DV), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table).

== Agricultural use ==
Tillage radish leaves behind a cavity in the soil when the large taproot decays, making it easier for the following year&#x27;s crops, such as potatoes, to bore deeper into the soil. Potatoes grown in a rotation with tillage radish do not experience growth restrictions associated with having a shallow hardpan soil, as the tillage radish can break the hardpan, making the transfer of water and other important nutrients much easier for the root system.

Nutrient retention is another important feature of tillage radish. The large taproot is used to retain macro- and micro-nutrients that would otherwise have the potential to be lost to leaching during the time when the field would otherwise be left empty. The nutrients from the root become readily available for the following year&#x27;s crop upon the decay of the radish, which can boost yields and reduce fertilizer costs.

Daikons are also used as a forage worldwide. As a forage, they also have the side benefit of weed suppression. Although used elsewhere for much longer, daikon as a forage is a recent introduction in Massachusetts field practice.

== Other use ==
Daikon is used in preparing metal surfaces for chemical patination, for example, under the Rokushō process.

<doc id="180546" wikidata="Q954957" url="?curid=180546" title="Child support">
<text>Child support (or child maintenance) is an ongoing, periodic payment made by a parent for the financial benefit of a child (state or parent, caregiver, guardian) following the end of a marriage or other similar relationship. Child maintenance is paid directly or indirectly by an &quot;obligor&quot; to an &quot;obligee&quot; for the care and support of children of a relationship that has been terminated, or in some cases never existed. Often the obligor is a non-custodial parent. The obligee is typically a custodial parent, a caregiver, or a guardian.

Depending on the jurisdiction, a custodial parent may pay child support to a non-custodial parent. Typically one has the same duty to pay child support irrespective of sex, so a mother is required to pay support to a father just as a father must pay a mother. In some jurisdictions where there is joint custody, the child is considered to have two custodial parents and no non-custodial parents, and a custodial parent with a higher income (obligor) may be required to pay the other custodial parent (obligee). In other jurisdictions, and even with legally shared residence, unless they can prove exactly equal contributions, one parent will be deemed the non-resident parent for child support and will have to pay the other parent a proportion of their income; the &quot;resident&quot; parent&#x27;s income or needs are not assessed.

Child support is often arranged as part of a divorce, marital separation, annulment, determination of parentage or dissolution of a civil union and may supplement alimony (spousal support) arrangements.

The right to child support and the responsibilities of parents to provide such support have been internationally recognized. The 1992 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is a binding convention signed by every member nation of the United Nations and formally ratified by all but the United States. It declares that the upbringing and development of children and a standard of living adequate for the children&#x27;s development is a common responsibility of both parents and a fundamental human right for children, and asserts that the primary responsibility to provide such for the children rests with their parents. Other United Nations documents and decisions related to child-support enforcement include the 1956 New York Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance created under the auspices of the United Nations, which has been ratified by the 64 of the UN member states.

In addition, the right to child support, as well as specific implementation and enforcement measures, has been recognized by various other international entities, including the Council of Europe, the European Union and the Hague Conference.

Within individual countries, examples of legislation pertaining to, and establishing guidelines for, the implementation and collection of child maintenance include the 1975 Family Law Act (Australia), the Child Support Act (United Kingdom) and the Maintenance and Affiliation Act (Fiji). Child support in the United States, 45 C.F.R. 302.56 requires each state to establish and publish a Guideline that is presumed correct (but rebuttable), and Review the Guideline, at a minimum, every four years. Child-support laws and obligations are known to be recognized in a vast majority of world nations, including the majority of countries in Europe, North America and Australia, as well as many in Africa, Asia and South America.

==Legal theory==
Child support is based on the policy that both parents are obliged to financially support their children, even when the children are not living with both parents. Child support includes the financial support of children and not other forms of support, such as emotional support, intellectual support, physical care, or spiritual support.

When children live with both parents, courts rarely, if ever, direct the parents on how to provide financial support for their children. However, when the parents are not together, courts often order one parent to pay the other an amount set as financial support for the child. In such situations, one parent (the &quot;obligee&quot;) receives child support, and the other parent (the &quot;obligor&quot;) is ordered to pay child support. The amount of child support may be set on a case-by-case basis or by a formula estimating the amount thought that parents should pay to financially support their children.

Child support may be ordered to be paid by one parent to another when one is a non-custodial parent and the other is a custodial parent. Similarly, child support may also be ordered to be paid by one parent to another when both parents are custodial parents (joint or shared custody) and they share the child-raising responsibilities. In some cases, a parent with sole custody of their children may even be ordered to pay child support to the non-custodial parent to support the children while they are in the care of that parent.

Child support paid by a non-custodial parent or obligor does not absolve the obligor of the responsibility for costs associated with their child staying with the obligor in their home during visitation. For example, if an obligor pays child support to an obligee, this does not mean that the obligee is responsible for food, shelter, furniture, toiletries, clothes, toys or games, or any of the other child expenses directly associated with the child staying with the non-custodial parent or obligor.

In most jurisdictions, there is no need for the parents to be married, and only paternity and/or maternity (filiation) need to be demonstrated for a child-support obligation to be found by a competent court. Child support may also operate through the principle of estoppel where a &quot;de facto&quot; parent that is &quot;in loco parentis&quot; for sufficient time to establish a permanent parental relationship with the child or children.

Canadian courts differ in that the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; sets out in detail, the financial responsibilities of the &quot;Non-Custodial&quot; parent whilst the &quot;Custodial&quot; parent&#x27;s responsibilities are not mentioned. Consequently, Canadian courts limit themselves to dividing the &quot;Non-Custodial&quot; parents income and providing it to the &quot;Custodial&quot; parent. While the courts recognize that the child has an &quot;expectation of support from both parents&quot;, there is no legal precedent under the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; indicating that the &quot;Custodial&quot; parent has any obligation to support the child. In addition, courts have vehemently opposed any attempt by &quot;Non-Custodial&quot; parents to ensure &quot;Child Support&quot; is actually used for the child.

==Child support vs. contact==
While the issues of child support and visitation or contact may be decided in the same divorce or paternity settlement, in most jurisdictions the two rights and obligations are completely separate and individually enforceable. Custodial parents may not withhold contact to &quot;punish&quot; a noncustodial parent for failing to pay some or all child support required. Conversely, a noncustodial parent is required to pay child support even if they are partially or fully denied contact with the child. Furthermore, child support is established between parents also if joint custody is awarded, but the child spends most of the time with one of the parents.

Additionally, a non-custodial parent is responsible for child-support payments even if they do not wish to have a relationship with the child. Courts have maintained that a child&#x27;s right to financial support from parents supersedes an adult&#x27;s wish not to assume a parenting role.

While child support and contact are separate issues, in some jurisdictions, the latter may influence the former. In the United Kingdom, for example, the amount of support ordered may be reduced based on the number of nights per week the child regularly spends at the support-giving parent&#x27;s home.

==Use of child support payments==
Most international and national child-support regulations recognize that every parent has an obligation to support their child. Under this obligation, both parents are expected to share the responsibility for their child(ren)&#x27;s expenses. What differs between jurisdictions is which &quot;expenses&quot; are covered by &quot;Child Support&quot; and which are &quot;Extraordinary&quot; and fall outside the definition of &quot;Child Support&quot;.

Support moneys collected are often assumed to be used for the child&#x27;s expenses, such as food, clothing, and ordinary educational needs, but that is not required. Under California law, for example, child-support money may be used to &quot;improve the standard of living of the custodial household&quot; and the recipient does not have to account for how the money is spent.

Child support orders may earmark funds for specific items for the child, such as school fees, day care, and medical expenses. In some cases, obligors parents may pay for these items directly. For example, they may pay tuition fees directly to their child&#x27;s school, rather than remitting money for the tuition to the obligee. Orders may also require each parent to assume a percentage of expenses for various needs. For instance, in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, custodial parents are required to pay for the first $100 of annual uninsured medical costs incurred by each child. Only then will the courts consider authorizing child-support money from a non-custodial parent to be used for said costs. Canadian courts provide child support through the &quot;Federal Child Support Guidelines&quot; based on income; however, &quot;Extraordinary Expenses&quot; can be ordered.

Many American universities also consider non-custodial parents partially responsible for paying college costs, and will consider parents&#x27; income in their financial aid determinations. In certain states, non-custodial parents may be ordered by the court to assist with these expenses. Canadian Universities all have different standards but essentially mimic the provincial standards required for student loan eligibility. While both parents are expected to provide support, &quot;Custodial Parents&quot; are rarely ordered to provide it whilst &quot;Non-Custodial&quot; parents are required to provide it under the law.

In the United States, obligors may receive a medical order that requires them to add their children to their health insurance plans. In some states both parents are responsible for providing medical insurance for the child/children. If both parents possess health coverage, the child may be added to the more beneficial plan, or use one to supplement the other. Children of active or retired members of the U.S. armed forces are also eligible for health coverage as military dependents, and may be enrolled in the DEERS program at no cost to the obligor.

Accountability regulations for child support money vary by country and state. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, child support recipients are trusted to use support payments in the best interest of the child, and thus are not required to provide details on specific purchases. In California, there is no limitations, accountability, or other restriction on how the obligee spends the child support received, it is merely presumed that the money is spent on the child. However, in other jurisdictions, a child support recipient might legally be required to give specific details on how child support money is spent at the request of the court or the non-custodial parent. In the United States, 10 states (Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Washington) allow courts to demand an accounting on expenses and spending from custodial parents. Additionally, Alabama courts have authorized such accounting under certain specific circumstances.

==Obtaining child support==
Child-support laws and regulations vary around the world. Legal intervention is not mandatory: some parents have informal or voluntary agreements or arrangements that do not involve the courts, where financial child support and/or other expenses are provided to the other parent to assist in supporting their child(ren). A voluntary maintenance arrangement can in certain jurisdictions be approved by judicial authorities.

A major impetus to collection of child support in many places is recovery of welfare expenditure. A resident or custodial parent receiving public assistance, as in the United States, is required to assign their right to child support to the Department of Welfare before cash assistance is received. Another common requirement of welfare benefits in some jurisdictions is that a custodial parent must pursue child support from the non-custodial parent.

===Court procedures===
In divorce cases, child-support payments may be determined as part of the divorce settlement, along with other issues, such as alimony, custody and visitation. In other cases, there are several steps that must be undertaken to receive court-ordered child support. Some parents anticipating that they will receive child support may hire lawyers to oversee their child support cases for them; others may file their own applications in their local courthouses.

While procedures vary by jurisdiction, the process of filing a motion for court ordered child support typically has several basic steps.

# One parent, or their attorney, must file an application or complaint with the local court for the establishment of child support. The information required varies by jurisdiction, but generally collects identifying data about both parents and the child(ren) involved in the case, including their names, social security or tax identification numbers and dates of birth. Parents may also be required to furnish details relating to their marriage and divorce, if applicable, as well as documents certifying the identity and parentage of the child(ren). Local jurisdictions may charge fees for filing such applications, however, if the filing parent is receiving any sort of public assistance, these fees may be waived.
# The other parent is located, and served a court summons by a local sheriff, police officer, bailiff or process server. The summons informs the other parent that they are being sued for child support. Once served, the other parent must attend a mandatory court hearing to determine if they are responsible for child-support payments.
# In cases where parentage of a child is denied, has not been established by marriage or is not listed on the birth certificate, or where paternity fraud is suspected, courts may order or require establishment of paternity. Paternity may be established voluntarily if the father signs an affidavit or may be proven through DNA testing in contested cases. Once the identity of the father is confirmed through DNA testing, the child&#x27;s birth certificate may be amended to include the father&#x27;s name.
# After the responsibility for child support is established and questions of paternity have been answered to the court&#x27;s satisfaction, the court will notify the obligor and order that parent to make timely child support payments, fees (which may be 0, $60, or more) and establish any other provisions, such as medical orders. Generally the father will be required to pay for genetic testing.

===Calculating the amount===
Various approaches to calculating the amount of child-support award payments exist. Many jurisdictions consider multiple sources of information when determining support, taking into account the income of the parents, the number and ages of children living in the home, basic living expenses and school fees. If the child has special needs, such as treatment for a serious illness or disability, these costs may also be taken into consideration.

Guidelines for support orders may be based on laws that require obligors to pay a flat percentage of their annual income toward their children&#x27;s expenses. Often two approaches are combined. In the United Kingdom, for instance, there are four basic rates of child support based on the obligors&#x27; income, which are then modified and adjusted based on several factors. In the United States, the federal government requires all states to have guideline calculations. Guidelines are either a percentage of income or more usually in the form of tables listing incomes and the amount needed to support one to six children. These computations are often performed by computer programs upon input of certain financial information including, earnings, visitation (overnights with the non-custodial parent (NCP)), health insurance costs, and several other factors.

If tables are used in the guidelines those tables are computed by economists such as Policy Studies, Inc. They examine spending patterns of couples without children and couples with children in the consumer expenditure survey. The amount of additional money spent on the children (for expenses such as automobile insurance; AP exams; cell phones and plans; Christmas presents; educational expenses (trips, pictures, study guides, tutoring, AP and SAT exams, books, supplies, and uniforms); laptops; music lessons; parking fees; private school tuition; sports activities; and summer camps is computed and reduced to a table. Separating parents then find their incomes in the table and how much average intact families pay on children. In the widely used income shares model that amount is divided in proportion to the parents income.

===Change of circumstances===
Once established, child-support orders typically remain static unless otherwise reviewed. Obligors and obligees reserve the right to request a court review for modification (typically six months to one year or more after the issuance of the order or if the circumstances have changed such that the child support would change significantly). For instance, if the obligor has a change in income or faces financial hardship, they may petition the court for a reduction in support payments. Examples of financial hardship include supporting other children, unemployment, extraordinary healthcare expenses, etc. Likewise, if the obligor is spending more time with the child, they may petition the court for a reduction or even a reversal in support payments. Conversely, if the child&#x27;s expenses increase, the obligee may ask the court to increase payments to cover the new costs

Although both parents have the right to petition the court for a support order adjustment, modifications are not automatic, and a judge may decide not to alter the amount of support after hearing the facts of the case. That is to say, simply because an obligors&#x27;s income has decreased, a court may find that the decrease in income is of no fault of the child, and will not decrease the child&#x27;s expenses, and therefore should not affect him or her financially. Likewise, a court may find that an increase in the child&#x27;s expenses may have been calculated by the receiving parent and is not necessary, and therefore the support obligation of the paying parent should not increase.

In United States law, the Bradley Amendment (1986, ) requires state courts to prohibit retroactive reduction of child-support obligations. Specifically, it:

* automatically triggers a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes past-due.
* overrides any state&#x27;s statute of limitations.
* disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges.
* requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support (the obligor) to promptly document changed circumstances or regard for his awareness of the need to make the notification.

===Distribution and payment===
Child-support payments are distributed in a variety of ways. In cases where an obligor is liable for specific expenses such as school tuition, they may pay them directly instead of through the obligee.

In some jurisdictions, obligors (paying parents) are required to remit their payments to the governing federal or state child-support enforcement agency (State Disbursement Unit). The payments are recorded, any portion required to reimburse the government is subtracted, and then the remainder is passed on to the obligee (receiving parent), either through direct deposit or checks.

The first payee for child support depends on the current welfare status of the payee. For example, if the obligee is currently receiving a monthly check from the government, all current support collected during said month is paid to the government to reimburse the monies paid to the obligee. Regarding families formerly on assistance, current support is paid to the family first, and only after said support is received, the government may then collect additional payments to reimburse itself for previously paid assistance to the obligee (receiving parent). See 42 USC 657: &quot;(A) Current Support Payments: To the extent that the amount so collected does not exceed the amount required to be paid to the family for the month in which collected, the State shall distribute the amount so collected to the family.&quot;.

Within the United States, a 2007 study conducted through the University of Baltimore estimates that 50% of all child-support arrears are owed to the government to reimburse welfare expenses. Half of U.S. states pass along none of the child support they collect to low-income families receiving welfare and other assistance, instead reimbursing themselves and the federal government. Most of the rest only pass along $50.00 per month. The bipartisan 2006 Deficit Reduction Act and other measures have sought to reduce the amount of money claimed by the government and to ensure that more funds are accessible by children and families, noting that more obligors (paying parents) are willing to pay child support when their children directly benefit from payments.

Most U.S. states deliver child-support benefits through direct deposit, but many states make payments to recipients who do not have a bank account through a prepaid debit card. State use of prepaid cards has helped increase the popularity of federal benefit debit cards, such as the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card offered by MasterCard, Visa, Chase, and Comerica Bank.

===Duration of support orders===
The duration of support orders varies both by jurisdiction and by case. Requirements for support typically end when the child reaches the age of majority, which may range in age from 16 to 23 (Massachusetts and Hawaii) or graduates from high school. Some countries and states have provisions that allow support to continue past the age of majority if the child is enrolled as a full-time, degree-seeking post-secondary student. If the obligor owes back child support, they must continue to make payments until the debt is satisfied, regardless of the age of the child.

Several circumstances allow for the termination of a support order for a child under the age of majority. These include the child&#x27;s marriage, legal emancipation or death.

==Compliance and enforcement issues==

===&quot;Deadbeat&quot; parents===

With respect to child support obligations, a &quot;deadbeat&quot; parent is one who has refused to provide child support payments or expenses.

US Governmental child support agencies typically refer to clients as being &quot;in compliance&quot;, &quot;not in compliance&quot; or &quot;criminally non-compliant&quot;. Compliance is judged by the paying party&#x27;s performance in meeting the financial terms of the legal child support court order. In some circumstances, obligors found &quot;not in compliance&quot; or &quot;criminally non-compliant&quot; have even had their professional (e.g. doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc.) and other (e.g. driver&#x27;s) licenses suspended or revoked in an effort to collect monies for support and shared expenses.

While the US has an extremely negotiable system, Canadian laws are fairly automatic and &quot;No-Fault&quot;. Child support is determined by the number of children and the obligor&#x27;s income.

===Enforcement===
Regulations and laws on the enforcement of child-support orders vary by country and state. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, enforcement is overseen by a national office. In others, such as Canada, the responsibility to enforce child-support orders rests with individual provinces, with financial and logistical assistance from the federal government. In the United States, child-support enforcement is also handled largely at the state level, but non-compliant parents who meet certain criteria, such as traveling across state lines to circumvent orders or owing more than two years of support payments, may be subjected to federal prosecution under the Federal Deadbeat Punishment Act.

One focus of Article 27 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child is the establishment and strengthening of international treaties to further aid in child-support order enforcement across national and international boundaries. Under these agreements, orders established in one country are considered valid and enforceable in another country, and may be pursued through local court processes. The goal of such conventions is to ensure that noncompliant parents will not be able to evade support payments by crossing an international border.

To this end, various international conventions regarding interjurisdictional enforcement of maintenance orders have been created, including the 1956 United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance, the Hague Conference&#x27;s 1973 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions relating to Maintenance Obligations and the 1956 United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance and the 2007 Hague Maintenance Convention.

More than 100 nations currently have reciprocal arrangements for child support orders. Examples of reciprocal agreements include the UK Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders (REMO) and those of Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the United States and the European Union.

Consequences of non-payment vary by jurisdiction, the length of time the parent has been noncompliant, and the amount owed. Typical penalties include wage garnishment and denial or suspension of drivers, hunting and professional licenses. In the United States, noncompliant parents who are more than $2500 in arrears may be denied passports under the Passport Denial Program. Australia, Austria, and Finland do not imprison persons for failure to pay child-support arrears. In the U.S., in contrast, non-payment of child support may be treated as a criminal offense or a civil offense, and it can result in a prison or jail term. In New York, continuous failure to provide child support is an E felony punishable by up to 4 years in prison. In addition, child-support debtors are subject to fines and property seizure.

Since the duty to provide child support is separate from the civil requirement to obey a court order regarding visitation, it is exceptionally rare for a parent to be jailed for violating that part of the court order.

==Laws in specific jurisdictions==
==Criticism==

===Implementation flaws and side effects===
In jurisdictions where child support is reduced or partially reduced when care is provided by both parents, there may be a financial incentive for the resident parent to restrict the amount of time the other parent can see the children. If a parent seeks a custody order with the goal of maximizing child support, the effect could be to reduce the amount of contact that the children have with the other parent without regard to their needs or wishes.

Payment is not made to children but between parents, and the payee is not required to account for how child-support money is spent. Critics of child support argue that, as a result, the support payments do not need to be used to support the child and can be regarded as a punishment to the parent who is paying child support. A response to that criticism is that if a parent is caring for the children, that parent will incur costs in providing that support, even if they have no duty to account for their expenditures in support of the child.

Critics of child support, such as fathers&#x27; rights groups, complain that the law does not necessarily require that the child support money be used for the child. Barring unusual circumstances, most jurisdictions do not require accountings on the request of a child support payor. The custodial parent also has a duty to support the children, yet in countries like Canada, it has been shown that &quot;over a wide range of reasonable assumptions, the [custodial parent] does not financially contribute to the support of the children but in fact receives a net wealth transfer from the system.&quot; Child-support amounts are considerably higher than the costs of raising children.

Critics of child support suggest that support orders carry the threat of state violence to give the resident parent a degree of financial control over the non-resident parent, and even that the enforcement of child support can be considered domestic violence or abuse. No jurisdiction has accepted that argument, and a parent ordered to pay child support will not face any legal consequence if payments are made as ordered by the court.

Some parents argue that they should be permitted to directly provide for their children, with those provisions being credited against child support or taking the place of any payment to the other parent. Some argue that being ordered to pay child support reduces their ability to directly provide for their children. However, courts uniformly recognize that the custodial parent will incur expenses for the care of children that a non-custodial parent might prefer not to pay, and that giving the non-custodial parent direct control over how child support is used would in many cases result in abusive or controlling behavior by the child support payor.

Some child-support laws and formulas do not adequately reflect the extent to which the child-support payor supports the children, and the expenses the payor incurs in caring for the children. Many jurisdictions have tried to develop child-support formulas and models that take into account the extent to which parents share custody, and adjust child-support amounts in shared parenting arrangements in relation to the division of parenting time. In the UK a &quot;non-resident&quot; parent caring for the children 174 nights a year would have to pay the other parent (4/7) 57% of the maintenance they would have paid if they had provided no care. Thus, a &quot;non-resident&quot; parent may be obligated to pay up to 17% (31%*4/7) of their income as child support.

In the United States, each state receives money from the federal government to offset some of the expenses it incurs in processing paternity, spousal support and child-support cases. It has been argued that this creates an incentive for each state to enforce larger than necessary support orders, since doing so creates a larger financial incentive for each state. However, as a matter of law, when the federal government mandates state action it is broadly required to reimburse the state for the cost of the required action. It has also been argued that a Defendant in a child-support matter cannot get a fair trial due to the fact that the Courts have a financial interest in keeping child-support orders higher than necessary. However, there has never been a showing that states have created or modified their child-support formulas in such a manner, nor would doing so actually increase federal reimbursements.

Another criticism of child support is that it can be difficult for a man who has been mistakenly identified as a child&#x27;s father, or who later discovers that he is not a child&#x27;s biological parent, to be excused from an order to pay child support, and recover the money already taken from him.

===A man&#x27;s right to choose===
Child-support policies have been criticized by fathers&#x27; rights advocacy groups, as well as by some feminists, who state that child-support policy violates gender equality and denies reproductive choice to men. Child support is based principally upon income and custody arrangements and not on gender, and male and female parents report similar levels of satisfaction with support awards. As child support is payable for the benefit of the children, not the parent, courts are not sympathetic to the idea that a parent should be able to refuse to support a child by claiming that he would have preferred that the child not be born.

Child-support guidelines and policies have also been criticized for requiring boys and men that are victims of sexual assault to pay child support to the women who sexually assaulted them; a precedent-setting case in US law is &quot;Hermesmann v. Seyer&quot;, whereby a male victim of statutory rape was required to pay child support to the mother. In the case of &quot;S.F. vs T.M.&quot; (1996), a man who produced evidence that the mother of the child raped him while he was unconscious was nevertheless ordered to pay child support. Men who assert that a child was conceived as a result of deception, birth-control fraud or sperm theft have also challenged their obligation to pay child support.

Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, coined the term male abortion in 1998, suggesting that a father should be allowed to disclaim his obligations to an unborn child early in the pregnancy. Proponents hold that concept begins with the premise that when an unmarried woman becomes pregnant, she has the option of abortion, adoption, or sole parenthood; and argues, in the context of legally recognized gender equality, that in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the putative (alleged) father should have the same human rights to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility—leaving the informed mother with the same three options. McCulley&#x27;s male-abortion concept aims to equalize the legal status of unwed men and unwed women by giving the unwed man by law the ability to &#x27;abort&#x27; his rights and obligations to the child. If a woman decides to keep the child, the father may choose not to by severing all ties legally (in the same way a sperm donor usually rescinds all parental rights).

This same concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization National Organization for Women, attorney Karen DeCrow, who wrote that &quot;if a woman makes a unilateral decision to bring pregnancy to term, and the biological father does not, and cannot, share in this decision, he should not be liable for 21 years of support...autonomous women making independent decisions about their lives should not expect men to finance their choice.&quot;

The legal concept was tried in the case of &quot;Dubay v. Wells&quot; and was rejected by the court, since legislation in the various jurisdictions currently sets forth guidelines for when child support is owed as well as its amount. Accordingly, legislation would be required to change the law to implement McCulley&#x27;s concept.

<text>A television advertisement (also called a commercial, spot, break, advert, or ad) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization. It conveys a message promoting, and aiming to market, a product, service or idea. Advertisers and marketers may refer to television commercials as TVCs.

Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks. During the 2010s, the number of commercials has grown steadily, though the length of each commercial has diminished. Advertisements of this type have promoted a wide variety of goods, services, and ideas ever since the early days of the history of television.
The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as Nielsen Media Research in the United States, or BARB in the UK, is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates which broadcasters charge to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a &quot;day-part&quot;).

In many countries, including the United States, television campaign advertisements are commonplace in a political campaign. In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted, while some countries, such as Norway, completely ban political advertisements.

The first official paid television advertisement came out in the United States on July 1, 1941, at 2:30 p.m., over New York station WNBT (subsequently WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase &quot;Bulova Watch Time&quot;, appeared in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute. The first TV ad broadcast in the UK went on air on ITV on September 22, 1955, advertising Gibbs SR toothpaste. In Asia, the first TV ad broadcast appeared on Nippon Television in Tokyo on August 28, 1953, advertising Seikosha (subsequently Seiko); it also displayed a clock with the current time.

The television market has grown to such an extent that it was estimated to reach $69.87 billion for TV ad spending in the United States for 2018.

==General background==
Television advertising involves three main tasks: creating a television advertisement that meets broadcast standards, placing the advertisement on television to reach the desired customer and then measuring the outcomes of these ads, including the return on investment.

To accomplish the first step means different things to different parts of the world depending on the regulations in place. In the UK for example, clearance must be given by the body Clearcast. Another example is Venezuela where clearance is governed by a body called CNAC. The clearance provides a guarantee to the broadcasters that the content of the advertisement meets legal guidelines. Because of this, special extended clearance sometimes applies to food and medical products as well as gambling advertisements.

The second is the process of TV advertising delivery and usually incorporates the involvement of a post-production house, a media agency, advertising distribution specialists and the end-goal, the broadcasters.

At New York&#x27;s TV Week in November 2018, the TV advertising model was described by Turner Broadcasting System as broken.

==TV advertisement trends==

===Internet and digital===

However, with the emergence of over-the-top media services, the Internet itself has become a platform for television, and hence TV advertising. TV attribution is a marketing concept whereby the impact television ads have on consumers is measured.

Addressable television is where targeted advertising is used on digital platforms, so two people watching the same show receive different ads.

===Digital television recorders and advertisement skipping===
After the video cassette recorder (VCR) became popular in the 1980s, the television industry began studying the impact of users fast-forwarding through commercials. Advertising agencies fought the trend by making them more entertaining. The introduction of digital video recorders (also known as digital television recorders or DTRs), such as TiVo, and services like Sky+, Dish Network and Astro MAX, which allow the recording of television programs into a hard drive, also enabled viewers to fast-forward or automatically skip through advertisements of recorded programs.

At the end of 2008, 22% of UK households had a DTR. The majority of these households had Sky+ and data from these homes (collected via the SkyView panel of more than 33,000) shows that, once a household gets a DTR, they watch 17% more television. 82% of their viewing is to normal, linear, broadcast TV without fast-forwarding the ads. In the 18% of TV viewing that is time-shifted (i.e. not watched as live broadcast), viewers still watch 30% of the ads at normal speed. Overall, the extra viewing encouraged by owning a DTR results in viewers watching 2% more ads at normal speed than they did before the DTR was installed.

The SkyView evidence is reinforced by studies on actual DTR behaviour by the Broadcasters&#x27; Audience Research Board (BARB) and the London Business School.

===Product placement===
Other forms of TV advertising include product placement advertising in the TV shows themselves. For example, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; advertises Sears, Kenmore, and the Home Depot by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the Monster Energy Cup of NASCAR are named after sponsors, and race cars are frequently covered in advertisements.Today&#x27;s sports advertisements frequently push boundaries or test out innovative methods using digital advances, depending less and less on the &quot;spots and dots&quot;, the conventional 30-second commercials on television and radio. Additionally, companies are becoming more closely associated with sports content, particularly if it connects them to a digital audience made up mostly of highly sought-after men and women between the ages of 18 and 34. Many major sporting venues in North America are named for commercial companies, dating back as far as Wrigley Field. Television programs delivered through new mediums such as streaming online video also bring different opportunities to the traditional methods of generating revenue from television advertising.

===Overlay advertisements===
Another type of advertisement shown increasingly, mostly for advertising TV shows on the same channel, is an ad overlay at the bottom of the TV screen, which blocks out some of the picture. &quot;Banners&quot;, or &quot;Logo Bugs&quot;, as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E). This is done in much the same way as a severe weather warning is done, only these happen more frequently. They may sometimes take up only 5 to 10 per cent of the screen, but in the extreme, they can take up as much as 25 per cent of the viewing area. Subtitles that are part of the programme content can be completely obscured by banners. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example is the 2E ads for Three Moons Over Milford, which was broadcast in the months before the TV show&#x27;s première. A video taking up approximately 25 per cent of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television programme. Another example is used in Poland to use any premieres of new shows/new seasons of the same show. TVP has taken a step further, overlaying on screen not only the channel on which the show is premiered, but also on a sister channel.

===Interactive advertisements===
Online video directories are an emerging form of interactive advertising, which help in recalling and responding to advertising produced primarily for television. These directories also have the potential to offer other value-added services, such as response sheets and click-to-call, which enhance the scope of the interaction with the brand. Researchers have found that For some consumer types and for specific ad types, that the standard linear advertising format is really superior to interactive advertising. Particularly, they have discovered that a cognitive &quot;matching&quot; of the system&#x27;s (predominantly visual or verbal) characteristics and the demands of the customer group (preferring their information to be delivered in a visual or verbal fashion) appears to be crucial.

===Shorter commercial breaks===
During the 2008–09 TV season, Fox experimented with a new strategy, which the network dubbed &quot;Remote-Free TV&quot;. Episodes of &quot;Fringe&quot; and &quot;Dollhouse&quot; contained approximately ten minutes of advertisements, four to six minutes fewer than other hour-long programs. Fox stated that shorter commercial breaks keep viewers more engaged and improve brand recall for advertisers, as well as reducing channel surfing and fast-forwarding past the advertisements. However, the strategy was not as successful as the network had hoped and it is unclear whether it will be continued in the future.

In May 2018, Fox Networks Group said its channels would try one-minute commercial breaks, mainly during sports events, but also on some shows on Fox Broadcasting Company. Ads during these breaks would cost more and fewer advertisers would be willing to pay that much. Also in 2018, NBC used one-minute commercial breaks after the first block in many shows. These &quot;prime pods&quot; are intended to keep viewers who are watching live, and advertisers pay more for the NBC spots.

=== Children with advertisement ===

Children can be impacted by advertising in a variety of ways, and how they respond to it will depend on a number of factors, including their age, background knowledge, and level of experience. Youngsters under two years old are unable to distinguish between television programs and advertisements; however, children between the ages of three and six can. Children between the ages of 7 and 11 can grasp that they are being sold something, can identify sales tactics, and are willing to buy items with poor selling points, therefore they could also not be able to understand what they are being marketed. Teenagers between the ages of 12 and 13 can typically understand what they are being sold and decide whether they want to purchase it based on what they were told. However, they may not be able to recognize products with tricky placement or understand that celebrities are being paid to endorse a product. Over 14-year-olds could not have the necessary judgment abilities to make a decent purchase and may not comprehend how the market operates.

==TV advertisements by country==
==Characteristics==

Advertising agencies often use humor as a tool in their creative marketing campaigns. Many psychological studies have attempted to demonstrate the effects of humor and their relationship to empowering advertising persuasion.

Animation is often used in advertisements. The pictures can vary from hand-drawn traditional animation to computer animation. By using animated characters, an advertisement may have a certain appeal that is difficult to achieve with actors or mere product displays. Animation also protects the advertisement from changes in fashion that would date it. For this reason, an animated advertisement (or a series of such advertisements) can be very long-running, several decades in many instances. Notable examples are the series of advertisements for Kellogg&#x27;s cereals, starring Snap, Crackle and Pop and also Tony the Tiger. The animation is often combined with real actors. Animated advertisements can achieve lasting popularity. In any popular vote for the most memorable television advertisements in the UK, such as on ITV or Channel 4, the top positions in the list invariably include animations, such as the classic &quot;Smash&quot; and Creature Comforts advertisements.

Other long-running advertising campaigns catch people by surprise, even tricking the viewer, such as the Energizer Bunny advertisement series. It started in the late 1980s as a simple comparison advertisement, where a room full of battery-operated bunnies was seen pounding their drums, all slowing down except one, with the Energizer battery. Years later, a revised version of this seminal advertisement had the Energizer bunny escaping the stage and moving on (according to the announcer, he &quot;keeps going and going and going...&quot;). This was followed by what appeared to be another advertisement: viewers were oblivious to the fact that the following &quot;advertisement&quot; was actually a parody of other well-known advertisements until the Energizer bunny suddenly intrudes on the situation, with the announcer saying &quot;Still going...&quot; (the Energizer Battery Company&#x27;s way of emphasizing that their battery lasts longer than other leading batteries). This ad campaign lasted for nearly fifteen years. The Energizer Bunny series has itself been imitated by others, via a Coors Light Beer advertisement, in motion pictures, and by current advertisements by GEICO Insurance.

===Use of popular music===

Many television advertisements feature songs or melodies (&quot;jingles&quot;) or slogans designed to be striking and memorable, which may remain in the minds of television viewers long after the span of the advertising campaign. Some of these ad jingles or catch-phrases may take on lives of their own, spawning gags that appear in films, television shows, magazines, comics, or literature. These long-lasting advertising elements may be said to have taken a place in the pop culture history of the demographic to whom they appeared. An example is the enduring phrase, &quot;Winston tastes good like a cigarette should&quot;, from the eighteen-year advertising campaign for Winston cigarettes from the 1950s to the 1970s. Variations of this dialogue and direct references to it appeared as long as two decades after the advertising campaign expired. Another example is &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beef?&quot;, which grew so popular it was used in the 1984 presidential election by Walter Mondale. Another popular catch-phrase is &quot;I&#x27;ve fallen and I can&#x27;t get up&quot;, which still appears occasionally, over two decades after its first use. Some advertising agency executives have originated more than one enduring slogan, such as Mary Wells Lawrence, who is responsible for such famous slogans as &quot;Raise your hand if you&#x27;re Sure&quot;, &quot;I♥New York&quot; and &quot;Trust the Midas touch.&quot;

Prior to the 1970s, music in television advertisements was generally limited to jingles and incidental music; on some occasions lyrics to a popular song would be changed to create a theme song or a jingle for a particular product. An example of this is found on the recent popular Gocompare.com advert that utilises &quot;Over There&quot;, the 1917 song popular with United States soldiers in both World Wars and written by George M. Cohan during World War I. In 1971 the converse occurred when a song written for a Coca-Cola advertisement was re-recorded as the pop single &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)&quot; by the New Seekers, and became a hit. Additionally songwriter Paul Williams composed a piece for a Crocker Bank commercial which he lengthened and The Carpenters recorded as &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot;. Some pop and rock songs were re-recorded by cover bands for use in advertisements, but the cost of licensing original recordings for this purpose remained prohibitive in certain countries (including the U.S.) until the late 1980s.

The use of previously recorded popular songs in American television advertisements began in earnest in 1985 when Burger King used the original recording of Aretha Franklin&#x27;s song &quot;Freeway of Love&quot; in a television advertisement for the restaurant. This also occurred in 1987 when Nike used the original recording of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Revolution&quot; in an advertisement for athletic shoes. Since then, many classic popular songs have been used in similar fashion. Songs can be used to concretely illustrate a point about the product being sold (such as Bob Seger&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rock&quot; used for Chevy trucks), but more often are simply used to associate the good feelings listeners had for the song to the product on display. In some cases the original meaning of the song can be totally irrelevant or even completely opposite to the implication of the use in advertising; for example Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, a song about heroin addiction, has been used to advertise Royal Caribbean International, a cruise ship line. Music-licensing agreements with major artists, especially those that had not previously allowed their recordings to be used for this purpose, such as Microsoft&#x27;s use of &quot;Start Me Up&quot; by the Rolling Stones and Apple Inc.&#x27;s use of U2&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot; became a source of publicity in themselves.

In early instances, songs were often used over the objections of the original artists, who had lost control of their music publishing, the music of the Beatles being perhaps the most well-known case; more recently artists have actively solicited use of their music in advertisements and songs have gained popularity and sales after being used in advertisements. A famous case is Levi&#x27;s company, which has used several one hit wonders in their advertisements (songs such as &quot;Inside&quot;, &quot;Spaceman&quot;, and &quot;Flat Beat&quot;). In 2010, research conducted by PRS for Music revealed that &quot;Light &amp; Day&quot; by The Polyphonic Spree is the most performed song in UK TV advertising.

Sometimes a controversial reaction has followed the use of some particular song on an advertisement. Often the trouble has been that people do not like the idea of using songs that promote values important for them in advertisements. For example, Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s anti-racism song, &quot;Everyday People&quot;, was used in a car advertisement, which angered some people.

Generic scores for advertisements often feature clarinets, saxophones, or various strings (such as the acoustic/electric guitars and violins) as the primary instruments.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, electronica music was increasingly used as background scores for television advertisements, initially for automobiles, and later for other technological and business products such as computers and financial services. Television advertising has become a popular outlet for new artists to gain an audience for their work, with some advertisements displaying artist and song information onscreen at the beginning or end.

==Advertisement controversies==
Several advertisements were banned shortly after being televised due to their controversial nature. In 2005, the notorious &quot;Blood on the Carpet&quot; commercial for &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; was pulled for its depicted mutilation. The &quot;Game Boy Advance Micro&quot; commercial was withdrawn due to showing a lab rat &quot;humping&quot; on the handheld system, using it as a sex toy. The &quot;Snickers&quot; commercial featuring Mr. T shooting Snickers at a feminine speed walker was quickly pulled for being homophobic. The &quot;Cocoa Pebbles&quot; commercial featuring a caricature based on Hulk Hogan was removed after Hogan filed a lawsuit against Post for plagiarizing his image. In 2020, the &quot;Match.com&quot; commercial depicting a petite woman (Taylor Swift) dating Satan (Ryan Reynolds) was only shown once before it was withdrawn as it is deemed religiously sensitive. Some advertisements are refused to be shown to the public, such as the risqué AGFA underwater camera commercial that was never televised. In 2012, the &quot;Burger King&quot; commercial featuring rapper Mary J. Blige received backlash by African-American reviewers after it was previewed on the internet. Yet, it was shelved before being televised.

Controversial advertisements have been observed to be subject to change during the advertised product&#x27;s lifespan:
The slogan for &quot;Dr Pepper Ten&quot; &quot;It’s not for women&quot; was no longer used for subsequent ads after it was deemed too sexist.
The slogan for &quot;Kotex&quot; &quot;It fits. Period.&quot; (one advertisement showed a CG anthropomorphic red dot dissolving on a pad) was no longer used in subsequent ads due to the slogan&#x27;s term &quot;period&quot; referring to both punctuation and menstruation have been deemed inappropriate for television owing to the regarded viewership surrounding children. Commercials on children&#x27;s underwear, such as &quot;Underoos&quot;, featuring clad child models had since gained criticism by parents due to concerns of child sexual exploitation, resulting that children will no longer be used for these advertisements in this fashionable matter, not limiting to advertisements on baby diapers. The Mac Tonight mascot made minimal appearances before retiring from the &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot; commercials due to the theme song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; infringing upon the likeness of Bobby Darin as sued by his son, Dodd Mitchell Darin, in 1989.

<doc id="180558" wikidata="Q3197019" url="?curid=180558" title="Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003">
<text>The Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 was draft legislation written by United States Department of Justice during the George W. Bush administration, under the tenure of United States Attorney General John Ashcroft. The Center for Public Integrity obtained a copy of the draft marked &quot;confidential&quot; on February 7, 2003, and posted it on its Web site along with commentary. It was sometimes called Patriot II, after the USA PATRIOT Act, which was enacted in 2001. It was never introduced to the United States Congress.

The draft version of the bill would have expanded the powers of the United States federal government while simultaneously curtailing judicial review of these powers. Members of the United States Congress said that they had not seen the drafts, though the documents obtained by the CPI indicated that Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Dennis Hastert and Vice President Dick Cheney had received copies.

Provisions of the draft version included:
*Removal of court-ordered prohibitions against police agencies spying on domestic groups.
*The Federal Bureau of Investigation would be granted powers to conduct searches and surveillance based on intelligence gathered in foreign countries without first obtaining a court order.
*Creation of a DNA database of suspected terrorists.
*Prohibition of any public disclosure of the names of alleged terrorists including those who have been arrested.
*Exemptions from civil liability for people and businesses who voluntarily turn private information over to the government.
*Criminalization of the use of encryption to conceal incriminating communications.
*Automatic denial of bail for persons accused of terrorism-related crimes, reversing the ordinary common law burden of proof principle. Persons charged with terrorists acts would be required to demonstrate why they should be released on bail rather than the government being required to demonstrate why they should be held.
*Expansion of the list of crimes eligible for the death penalty.
*The Environmental Protection Agency would be prevented from releasing &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; information to the public about chemical plants.
*United States citizens whom the government finds to be either members of, or providing material support to, terrorist groups could have their citizenship revoked and be deported to foreign countries.

Some provisions of this act have been tacked onto other bills such as the Senate Spending bill and subsequently passed.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the Bill of Rights Defense Committee have all been vocal opponents of the PATRIOT Act of 2001, the proposed (as of 2003) PATRIOT 2 Act, and other associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism that it believes violates either the letter and/or the spirit of the U.S. Bill of Rights.

On January 31, 2006, the Center for Public Integrity published a story on its website that claimed that this proposed legislation undercut the Bush administration&#x27;s legal rationale of its NSA wiretapping program.

<text>Morris Swadesh (; January 22, 1909 – July 20, 1967) was an American linguist who specialized in comparative and historical linguistics, and developed his mature career at UNAM in Mexico.

Swadesh was born in Massachusetts to Bessarabian Jewish immigrant parents. He completed bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees at the University of Chicago, studying under Edward Sapir, and then followed Sapir to Yale University where he completed a Ph.D. in 1933. Swadesh taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1937 to 1939, and then during World War II worked on projects with the United States Army and Office of Strategic Services. He became a professor at the City College of New York after the war&#x27;s end, but was fired in 1949 due to his membership in the Communist Party. He spent most of the rest of his life teaching in Mexico and Canada.

Swadesh had a particular interest in the indigenous languages of the Americas, and conducted extensive fieldwork throughout North America. He was one of the pioneers of glottochronology and lexicostatistics, and is known for his creation of the Swadesh list, a compilation of basic concepts believed to present across cultures and thus suitable for cross-linguistic comparison. Swadesh believed that his techniques could discover deep relationships between apparently unrelated languages, thus allowing for the identification of macrofamilies and possibly even a &quot;Proto-Human&quot; language. His theories were often controversial, and some have been deprecated by later linguists.

==Early life and education==
Swadesh was born in 1909 in Holyoke, Massachusetts, to Jewish immigrant parents from Bessarabia. His parents were multilingual, and he grew up with Yiddish, some Russian, and English as his first languages.

Swadesh earned his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Chicago, where he began studying with the linguist Edward Sapir. He followed Sapir to Yale University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1933. Inspired by Sapir&#x27;s early lists of word similarities among Native American languages, he began a life work in comparative linguistics.

==Early career==
In the 1930s, Swadesh conducted extensive fieldwork on more than 20 indigenous languages of the Americas, with travels in Canada, Mexico, and the US. He worked most prominently on the Chitimacha language, a now-extinct language isolate found among indigenous people of Louisiana. His fieldnotes and subsequent publications constitute the main source of information on this extinct language. He also conducted smaller amounts of fieldwork on the Menominee and Mahican languages, in Wisconsin and New York, respectively; both are part of the Algonquian language family.

Swadesh taught linguistics and anthropology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison from 1937 to 1939. During this time he devised and organized the highly original Oneida Language and Folklore Project. This program hired more than a dozen Oneida Indians in Wisconsin for a WPA project (under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to record and translate texts in the Oneida language. (The Oneida were historically one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, with their historic territory located in central New York state, but some had moved to Wisconsin in the 19th century.) In this same period in other WPA projects, writers were recording state histories and guides, and researchers were collecting oral histories of African Americans who had been born into slavery before the end of the Civil War.

Swadesh was let go by the University of Wisconsin just as he was to begin the project. Floyd Lounsbury, then an undergraduate, was assigned to finish it. Lounsbury continued his studies in linguistics, later serving as Sterling Professor of Anthropology and Linguistics at Yale University.

In May 1939 Swadesh went to Mexico, where he had been hired to assist the government of Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas, who was promoting the education of indigenous peoples. Swadesh learned the Purépecha language for this work. Together with rural school teachers, Swadesh worked in indigenous villages, teaching people to read first in their own languages, before teaching them Spanish. His Mexican colleagues remembered him for his impressive physical complexion, nicknaming him &quot;The Paunch&quot;, as well as for his outspoken Communism. He worked with the Tarahumara, Purépecha, and Otomi peoples. Swadesh also learned Spanish in less than a year; he was fluent enough that he was able to give a series of linguistics lectures (in Spanish) at the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolás de Hidalgo and publish his first book, &quot;,&quot; in Spanish in 1941.

Returning to the U.S., during the Second World War Swadesh worked on military projects for the U.S. Army and the OSS to compile reference materials on Burmese, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish. He also wrote easy-to-learn textbooks for troops to learn Russian and Chinese.

Swadesh served in Burma, where Lt. Roger Hilsman described his linguistic skills as extraordinary. Swadesh learned enough of the Naga language, after spending only one day with a local guide, that he was able to give a ten-minute thank-you speech in that language. Hilsman recalled that Swadesh had been strongly opposed to racial segregation in the United States.

==Red Scare==
In May 1949, Swadesh was fired by the City College of New York (CCNY) due to accusations that he was a Communist. That was during the Red Scare, and he was one of a number of anthropologists and other academics to be deprived of their employment during the McCarthy Era. Swadesh had been a member of the Denver Communist Party and was active in the protest movement against the execution of convicted spies, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Swadesh continued to work in the United States until 1954, aided by limited funding from the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia.

==Later career==
In 1956 Swadesh returned to Mexico, where he took a position as researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and taught linguistics at the National School of Anthropology and History (Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia), in Mexico City.

In 1966, he was appointed Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Alberta in Canada. He was developing plans for a major research project in Western Canada at the time of his death, in the summer of 1967.

==Work in historical linguistics==
Swadesh is best known for his work in historical linguistics. Any language changes over centuries (consider, for example, the changes in English since the Middle Ages). Some languages diverge and become separate dialects, or languages that still belong to the same language family. Tracking similarities and differences between languages is part of historical linguistics. Swadesh proposed a number of distant genetic links among languages.

He was the chief pioneer of lexicostatistics, which attempts to classify languages on the basis of the extent to which they have replaced basic words reconstructible in the proto-language, and glottochronology, which extends lexicostatistics by computing divergence dates from the lexical retention rate.

Swadesh became a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized Interlingua and presented it to the public in 1951 (Esterhill 2000). In this role, he originated the lists of 100 and 200 basic vocabulary items, used (with some variation) in both lexicostatistics and glottochronology for comparison among languages. They have since been known as the Swadesh lists.

Some scholars considered Swadesh as a supporter of monogenesis, the theory that all languages have a common origin: &quot;Swadesh sought to show that all the world&#x27;s languages are related in one large family&quot; (Ruhlen 1994:215). Others believe that Swadesh proposed early linkages, but believed that languages diverged immediately among peoples, as he expressed in his major, but unfinished work, &quot;The Origin and Diversification of Language&quot; (1971), published posthumously.

==Personal life==
Swadesh was married for a time to Mary Haas, a fellow American linguist. He later married Frances Leon, with whom he worked in Mexico in the 1930s; they divorced in the late 1950s. He married linguist Evangelina Arana after his return to Mexico in 1956.

He died in Mexico City in July 1967.

<doc id="180562" wikidata="Q1094925" url="?curid=180562" title="Clan Campbell">
<text>Clan Campbell ( ) is a Highland Scottish clan, historically one of the largest and most powerful of the Highland clans. The Clan Campbell lands are in Argyll and within their lands lies Ben Cruachan. The chief of the clan became Earl of Argyll and later Duke of Argyll.

==History==
===Origins===

In traditional genealogies of Clan Campbell, the clan&#x27;s origins are in the ancient Britons of Strathclyde. The earliest Campbell in written record is Gillespie, whose name is recorded in 1263. Early grants to Gillespie and his relations were almost all in east-central Scotland. The family&#x27;s connection with Argyll came some generations earlier when a Campbell married the heiress of the O&#x27;Duines and she brought with her the Lordship of Loch Awe. Because of this, the early clan name was &quot;Clan O&#x27;Duine&quot;. The name was later styled &quot;Clann Diarmaid&quot; based on a fancied connection to &quot;Diarmuid the Boar&quot;, a great hero from early Celtic mythology.

The original seat of Clan Campbell was either Innes Chonnel Castle on Loch Awe or Caisteal na Nigheann Ruaidh on Loch Avich. The clan&#x27;s power soon spread throughout Argyll, though at first the Campbells were under the domination of the Lords of Lorne, chiefs of Clan MacDougall. The MacDougalls killed the Campbell chief Cailean Mór (Colin Campbell) in 1296. (See: Battle of Red Ford.) All subsequent chiefs of Clan Campbell have taken &quot;MacCailean Mór&quot; as their Gaelic patronymic.

Between 1200 and 1500, the Campbells emerged as one of the most powerful families in Scotland, dominant in Argyll and capable of wielding a wider influence and authority from Edinburgh to the Hebrides and western Highlands.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===

Early in the 14th century, the family of Colin Campbell became firm supporters of King Robert the Bruce and benefited from his successes through grants of lands, titles, and good marriages. In 1314, the Campbells fought for Scotland against England in the Wars of Scottish Independence at the Battle of Bannockburn. Throughout the 14th century, Clan Campbell rapidly expanded its lands and power. The expansion is explained in part by the loyalty of Sir Neil Campbell (&quot;Niall mac Caile&quot;) (died 1316) to the cause of Robert the Bruce, a loyalty that was rewarded with marriage to Bruce&#x27;s sister Mary. The family was closely associated with the Stewarts and the Bruces in the time of Cailean Mór. Sir Neil, as a staunch ally of Robert the Bruce, was rewarded with extensive lands that had been taken from Clan MacDougall, the Lords of Lorne, and other enemies of the Bruces in Argyll.

===15th century and royal relations===

The Campbells gave support to the Crown throughout the 15th century. By the end of the 15th century, the power of the Lords of the Isles (chiefs of Clan Donald), the Crown&#x27;s most powerful rivals, had been broken, and the Campbells were the main power in the area. From this time onward, the Campbells acted as the central authority in the area; this transition of power might be the real cause of the ancient enmity between the Campbells and the MacDonalds.

Descendants of Sir Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell (&quot;Donnchadh&quot;), and his wife Lady Marjorie Stewart are descendants of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, and Robert II Stewart, King of Scotland. Lady Marjorie Stewart (born circa 1390) was the daughter of King Robert II&#x27;s son, Robert Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany. This makes all descendants of Sir Duncan Campbell and Lady Marjorie Stewart descendants of Robert I Bruce and of most of the early kings of Scotland.

The title of 1st Lord Campbell was created in 1445. In the second half of the 15th century, the Campbells played an increasingly prominent role in Scotland. During his reign, James I of Scotland launched a great political assault on the Albany Stewarts and their allies in the west. However, Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell (&quot;Donnchadh&quot;), escaped the fate of his Albany kinsmen, who all were either executed or exiled.

Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll (&quot;Cailean&quot;), was ennobled as Earl of Argyll in 1457 and later became Baron of Lorn. He also was granted lands in Knapdale. The title and land grants were signs that the Argylls were one of the major forces in Scotland. In 1493, after the forfeiture of the MacDonalds as Lords of the Isles, the Campbell lords might well have viewed themselves as natural successors to Clan Donald in terms of leadership of the Gaels of the Hebrides and western Highlands. The Campbell lordship thus remained one of the most significant bastions of Gaelic learning and culture in late medieval and early modern Scotland.

In the Battle of Knockmary in 1490, men of Clan Campbell and Clan Drummond joined forces to defeat Clan Murray. The battle also became known as the Massacre of Monzievaird. In 1499, Campbell of Inverliver defeated Clan Calder at the Battle of Daltullich. Sir John Campbell, the younger son of the Earl of Argyll, subsequently received the estate of Calder and Cawdor Castle through his marriage to the estate&#x27;s heiress, Muriel Calder.

===16th century and clan conflicts===

In 1513, the 2nd Earl of Argyll was killed along with many of his clan at the Battle of Flodden.

The Battle of Langside took place in 1568 where the chief of Clan Campbell, Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll, commanded the forces who fought for Mary, Queen of Scots.

In 1567, a conflict took place between the Clan Campbell and Clan Arthur. Duncan MacArthur and his son of the Loch Awe MacArthur family, became the victims of their own success when jealousy of their power drove neighbours to drown them in Loch Awe during a skirmish with the Clan Campbell. In the archives of Inveraray Castle a charter dated 1567 confirms that a pardon was granted to the Campbells of Inverawe for what became known as the &quot;drowning of Clan Arthur&quot;. It is believed that the MacArthurs trying to defend themselves were driven into the loch. Centuries later in the 1970s an ancient sword was unearthed on the shore of the loch.

For two centuries from the mid-15th century the Clan Gordon and Clan Campbell controlled the north-east and west of Scotland respectively, as the magnates who straddled the divide between the Scottish Highlands and Scottish Lowlands. In 1594, Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll was granted a Royal Commission against George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly but was defeated at the Battle of Glenlivet.

===17th century and Civil War===

The support that the Campbells gave to the central Government brought them rewards: In 1607, Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll was granted the former MacDonald lands of Kintyre and in 1615 Campbell of Cawdor was allowed to purchase the Isle of Islay which had previously belonged to the Macleans of Duart.
At the Battle of Inverlochy (1645), the Scottish Covenanter forces led by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll were defeated by the Royalist forces of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose whose army was mainly made up of Scots of the Clan MacDonald, Clan Maclean, and others from Ireland. After the Battle of Inverlochy, Montrose and the Macleans burnt Castle Campbell, but the castle remained in Campbell hands. In the wake of the Battle of Inverlochy the Clan Lamont took the opportunity to raid the Campbell lands. The vengeful Campbells also ravaged the lands of the Clan Maclean who had fought against them at Inverlochy and in due course the Maclean&#x27;s Duart Castle surrendered.

In 1648, at the Battle of Stirling (1648) the Kirk Party Covenanter forces of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll were defeated by the Engager Covenanter forces of Sir George Munro, 1st of Newmore who supported the Earl of Lanark. Among Argyll&#x27;s dead was William Campbell of Glenfalloch killed in action.

In 1672, a feud took place between the Clan Campbell and Clan Sinclair. Debt had forced George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness to resign his titles and estates in favour of Sir John Campbell. Campbell took possession of the estates on Sinclair&#x27;s death in May 1676, and was created earl of Caithness in June the following year. Sinclair&#x27;s heir, George Sinclair of Keiss disputed the claim and seized the land in 1678. This was followed by the Battle of Altimarlech, 13 July 1680, between the Clan Campbell and the Clan Sinclair in which the Campbells were victorious. Legend has it that so many Sinclairs were killed that the Campbells were able to cross the river without getting their feet wet. Having failed to regain his inheritance by force, Sinclair of Keiss then turned to the law. He took his place as Earl of Caithness on 15 July 1681, and his lands were restored on 23 September. Campbell was made Earl of Breadalbane by way of compensation.

In 1678, Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll led the Campbell of Argyll militia on an expedition to the Isle of Mull and took Duart Castle from the Clan Maclean. However, Argyll was beheaded on 30 June 1685 for his participation in Argyll&#x27;s Rising in support of the Monmouth Rebellion to depose Catholic James VII and II and place the Protestant James, Duke of Monmouth on the throne. Later in 1692, Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll again gained possession of the Maclean&#x27;s Duart Castle.

In 1692, 38 unarmed people of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed in the Massacre of Glencoe when a Government initiative to suppress Jacobitism was entangled in the long running feud between Clan MacDonald and Clan Campbell. The slaughter of the MacDonalds at the hands of the soldiers, led by Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, after enjoying their hospitality for over a week was a major affront of Scots Law and Highland tradition. The majority of soldiers were not Campbells, but a roll call from a few months before included six Campbells in addition to Cpt. Robt. Campbell: Corporal Achibald Campbell, Private Archibald Campbell (elder), Private Donald Campbell (younger), Private Archibald Campbell (younger), Private James Campbell, Private Donald Campbell (elder), and Private Duncan Campbell. See also: Earl of Argyll&#x27;s Regiment of Foot.

===18th century and Jacobite Uprisings===

====Jacobite rising of 1715====
During the Jacobite risings of the 18th century the Clan Campbell supported the British-Hanoverian Government. On 23 October 1715, chief John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll learned that a detachment of rebels was passing by Castle Campbell, towards Dunfermline. He sent out a body of cavalry which attacked the rebel party and defeated it in what is now known as the Skirmish of Dunfermline and took a number of prisoners, taking only light casualties. A month later the British Government forces, including men from Clan Campbell, fought and defeated the Jacobites at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715. However, there were in fact a small number of Campbells who took the side of the Jacobites led by the son of Campbell of Glenlyon whose father had commanded the Government troops at the Massacre of Glencoe against the MacDonalds 22 years earlier. These two families then settled their differences and swore to be brothers in arms, fighting side by side in the Sheriffmuir. However, the British Government forces led by chief John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll defeated the Jacobites.

====The Black Watch====

General Wade&#x27;s report on the Highlands in 1724 estimated the strength of the clan who supported the Government under the Duke of Argyll as 4,000 men, whilst those under Campbell of Breadalbane who had supported the Jacobites in 1715, as 1000 men. In 1725, six Independent Highland Companies were formed to support the Government: three from Clan Campbell, one from Clan Fraser of Lovat, one from Clan Munro and one from Clan Grant. These companies were known by the name &quot;Reicudan Dhu&quot;, or &quot;Black Watch&quot;. The Regiment of the Line was formed officially in 1739 as the 42nd Regiment of Foot and first mustered in 1740, at Aberfeldy.

====Jacobite rising of 1745====

Just before 1745, the strength of the Clan Campbell had been put at a total of 5,000 men. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, the Clan Campbell continued their support for the British Government. They fought against the rebel Jacobites at the Battle of Falkirk (1746) where Government forces were defeated. However, shortly afterwards the Campbells held out during the Siege of Fort William where the Jacobites were defeated. The Campbells were also involved in the Skirmish of Keith around the same time. At the Battle of Culloden in 1746 where the Jacobites were finally defeated, involved in the fighting on the Government side were four companies from the Campbell of Argyll Militia, three companies from Loudon&#x27;s Highlanders who were under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell and one company from the 43rd Highlanders who were under the command of Captain Dugald Campbell of Auchrossan.

==Castles==

Castles that have belonged to the Clan Campbell have included amongst many others:
*Inveraray Castle in Argyll is the current seat of the chief of Clan Campbell. The present symmetrical mansion with towers and turrets was built in 1743 and replaced an earlier 15th-century castle. It contains a &quot;clan room&quot; with information for members of Clan Campbell.
*Castle Campbell, which was originally known as &quot;Castle Gloom&quot;, passed by marriage from the Clan Stewart to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, who renamed it Castle Campbell. During the Civil War it was burned by General Monk for Oliver Cromwell and the Clan Ogilvy are also said to have torched it in revenge for the burning of Airlie Castle.
*Innes Chonnel Castle, possibly the earliest seat of Clan Campbell.
*Kilchurn Castle was seat of the Campbells of Glenorchy. The lands were originally held by the Clan MacGregor but they went to the Campbells of Glenorchy who built or re-built the castle. The castle was strengthened and improved after being damaged by the MacGregors at the end of the sixteenth century. Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy who was known as &quot;Black Duncan of the Seven Castles&quot; was responsible for building castles at Kilchurn, Achallader, Loch Dochart, Finlarig, Balloch (Taymouth) and Edinample. In 1654, the Campbells withstood a two-day siege in Kilchurn Castle by General Middleton who retreated from Cromwell&#x27;s forces.
*Achallader Castle, was seat of Sir Duncan Campbell of Glen Orchy which he acquired in 1590.
*Finlarig Castle, was another seat of the Campbell of Breadalbane branch of the clan. 
*Edinample Castle, was another seat of the Campbell of Glenorchy branch of the clan.
*Taymouth Castle, originally built by Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy in around 1580 and known as Balloch Castle, the current building was built between 1801 and 1842 and incorporates the cellars of the original stronghold.
*Saddell Castle was owned by the Campbells from the late 17th century onwards.
*Torosay Castle, built by John Campbell of Possil in 1858.
*Castle Sween was granted to Colin Campbell in 1481 when he became the first Earl of Argyll, but it was captured by the MacDonalds in 1647.
*Carnasserie Castle, has belonged to the Clan Campbell since the 16th century.
*Kilmartin Castle, passed to the Campbells in 1674.
*Ardkinglas Castle.
*Auchenbreck Castle, held by the Campbell of Auchinbreck branch of the clan but demolished by 1870.
*Cawdor Castle, originally seat of the chiefs of Clan Calder, it later passed to the Clan Campbell of Cawdor.
*Loudoun Castle in Ayrshire, is a mansion dating from the early nineteenth century but includes work from a fifteenth century castle which was originally held by the Clan Crawford, but passed by marriage to the Campbells in the fourteenth century. This branch of the Clan Campbell sprung from Donald Campbell, second son of Colin Campbell of Lochaw. John Campbell, from another branch of the clan was made Earl of Loudon in 1641. In 1650, the castle was surrendered to General Monk for Cromwell after a siege in which the castle was damaged. The earl took part in Glencairn&#x27;s rising in support of Charles II of England in 1653. John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun fought for the British-Hanoverians during the Jacobite risings.
*Lesmoir Castle
*Castle and Lands of Auchruglen - East Ayrshire.

==Tartans==

Although mills produce many fabrics based on the Campbell tartan, the clan chief recognizes only four:

*Campbell or old Campbell: In darker tones, it is more commonly known as the Black Watch tartan or the Government sett. The Black Watch, first raised in 1695 to police the &quot;black trade&quot; of cattle smuggling in the Highlands, taking role later as a militia in 1725 by General Wade (after the act of Union in 1707), became what was the first Highland regiment in the British Army. All Campbell tartans are based upon the Old Campbell tartan, as are many other clan tartans. The Black Watch variant was used, and is in current use, by several military units throughout the Commonwealth.
*Campbell of Breadalbane: the tartan of the Campbells of the Breadalbane and Glenorchy branches. 
*Campbell of Cawdor: the tartan of the Campbells of the Cawdor branch.
*Campbell of Loudoun: the tartan of the Campbells of the Loudoun branch.

George Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll added a white line to his tartan to distinguish himself as the clan chief. He was the only member of the family to do so, but the tartan has persisted as &quot;Campbell of Argyll&quot; which, as with any other tartan not listed above, is not recognized as official by the clan.

==Chief==

*Torquhil Ian Campbell is the 13th Duke of Argyll, Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne, Earl of Argyll, Campbell and Cowal, Viscount Lochawe and Glenyla, Lord Campbell, Lorne, Kintyre, Inveraray, Mull, Morven and Tyrie in the peerage of Scotland, Baron Sundridge of Coombank and Baron Hamilton of Hameldon in the peerage of Great Britain, 6th Duke of Argyll in the peerage of the United Kingdom, Baronet of Nova Scotia, Hereditary Master of the Royal Household in Scotland, Hereditary Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, Hereditary Keeper of the royal castles of Dunoon, Carrick Castle, Dunstaffnage Castle and Tarbet, Admiral of the Western coasts and isles, and Chief of the Honorable Clan Campbell. The chief&#x27;s Gaelic title is &quot;Mac Cailein Mòr&quot; (&#x27;Son of Colin the Great&#x27;). Campbell is also the hereditary High Sheriff of Argyllshire, a member of the Queen&#x27;s Body Guard for Scotland, and a member of the Royal Company of Archers.

<doc id="180566" wikidata="Q6970063" url="?curid=180566" title="Nation of Islam and antisemitism">
<text>A number of organizations and academics consider the Nation of Islam (NOI) to be antisemitic. The NOI has engaged in Holocaust denial, and exaggerates the role of Jews in the African slave trade; mainstream historians, such as Saul S. Friedman, have said Jews had a negligible role. The NOI has repeatedly rejected charges made against it as false and politically motivated.

==Charges of antisemitism==

The Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish Congress, and the Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism have condemned the Nation of Islam as antisemitic.

Scholars of comparative religion have argued that the Nation of Islam is antisemitic and advocates Holocaust denial. For instance, in the &quot;Global Journal of Classical Theology&quot;, Professor Richard V. Pierard writes:
A report by the Stephen Roth Institute for studying Anti-Semitism and Racism states the following:
British Home Secretary Jack Straw and lawyers for the Home Office have also described Farrakhan&#x27;s views as &quot;anti-semitic and racially divisive&quot;, and as a result he has been banned from the United Kingdom since 1986.

A Catholic magazine, &quot;This Rock&quot;, has described the Nation of Islam as both antisemitic and anti-Catholic.

A number of prominent secular humanists have written that the NOI is antisemitic. &quot;Hating in the Name of God&quot;, by Benjamin Radford (Council for Secular Humanism website), and Madeline Weld&#x27;s address to the 1995 annual meeting of the Humanist Association of Canada are examples of such criticism.

=== Farrakhan calls Jews &quot;Satanic&quot; and compares Jews to Termites ===
Louis Farrakhan said in a 2014 speech that &quot;the satanic Jews that control everything, and mostly everybody, if they are your enemy, you must, must be somebody.&quot; In an October 2018 speech, Farrakhan referred to Jews as termites: &quot;So when they talk about Farrakhan, call me a hater, you know what they do, call me an anti-Semite. Stop it, I’m anti-Termite.&quot;

===Jews &quot;control the economy&quot;===
For many years certain Nation of Islam (NOI) ministers have been preaching that &quot;the Jews&quot; control the American economy and the world economy. Statements to this effect can be found in its newspaper &quot;The Final Call&quot; and in speeches given in their temples and on college campuses.

For example, the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; recorded this dialogue between Nation-of-Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and an audience to which he was speaking:

===Alleged major role of Jews in the slave trade===
&quot;The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews&quot; is a book published in 1991 by the Nation of Islam. The book alleges that Jews dominated the Atlantic slave trade. The book has been labeled an antisemitic canard by historians including Saul S. Friedman, who has written that Jews had a minimal role in New World slave trade. Henry Louis Gates, head of the department of Afro-American studies at Harvard University, called the book &quot;the bible of new anti-Semitism&quot; and added, &quot;The book massively misinterprets the historical record, largely through a process of cunningly selective quotations of often reputable sources.&quot;

===Criticisms of perceived Jewish &quot;control&quot;===
Elijah Muhammad, Louis Farrakhan, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, and other NOI ministers have been frequently critical of what they perceive as the Jewish control over African American society, their beliefs frequently approaching conspiracy theory. For example:

Farrakhan gave a speech attacking then National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, and presidential advisor (later Chicago mayor) Rahm Emanuel. In regards to their names, he stated that &quot;Every Jewish person that is around the president is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States of America...and sometimes, we have to raise the question, Are you more loyal to the state of Israel than you are to the best interests of the United States of America?&quot;

===References to Jews as &quot;bloodsuckers&quot;===
Some NOI ministers have called Jews bloodsuckers. For example, in his Saviours&#x27; Day speech in Chicago, Illinois, February 25, 1996, Louis Farrakhan stated:

One former NOI minister Khalid Abdul Muhammed referred to Jews as bloodsuckers.
Quotes from Khalid Abdul Muhammad, the spokesperson until 1993:

=== Malcolm X and antisemitism ===

Malcolm X, a member of the Nation of Islam until he left in 1964, made antisemitic statements and is thought to have held antisemitic beliefs. His autobiography contains several antisemitic charges and caricatures of Jews. Alex Haley, the autobiography&#x27;s co-author, had to rewrite some of the book in order to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the manuscript. Malcolm X believed that the fabricated antisemitic text &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, was authentic and introduced it to NOI members, while blaming Jewish people for &quot;perfecting the modern evil&quot; of neo-colonialism. He was a leading figure in reshaping the black community&#x27;s perception of The Holocaust, engaging in Holocaust trivialization and claiming that the Jews &quot;brought it on themselves&quot;. 

In 1961, Malcolm X spoke at a NOI rally alongside George Lincoln Rockwell, the head of the American Nazi Party. Rockwell claimed that there was overlap between Black nationalism and White supremacy. Even after his departure from the NOI and during the last months of his life, Malcolm X&#x27;s statements about Jews continued to include antisemitic images of Jews as &quot;bloodsucker[s]&quot;.

==Response to charges of antisemitism==
The Nation of Islam has repeatedly denied charges of antisemitism. Louis Farrakhan has stated, &quot;The ADL .. uses the term &#x27;anti-Semitism&#x27; to stifle all criticism of Zionism and the Zionist policies of the State of Israel and also to stifle all legitimate criticism of the errant behavior of some Jewish people toward the non-Jewish population.&quot;

In a letter responding to Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Director Abraham Foxman&#x27;s insistence that black leaders distance themselves from the Nation of Islam, hip hop mogul Russell Simmons wrote: &quot;Simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of African Americans and most importantly your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews in the minds of millions of African Americans,&quot; he continued, &quot;For over 50 years, Minister Farrakhan has labored to resurrect the downtrodden masses of African Americans up out of poverty and self-destruction&quot; and indicated that he had personally witnessed Farrakhan affirm, &#x27;A Muslim can not hate a Jew. We are all members of the family of Abraham and all of us should maintain dialogue and mutual respect.&#x27;&quot;

==Jews, Nazis, and the Holocaust==
Farrakhan stated at the Mosque Maryam in Chicago on March 19, 1995 that the Jews financed the Holocaust:
Khalid Abdul Muhammad, a former advisor to Farrakhan, stated that the Jews deserved to be exterminated by the Nazis. Echoing white supremacist propaganda, he holds that Jewish people undermined German society, and thus deserved to be targeted by the Nazis.
==Cooperation with antisemitic groups==

===Holocaust deniers===

The Nation of Islam&#x27;s official position does not deny the Jewish holocaust. Tim Russert, during a 1997 &quot;Meet the Press&quot; interview with Louis Farrakhan, posed the question, &quot;Do you believe there was a Holocaust in which 6 million Jews perished?&quot;

==Relationship with white supremacists==

Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s pro-separation views were compatible with those of some white supremacist organizations in the 1960s. He reportedly met with leaders of the Ku Klux Klan in 1961 to work toward the purchase of farmland in the Deep South. He eventually established Temple Farms, now Muhammad Farms, on a tract in Terrell County, Georgia. George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party once called Muhammad &quot;the Hitler of the black man.&quot; At the 1962 Saviours&#x27; Day celebration in Chicago, Rockwell addressed Nation of Islam members. Many in the audience booed and heckled him and his men, for which Muhammad rebuked them in the April 1962 issue of &quot;Muhammad Speaks&quot;.

<doc id="180568" wikidata="Q201908" url="?curid=180568" title="Anni-Frid Lyngstad">
<text>Anni-Frid Synni Lyngstad (born 15 November 1945), also known simply as Frida, is a Swedish singer who is best known as one of the founding members and lead singers of the pop band ABBA. Courtesy titles &quot;Princess Reuss&quot; and &quot;Countess of Plauen&quot; are also in use because of her third marriage. Born in Bjørkåsen (in Ballangen Municipality), Norway, to a Norwegian mother and a German father, she grew up in Torshälla, Sweden, and started her first solo career there, as a jazz singer in 1967, through a talent competition called &quot;New Faces&quot;.

She won the competition with her song &quot;En ledig dag&quot;, leading to a television appearance on &quot;Hylands Hörna&quot; on Dagen H; as a result, she was signed by EMI, and in turn was signed by Stig Anderson&#x27;s record label, Polar Music, after years of releasing several singles and an album, &quot;Frida&quot;, under the earlier record label. She then had moderate success in Sweden, as she was a contestant for Melodifestivalen 1969 with her song &quot;Härlig är vår jord&quot;. Lyngstad did not find international fame, however, until she joined ABBA, who have sold over 150 million albums and singles worldwide, making the group, which included her second husband Benny Andersson, one of the best-selling music acts in history. 

After the break-up of ABBA, she continued an international solo singing career with mixed success, releasing the albums &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1982) and &quot;Shine&quot; (1984); the latter being her last international album. In 1996, Lyngstad recorded her final album in Swedish, &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; (&quot;Deep Breaths&quot;), released by Anderson Records, before retiring from music.

==Early life==
Anni-Frid Synni Lyngstad was born on 15 November 1945 in Bjørkåsen, a small village in Ballangen Municipality near the town of Narvik, in northern Norway. In early 1947, Synni, her own mother Arntine and infant Anni-Frid left their small village in Ballangen, fearing reprisals against those Norwegians that had children conceived by German military fathers during the occupation of their country. Anni-Frid was taken by her grandmother, Arntine to Sweden, where they settled in the region of Härjedalen. Her grandmother took any available job while living there, whereas Synni remained in Norway and worked for a time in the south of the country. Synni joined her mother and daughter in Sweden, and the three moved to Malmköping (72 km from Stockholm). Synni died of kidney failure soon afterward, aged 21 years, leaving Anni-Frid to be raised solely by her grandmother. Anni-Frid would grow up believing her father had died during World War II as his ship had been reported to have sunk on its return to Germany.

In June 1949, Arntine and infant Anni-Frid relocated to Torshälla, outside Eskilstuna, where Arntine worked as a seamstress. Anni-Frid grew up in Torshälla and began to attend school in August 1952. During her childhood, Anni-Frid had close contact with her family, particularly her uncle and four aunts, at her birthplace during the summer holidays. She was close to her aunt, Olive, who once stated that she saw how lonely and subdued Anni-Frid was, and who consequently always did her best to make her feel loved and welcomed during her visits.

In 1977, the German teen magazine &quot;Bravo&quot; published a poster and a complete biography with details of Anni-Frid&#x27;s background, including the names of her mother and father. It was seen by Anni-Frid&#x27;s half-brother, Peter Haase, who went to his father and asked him if he had been in Ballangen during the war. A few months later, at the instigation of Benny Andersson, Anni-Frid met Haase in Stockholm for the first time.

==Career==
===1958–1969: Early work===
Lyngstad stated in several interviews that her grandmother frequently sang songs to her (such as old Norwegian songs), which resulted in her love for music. She showed musical talent at a very early age from her earliest school years. On Fridays, she was often asked by her teacher to sing in front of the class and soon became known in school and in the neighbourhood for her beautiful voice. Although her grandmother encouraged her to sing (according to Lyngstad herself), she never attended any of her performances. Her grandmother died shortly before ABBA formed, so she never witnessed the success of the group.
At the age of 13, Lyngstad gained her first job as a dance band and schlager singer in 1958, with the Evald Ek&#x27;s Orchestra. Evald Ek himself remembers: &quot;It was hard to believe, such a young person could sing that well. She was so easy to rehearse with and she was never shy onstage. The only thing I taught her was to sing out. In those days, she had a tendency of holding back her voice a little.&quot; With the Evald Eks Orchestra, the 13-year-old Lyngstad, performed every weekend in front of a dancing audience. The sets often lasted up to five hours. The songs she liked most to sing were standards such as &quot;All of Me&quot;, &quot;Night and Day&quot; and &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;. To advance and develop, she also started to take singing lessons with opera tenor Folke Andersson. Later, she teamed up with the 15-piece Bengt Sandlunds Bigband, who performed a jazz repertoire covering Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and Count Basie, her vocal idols being Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee. In 1963, she was the vocalist with the Gunnar Sandevarn Trio before forming her own band, the Anni-Frid Four. These groups all contained her husband, Ragnar Fredriksson.

On 3 September 1967, Lyngstad won the Swedish national talent competition &quot;New Faces&quot;, arranged by record company EMI Svenska, and held at Skansen, Stockholm. The song she chose to sing was &quot;En ledig dag&quot; (&quot;A Day Off&quot;; original title &quot;Week-End in Portofino&quot;). The first prize in this contest was a recording contract with EMI&#x27;s Swedish subsidiary. Unbeknownst to Lyngstad, the winner of the contest was also expected to appear the same evening in the country&#x27;s most popular TV show at that time, &quot;Hylands Hörna&quot;. This happened on the same day Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right-hand side. Driving on that day was discouraged, so most of the nation was watching TV that night. Lyngstad performed her winning song live. The performance can be seen on &quot;Frida – The DVD&quot;.

This first exposure to a wider television audience caused a sensation, and many record companies and producers contacted Frida immediately. EMI executives, fearing they might lose their new singer, took the precaution of driving from Stockholm to Lyngstad&#x27;s home in Eskilstuna the next morning with a recording contract for her to sign. EMI producer Olle Bergman remembers: &quot;We got so interested and fond of her and I thought she had everything a person needs to become something.&quot;

On 11 September 1967, Lyngstad recorded the vocals for &quot;&quot;En ledig dag&quot;, which was to become her first single for EMI, under the company&#x27;s British His Master&#x27;s Voice label. Professional and self-assured on this first day in the studio, she recorded the vocals in just one take. The early songs she recorded for EMI are included in the compilation album &quot;Frida 1967–1972&quot;, released by EMI Sweden in 1997.

On 29 January 1968, she performed this song on &quot;Studio 8&quot; on national television and on this occasion briefly met future ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog, who also performed her first single on the same SVT1 programme. Lyngstad toured Sweden with Lasse Lönndahl and Bengt Hallberg in 1968, and recorded several singles for EMI. At the same time, she decided to leave her family and move to Stockholm to start working full-time as a singer.

In 1969, she participated in Melodifestivalen, the Swedish heats for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song &quot;Härlig är vår jord&quot;&quot; (&quot;Our Earth Is Wonderful&quot;), and finished in fourth place. Backstage she met her future second husband and ABBA bandmate Benny Andersson.

===1970–1971: Pre-ABBA===
Her first album, &quot;Frida&quot;, produced by her then-fiancé Benny Andersson, was released in 1971 by EMI Columbia. The album received generous praise from critics and the press, who especially commented on the precision and versatility of Lyngstad&#x27;s voice. A reviewer for the Swedish newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; wrote: &quot;Professional, sure and certain LP-debut ... low-key but self-assured personality with sprinkles of temperament, humor and tenderness. And she sings in such a way that you understand that she&#x27;s got something between her ears – she sings, in other words, in a very intelligent way.&quot; That same year, she released her single &quot;Min egen stad&quot; (&quot;My Own Town&quot;), a cover version of Andersson&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s Nice To Be Back&quot; with lyrics by Peter Himmelstrand; the single reached No. 1 in Svensktoppen. All four future members of ABBA sang back-up vocals on this song. The success of the single led EMI Columbia to re-issue the &quot;Frida&quot; album with &quot;&quot;Min egen stad&quot; added to the beginning of side two of the LP. The entire album was included in the EMI Sweden compilation &quot;Frida 1967–1972&quot;.

Frida continued to play in cabarets, and tour and regularly perform on TV and radio. Subsequently, her relationship with Andersson, and friendship with Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog led to the formation of ABBA. In 1972, after five years with EMI Sweden, Lyngstad changed record companies and moved to the Polar Music label. She recorded the single &quot;Man vill ju leva lite dessemellan&quot;&quot; (&quot;One wants to live a little from time to time&quot;), which became her second No. 1 hit in the Swedish charts.

===1972–1981: ABBA and &quot;Frida ensam&quot;===

At first, Lyngstad was hesitant to perform with her boyfriend Benny Andersson, his best friend Björn Ulvaeus and his wife, Agnetha Fältskog. Their first project together in the winter of 1970–1971 was the cabaret act Festfolket, which was not a success. The following year, Lyngstad toured with Lasse Berghagen, while the other three future ABBA members started performing together on a regular basis. Eventually, she rejoined the ensemble. Andersson and Ulvaeus were busy producing other artists, but soon discovered the qualities of Lyngstad&#x27;s and Fältskog&#x27;s voices combined; thus, the band was formed initially as Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid, later renamed ABBA.

Possessing a wide mezzo-soprano vocal range, that covers C#3 to Eb6, Lyngstad sang solo parts in the following ABBA songs: &quot;Andante, Andante&quot;, &quot;Bumblebee&quot;, &quot;Cassandra&quot;, &quot;Fernando&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gonna Sing You My Lovesong&quot;, &quot;I Am the City&quot;, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot;, &quot;I Let the Music Speak&quot;, &quot;On Top of Old Smokey&quot;, &quot;I Still Have Faith in You&quot;, &quot;I Wonder (Departure)&quot;, &quot;The King Has Lost His Crown&quot;, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot;, &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;, &quot;Lovers (Live a Little Longer)&quot;, &quot;Me and Bobby and Bobby&#x27;s Brother&quot;, &quot;Me and I&quot;, &quot;Money, Money, Money&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;No Doubt About It&quot;, &quot;One Man, One Woman&quot;, &quot;Our Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Put On Your White Sombrero&quot;, &quot;Should I Laugh or Cry&quot;, &quot;Super Trouper&quot;, &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot;, &quot;The Visitors&quot;, &quot;The Way Old Friends Do&quot; and &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot;.

Lyngstad clearly enjoyed the spotlight more than the other three members of ABBA. She liked to tour and to meet audience members one-to-one. She took an active part in co-designing the famed ABBA costumes for their tours and TV performances. After the members of ABBA went their separate ways, Lyngstad was the only one who openly regretted there had never been a reunion, until ABBA got back together in 2017.

Her next solo album, in Swedish, was &quot;Frida ensam&quot; (&quot;Frida Alone&quot;), released in 1975 during the ABBA years, and produced by Andersson. This album includes her successful Swedish version of &quot;Fernando&quot;, which stayed at the No. 1 spot in the Svensktoppen radio charts for 9 weeks, but was never released as a single. The album was recorded between sessions of the ABBA albums &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;ABBA&quot;. Because of the activities of the group, the album took 18 months to record. &quot;Frida ensam&quot; became an enormous commercial and critical success in Sweden, topping the Swedish album charts for six weeks and remaining in the charts for 38. The album was mostly a collection of covers of songs by artists such as the Beach Boys (&quot;&quot;Skulle de&#x27; va&#x27; skönt&quot;), 10cc (&quot;Guld och gröna ängar&quot;) and David Bowie (&quot;Liv på Mars?&quot;&quot;), receiving positive reviews from &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;The album portrays Frida as a very strong and emotive singer and shows the true value of the music, that if sung properly and with enough feeling it transcends all language barriers&quot;. This album eventually went platinum.
===1982–1984: International solo career===

In 1982, during ABBA&#x27;s last year as a working band, Frida recorded and released her first post-ABBA solo album. This was also her first solo album in English. The Phil Collins-produced album called &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot; became a big success for Frida worldwide. A much rockier sound was found on many of the songs and Phil Collins&#x27; drum sound had a major contribution, particularly on the lead single, &quot;I Know There&#x27;s Something Going On&quot;, which topped the charts in Belgium and Switzerland, and was a top 5 hit in Australia, Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa and Sweden among others. With the song and video being heavily promoted and played on MTV, the single also proved successful in the United States, reaching No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (and No. 9 on &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;) in March 1983, and was the 20th-biggest-selling single in the US that year. In the UK, the track was not a big hit, only reaching No. 43.

The album itself received good reviews, with &quot;Billboard&quot; writing: &quot;ABBA&#x27;s auburn-haired songstress makes a bold solo project a stunning success&quot;, while Mark Coleman described the album in the third edition of &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; as &quot;a sharp, rock-oriented, delightfully eclectic album&quot;. William Cooper had a similar opinion in AllMusic: &quot;Frida escapes the creative limitations of being a member of one of the world&#x27;s most popular groups on this solid and often riveting album&quot;. Swedish Television SVT documented this historical event by filming the whole recording process. The result became a one-hour TV documentary, including interviews with Frida and Phil, Björn and Benny, as well as all the musicians involved with the album. Owing to the success of the album (selling 1.5 million copies worldwide), and its lead single, Frida was voted &quot;Best Female Artist Of The Year&quot; 1982, by the readers of Sweden&#x27;s biggest evening paper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, receiving the Swedish Music Award Price Rockbjörnen.

In 1983, Lyngstad assisted with &quot;Abbacadabra&quot;, and recorded one of the tracks with two different male vocalists in different languages, including the French star Daniel Balavoine on the track &quot;Belle&quot; and on the English version &quot;Time&quot; with B. A. Robertson produced by Mike Batt. This track was a cover of &quot;Arrival&quot;, an instrumental track from the ABBA album of the same name. She also jumps in and does the female recitation towards the end of the song &quot;Strip&quot; on the &quot;Strip&quot; album by Adam Ant, who was recording his album at Polar Studios in Stockholm.

Lyngstad&#x27;s next album was &quot;Shine&quot; (1984). This album was recorded at Studios De La Grande Armée in Paris and produced by Steve Lillywhite. Lillywhite was only 29 when this album was recorded; he gave Lyngstad a very experimental sound and managed to create a relaxed atmosphere in the studio. The album had much less success than hoped, though it reached the Top 20 in many European countries, No. 6 in Sweden being its highest position.

===1985–2004: Later career===
In 1987, Lyngstad was in the choir for the recording of her former husband Benny Andersson&#x27;s song &quot;&quot;Klinga Mina Klockor&quot;. Also in 1987, Lyngstad recorded the single &quot;Så Länge Vi Har Varann&quot;&quot; (&quot;As Long As We Have Each Other&quot;) with the Swedish pop group Ratata, one of Lyngstad&#x27;s favourites. She was contacted by singer Mauro Scocco, who mentioned that he had a song suitable for a duet. After hearing it, Lyngstad accepted immediately. The song achieved great success in Sweden, and was also recorded in English under the title of &quot;As long as I have you&quot;. An English-language video of the song was produced, although an Australian release of this song on Festival Records in January 1998 was eventually shelved.

In 1990, Lyngstad became a member of the committee of the Swedish environmental organization &quot;Det Naturliga Steget&quot; (&quot;The Natural Step&quot;). The organization wanted a &quot;famous face&quot; to help them reach the public, and in 1991 she became chairwoman for the organization &quot;Artister För Miljö&quot; (&quot;Artists for the Environment&quot;). In 1992, Lyngstad founded her Children and Environment Foundation which runs summer camps for underprivileged children. Also in 1992, Lyngstad performed live at the Stockholm Water Festival at the Kings Castle and released the environmental charity single with her cover of Julian Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Saltwater&quot;. All the royalties from this single went to charity. In 1993, on Queen Silvia&#x27;s 50th birthday, Frida was asked to perform &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; on stage, as performed by ABBA when the king and queen married in 1976. Frida contacted The Real Group and together they performed the song at the Stockholm Opera House in front of the king and queen. This performance was filmed by Swedish TV and can be seen in &quot;&quot;.

In 1996, Lyngstad recorded her Swedish language album &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; (&quot;Deep Breaths&quot;). It was a long-awaited album as 12 years had passed since &quot;Shine&quot; was released. The album attracted overall relatively positive reviews and was a success in Sweden where it reached No. 1 on the album chart. Frida did many TV appearances in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland to promote the album. &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; was one of the first Swedish albums to be released as a combined audio-video CD-ROM, including interviews with Lyngstad, footage from the making of the album, as well as promotional videos. Despite the fact that &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; was officially only released in Scandinavia and the songs were entirely sung in Swedish, a remix album of the single tracks &quot;&quot;Även en blomma&quot;, &quot;Alla Mina Bästa År&quot; (a duet with Roxette&#x27;s Marie Fredriksson) and &quot;Ögonen&quot;&quot; was released in Germany in 1998, entitled &quot;Frida – The Mixes&quot;. Despite the success of the album, none of these singles made a big impression on the Swedish charts. A one-hour documentary about the making of this album, both in the studio and from Frida&#x27;s home in Mallorca, Spain, can be seen in &quot;Frida: The DVD&quot;. A follow-up album with producer Anders Glenmark was reportedly in the works, but was shelved because of the death of Frida&#x27;s daughter in 1998. Lyngstad dedicated the song &quot;Chemistry Tonight&quot; (co-written by Kirsty MacColl) to the songwriter after MacColl&#x27;s death in 2000.

A few low key and one-off recordings followed, including a 2002 duet with opera singer Filippa Giordano of the &quot;Barcarolle&quot; from Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffman&quot; as well as the song &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot;, written by former Deep Purple member Jon Lord, and recorded in 2004. &quot;Barcarolle&quot; is only available on the Japanese edition of Giordano&#x27;s album &quot;Rosso Amore&quot; and &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot; can be found on Jon Lord&#x27;s album &quot;Beyond The Notes&quot; (although a limited-promotional single had been made available). Lord and Lyngstad made several TV appearances in Germany performing the song, on shows like &quot;The Sunday Night Classics&quot; and &quot;The Golden Henne Gala&quot;. Lyngstad also joined Lord on stage singing the song during his European autumn tour in 2004. During this tour, she also performed &quot;In the Bleak Midwinter&quot;, a performance of which can be found on social media.

For the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest, staged in Istanbul thirty years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, Lyngstad appeared in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video&quot;. All four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did the singer Cher and British comedian Rik Mayall among others. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release on the Universal Music label. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split in 1982 although they each filmed their appearances separately. Also in 2004, Lyngstad appeared with former bandmates Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus in London at the fifth-anniversary performance of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, the musical based on ABBA songs. In 2008, she joined all three of her former ABBA colleagues at the Swedish premiere of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; at the arena Cirkus in Stockholm.

===2005–present: Hiatus from music, selected public appearances and ABBA reunion===

On 15 November 2005, to celebrate Lyngstad&#x27;s 60th birthday, Universal Records released the box set &quot;&quot;, consisting of all the solo albums she recorded for Polar Music and Anderson Records, including a set of bonus tracks. Also included was &quot;&quot;, a 3.5-hour documentary where Lyngstad talks about her entire career in the music business. Filmed in the Swiss Alps, she talks about her singing technique and about her career both before and after ABBA, and explains how songs were performed and recorded. In collaboration with Swedish TV, SVT, the film included many clips from her early television performances, such as her first TV performance with &quot;En ledig dag&quot; (&quot;A Day Off&quot;). Also included are TV documentaries about the making and recordings of &quot;Something&#x27;s Going On&quot; and &quot;Djupa andetag&quot; (&quot;Deep Breaths&quot;).

In 2007, Lyngstad became one of the initial patrons of the Zermatt Unplugged Music Festival along with Jon Lord and Claude Nobs. 

In September 2010, a new album by musician Georg Wadenius titled &quot;Reconnection&quot; was released. Lyngstad and Wadenius had discussed working together for many years, as they had long been good friends. The album opens with her rendition of the traditional tune &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;, previously covered by Cat Stevens. This song is a favourite for Frida and the song was also on the playlist in the church for Frida and Prince Ruzzo&#x27;s wedding on 26 August 1992.

On 16 February 2011, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute play featuring Lyngstad and the play&#x27;s writer, long-term fan and performer Christopher Green. The play, &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;, was billed as &quot;a story about love. The unconditional love of a devoted fan ... about a real and an imagined intimacy.&quot; It was a project several years in the making; what started as an upbeat reflection on fame and being a fan developed into a meditation on the communication between two people and coping with the blows life deals. In an interview, she and Green talked about her long recovery following the death of her husband in 1999. The play is reflective but with a comic sensibility. Lyngstad stated in 2004 that she never intended to return to the music industry, although this was short-lived, and future studio albums were discussed in 2010.

In 2013, she helped organise the opening of ABBA The Museum in Stockholm stating she wanted to &quot;let ABBA rest&quot;. The long-awaited ABBA reunion was expected to happen in 2014 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the group&#x27;s win at the Eurovision Song Contest. However, this did not happen. In 2015, Lyngstad, along with Dan Daniell, released the single &quot;1865&quot; about the Matterhorn in Switzerland.

On 19 August 2017, Lyngstad travelled to Torshälla to claim her award from the Eskilstuna Music Prize 2014.

In the summer of 2017, Lyngstad joined her ABBA bandmates Agnetha Faltskög, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to record two new songs, &quot;I Still Have Faith in You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shut Me Down&quot;. These songs were meant to be part of an ABBA-themed TV special that was eventually discarded and replaced by the more ambitious, digital-laden &quot;Voyage&quot; show. 

In 2018, Lyngstad and jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval released a duet of the ABBA song &quot;Andante, Andante&quot; as a single. The song is featured on Sandoval&#x27;s album &quot;Ultimate Duets&quot;.

On 2 September 2021, via YouTube livestream, ABBA announced their upcoming virtual concert residency &quot;ABBA Voyage&quot;, as well as the imminent release of an eponymous album, recorded between 2017 and 2021. The new record, their first studio album in 40 years, features ten tracks, including &quot;I Still Have Faith In You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shut Me Down&quot;, which also were first shown in the aforementioned livestream event and released as a double A-side single. On 5 November 2021, the &quot;Voyage&quot; album was released worldwide. On 27 May 2022, ABBA Voyage opened in a purpose-built venue named the ABBA Arena at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London.

==Personal life==
On 3 April 1964, 18-year-old Lyngstad married salesman and fellow musician Ragnar Fredriksson. They had two children. They separated in 1968 and were divorced on 19 May 1970.

In 1969, Lyngstad met Benny Andersson. By 1971, they were living together, but did not marry until 6 October 1978, during the height of ABBA&#x27;s success. However, after only two years of marriage, they separated in November 1980 and were divorced in 1981.

In 1982, Lyngstad left Sweden and moved to London. In 1986, she relocated to Switzerland, and lived with her boyfriend, landscape architect Heinrich Ruzzo Prinz Reuss von Plauen (1950–1999), member of an ancient German House of Reuss, in his family castle in Fribourg. The couple married on 26 August 1992. He died from lymphoma in 1999.

In 1989, Lyngstad became a grandmother when her daughter, Ann Lise-Lotte, had a son, Jonathan Casper. Jonathan died in 2023 from stomach cancer.

Through her marriage to Reuss von Plauen, who had been a student at the same boarding school as Crown Prince Carl Gustaf (later King of Sweden), Lyngstad became acquainted with the Swedish royal family and eventually became close friends with Sweden&#x27;s Queen Silvia.

On 13 January 1998, Lyngstad&#x27;s 30-year-old daughter Ann Lise-Lotte Fredriksson Casper died of injuries sustained in a car accident in the United States in Livonia, New York.

Since 2007 she has been in a relationship with British peer Henry Smith, 5th Viscount Hambleden, with whom she lives in Genolier, Switzerland.

===Other interests===
According to Dagens Nyheter and Sveriges Radio, Lyngstad has supported the Swedish Moderate Party. She appeared in a Swedish Employers Association advertisement, &quot;Satsa på dig själv&quot; (&quot;Invest in yourself&quot;), in 1979, which caused controversy and objections from the left, especially from Mikael Wiehe, who rejected her offer to record a cover version of his song &quot;Flickan och kråkan&quot;, because of political differences, in the 1980s.

Lyngstad is a vegetarian and a feminist. She remains involved in charity work. She is interested in environmental issues.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1964, Lyngstad won a national singing contest Flugan (The Fly) and was awarded &quot;Vocalist of the Year&quot;. In September 1967, Lyngstad won the Barnens Dag contest held at Skansen, Stockholm. This led to her TV debut and a recording contract with EMI. In 1982, Lyngstad won the Swedish music prize Rockbjörnen for &quot;Best Female Artist&quot;. She was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ABBA in 2010, and she represented the group in their acceptance speech, along with Benny Andersson. In 2014, she was awarded with the Eskilstuna Music Prize for her &quot;pioneering career&quot; and significant contribution to popular music as an &quot;icon&quot; who had &quot;left an indelible imprint in musical history&quot;.

On 21 March 2024, all four members of ABBA were appointed &quot;Commander, First Class, of the Royal Order of Vasa&quot; by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. This was the first time that the Swedish Royal Orders of Knighthood had been bestowed after almost 50 years of dormancy. It was also the 50th anniversary of ABBA winning the Eurovision Song Contest. The group members shared the honour with nine other people.
