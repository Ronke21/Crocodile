<text>Now, Voyager is a 1942 American drama film starring Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains, and directed by Irving Rapper. The screenplay by Casey Robinson is based on the 1941 novel of the same name by Olive Higgins Prouty.

Prouty borrowed her title from the Walt Whitman poem &quot;The Untold Want,&quot; which reads in its entirety,
In 2007, &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film ranks number 23 on &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years ... 100 Passions&quot;, a list of the top love stories in American cinema. Film critic Steven Jay Schneider suggests the film continues to be remembered for not only its star power, but also the &quot;emotional crescendos&quot; engendered in the storyline.
==Plot==
Charlotte Vale is a drab, quiet, overweight, neurotic woman whose life is brutally dominated by her mother, an aristocratic Boston dowager whose verbal and emotional abuse of her daughter has contributed to Charlotte&#x27;s complete lack of self-confidence. Mrs. Vale had already brought up three sons, and Charlotte was an unwanted child born to her late in life. Fearing that Charlotte is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, her sister-in-law Lisa introduces her to psychiatrist Dr. Jaquith, who recommends that Charlotte spend time in his sanitarium.

Away from her mother&#x27;s control, Charlotte blossoms, and at Lisa&#x27;s urging, the slim, transformed woman — with a chic borrowed wardrobe — opts to take a lengthy cruise instead of going home immediately. Initially Charlotte is too shy to mix with the other passengers on the ship. On an excursion, Charlotte is asked to share a carriage ride with Jeremiah Duvaux Durrance, a married man traveling on business, who asks Charlotte to help select presents for his female relatives. She obliges and they become friendly, with Jerry discussing his young daughter Tina’s shyness. Charlotte shows him a picture of her family, with herself appearing “as the fat lady with glasses” before her transformation. Jerry is sympathetic to her fledgling and frail confidence, expressing his admiration for her. Jerry runs into his friends Deb and Frank McIntyre and introduces Charlotte to them. From them, Charlotte learns how Jerry&#x27;s devotion to his young daughter Tina keeps him from divorcing his wife, a manipulative, jealous woman who does not love Tina and hinders Jerry&#x27;s chosen career of architecture.

On an excursion from the ship in Rio de Janeiro, Charlotte and Jerry are stranded on Sugarloaf Mountain when their car crashes. Spending the night together while their driver goes for help, Jerry and Charlotte cuddle together for warmth, the dialogue says. They miss the ship and spend five days together before Charlotte flies to Buenos Aires to rejoin the cruise. Although they have fallen in love, they decide it would be best not to see each other again.
When she disembarks from the ship, Charlotte&#x27;s family is stunned by the dramatic changes in her appearance and demeanor. The awkward and shy Charlotte has become popular among the passengers, with many making fond farewells. At home, her mother is determined to subjugate her daughter once again, but Charlotte is resolved to remain independent. The memory of Jerry&#x27;s love and devotion — as evidenced in the timely arrival of a corsage of Camellias — helps give her the strength she needs to remain resolute.

Charlotte becomes engaged to wealthy, well-connected widower Elliot Livingston, but by chance she again encounters Jerry at a party for an acquaintance who is his client. Though Jerry congratulates her, Charlotte realizes she does not love Elliot enough and subsequently breaks the engagement. During a quarrel with her mother over the broken engagement, Charlotte says she did not ask to be born, that her mother never wanted her, and it has &quot;been a calamity on both sides.&quot; Mrs. Vale has a heart attack and dies. Guilty and distraught, Charlotte returns to the sanitarium.

Charlotte is immediately diverted from her problems when she meets Jerry&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter Tina, who has been sent to Dr. Jaquith by her father on Charlotte&#x27;s recommendation. Tina greatly reminds Charlotte of herself; both were unwanted and unloved by their mothers. Shaken from her depression, Charlotte becomes interested in Tina&#x27;s welfare, and with Dr. Jaquith&#x27;s permission, Charlotte takes her under her wing. When the girl improves, Charlotte takes her home to Boston.

Jerry and Dr. Jaquith visit the Vale home to discuss a project where Jerry is the architect for a new psychiatric wing donated by Charlotte. Jerry is delighted to see the change in his daughter. Dr. Jaquith has allowed Charlotte to keep Tina there, provided her relationship with Jerry remains platonic. Charlotte tells Jerry she sees Tina as his gift to her and her way of being close to him. When Jerry asks her if she is happy, she replies: &quot;Oh, Jerry, don&#x27;t let&#x27;s ask for the Moon. We have the stars.&quot;

==Production==
Filming ran from April 7 to June 23 of 1942 as producer Hal B. Wallis made &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; his first independent production at Warner Bros. under a new arrangement with the studio. He took an active role in the production, including casting decisions. The initial choices for Charlotte were Irene Dunne, Norma Shearer, and Ginger Rogers. When Bette Davis learned about the project, she campaigned for and won the role. More than any other of her previous films, Davis became absorbed in the role, not only reading the original novel, but also becoming involved in details such as choosing her wardrobe personally. Consulting with designer Orry-Kelly, she suggested a drab outfit, including an ugly foulard dress for Charlotte initially, to contrast with the stylish, &quot;timeless&quot; creations that mark her later appearance on the cruise ship.

The choice of Davis&#x27;s leading men became important, as well. Davis was aghast at the initial costume and makeup tests of Austrian actor Paul Henreid; she thought the &quot;slicked back&quot; gigolo-like appearance made him look &quot;just like Valentino.&quot; Henreid was similarly uncomfortable with the brilliantine image, and when Davis insisted on another screen test with a more natural hairstyle, he was finally accepted as the choice for her screen lover. In her 1987 memoir, &quot;This &#x27;N That&quot;, Davis revealed that co-star Claude Rains (with whom she also shared the screen in &quot;Juarez&quot;, &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot;, and &quot;Deception&quot;) was her favorite co-star. She remained close friends with both Henreid and Rains for the rest of her life.

Initial production of the Prouty novel had to take into account that European locales would not be possible in the midst of World War II, despite the novelist&#x27;s insistence on using Italy as the main setting. Prouty&#x27;s quirky demands for vibrant colors and flashbacks shot in black and white with subtitles were similarly disregarded. Principal photography was shifted to Warner&#x27;s sound stage 18 and various locations around California, including the San Bernardino National Forest, while European scenes were replaced by stock footage of Brazil. One of the primary reasons for Davis being interested in the original project was that photography would also take place in her hometown of Boston. Other locations of filming include Harvard Medical School in Roxbury, Massachusetts, Laguna Beach, Whitley Avenue, and other streets around Boston.

The film highlighted Davis&#x27;s ability to shape her future artistic ventures, as not only did she have a significant role in influencing the decisions over her co-stars, but also the choice of director was predicated on a need to have a compliant individual at the helm. Davis previously had worked with Irving Rapper on films where he served as a dialogue director, but his gratitude for her support turned into a grudging realization that Davis could control the film. Although his approach was conciliatory, the to-and-fro with Davis slowed production and &quot;he would go home evenings angry and exhausted&quot;. The dailies, however, showed a &quot;surprisingly effective&quot; Davis at the top of her form.

For years, Davis and co-star Paul Henreid claimed the moment in which Jerry puts two cigarettes in his mouth, lights both, then passes one to Charlotte, was developed by them during rehearsals, inspired by a habit Henreid shared with his wife, but drafts of Casey Robinson&#x27;s script on file at the University of Southern California indicate it was included by the screenwriter in his original script. The scene remained an indelible trademark that Davis would later exploit as &quot;hers&quot;.

==Box office==
According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,130,000 domestically and $2,047,000 foreign.

==Critical reception==
Theodore Strauss, a critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, observed:
David Lardner of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; offered a similar opinion, writing that for most of the film, Davis &quot;just plods along with the plot, which is longish and a little out of proportion to its intellectual content.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;, however, wrote a more positive review, calling it the kind of drama that maintains Warner&#x27;s pattern for box-office success ... Hal Wallis hasn&#x27;t spared the purse-strings on this production. It has all the earmarks of money spent wisely. Irving Rapper&#x27;s direction has made the picture move along briskly, and the cast, down to the most remote performer, has contributed grade A portrayals. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;intelligently directed&quot; and praised Davis&#x27; performance as &quot;outstanding&quot;, but warned that the film&#x27;s &quot;slow-paced action and its none-too-cheerful atmosphere make it hardly suitable entertainment for the masses.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell wrote in &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot;: &quot;A basically soggy script gets by, and how, through the romantic magic of its stars, who were all at their best; and suffering in mink went over very big in wartime.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
==Source material==
Olive Higgins Prouty&#x27;s novel, written in 1941, served as the basis for the film, and other than certain limitations imposed by World War II on the locations for filming, the movie remains fairly true to the novel.

The novel is considered to be one of the first, if not the first, fictional depictions of psychotherapy, which is depicted fairly realistically for the time, as Prouty herself spent time in a sanitarium following a mental breakdown in 1925. This was caused by the death of one of her daughters and proved to be a defining period in her professional life as a writer, as the experience she gained from this episode helped her write not only &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, but also her 1927 novel &quot;Conflict&quot;, both of which have similar themes of recovery following a breakdown. Prouty also used this experience to help others in her life who were experiencing mental health issues, including her close friend Sylvia Plath, who was supported both financially and emotionally by Prouty following a suicide attempt in 1953.

The novel is the third in a pentalogy centered on the fictional Vale family, and by far the most popular. The other titles are &quot;The White Fawn&quot; (1931), &quot;Lisa Vale&quot; (1938), &quot;Home Port&quot; (1947), and &quot;Fabia&quot; (1951). The other novels in the series do not feature mental health as centrally as &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, but themes and certain elements appear throughout. Many characters appear in multiple novels.

<doc id="180997" wikidata="Q233854" url="?curid=180997" title="Rosalind Russell">
<text>Catherine Rosalind Russell (June 4, 1907November 28, 1976) was an American actress, model, comedian, screenwriter, and singer, known for her role as fast-talking newspaper reporter Hildy Johnson in the Howard Hawks screwball comedy &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), opposite Cary Grant, as well as for her portrayals of Mame Dennis in the 1956 stage and 1958 film adaptations of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, and Rose in &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962). A noted comedienne, she received various accolades, including five Golden Globe Awards and a Tony Award, in addition to nominations for four Academy Awards and a BAFTA Award. Russell has been honoured with a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1973 and Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 1975.

In addition to her comedic roles, Russell was known for playing dramatic characters, often wealthy, dignified, and stylish women. She was one of the few actresses of her time to portray women in professional roles such as judges, reporters, and psychiatrists. Russell&#x27;s career spanned from the 1930s to the 1970s and she attributed this longevity to the fact that, although she had many glamorous roles, she never became a sex symbol.

==Early years==
Catherine Rosalind Russell was one of seven children born in Waterbury, Connecticut, to James Edward, a lawyer, and Clara A. Russell (née McKnight), a teacher. The Russells were an Irish-American, Catholic family. She was named after a ship on which her parents had traveled. Russell attended Catholic schools, including the women&#x27;s-only Rosemont College in Rosemont, Pennsylvania and Marymount College in Tarrytown, New York. She then attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. Her parents thought Russell was studying to become a teacher and were unaware that she was planning to become an actress. Upon graduation from the performing arts school, Russell acted in summer stock and joined a repertory company in Boston.

==Career==
===Early career===
Russell began her career as a fashion model and was in many Broadway shows. Against parental objections, she took a job with a stock company for seven months at Saranac Lake, New York, and then Hartford, Connecticut. Afterwards, she moved to Boston, where she acted for a year with a theater group run by Edward E. Clive. Later, she appeared in a revue in New York (&quot;The Garrick Gaieties&quot;). There, she took voice lessons and had a brief career in opera, which was cut short because she had difficulty reaching high notes.

In the early 1930s, Russell went to Los Angeles, where she was hired as a contract player for Universal Studios. When she first arrived on the lot, she was ignored by most of the crew and later told the press she felt terrible and humiliated at Universal, which affected her self-confidence. Unhappy with Universal&#x27;s leadership, and second-class studio status at the time, Russell set her sights on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and was able to get out of her Universal contract on her own terms. When MGM first approached her for a screen test, Russell was wary, remembering her experience at Universal. However, when she met MGM&#x27;s Benny Thau and Ben Piazza, she was surprised; they were &quot;the soul of understanding&quot;. Her screen test was directed by Harold S. Bucquet, and she later recalled that she was hired because of a closeup he took of her.

Under contract to MGM, Russell debuted in &quot;Evelyn Prentice&quot; (1934). Although the role was small, she received good notices, with one critic saying that she was &quot;convincing as the woman scorned&quot;. She starred in many comedies such as &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot; (1934) and &quot;Four&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1938), as well as dramas, including &quot;Craig&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1936) (the second of three film adaptations of the play of the same name; Joan Crawford starred in the third) and &quot;The Citadel&quot; (1938). Russell was acclaimed when she co-starred with Robert Young in the MGM drama &quot;West Point of the Air&quot; (1935). One critic wrote: &quot;Rosalind Russell as the &#x27;other woman&#x27; in the story gives an intelligent and deft handling to her scenes with Young.&quot; She quickly rose to fame, and by 1935, was seen as a replacement for actress Myrna Loy, as she took many roles for which Loy was initially set.

In her first years in Hollywood, Russell was characterized, both in her personal life and film career, as a sophisticated &quot;lady&quot;. This dissatisfied Russell, who said in a 1936 interview:

Being typed as a lady is the greatest misfortune possible to a motion picture actress. It limits your characterizations, confines you to play feminine sops and menaces and the public never highly approves of either. An impeccably dressed lady is always viewed with suspicion in real life and when you strut onto the screen with beautiful clothes and charming manners, the most naive of theatergoers senses immediately that you are in a position to do the hero no good. I earnestly want to get away from this. First, because I want to improve my career and professional life and, secondly because I am tired of being a clothes horse – a sort of hothouse orchid in a stand of wild flowers.

Russell approached director Frank Lloyd for help changing her image, but instead, Lloyd cast her as a wealthy aristocrat in &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936). She was then cast as catty gossip Sylvia Fowler in the comedy &quot;The Women&quot; (1939), directed by George Cukor. The film was a major hit, boosting Russell&#x27;s career and establishing her reputation as a comedienne.
Russell continued to display her talent for comedy in the classic screwball comedy &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940), directed by Howard Hawks. In the film, a reworking of Ben Hecht&#x27;s story &quot;The Front Page&quot;, Russell plays quick-witted ace reporter Hildy Johnson, who was also the ex-wife of her newspaper editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Russell had been, as she put it, &quot;Everyone&#x27;s fifteenth choice&quot; for the role of Hildy in the film. Before her being cast, Howard Hawks had asked Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Claudette Colbert, Jean Arthur, Margaret Sullavan, and Ginger Rogers if they would like to play the brash, fast-talking reporter in his film. All of them refused. Russell found out about this while riding on a train to New York, when she read an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating that she had been cast in the film and listing all the actresses who had turned down the part.

===Later career===
In the early 1940s, Russell starred in the rom-coms &quot;The Feminine Touch&quot; (1941) and &quot;Take a Letter, Darling&quot; (1942). In Alexander Hall&#x27;s comedy film &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot; (1942), she played older sister Ruth Sherwood. She received her first Academy Award nomination for &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;. She then starred in &quot;Sister Kenny&quot; (1946), portraying real-life Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian bush nurse who fought to help polio victims. She won her first Golden Globe and received her second Academy Award nomination. In &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1947), she plays a young New Englander who exacts vengeance after the murder of her father. She won her second Golden Globe and got her third Academy Award nomination; she was highly favored to win, to the point that Russell actually began to rise from her seat just before the winner&#x27;s name was called. However, it was Loretta Young, and not Russell, who was named Best Actress, for her performance in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. She followed up with the murder mystery &quot;The Velvet Touch&quot; (1948).

Russell scored a big hit on Broadway with her Tony Award-winning performance in the musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), a musical version of her successful film of a decade earlier, &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;. Russell reprised her starring role for a 1958 television special.

Perhaps her most memorable performance was in the title role of the long-running stage comedy &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; (based on a Patrick Dennis novel) as well as the 1958 film version, in which she played an eccentric aunt whose orphaned nephew comes to live with her. When asked with which role she was most closely identified, she replied that strangers who spotted her still called out, &quot;Hey, Auntie Mame!&quot;. For the film version, she won the Laurel Award for Top Female Comedy Performance and her third Golden Globe, and received her first BAFTA nomination and fourth Academy Award nomination. For the stage version, she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Patrick Dennis dedicated his second &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; novel, &quot;Around the World with Auntie Mame,&quot; to &quot;the one and only Rosalind Russell&quot; in 1958.

She continued to appear in movies through the mid-1960s, including &quot;Picnic&quot; (1955), &quot;A Majority of One&quot; (1961), &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; (1962), &quot;Gypsy&quot; (1962; winning her fifth Golden Globe), &quot;The Trouble with Angels&quot; (1966), and its sequel &quot;Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows&quot; (1968). Russell was the logical choice for reprising her role as Auntie Mame when the musical version &quot;Mame&quot; was set for a production on Broadway in 1966, but she declined for health reasons.

In addition to her acting career, Russell (under the name C.A. McKnight) also wrote the story for the film &quot;The Unguarded Moment&quot; (1956), a story of sexual harassment starring Esther Williams. Russell used the pen name C.A. McKnight again in 1971, when she was credited as screenwriter for adapting the novel &quot;The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax&quot; into the screenplay for &quot;Mrs. Pollifax-Spy&quot;, in which she also starred. It was Russell&#x27;s last big screen role.

===Awards and nominations===
In 1972, Russell received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. She also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Russell is honored at the Rosalind Russell Medical Research Center for Arthritis. Her portrait and a description of her work hang in the lobby, as Congress made a grant in 1979 to establish the research center, in honor of her Congressional appointment to the National Commission on Arthritis.

==Personal life==
On October 25, 1941, Russell married Danish-American producer Frederick Brisson (1912–1984), son of actor Carl Brisson. Cary Grant was responsible for the couple having met and was the best man at Frederick and Rosalind&#x27;s wedding. Brisson had been traveling from England to the United States by ship in 1939, and &quot;The Women&quot; was playing on an endless loop during the voyage. After hearing the audio for the film day after day while traveling, Brisson decided he had better sit down and watch the whole film. He became so enamored with Russell&#x27;s performance as Sylvia Fowler that he turned to his friends and proclaimed: &quot;I&#x27;m either gonna kill that girl, or I&#x27;m gonna marry her.&quot;

Brisson stayed with Cary Grant in his guest house while Grant was filming &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;. Upon hearing that Grant was making the movie with Russell, Brisson asked his friend if he could meet her. Cary Grant then spent weeks greeting Russell each morning on set with the question &quot;Have you met Freddie Brisson?&quot; in an effort to pique the actress&#x27;s curiosity. One night, when Russell opened her door to let Grant in before they went dancing, as they often did, she found him standing next to a stranger. Grant sheepishly explained that the odd fellow was Freddie Brisson, the man whom he had mentioned so often, and they set off for dinner, with Freddie in tow.

Russell and Brisson were married for 35 years, until her death. They had one child in 1943, a son, Carl Lance Brisson.

Russell was a registered Republican who supported Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1960 presidential campaign.

Russell was a devout Catholic and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

==Death==

Russell died of breast cancer on November 28, 1976. She was survived by her husband and her son. She is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Russell has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the 1700 block of Vine Street.

Her autobiography &quot;Life Is a Banquet,&quot; written with Chris Chase, was published a year after her death. The foreword (written by her husband) states that Russell had a mental breakdown in 1943. She did not act in films in 1944. Details are scant, but the book indicates that health problems and the deaths of a sister and a brother were major factors leading to her breakdown. Russell had rheumatoid arthritis, and an arthritis research center at the University of California, San Francisco bears her name.

In 2009, the documentary film &quot;Life Is a Banquet: The Life of Rosalind Russell&quot;, narrated by Kathleen Turner, was shown at film festivals across the U.S. and on some PBS stations.

Shizuoka Prefecture borders Kanagawa Prefecture to the east, Yamanashi Prefecture to the northeast, Nagano Prefecture to the north, and Aichi Prefecture to the west.

Shizuoka is the capital and Hamamatsu is the largest city in Shizuoka Prefecture, with other major cities including Fuji, Numazu, and Iwata. Shizuoka Prefecture is located on Japan&#x27;s Pacific Ocean coast and features Suruga Bay formed by the Izu Peninsula, and Lake Hamana which is considered to be one of Japan&#x27;s largest lakes. Mount Fuji, the tallest volcano in Japan and cultural icon of the country, is partially located in Shizuoka Prefecture on the border with Yamanashi Prefecture. Shizuoka Prefecture has a significant motoring heritage as the founding location of Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha, and is home to the Fuji International Speedway.

== History ==

Shizuoka Prefecture was established from the former Tōtōmi, Suruga and Izu provinces.

The area was the home of the first Tokugawa shōgun. Tokugawa Ieyasu held the region until he conquered the lands of the Hōjō clan in the Kantō region and placed land under the stewardship of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After becoming &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa took the land back for his family and put the area around modern-day Shizuoka City under the direct supervision of the shogunate. With the creation of the Shizuoka han from the Sunpu Domain in 1868, it once again became the residence of the Tokugawa family.

== Geography ==
Shizuoka Prefecture is an elongated region following the coast of the Pacific Ocean at the Suruga Bay. In the west, the prefecture extends deep into the Japan Alps. In the east, it becomes a narrower coast bounded in the north by Mount Fuji, until it comes to the Izu Peninsula, a popular resort area pointing south into the Pacific.

<doc id="181004" wikidata="Q3273584" url="?curid=181004" title="My Sister Eileen">
<text>My Sister Eileen is a series of autobiographical short stories by Ruth McKenney, originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which eventually inspired many other works: her 1938 book &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, a play, a musical, a radio play (and an unproduced radio series), two motion pictures, and a CBS television series in the 1960–1961 season.

The stories center on two sisters from Ohio who are out to make successful careers while living in a basement apartment in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. Older, sensible Ruth aspires to be a writer, while Eileen dreams of success on the stage. A variety of oddball characters bring color and humor to their lives.

== Adaptations ==

===1940 play===
The stories were adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov. The Broadway production, directed by George S. Kaufman, opened on December 26, 1940 at the Biltmore Theatre and moved three times before finally completing its run of 864 performances on January 16, 1943. The opening night cast included Shirley Booth as Ruth and Jo Ann Sayers as Eileen, with Richard Quine and Morris Carnovsky in supporting roles.

Eileen McKenney, the inspiration for the title character, and her husband, novelist and screenwriter Nathanael West, were killed in a car accident in Southern California four days before the Broadway opening.

===1942 film===
Fields and Chodorov adapted their play for a 1942 film released by Columbia Pictures (their biggest hit of 1942/3). Alexander Hall directed a cast that includes Rosalind Russell as Ruth (in an Academy Award–nominated performance) and Janet Blair as Eileen, with Brian Aherne, George Tobias, Allyn Joslyn, Elizabeth Patterson, Grant Mitchell, Jeff Donnell, and Richard Quine in supporting roles.

===1946 radio play and unproduced radio series===
On May 18, 1946 Rosalind Russell and Janet Blair reprised their roles in a half-hour radio adaptation of the 1942 film for the CBS Radio anthology series &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot;. During the closing credits show announcer Hugh Brundage stated that a radio series based on the two main characters was being prepared by writer Arthur Kurlan. He added that it would star Lucille Ball and it would premiere in the fall. However CBS ultimately turned down the proposed series after only a sample audition record was made.

In 1947 CBS began airing a new radio series, &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;, which contained the same basic premise and characterizations. In response, Arthur Kurlan sued CBS on behalf of himself and Ruth McKenney, ultimately winning compensation from CBS.

===1953 Broadway musical===
&quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, music by Leonard Bernstein, and book by Fields and Chodorov, is a musical stage adaptation of the 1940 play, which was in turn based on McKenney&#x27;s stories. Rosalind Russell reprised the part of Ruth for the Broadway production and appeared in a CBS broadcast of the musical on November 30, 1958. It was revived on Broadway, starring Donna Murphy, in 2004.

===1955 film===
In 1955, Columbia made a film as a musical comedy with a score by Jule Styne and Leo Robin. Richard Quine and Blake Edwards wrote the screenplay, and Quine directed. The cast includes Betty Garrett as Ruth and Janet Leigh as Eileen, with Jack Lemmon, Bob Fosse (who choreographed the musical numbers), Kurt Kasznar, Dick York, Arnold Stang, and Tommy Rall in supporting roles.

===1960–1961 television series===
A pilot for a television series based on the short stories and subsequent film adaptations aired on NBC as an episode of &quot;Alcoa-Goodyear Theater&quot; titled &quot;You Should Meet My Sister&quot; on May 16, 1960, starring Elaine Stritch as Ruth and Anne Helm as Eileen. Twenty-six more episodes were produced with Stritch as Ruth and Shirley Bonne portraying Eileen, and CBS broadcast these in the United States during the 1960–1961 season as the situation comedy &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;. The series premiered on October 5, 1960. It was canceled after one season, and last aired on April 12, 1961.

<doc id="181005" wikidata="Q516390" url="?curid=181005" title="Robert Young (actor)">
<text>Robert George Young (February 22, 1907 – July 21, 1998) was an American film, television, and radio actor best known for his leading roles as Jim Anderson, the father character, in &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; (CBS, then NBC, then CBS again) and the physician Marcus Welby in &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (ABC). In 1978, Young produced a documentary that &quot;stressed the importance of motorcycle training for teenagers.&quot; This film earned him the 1979 BAFTA Award for Best Specialised Film.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, Young was the son of an Irish immigrant father, Thomas E. Young, and an American mother, Margaret Fyfe. While Young was a child, the family moved to various locations within the U.S., including Seattle as well as Los Angeles, where Young was a student at Abraham Lincoln High School. After graduation, he studied and performed at the Pasadena Playhouse while working and appearing in bit parts in silent films. While touring with a stock company producing &quot;The Ship&quot;, Young was discovered by a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer talent scout who signed the fledgling actor to a contract. Young made his sound-film debut for Fox Film Corporation in the 1931 Charlie Chan film &quot;Black Camel&quot;, starring Warner Oland.

==Film career==
Young appeared in over 100 films between 1928 and 1952. In spite of having a &quot;tier B&quot; status, he co-starred with some of the studio&#x27;s most illustrious actresses, such as Katharine Hepburn, Margaret Sullavan, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Luise Rainer, Hedy Lamarr, Helen Twelvetrees and (unrelated) Loretta Young. Yet most of his assignments consisted of short B movies, also known as &quot;programmers&quot;, which required brief two- to three-week shooting schedules. Actors who were relegated to such hectic routines appeared, as Young did, in some six to eight movies per year.

As an MGM contract player, Young was obligated to accept any film assigned to him or risk being placed on suspension—and many actors who were placed on suspension were prohibited from earning a salary from any endeavor at all, even those unrelated to the film industry. In 1936, MGM summarily loaned Young to Gaumont British in the U.K. for two films; the first, &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, was directed by Alfred Hitchcock, while the other, &quot;It&#x27;s Love Again&quot;, co-starred Jessie Matthews. While in England, he was convinced that MGM intended to terminate his contract, but he was mistaken.

He unexpectedly received one of his most rewarding roles late in his MGM career, in &quot;H.M. Pulham, Esq.&quot; (1941), which also benefited from one of Hedy Lamarr&#x27;s most effective performances. He once remarked that he was assigned only those roles which Robert Montgomery and other A-list actors had rejected.

After his contract with MGM expired, Young starred in light comedies and dramas for studios such as 20th Century Fox, United Artists, and RKO Radio Pictures. From 1943, Young had more challenging roles in films like &quot;Claudia&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Cottage&quot;, &quot;They Won&#x27;t Believe Me&quot;, &quot;The Second Woman&quot;, and &quot;Crossfire&quot;. His portrayals of unsympathetic characters in several of these later films—which had seldom been the case in his MGM pictures—were applauded by numerous critics. In 1949, he returned to MGM briefly to appear in &quot;That Forsyte Woman&quot; with Errol Flynn and Greer Garson. He played the second lead in &quot;Secret of the Incas&quot; (1954) starring Charlton Heston, the film upon which &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; was subsequently loosely based. Despite the picture&#x27;s superior quality while being shot on location at Machu Picchu, it was the last feature film in which he appeared. Young&#x27;s career had begun an incremental and almost imperceptible decline, despite a propitious beginning as a freelance actor without the nurturing of a major studio. He had continued starring as a leading man in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but only in mediocre films, and occasionally playing supporting roles in important films. Then, he subsequently disappeared from the silver screen—only to reappear, successfully, several years later on a much smaller one.

===Television career===
Today, Young is most remembered as the affable insurance salesman in the long-running popular sitcom &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; (1949–1954 on radio, 1954–1960 on television), for which he and his co-star Jane Wyatt won several Emmy Awards. Elinor Donahue (&quot;Betty&quot;), Billy Gray (&quot;Bud&quot;), and Lauren Chapin (&quot;Kathy&quot;) played the Anderson children in the television version.

Young then created, produced, and starred with Ford Rainey and Constance Moore in the nostalgic CBS comedy series &quot;Window on Main Street&quot; (1961–1962).

Young&#x27;s final television series was &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot; (1969–1976), co-starring a young James Brolin. This show earned an Emmy for Young, for best leading actor in a drama series.

He shared the stage on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; with Jimi Hendrix in September 1969.

Until 1982, he made numerous television commercials for Sanka coffee.

The popular phrase &quot;I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I play one on TV&quot; from a commercial for Vicks 44 cough medicine has been erroneously attributed to Young due to his &quot;Marcus Welby, MD&quot; fame. It was actually spoken by actor Chris Robinson and then by Peter Bergman during the 1980s.

==Personal life and death==
Young was married to Betty Henderson for 61 years from 1933 until her death in 1994. They had four daughters: Carol Proffitt, Barbara Beebe, Kathy Young, and Betty Lou Gleason. They also had six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

Despite his trademark portrayal of happy, well-adjusted characters, Young&#x27;s bitterness toward Hollywood casting practices never diminished, and he suffered from depression and alcoholism, culminating in a suicide attempt in January 1991. Later, he spoke candidly about his personal problems in an effort to encourage others to seek help. The Robert Young Community Mental Health Center is named after Young in honor of his work toward passage of the 708 Illinois Tax Referendum, which established a property tax to support mental health programs in his home state. The center started in Rock Island, Illinois, and now has sites in both Iowa and Illinois, as part of the Quad-City metropolitan area.

Young died of respiratory failure at his Westlake Village, California, home on July 21, 1998.

He has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; the stars are in the categories of film (located at 6933 Hollywood Blvd.), television (6358 Hollywood Blvd.), and radio (1660 Vine Street).

<text>Balhae, also rendered as Bohai, known by the name Bohea and called Jin (; ) was a multiethnic kingdom established in 698 by Dae Joyeong (Da Zuorong) and originally known as the Kingdom of Jin (震, Zhen) until 713 when its name was changed to Balhae. At its greatest extent it corresponded to what is today Northeast China, the northern half of the Korean Peninsula and the southeastern Russian Far East.

Balhae&#x27;s early history involved a rocky relationship with the Tang dynasty that saw military and political conflict, but by the end of the 8th century the relationship had become cordial and friendly. The Tang dynasty would eventually recognize Balhae as the &quot;Prosperous Country of the East&quot;. Numerous cultural and political exchanges were made. Balhae was conquered by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty in 926. Balhae survived as a distinct population group for another three centuries in the Liao and Jin dynasties before disappearing under Mongol rule.

The history surrounding the origin of the state, its ethnic composition, the modern cultural affiliation of the ruling dynasty, the reading of their names, and its borders are the subject of a historiographical dispute between Korea, China and Russia. Historical sources from both China and Korea have described Balhae&#x27;s founder, Dae Joyeong, as related to the Mohe people and Goguryeo.

==Name==
Balhae was founded in 698 by Dae Joyeong (Da Zuorong) under the name (진, Jin), read as &quot;tsyinH&quot; in Middle Chinese. The kingdom&#x27;s name was transcribed as in Chinese, with the same Middle Chinese reading as .

In 713, the Tang dynasty bestowed the ruler of Jin with the noble title &quot;Prince of Commandery of Bohai (Balhae)&quot; (渤海郡王). In 762, the Tang formally elevated Balhae to the status of a kingdom. The kingdom&#x27;s territories did not overlap with the Bohai Commandery. According to Jin Yufu, the Tang referred to the state as Mohe (Malgal, name of the ethnic group) until 713, and &quot;Balhae&quot; was possibly used as a different transcription of the same name. According to the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, the state was called Mohe before it received investiture from China and assumed the name Bohai. Linguists Karl Heinrich Menges and Roy Andrew Miller raised another theory, suggesting that the name Balhae had an underlying native name which was cognate to Manchu &quot;butha&quot; (&quot;hunting&quot;).

The transcriptions Bohai (Chinese pinyin romanization), Po-hai (Chinese Wade–Giles romanization), and Parhae (Korean McCune–Reischauer romanization) are also used in modern academia. Most Western-language scholarship have opted for Bohai except in the field of Korean studies; however, some scholars have chosen the Korean romanization to avoid a &quot;Chinese&quot; narrative spread by the usage of &quot;pinyin&quot; romanization. According to Pamela Kyle Crossley, neither Chinese or Korean transliterations can be correct. She chose to use modern Chinese transliteration &quot;to indicate that the only referent we have is Chinese characters&quot;. Jesse D. Sloane chose to use &quot;Parhae&quot; because it was not covered in depth in the state-mandated curriculum of China, but used Chinese romanization for all other terms related to Balhae that appeared in Chinese sources first. Neither Crossley or Sloane meant to depict Balhae as essentially Chinese but used Chinese romanization out of convenience and to acknowledge the transnational origins of Balhae discourse.

== History ==

===Origin===

In 696, Li Jinzhong (Wushang Khan) of the Khitans along with his brother-in-law Sun Wanrong rebelled against Tang (Wu Zetian&#x27;s Zhou Dynasty) hegemony, killed an abusive Tang commander, and attacked Hebei. Li died soon after and Sun succeeded him, only to be defeated by the Second Turkic Khaganate. The population of Yingzhou (營州, modern-day Chaoyang, Liaoning) fled eastward toward the Liao River during the turmoil. The Tang tried to appease Dae Jungsang (Da Zhongxiang) and Geolsa Biu (Qisi Biyu), two local leaders, by granting them the titles of Duke of Zhen (Jin) and Duke of Xu (Heo) respectively. Geolsa Biu rejected the offer but was soon defeated by a Tang force led by Li Kaigu, while Dae Jungsang fled with his followers but also died around the same time. Dae Jungsang&#x27;s son, Dae Joyeong (Da Zuorong), left the Liao River valley for Mt. Tianmen (in modern Jilin Province). There, he dealt a heavy defeat to the Tang forces at the Battle of Tianmenling (Cheonmunnyeong), after which he led his followers to set up a state. In 698, Dae Joyeong declared himself King of Zhen (Jin).

Another account of the events suggests that there was no rebellion at all, and the leader of the Sumo Mohe (Songmal Malgal) rendered assistance to the Tang by suppressing Khitan rebels. As a reward the Tang acknowledged the leader as the local hegemon of a semi-independent state.

In diplomatic communications between Silla and Jin, Silla attempted to confer investiture to Dae Joyeong with the title of a fifth rank official: &quot;Dae Achan&quot;. Silla conferred this mid-ranking investiture partially out of a sense of superiority, but also because Balhae was a relatively new kingdom whereas Silla had been centuries old. The people of Jin did not know the system of ranks used in Silla and thus accepted the title. After a while, Dae Joyeong realized the meaning of the title and sought to change Balhae&#x27;s international status. In 713 or 714, the Tang dynasty recognized Dae Joyeong as the &quot;Prince of Bohai (Balhae)&quot;, the name for the sea surrounding Liaodong and Shandong.

According to Alexander Kim, neither the Tang or Silla recognized Balhae as the successor of Goguryeo. The Tang considered it a dukedom while Silla considered it their vassal. South Korean historians such as Kim Eng Gug, however, believe that the Tang viewed Balhae as Goguryeo&#x27;s successor. Between 713 and 721, Silla constructed a northern wall to maintain active defences along the border. The Tang later recognized Balhae as a kingdom in 762 but Silla continued to view Balhae as a rebellious vassal. However, Kim Eun Gug argues that thus the &quot;bestowal of a fifth-rank position was an expression of Silla&#x27;s confidence, and such an exchange would have been unimaginable if Silla and Parhae were in a hostile relationship.&quot; After Tang recognition of Balhae as a kingdom, Balhae diplomatic missions to Japan began to refer to the Balhae ruler as descended from Heaven. Japanese officials criticized these letters, revised them, and limited diplomatic missions from Balhae. A royal epitaph and Buddhist scripture confirm this designation for the ruler of Balhae.

===Ethnic identity===
The ethnic identity of Balhae&#x27;s founder is controversial and disputed. Many Chinese, Korean, Russian, and Japanese scholars of Balhae believe its population was composed of Goguryeo remnants and Mohe tribes. Chinese scholars consider that Mohe people form the ethnic majority of Balhae, and arguments for this opinion are also viewed positively in Russia and in the West. While modern Korean scholars usually consider Balhae a Korean state and one of the Northern and Southern States of Korea, Russian and Chinese scholars reject this notion, echoing the position of historical Korean scholars such as Kim Bu-sik, author of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;.

Some historians view this dispute as the polemics reflecting modern politics rather than historical evidence.

Historical sources give different accounts of Dae Joyeong&#x27;s ethnicity and background. Among the official dynastic history works, the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; refers to Dae Joyeong and his state as Sumo Mohe (related to Jurchens and later Manchus) affiliated with Goguryeo. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; also states Dae&#x27;s ethnic background as Mohe but adds that he was &quot;高麗別種&quot; (&quot;gaoli biezhong&quot;). Literally speaking, &quot;biezhong&quot; means &quot;separate kind.&quot; The term is interpreted as meaning &quot;a branch of the Goguryeo people&quot; by South and North Korean historians, but as &quot;distinct from Goguryeo&quot; by Japanese and Chinese researchers. According to Sloane, Tang sources divided Balhae&#x27;s population into two categories, Goguryeo and Mohe. The royalty and upper class were composed of Goguryeo remnants while the majority of Balhae&#x27;s population were Mohe. In a diplomatic mission to Japan in 727 or 728, the Balhae envoy said that Balhae has &quot;recovered the lost land of Goguryeo and inherited the old traditions of Buyeo.&quot; Some consider this divide to be a cause of tension that contributed to Balhae&#x27;s eventual downfall. Chinese scholars have made claims that Han Chinese were a part of the Balhae population, but apart from Goguryeo and Mohe, no other group is associated with the foundation of Balhae in Chinese, Korean, or Japanese sources.

According to Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn (b. 857), the people of Balhae were Mohe. In the conflict between the joint Tang-Silla forces against Balhae, Silla described Balhae as &quot;rebellious barbarians.&quot; Sillan aristocracy tended to view the Balhae population as consisting of solely Mohe people, but this could be due to the antagonistic relations between the two states causing the Sillan nobility to ignore Goguryeo elements of Balhae ethnic composition. The &quot;Ruijū Kokushi&quot;, a 9th-century Japanese text, says that when Balhae was founded, it spanned 2,000 &quot;li&quot; and was filled with villages, each of which were Mohe tribes. Japanese diplomatic communications with Balhae recognized it as a &quot;state of Go[gu]ryeo.&quot; In the early 12th century, the Jurchen leader Aguda sent ambassadors to the Liao dynasty to call on the Balhae people there to rebel against the Liao by appealing to a common origin between the Jurchens and Balhae. According to the appeal, both the Jurchens and Balhae people descended from the seven Wuji tribes. However, according to Alexander Kim, this only applied to the Mohe portion of Balhae&#x27;s population and not the Goguryeo people, who were not included in the seven Wuji tribes. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, written in the 12th century by Kim Bu-sik, did not consider Balhae a Korean state. The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, a 13th-century collection of Korean history and legends, describes Dae as a Sumo Mohe leader. However, it gives another account of Dae being a former Goguryeo general, citing a now-lost Sillan record. Kim considers this unlikely since Goguryeo fell in 668 while Dae died in 719, and young men could not receive the rank of general.

Russian scholars argue that the ethnic composition of Balhae cannot be determined with great precision because no materials exist that can confirm either the Chinese or Korean claims. Some Russian scholars claim Balhae as part of Manchurian history while others believe Balhae was neither a Korean state or Chinese province and there is no direct link between Balhae and either modern China or Korea. E. V. Shakunov believes that Balhae&#x27;s population also consisted of elements from Central Asia such as Sogdians and Tocharians. Many Uyghurs fled to Balhae after the destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840 but they failed to adapt to Balhae society and caused social unrest.

It is evident that Balhae had a diverse population, including other minorities such as Khitan and Evenk peoples. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Balhae culture was an amalgamation of High Tang Chinese, Korean, and Tungusic cultures.

===Expansion and foreign relations===
Dae Joyeong died in 719 and was succeeded by his son, Dae Muye (Da Wuyi, r. 719–737). While Muye accepted Tang gifts and title upon his succession, he showed his independence by giving his father a posthumous temple name, Gowang/Gaowang (high king). Muye adopted his own reign title in 720. In 721, the Tang asked Balhae for military support against the Khitans but they refused. To check Balhae&#x27;s influence, the Tang appointed a chieftain of the Heishui Mohe (Heuksu Malgal) as prefect of Bozhou (in modern Khabarovsk) in 722. In 725, the Andong Protectorate suggested stationing an army in the region. In response, Tang officials dispatched an administration staffed by the leaders of smaller tribes under the command of the Youzhou governor-general. Muye was convinced that the Heishui Mohe and the Tang were plotting to attack him and required a preemptive strike. He ordered his brother, Dae Munye (Da Wenyi), to attack the Heishui Mohe. Munye, who had stayed at the Tang capital as a hostage since the start of peaceful relations in 705, and understood the implications of attacking a Tang ally, was reluctant to carry out the order. He advised Muye to abandon the plan twice.

Muye paid his brother no heed and used his reluctance as pretext to remove Munye from command. Munye fled to the Tang dynasty. A Balhae envoy arrived at the Tang court in 732 requesting the execution of Munye. In response, the Tang secretly sent Munye to Central Asia while informing Muye that his brother had been banished to South China. The reality of events, however, leaked out, enraging Muye. A Balhae naval force led by Jang Mun-hyu (Zhang Wenxiu) attacked Dengzhou on the north shore of the Shandong Peninsula and killed its prefect. Additionally, Dengzhou was the center of maritime trade routes in East Asia, and was the locale where both Silla and Balhae envoys stayed when coming to pay tribute to the Tang Emperor. As a result, Balhae&#x27;s attack on Dengzhou was not merely motivated by geopolitical retaliation against the Tang but also out a of a desire to assert its newfound maritime prowess as well as prevent the Heishui Mohe from establishing trade relations with the Tang, which would have weakened Balhae&#x27;s dominace of the northern trade routes. Balhae&#x27;s successful attack on Dengzhou also demonstrates a surprising maritime prowess for a thirty-year old state, which had military naval vessels that could cross the sea as well as merchant vessels that could carry out trade activities.

In response to the attacks, the Tang ordered Kim Chungsin, the nephew of Seongdeok of Silla and courtier in the Tang court, to return to Silla and organize an attack on Balhae. Chungsin excused himself from the request by asking to remain in China as the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard. In his place, the Tang sent Kim Saran, a low ranking Sillan diplomat, and a Tang eunuch. Munye was also recalled to recruit soldiers in Youzhou. In the meantime, Balhae struck again, sacking the town of Mt. Matou (northwest of modern Shanhaiguan), and killing 10,000 Tang soldiers. The Balhae force raided and pillaged along the Liao River and the coast of the Liaodong Peninsula. In 733, Tang and Sillan forces attempted a joint attack on Balhae but were accosted by a blizzard that blocked all roads and killed half of the 100,000 Tang-Silla army, forcing them to abort the invasion. Muye continued to try to kill his brother. He sent an agent to Luoyang to plot the assassination of his brother. Munye was attacked in broad daylight near the Tianjin Bridge outside the imperial palace but escaped unharmed.

Japanese records indicate that Balhae and Japan enjoyed very amicable relations. When King Mu sent Balhae&#x27;s first envoy delegation to Japan in 727, the mission was made up of 24 men, which included high-ranking Generals such as 
Ko In ˇui and Ko Ched ˇok. King Mu had 300 sable furs sent by the Balhae delegation to Japan as both a show of goodwill and a desire to foster friendly relations with Japan.

In 734, Silla attacked Balhae with no success. In an effort to curb Balhae&#x27;s ambitions, the Tang granted Silla&#x27;s request to place troops in the Paegang region in 735.

The strategic landscape began to turn on Balhae in 734–735, when the Khitan chieftain, Ketuyu, and his Turkic allies were defeated by Tang forces. In addition a force of 5,000 Kumo Xi cavalrymen surrendered to the Tang. The defeat of the Khitans and Turks, and the submission of the Kumo Xi removed the buffer zone that had formed between Balhae and the Tang. Sensing the change in strategic developments, Muye decided to reconcile with the Tang. In 737, Tang sailors and civilians detained in Balhae were repatriated. In 738, an envoy from Balhae requested Tang ritual codes and dynastic histories in a symbolic gesture towards peace. Muye died soon after.

Muye&#x27;s son and successor, Dae Heummu (Da Qinmao, r. 737–793), continued the course of reconciliation with the Tang. At the same time, trouble with the Tibetan Empire to the west forced the Tang to withdraw all military forces from Korea and adopt a defensive stance. Heummu cemented the geopolitical balance by sending an envoy to the Japanese court, which his father had done as well in 728 to threaten Silla with an ally from the southeast. Balhae kept diplomatic and commercial contacts with Japan until the end of the kingdom. Balhae dispatched envoys to Japan 34 times, while Japan sent envoys to Balhae 13 times.

Balhae planned a joint attack on Silla with Japan. Gyeongdeok of Silla offended Japan twice. In 753 he treated Japanese ambassadors with arrogance and in 758 he refused to meet them. After 758, Japan asked Balhae to attack Silla with them. Balhae and Japan exchanged ambassadors several times in the 750s and 760s to plan for the attack. Silla likely knew of these plans and prepared by building six castles along the border with Balhae in 762. The border region changed hands many times but the losses are not described in Silla&#x27;s official history, only the dates when an army was sent north. Japan prepared a fleet to invade southern Silla; however the plan never came to fruition.

In 755, the An Lushan Rebellion broke out, causing the Tang to lose control of the northeast, and even after the rebellion&#x27;s end in 763, warlords known as jiedushi controlled the former northeastern part of the Tang empire. In 762, Emperor Daizong of Tang formally recognized Balhae as a state and Heummu as its king. Although China recognized him as a king, Balhae itself referred to him as the son of heaven (emperor) and a king. The consort of the ruler was also called empress. A record in 834 says that Balhae had both kings and great kings. The epitath of Princess Jeonghyo (Zhenxiao), daughter of Heummu, states that his father was a &quot;great king.&quot; During Heummu&#x27;s reign, a trade route with Silla, called &quot;Sillado&quot; (), was established. The Silla trade route began at the Eastern Capital located at the center of Balhae&#x27;s Yongwon Province, came down along the coast past what is now Hamgyong Province. This route, which also passed through Balhae&#x27;s Southern Capital, was established for the purpose of conducting trade with Silla. Since the 1980s large numbers of archaeological sites related to Parhae have been excavated in North Korea; among those sites, the fortress at Bukcheong and the monastery site at Omae-ri in the city of Sinpo were locales engaged in the trade between Balhae and Silla. The route led from Pukchong, which was Balhae&#x27;s Southern Capital, down along the coast to the Yonghung River; across the river was Silla&#x27;s Chonjong (Jeonjeong) Prefecture. King Mun moved the capital of Balhae several times. He also established Shangjing/Sanggyeong, the permanent capital near Lake Jingpo in the south of today&#x27;s Heilongjiang province around 756, stabilizing and strengthening central rule over various ethnic tribes in his realm, which was expanded temporarily. He also authorized the creation of the &quot;Jujagam&quot;/&quot;Zhouzijian&quot; (), the national academy, based on the national academy of Tang.

The bilateral relationship between the Tang and Balhae grew friendlier. From 766 to 779, 25 missions from Balhae paid respect to Daizong. By the end of Heummu&#x27;s reign in 793, princes from Balhae&#x27;s royal family were serving as guards at the court of Emperor Dezong of Tang of their own volition. Peace with the Tang allowed Balhae to further expand its territory. After the death of Heummu, who was posthumously known as Mun of Balhae (Wen, r. 737–793), Balhae experienced a succession crisis. As a result, Balhae lost territory and bordering Mohe tribes rebelled. Both the reigns of Seon of Balhae (Xuan, r. 818–830) and Dae Ijin (Da Yizhen, r. 830–857) saw intrusions by Mohe tribes. Seon annexed the Yuexi Mohe and other tribes along the Amur valley in the north. In 818-820, he also invaded Liaodong and parts of Silla on Balhae&#x27;s southern border. In 826, Silla mobilized tens of thousands of people to fortify the border with Balhae. In the middle of the 9th century, Balhae completed its local administrative system, which was composed of five capitals, 15 prefectures and 62 counties.

===Fall===
In 907, Balhae came into conflict with the Khitan Liao dynasty because of the decision of the Khitans near modern Chifeng and Tongliao, who recognized the supremacy of Balhae, to become part of the Liao dynasty. The Liao ruler Abaoji took possession of the Liao River basin, which led to a long conflict. In 911, Silla allied with Balhae against the Khitans. In 924, Balhae attacked the Khitans. The next year, a Balhae general, Sindeok, surrendered to Goryeo. In 925, Silla allied with the Khitans and helped them in their war against Balhae. Afterwards, warriors from Silla were rewarded by the Khitan ruler. In 926, the Khitans laid siege to the Balhae capital Shangjing/Sanggyeong and forced their surrender. In Balhae&#x27;s place, the Khitans established the autonomous kingdom of Dongdan ruled by the Liao crown prince Yelü Bei. Its independence ended in 929 when a new Liao ruler ordered the relocation of its population. It was soon absorbed into the Liao in 936. The name of Balhae was officially removed in 982. Meanwhile, a series of nobilities and elites led by key figures such as crown prince Dae Gwang-hyeon, were absorbed into Goryeo. Some Balhae aristocrats were forced to move to Liaoyang, but Balhae&#x27;s eastern territory remained politically independent in Later Balhae, which was later renamed to Jeongan (Ding&#x27;an). The Liao invaded Jeongan in 975 but failed to conquer them. In 985–6, the Khitans attacked Jeongan again, this time successfully.

Some scholars considered the eruption of Mount Baekdu in the 930–940s to have dealt a final blow to the surviving forces of Balhae based on records of massive population displacement of Balhae people to the Liaodong peninsula of the Khitan empire and the Korean peninsula of Goryeo. However this theory has lost popularity in Korea in recent times and Russian scholars do not consider it a plausible reason for Balhae&#x27;s collapse. The most paramount reason seems to have been military confrontation with a superior power, the Khitans.

The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; stated that the kingdom originally had around 100,000 households and tens of thousands of soldiers, suggesting a population of around 500,000. At the time of its fall, its soldiers numbered &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; according to the &quot;History of Liao&quot;. The kingdom&#x27;s total population in its last years is variously estimated at between 1.5 and 4 million by historians today.

===Later history===
====Goryeo====
Though Balhae was lost, a great portion of the royalty and aristocracy fled to Goryeo, including Dae Gwang-hyeon, the last crown prince. They were granted land and the crown prince was given the family name Wang (), the royal family name of the Goryeo dynasty, and included in the royal household by Wang Geon, who was crowned as Taejo of Goryeo. Koreans believe Goryeo thus unified the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Some other members of the Balhae royalty took the surname Tae (). According to the &quot;Goryeosa jeolyo&quot;, the Balhae refugees who accompanied the crown prince numbered in the tens of thousands of households. According to Alexander Kim, Goryeo&#x27;s statistical information shows that more than 100,000 Balhae people moved to Goryeo at different points in time. As descendants of Goguryeo, the Balhae people and the Goryeo dynasts were related. Taejo of Goryeo felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, calling it his &quot;relative country&quot; and &quot;married country&quot;, and protected the Balhae refugees. This was in stark contrast to Later Silla, which had endured a hostile relationship with Balhae. Taejo displayed strong animosity toward the Khitans who had destroyed Balhae. The Liao dynasty sent 30 envoys with 50 camels as a gift in 942, but Taejo exiled the envoys to an island and starved the camels under a bridge, in what is known as the &quot;Manbu Bridge Incident&quot;. Taejo proposed to Gaozu of Later Jin that they attack the Khitans in retribution for Balhae, according to the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. Furthermore, in his &quot;Ten Injunctions&quot; to his descendants, he stated that the Khitans are &quot;savage beasts&quot; and should be guarded against. Khitan conquest of Balhae resulted in Goryeo&#x27;s prolonged hostility towards the Khitan Empire.

Exodus en masse on part from the Balhae refugees would continue on at least until the early 12th century during the reign of King Yejong, according to Korean scholars. Due to this constant massive influx of Balhae refugees, the Goguryeo population is speculated to have become dominant in proportion compared to their Silla and Baekje counterparts that have experienced devastating war and political strife since the advent of the Later Three Kingdoms. Later Baekje fared only little better than Later Silla before its fall in 936. Meanwhile, of the three capitals of Goryeo, two were Kaesong and Pyeongyang which were initially populated by Goguryeoic settlers from the Paeseo Region () and Balhae.

Crossley believes that according to Goryeo records, Balhae refugees only arrived in groups of a few hundred to a few thousand. She suggests that the total number could not be more than 100,000, while millions remained in Liao-controlled territories. According to Crossley, it is also unclear whether they stayed, went back to Balhae, or moved on elsewhere like China or Japan. According to Kim, between the 10th and 11th centuries, 30,000 Balhae families (more than 100,000 people) immigrated to Goryeo, 94,000 local families (470,000 inhabitants) were deported by the Liao, and only 20,000 Balhae families lived in the former territories of Balhae, a significantly smaller figure than those that immigrated to Goryeo. Korean historians generally estimate that approximately 100,000 to 200,000 fled from Balhae to Goryeo. Historian Professor Park Jong-gi estimated that 120,600 people fled from Balhae to Goryeo, and by themselves comprised approximately 6.3% of early Goryeo&#x27;s roughly 2 million inhabitants.

According to Kim, many Balhae refugees fled to Goryeo due to pro-Balhae policies during the mid 9th century. In the first few decades after Balhae&#x27;s fall, Balhae refugees were welcomed by Goryeo. However, it seems few Balhae refugees retained high positions in Goryeo as service in the Khitan administration offered more benefits. Goryeo annals contain only six names of high-ranking officials who were of Balhae origin. From 1029 to 1030, the Khitan Administration was rocked by a rebellion by Balhae people after the government tried raising taxes on them. The leader of the rebellion was the Liao general Da Yanlin, a 7th generation descendant of the founder of Balhae. He arrested and killed Khitan leaders and proclaimed the establishment of a new dynasty, Xing Liao. He sent an ambassador to Goryeo requesting military support. Goryeo sent some military troops against the Liao but the Khitans repelled them and expelled the Goryeo army. Some of Goryeo&#x27;s officers sought further confrontation with the Liao, but the Goryeo diplomatic corps and nobility asked the Goryeo king to exercise caution. The Goryeo king decided to abandon military activities against the Liao. Despite this, Balhae people continued to send missions to Goryeo requesting assistance. The last mission, led by Lee Kwang Rok, arrived after the destruction of the state, and Kim considers this group as refugees, not members of an ambassadorial mission. Kim believes that in the 11th century, Balhae people under the Liao started viewing Goryeo as a hostile state in which the Balhae people lacked support.

====Liao dynasty====
The Balhae people played a pivotal role in the politics, literature, and society of northern China under the Liao and Jin dynasties. After the dissolution of Balhae by the Khitan empire, the term &quot;Bohai&quot; was used through the fourteenth century to denote a subset of the populations of the Liao, Jin, and Mongol empires. The Liao Eastern Capital (Dongjing, modern-day Liaoyang, Liaoning) served as a base for monitoring the former Balhae territories. The city&#x27;s residents, over 40,000 in early tenth century, were primarily Balhae, according to a figure cited by Pamela Crossley. Dae Inseon (Da Yinzhuan), the last Balhae king, and other members of the former royal lineage still held considerable authority in Dongdan and the Eastern Capital after Balhae&#x27;s fall. Some Balhae elites, on the other hand, were integrated into the Liao aristocracy and often changed their personal identities dramatically.

According to Wittfogel and Feng, an undated Liao census puts the number of Balhae households in Liaoyang at around 100,000, which would be around half a million individuals.

In the summer of 1029, a distant descendant of Balhae royalty, Da Yanlin, rebelled at the Eastern Capital. He imprisoned minister Xiao Xiaoxian and his wife, killed the tax commissioners and chief military commander, and declared his own Xing Liao dynasty (興遼國/흥료국). He requested aid from Goryeo, who sent forces against Liao only to be repelled. Further ambassadors were sent by Xing Liao to Goryeo seeking aid but Goryeo refused to help them owing to the advice of nobles and scholars to the Goryeo king. Other Balhae people serving in the Liao military also refused to join Xing Liao. Four groups of ambassadors were sent but the last group remained in Goryeo rather than return. Instead only a handful of Jurchens joined his regime. Many participants of the rebellion probably realized the weakness of the new dynasty and fled to Goryeo before its collapse. A year later, one of Da Yanlin&#x27;s officers betrayed him and opened the Eastern Capital&#x27;s gates to the Khitans. His short lived dynasty came to an end. The old Balhae nobility were resettled near the Supreme Capital while others fled to Goryeo. In 1114, Balhae descendants took advantage of the Jurchen-Khitan war and rebelled. They defeated Khitan armies twice before they were destroyed. In 1116 another rebellion occurred at the Eastern Capital when a Balhae officer named Gao Yongchang declared himself emperor of the Yuan dynasty and requested aid from the Jin. Liao troops sent to quash the rebellion were themselves led by those of Balhae descent. The Jin relief troops to Yuan easily repulsed the Liao troops but then turned on the Balhae rebels and killed Gao Yongchang.

The distinction between Balhae and Jurchen rebellions was not always clear to the Liao. In the 1117 epitaph of an officer who died while fighting against Jurchens in 1114, the Balhae and Jurchens were mentioned in connection to each other and placed within a similar category.

====Jin dynasty====
The Khitans themselves eventually succumbed to the Jurchen people, the descendants of the Mohe, who founded the Jin dynasty. Jurchen proclamations emphasized the common descent of the Balhae and Jurchens from the seven Wuji (勿吉) tribes. The Jin sent two Balhae representatives to recruit &quot;people from their home area&quot; while bearing a message that &quot;The Jurchen and Bohai are originally of the same family; as we rise in arms to smite the wicked, [harm] will not unjustly reach the innocent.&quot; The fourth, fifth and seventh emperors of Jin were mothered by Balhae consorts. Nevertheless, the 13th century census of Northern China by the Mongols distinguished Balhae people who belonged to the Khitan Empire from other ethnic groups such as Goryeo, Khitans and Jurchens.

A Song observer notes that during the Liao era, Balhae people were not employed in the government, as a result they were the first to defect to the Jin. The call for Balhae defectors was met with significant success. Aguda was advised by a Balhae man named Yang Pu who aided him in establishing an imperial court. An 1125 embassy noted that Jin protocol officers included Khitans, Jurchens, as well as Balhae. They all spoke Chinese. A descendant of the Balhae royal family, Da Gao (1086–1153), served in the Jin army and was given command of eight Balhae battalions in the war against the Song dynasty. One Balhae commander, Guo Yaoshi (active 1116–1132) fought in the Liao, Jin, and Song armies at one point or another. The Balhae played a critical role in supporting Emperor Shizong of Jin&#x27;s accession to the throne.

Families of Balhae descent were able to rise high in the Jin hierarchy, including Zhang Rulin (d. 1190) and Zhang Rubi (d. 1187), who were key advisers of Emperor Shizong, and Li Yin (&quot;jinshi&quot; 1194, d. 1214), who died fighting against the Mongols. Balhae descendants also participated with success in the Jin imperial examinations. Many Balhae literati-officials such as Gao Kan (d. 1167), Gao Xian (&quot;jinshi&quot; 1203), Zhang Rulin, Zhang Runeng, Zhang Ruwei (fl. 1150), Zhang Rufang, and Wang Tingyun (1151–1202) were entrusted as arbiters of culture and cultivated taste. Wang Tingyun&#x27;s family received literary distinctions. His eldest daughter became a Daoist priestess, named Congqing, and was a poet at the imperial court. Intermarriage between Balhae civil elites in the Jin dynasty was common. In 1190, Wang Ji identified two families he encountered in Liaodong as Balhae. Writing after the fall of the Jin dynasty in 1234, Liu Qi identified the military commander Li Ying as a &quot;Bohai man of Liaodong.&quot;

There were still limitations on Balhae people in the Jin dynasty. In 1136, the Jurchen official Wanyan Puluhu revoked the pardon of a man when his origin was determined to be Balhae. Policies to restrain and weaken Balhae were increased over time. In 1140, an edict abolished Han Chinese and Balhae hereditary military garrisons but not Kumo Xi and Khitan garrisons. The Jin government also targeted the Balhae population for relocation. Over the years, groups of Balhae who were once moved outside to areas near the Liao supreme or central capital regions were resettled east of the Taihang Mountains, which was completed by 1141. Another relocation south of Zhongdu was planned in 1149, but the Balhae court attendant Gao Shouxing protested to Empress Daoping, who told the emperor, resulting in the beating and death of the two officials planning the relocation. A substantial Jin military presence was bought to Liaodong in which as many as thirty Jurchen meng&#x27;an units (&quot;meng&#x27;an&quot; literally means &quot;one thousand&quot; or units composed of one thousand soldiers) and the families of the retinues were moved to garrisons in the Eastern Capital Circuit. The southward migration of Jurchens, especially Jurchen aristocrats, may have contributed to a decline of people who identified as Balhae. In 1177, a decree was passed to abolish the &quot;old Bohai custom&quot; of marriage through mock abduction. Although the Balhae experienced less restrictions under the Jin, there was also less emphasis on Balhae as a distinct group. During the later Jin era, the strong association between Balhae and Liaodong declined as Liaodong became dominated by other identities.

As Balhae descendants became firmly incorporated into the apparatus of the Jurchen-led state, many individual Balhae-descended officials willingly chose to self-identify as Chinese. In 1135, Nansali was chosen as an emissary to Goryeo, for which he changed his name to the Sinitic Wang Zheng. Wang Tingyun also invented a genealogy record on his epitaph tracing his lineage to Taiyuan rather than Liaodong. The epitaph acknowledges that his most recent ancestors were in the employ of Balhae but added that they only &quot;lived dispersed among the eastern barbarians&quot;, rejecting his Balhae identity. The practice of inventing fictitious genealogies to hide ancestry outside of the &quot;Central Territories&quot; was widespread from Song times onward.

====Mongol Empire====
The term &quot;Balhae&quot; became noticeably less prevalent under the rule of the Mongol Empire. There is no trace of Balhae descendants from the defunct Jin dynasty and no epitaphs from the Mongol era claim a Balhae identity. Balhae was only used as a toponym in the early 14th century and Balhae disappeared entirely from historical sources by the late 14th century. Near the end of Mongol rule, Tao Zongyi (c. 1316–1402) put Balhae alongside Khitan and Jurchen under a subcategory within Hanren, which is not surprising given that most of them at the time of the Mongol conquest were literati, officials, or attachments to the Jin bureaucracy. Many chose to use Chinese style names, similar to Jurchens, probably for inclusion in the Hanren (Northern Chinese) category under the Mongol hierarchy, rather than the inferior fourth category, &quot;Nanren&quot; (Southern Chinese). Aside from legal references to the &quot;Taihe Code&quot; of the Jin dynasty, the term &quot;Balhae&quot; is absent from the Yuan legal compendium. The referenced passages have to do with limitations on levirate marriage for Han and Balhae and restrictions on marriage during mourning.

Some Balhae adopted Mongol or Tatar culture rather than Chinese. The biography of You Xingge (d. 1227) identifies him as Balhae. As the Jin dynasty was collapsing from the Mongol invasions, You established an independent fort near Gaozhou (modern Chifeng). They fought off several military detachments until they were besieged by Muqali. After You surrendered, Muqali praised him to Genghis Khan, who bestowed on him the Mongol name Halabadu. He later fought for the Mongols at Taiyuan in 1227. You Xingge&#x27;s son is only referred to by the name Mangqutai, which denotes him as part of the Mangqutai tribe.

The decline of Balhae identity was not a gradual and steady process. According to Toyama Gunji, &quot;the Bohai remained alive and well for three hundred years of history&quot; after the state was destroyed.

==Culture==
Balhae&#x27;s population was composed of former Goguryeo people and Tungusic Mohe people in Manchuria. Within sixty sites identified as Balhae settlements, many had dwellings with heating stoves, ceramic roof tiles, and vessels. Iron agricultural implements suggest that sophisticated agriculture was practised in parts of Balhae. These finds indicate that much of the population even outside the capitals were sedentary.

Balhae&#x27;s culture is as complex as its ethnic makeup. Archaeological findings have demonstrated that Balhae culture contained elements from Mohe, Goguryeo, Turkic, as well as Tang Chinese cultures. However, scholars from Japan, China, Russia and Korea emphasize some components over the others because of their national backgrounds. 

Han Ciu-cheol believes that many of Goguryeo&#x27;s tradition were continued by Balhae, such as the use of Ondol heating systems in Balhae&#x27;s royal palaces as well as the use of stone lined tombs, stone chambers and stone coffins used by Goguryeo&#x27;s ruling class. According to Japanese historian Shiratori Kurakichi, 26 of the 85 emissaries dispatched to Japan by Balhae bore the typical Goguryeo surname of Ko (Go), which is still commonly used in Korea, indicating a substantial Goguryeo presence in Balhae culture.

A record of the journey of Hong Hao (1088–1155) in Jin territory describes the Balhae people as primarily martial and not adherent to Confucian norms. Balhae women were described as &quot;fiercely jealous&quot; and prevented the men from deviating from martial fidelity. Balhae men were described as &quot;full of cunning, surpassing other nations in courage, such that there exists a saying &#x27;Three Bohai are a match for a tiger.&#x27;&quot; Some Balhae people practiced Buddhism. However Balhae cultural markers evidently did not deviate to the point of preventing assimilation into neighboring societies. There was widespread usage of &quot;Chinese&quot; style surnames in Balhae and no distinct cultural marker prevented them from integrating into Chinese literati society. There is no evidence of any friction in this process. Other cultural markers such as martial traditions may have also facilitated the adoption of Mongol, Tatar, and Jurchen backgrounds.

==Society==
According to Korean scholars and other historians, Mohe made up the working class which served the Goguryeo ruling class. Some historians believe that ethnic conflicts between the ruling Goguryeos and underclass Mohe weakened the state. Other historians offer dissenting views. Han Ciu-cheol agreed that Mohe people were the majority of Balhae&#x27;s population but disagreed that they were any different from Goguryeo or Balhae. According to Han, the origins of &quot;Malgal&quot; and &quot;Mulgil&quot; lie in the Goguryeo language, and &quot;the Malgal language and customs were the same as those of Goguryeo and Balhae.&quot;

On the other hand, the Russian historian Polutov believes that Goguryeo descendants did not have political dominance, and the ruling system was open to all people equally. Its ruling structure was based on the military leader-priestly management structure of the Mohe tribes and also partly adapted elements from the Chinese system. After the 8th century, Balhae became more centralized, and power was consolidated around the king and the royal family.

The class system of Balhae society is controversial. Some studies suggest there was a stratified and rigid class system similar to those of the related Korean kingdoms and pre-Qin northern China. Elites tended to belong to large extended aristocratic family lines designated by surnames. The commoners in comparison had no surnames at all, and upward social mobility was virtually impossible as class and status were codified into a caste system. Other studies have shown there was a clan system but no clear division of classes existed, whereas the position of the clan leader depended on the strength of the clan. Any member of the clan could become the clan leader if he had sufficient authority. There were also religiously privileged shaman clans. The clan struggles were also partly due to growing Tang influence and different attitudes toward further Sinicization. The main part of society in Balhae was free in a personal capacity and consisted of clans.

By the time of the state&#x27;s demise, the Balhae mode of living had come to resemble that of the northern Chinese. The Liao dynasty classified the Balhae population as Han in legal and taxation contexts, the same as those whose ancestry was traced to the Tang empire. Some Mohe groups did not adopt this manner of life and were excluded from the Liao&#x27;s designation of Balhae. Instead, they remained as Mohe, and would become an important source of the Jurchen people in the future.

==Government==

After its founding, Balhae actively imported the culture and political system of the Tang dynasty and the Chinese reciprocated through an account of Balhae describing it as the &quot;Flourishing land of the East (海東盛國).&quot; The bureaucracy of Balhae was modeled after the Three Departments and Six Ministries and used literary Chinese as the written language of administration. Balhae&#x27;s aristocrats and nobility traveled to the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an on a regular basis as ambassadors and students, many of whom went on to pass the imperial examinations. Three students are recorded in 833 and a royal nephew in 924. Although Balhae was a tributary state of the Tang dynasty, it followed its own independent path, not only in its internal policies, but also in its foreign relations. Furthermore, it regarded itself as an empire, and sent ambassadors to neighbor states such as Japan in an independent capacity.

Balhae had five capitals, fifteen provinces, and sixty-three counties. Balhae&#x27;s original capital was at Dongmo Mountain in modern Dunhua, Jilin Province, China. In 742 it was moved to the Central Capital in Helong, Jilin. It was moved to the Upper Capital in Ning&#x27;an, Heilongjiang in 755, to the Eastern Capital in Hunchun, Jilin in 785, and back to the Upper Capital in 794. Sanggyong (Upper Capital) was organized in the way of the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an. Residential sectors were laid out on either side of the palace surrounded by a rectangular wall. The same layout was also implemented by other East Asian capitals of the time.

==Military==
Balhae&#x27;s military organization consisted of a central army divided into ten guard units (wi, 衛) responsible for protecting the royal palace and the capital. Local militias were organized in the 15 local provinces (bu) for other regions according to the regional administrative structures, with local officials commanding them. Independent troops were stationed at key border points for defense.

The development of Balhae&#x27;s military system can be broadly divided into three phases. The first phase involved establishing administrative systems for the newly expanded territories during the early stages of the kingdom&#x27;s founding. The second phase saw the establishment of the ten guards as recorded in the &quot;Xin Tangshu&quot; (New Book of Tang). In contrast, the third phase occurred after the envoy Wang Zhongwu reported on Balhae&#x27;s military situation following his visit.

Balhae expanded its territory by conquering the Mohe (Malgal) tribes in Manchuria, Primorsky Krai, the Amur River region, and along the coast of the Sea of Japan, during which many fortresses were built. Some of these include the Palryeonseong, Mariyanovka Fortress, Cheonghaeto Fortress, Koksharovka Fortress Site, Kraskino Fortress Site, Nikolayevka Fortress Site in Partizansk, Suchanluha Fortress Site, Bittik Mountain Fortress Site, Ryuzanka Fortress Site, Usti-Chornaya Fortress Site, Namusurisk Fortress Site, Korsakovka Fortress Site, and Novgorodeyev Fortress Site.

=== First Phase ===
The first phase was a period during which the overall system was established, and this period firmly retained the legacy of Goguryeo, with military and administrative functions often overlapping. Volume 193 of &quot;Ruijū Kokushi&quot; records that &quot;Balhae spans 2,000 li in all directions, and no prefectures or counties exist. Villages are scattered throughout, mostly Malgal settlements. The people are mostly Malgal, and few are native. All the natives are made village chiefs, with large villages appointing a Dudu/Dudok (都督, Governor) and smaller ones appointing a Cishi/Jasa (刺史, Prefect), while the rest of the leaders are called Shouling/Suryong (首領, Chiefs).&quot; The Dudok or Jasa were likely regional administrative officials of Balhae, such as the Yakheolju Dudok, Mokjeoju Jasa, and Hyeontoju Jasa. Since this was an early period when the system was still being established, remnants of the former Goguryeo dynasty&#x27;s institutions were still present in many areas, and the division of the entire country was still incomplete. Therefore, in military terms, troops were dispatched mainly to tense situations.

Through the continued territorial expansion during the reigns of King Go and King Mu, Balhae&#x27;s territorial boundaries were secured, and the government structure was reorganized and completed by acquiring territory, population, and tax revenues. Considering that the initial military force at the time of Balhae&#x27;s founding was only a few thousand, Balhae likely needed to make overall adjustments to the expanded territory and population. Balhae, which had borders with powerful neighboring states like the Tang Dynasty, the Turks, the Khitans, the Heishui Mohe, and Silla, faced deteriorated relations with its neighbors due to its early aggressive conquests. Moreover, having witnessed the fall of Goguryeo, the dominant power in the previous era, Balhae needed to strengthen and reorganize its military. Therefore, this period can be seen as when Balhae laid the foundation for establishing a new system based on Goguryeo&#x27;s legacy over the expanded territory.

=== Second Phase ===
The second phase saw the establishment of central departments and the ten guards, as recorded in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;. The Zhengtangsheng/Jeongdangseong (政堂省), one of the three central departments, managed the military, recruitment, maps, war chariots, and weapons through the subordinate department known as the Zhibu/Jibu (智部). Subordinate to the Jibu were practical departments such as the Rongbu/Yongbu (戎部) and Shuibu/Subu (水部). For example, Yang Seung-gyeong, who was sent as an envoy to Japan in 758, held the central position of Boguk Daejanggun and Janggun (輔國大將軍兼將軍) and the regional position of Mokjeoju Jasa (木底州刺史), and he was also involved in managing national defense. However, the origins of these titles are difficult to trace, as they do not appear in the central official system. This indicates that Balhae organized its military by establishing the Jibu as the central department responsible for military affairs and its subordinate departments like the Yongbu or the Byeongseo (兵書).

Balhae had ten guards, including the &quot;Left and Right Mengbenwei/Mangbunwi (猛賁衛), Left and Right Xiongwei/Ungwi (熊衛), Left and Right Piwei/Biwi (羆衛), Left and Right Nanwei/Namwi (南衛), and Left and Right Beiwei/Bukwi (北衛).&quot; Each guard had a Da Jiangjun/Daejanggun (大將軍) and a Jiangjun/Janggun (將軍). This system was likely modeled after the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s 16 or 12 guards. Each guard had one Daejanggun and one Janggun, equivalent to the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s Shang Jiangjun (上將軍) and Jiangjun (將軍). The ten guards protected the royal family and oversaw the local militia. In 1960, a seal inscribed with &quot;Tianmenjun/Cheonmungun&#x27;s Seal&quot; (天門軍之印), belonging to one of Balhae&#x27;s military units, was discovered southwest of the royal city of Sanggyeong Yongcheonbu. The discovery of this seal suggests that the army under each guard was responsible for guarding the gates of the royal city.

Meanwhile, the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; records that in 728, among the envoys sent to Japan, there were officials such as You Jiangjun/Yujanggun (游將軍) and Guoyi Duwei/Gwaidowi (果毅都尉) Dezhou/Deokju (徳周). The title Guoyi Duwei was adopted from the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s military system. In the Tang Dynasty, the Weibu (衛部) and the Zhechongfu (折衝府) were part of the military system. The Zhechongfu was further divided into upper, middle, and lower levels, with each level having one Zhechong Duwei (折衝都尉) and two Guoyi Duwei (果毅都尉). The Guoyi Duwei of the upper level was equivalent to the 5th rank, the middle level to the 6th rank, and the lower level to the 6th rank. In Balhae, the existence of the Guoyi Duwei/Gwaidowi indicates that Balhae likely adopted the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s military system and established local militias in the provinces.

In particular, the military titles of envoys sent to Japan during the early period of Balhae, such as Janggun (將軍) or Boguk Daejanggun (輔國大將軍), suggest that the military system was already being organized at that time. The Jasa was a local administrative official overseeing the province, and the Daejanggun and Janggun were the highest military positions. The presence of various military titles among these envoys indicates that the system was already in the process of being organized.

=== Third Phase ===
The third phase occurred after the envoy Wang Zhongwu reported on Balhae&#x27;s military situation following his visit. In 832, after returning from Balhae, Wang Zhongwu reported to Emperor Wenzong of Tang that &quot;Balhae has Left and Right Shencejun/Shinchaekgun (神策軍), Left and Right Sanjun/Samgun (三軍), and 120 departments.&quot; This indicates that the military system had evolved from the early generals&#x27; system to the Left and Right ten guards, and by the time Wang Zhongwu returned from his mission, it had already been expanded and reorganized into the Left and Right Shinchaekgun, Left and Right Samgun, and 120 departments. The Sanjun in the Tang Dynasty referred to the Left Longwu (龍武), Left Shenwu (神武), and Left Yulin (羽林) armies, while the Right Sanjun referred to the Right Longwu, Right Shenwu, and Right Yulin. These six armies were all part of the Weijun (衛軍).

Based on Wang Zhongwu&#x27;s report, it can be inferred that Balhae&#x27;s military system also adopted the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s model, with both Weijun and local militias (Fubing). The Tang Dynasty system had separate Weijun and Fubing units, numbering over 600 nationwide. Each unit had a Langjiang (郞將) and was placed under the control of the Zhuwei (諸衛). This strict and extensive military organization greatly influenced Balhae, establishing the ten guards and units like the Shencejun/Shinchaekgun.

No historical records explicitly state that Balhae adopted the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s Fubing system. However, considering Balhae&#x27;s long-term territorial expansion and the presence of military officials such as Jasa, Rangjang, Gwaidowi, and Byeoljang, it is likely that Balhae implemented a Fubing system. Additionally, the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; mentions that &quot;Balhae&#x27;s Buyeo Province is located on the border with the Khitans, and strong troops are always stationed there to defend against the Khitans,&quot; suggesting that Balhae had local militias similar to the Tang Dynasty&#x27;s Fubing system, which played a crucial role in securing the borders. Military titles such as Langjiang/Rangjang and Biejiang/Byeoljang (别將) emerged during King Dae Muye&#x27;s reign, indicating that Balhae had already implemented an army system modeled after the Tang Dynasty with central and local forces.

The size of the military grew from a few thousand soldiers in the early days to tens of thousands in later periods. It is known that in its early years, during the reign of King Mu, Balhae held 100,000 troops, which is one-third of Goguryeo&#x27;s 300,000-strong army. Naturally, during periods of military control combined with production and conquest, even the elderly, children, and all men in a household might have been conscripted to meet the demands of external wars.

==Language and script==
Balhae used multiple languages. The indigenous language of Balhae is unclear, as no extant text or gloss of the language survived.

One term that the people of Balhae used to describe &quot;a king&quot; was &quot;Gadokbu&quot;, which is related to the words &quot;kadalambi&quot; (management) of the Manchu language and &quot;kadokuotto&quot; of the Nanai language.

Alexander Vovin suggests that the Balhae elite spoke a Koreanic language, which has had a lasting impact on Khitan, Jurchen and Manchu languages. However, he also believes that the vast majority of the Balhae population were probably Tungusic, and at least partially Jurchen-speaking. Some Korean historians believe that a record in &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; implies that the Balhae and Silla language were mutually intelligible: a student sent from Silla to Japan for Japanese language interpreter training assisted a diplomatic envoy from Balhae in communicating with the audience of a Japanese court.

Diplomatic missions between Balhae, Japan and the Tang dynasty were primarily conducted in the Chinese language. Based on administrative and diplomatic records, a number of Japanese historians and linguists have further suggested that Chinese was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Balhae. Classical Chinese was also used for the two unearthed tomb inscriptions for members of the Balhae royal family.

Excavated epigraphic materials indicate that the Chinese script was the only widely used script in Balhae. According to Russian scientific research, the Balhae writing system is based on Chinese characters, and among the characters used, many were used only in the state &quot;Wu&quot;. However, the recording was phonetic. Some of the names of Balhae&#x27;s emissaries were similar to Chinese names while others were unique to Balhae: Wodala, Zhaoheshi, and Nansali. The unique Balhae names were the minority. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; records that Balhae had its own script, about which almost nothing is known. Vovin has suggested that the script was a prototype of the Jurchen script. While most Balhae inscriptions consisted of common Chinese characters, he has identified a small number of characters with Jurchen script signs or phonograms.

==Economy and trade==
Under Balhae, the region&#x27;s agriculture became much more widespread and well-developed than in previous centuries, especially in the north. Millet, barley, soy beans and rice were the main type of crops cultivated in Balhae. Some of its specialized regional produce, such as rice, fermented beans, plums and pears, were much sought after. Fishing and hunting also remained important among Balhae people. Balhae also produced fine iron and copper wares, silk and linen textiles, and ceramics, including Sancai pottery developed under the influence of that of the Tang. Whaling was also done, albeit this was mostly done as tribute to the Tang.

Balhae had a high level of craftsmanship and engaged in trade with neighboring polities such as the Göktürks, Nara Japan, Later Silla and the Tang dynasty. Balhae sent a large number of envoys to Japan, called . Fur from Balhae was exported to Japan while textile products and precious metals, such as gold and mercury, were imported from Japan. In Japan, the fur of the 貂 (&quot;ten&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; sable or other marten) was very valuable due to its popularity among Japanese aristocrats. Similarly, Balhae builders used Japanese fortification techniques with prevailing Japanese culture in their construction of the . Balhae&#x27;s musical works &quot;Shinmaka&quot; () have been preserved by the Japanese court.

==Controversies==

The historic position of Balhae is disputed between Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Japanese historians. Korean scholars consider Balhae to be the successor state of Goguryeo, and part of the North–South States Period of Korean history. Chinese scholars argue that Balhae was a local administration of the Tang dynasty and composed of Mohe people, making it a part of Chinese history due to its close cultural and political ties with Tang China. The Russian archaeological school views Balhae as a state of primarily Mohe people while Japanese scholars consider it a tributary state.

==Media==
Balhae features in the Korean film &quot;Shadowless Sword&quot;, which is about the last prince of Balhae. The Korean TV drama Dae Jo-yeong, which aired from 16 September 2006, to 23 December 2007, was about the founder of Balhae.

Balhae is the name of the lunar research facility in the Korean TV series, The Silent Sea.

<text>Thomas Andrew Dorsey (July 1, 1899 – January 23, 1993) was an American musician, composer, and Christian evangelist influential in the development of early blues and 20th-century gospel music. He penned 3,000 songs, a third of them gospel, including &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; and &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;. Recordings of these sold millions of copies in both gospel and secular markets in the 20th century.

Born in rural Georgia, Dorsey grew up in a religious family but gained most of his musical experience playing blues piano at barrelhouses and parties in Atlanta. He moved to Chicago and became a proficient composer and arranger of jazz and vaudeville just as blues was becoming popular. He gained fame accompanying blues belter Ma Rainey on tour and, billed as &quot;Georgia Tom&quot;, joined with guitarist Tampa Red in a successful recording career.

After a spiritual awakening, Dorsey began concentrating on writing and arranging religious music. Aside from the lyrics, he saw no real distinction between blues and church music, and viewed songs as a supplement to spoken word preaching. Dorsey served as the music director at Chicago&#x27;s Pilgrim Baptist Church for 50 years, introducing musical improvisation and encouraging personal elements of participation such as clapping, stomping, and shouting in churches when these were widely condemned as unrefined and common. In 1932, he co-founded the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, an organization dedicated to training musicians and singers from all over the U.S. that remains active. The first generation of gospel singers in the 20th century worked or trained with Dorsey: Sallie Martin, Mahalia Jackson, Roberta Martin, and James Cleveland, among others.

Author Anthony Heilbut summarized Dorsey&#x27;s influence by saying he &quot;combined the good news of gospel with the bad news of blues&quot;. Called the &quot;Father of Gospel Music&quot; and often credited with creating it, Dorsey more accurately spawned a movement that popularized gospel blues throughout black churches in the United States, which in turn influenced American music and parts of society at large.

==Early life (1899–1918)==
Thomas A. Dorsey was born in Villa Rica, Georgia, the first of three children to Thomas Madison Dorsey, a minister and farmer, and Etta Plant Spencer. The Dorseys sharecropped on a small farm, while the elder Dorsey, a graduate of Atlanta Bible College (now Morehouse College), traveled to nearby churches to preach. He also taught black children at a one-room schoolhouse where his son accompanied him and listened to lessons.

Religion and music were at the center of the Dorseys&#x27; lives, and young Thomas was exposed to a variety of musical styles in his early childhood. While often living hand-to-mouth, the Dorseys were able to own an organ, which was rare for black families, and Dorsey&#x27;s mother played during his father&#x27;s church services. His uncle was also a musician, a traveling guitarist concentrating on country blues while it was in its infancy. Villa Rica&#x27;s rural location allowed Dorsey to hear slave spirituals, and &quot;moaning&quot; – a style of singing marked by elongated notes and embellishments widespread among Southern black people – alongside the Protestant hymns his father favored. Furthermore, when Thomas&#x27; father traveled to preach at other churches, Thomas and his mother attended a church that practiced shape note singing; their harmonizing in particular making a deep impression on him.

The Dorseys moved to Atlanta to find better opportunities when Thomas was eight years old. The adjustment for the entire family was difficult, culminating in Thomas being isolated, held back at school, and eventually dropping out after the fourth grade when he was twelve years old.

Directionless, Dorsey began attending shows at the nearby 81 Theater, that featured blues musicians and live vaudeville acts. Soon he began selling concessions there, and aspiring to join the theater band, honed his musical skills on his family&#x27;s organ and a relative&#x27;s piano, picking out melodies that he had heard and practicing long hours. He studied informally with musicians at the theater and local dance bands, always playing blues. Despite being meagerly compensated, he played rent parties, house parties, barrelhouses, and brothels, but enjoyed the social life of a musician. Due to the spontaneous nature of the events Dorsey worked, he became proficient at improvising, and along the way, learned to read musical notation.

==Blues career (1919–1925)==
Seeking a greater challenge, Dorsey relocated to Chicago in 1919, where he learned that his style of playing was unfashionable compared to the newer uptempo styles of jazz. Encountering more competition for jobs and with his concentration primarily on blues, Dorsey turned to composing, copyrighting his first song in 1920, titled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Believe I&#x27;m Leaving, You Can Count the Days I&#x27;m Gone&quot;. In doing so, he became one of the first musicians to copyright blues music.

Dorsey seemed ambivalent about writing church music until 1921 when he was inspired by W. M. Nix&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Do, Don&#x27;t You?&quot; after hearing him perform at the National Baptist Convention. Nix elongated some notes to emphasize specific syllables and words and sped up others. Dorsey found appeal in the freedom and potential that came with improvising within established hymns, allowing singers and musicians to infuse more emotion – particularly joy and elation – into their performances to move congregations. Upon hearing Nix sing, Dorsey was overcome, later recalling that his &quot;heart was inspired to become a great singer and worker in the Kingdom of the Lord–and impress people just as this great singer did that Sunday morning&quot;. The experience prompted him to copyright his first religious song in 1922, &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Get There&quot;, a composition in the style of Charles Tindley, whom Dorsey idolized. Sacred music could not sustain him financially, however, so he continued to work in blues.

Two of his secular songs were recorded by Monette Moore and another by Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver, ensuring Dorsey a place as one of Chicago&#x27;s top blues composers. His reputation led him to become a music arranger for Paramount Records and the Chicago Music Publishing Company. In 1923, he became the pianist and leader of the Wild Cats Jazz Band accompanying Gertrude &quot;Ma&quot; Rainey, a charismatic and bawdy blues shouter who sang about lost love and hard times. Rainey interacted with her audiences, who were often so enthralled they stood up and shouted back at her while she sang. The night Rainey opened at Chicago&#x27;s largest black theater Dorsey is remembered as &quot;the most exciting moment in my life&quot;.

Dorsey worked with Rainey and her band for two years, wherein he composed and arranged her music in the blues style he was accustomed to, as well as vaudeville and jazz to please audiences&#x27; tastes. In 1925, he married Nettie Harper, who Rainey hired as a wardrobe mistress despite her inexperience, so she could join Dorsey on tour.

==Transition to gospel music (1926–1930)==
Rainey enjoyed enormous popularity touring with a hectic schedule, but beginning in 1926 Dorsey was plagued by a two-year period of deep depression, even contemplating suicide. He experienced a spiritual re-invigoration of sorts in 1928. While attending a church service with his sister-in-law, Dorsey claimed the minister who prayed over him pulled a live serpent from his throat, prompting his immediate recovery. Thereafter, he vowed to concentrate all his efforts in gospel music. After the death of a close friend, Dorsey was inspired to write his first religious song with a blues influence, &quot;If You See My Savior, Tell Him That You Saw Me&quot;.

As the blues grew in popularity in the 1920s, black churches condemned it widely for being associated with sin and hedonism. Music performed in established black churches in Chicago and throughout the U.S. came from hymnals and was performed as written, usually as a way to showcase the musical abilities of the choirs rather than as a vehicle to deliver a specific spiritual message. Many churches sought prestige in their musical offerings, which were often ornate and sophisticated liturgical compositions by classical European composers, such as Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (1742) and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Alleluia&quot; (1773). Personal expressions such as clapping, stomping, and improvising with lyrics, rhythm, and melody were actively discouraged as being unrefined and degrading to the music and the singer.

Dorsey tried to market his new sacred music by printing thousands of copies of his songs to sell directly to churches and publishers, even going door to door, but he was ultimately unsuccessful. He returned to blues, recording &quot;It&#x27;s Tight Like That&quot; with guitarist Hudson &quot;Tampa Red&quot; Whittaker despite his misgivings over the suggestive lyrics. The record sold more than seven million copies. Billed as &quot;Tampa Red and Georgia Tom&quot; and &quot;The Famous Hokum Boys&quot;, the duo found great success together, eventually collaborating on 60 songs between 1928 and 1932, and coining the term &quot;Hokum&quot; to describe their guitar/piano combination with simple, racy lyrics.

Unsure if gospel music could sustain him, Dorsey was nonetheless pleased to discover that he made an impression at the National Baptist Convention in 1930 when, unknown to him, Willie Mae Ford Smith sang &quot;If You See My Savior&quot; during a morning meeting. She was asked to sing it twice more; the response was so enthusiastic that Dorsey sold 4,000 print copies of his song. In between recording sessions with Tampa Red, and inspired by the compliments he received, he formed a choir at Ebenezer Baptist Church at the request of the pastor, Reverend James Smith, who had an affinity for Negro spirituals and indigenous singing styles. Dorsey and Ebenezer&#x27;s music director Theodore Frye trained the new chorus to deliver his songs with a gospel blues sound: lively, joyous theatrical performances with embellished and elongated notes accentuated with rhythmic clapping and shouts. At their debut, Frye strutted up and down the aisles and sang back and forth with the chorus, and at one point Dorsey jumped up from the piano stool in excitement and stood as he played. When the pastor at Pilgrim Baptist, Chicago&#x27;s second largest black church, saw the way it moved the congregation, he hired Dorsey as music director, allowing him to dedicate all his time to gospel music.

==Leader of a movement (1930–1933)==
This new style began to catch on in Chicago, and Dorsey&#x27;s musical partners Theodore Frye, Magnolia Lewis Butts, and Henry Carruthers urged him to organize a convention where musicians could learn gospel blues. In 1932 however, just as Dorsey co-founded the Gospel Choral Union of Chicago – eventually renamed the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses (NCGCC), his wife Nettie died in childbirth, then 24 hours later, their son. His grief prompted him to write one of his most famous and enduring compositions, &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot;.

Chapters of the NCGCC opened in St. Louis and Cleveland. Now at the center of gospel music activity in Chicago, Dorsey countered his bereavement by immersing himself in marketing his songs. An unintended consequence of his sales strategy helped spread gospel blues, as he worked with numerous musicians who assisted in selling his sheet music traveling to churches in and around Chicago. Rehearsals for sales pitches took place in Dorsey&#x27;s nearly bare room in his uncle&#x27;s house. Frye and Sallie Martin were two of the first and most effective singers Dorsey took with him to market his work. Dorsey and Martin established a publishing company called Dorsey House of Music, the first black-owned gospel publishing house in the U.S. His sheet music sold so well, according to Heilbut, it supplanted the first book of compiled songs for black churches, W. M. Nix&#x27;s &quot;Gospel Pearls&quot;, and the family Bible in black households. He also mentored many young musicians, including training a teenage Mahalia Jackson when she first arrived in Chicago, although he said she did not entirely accept his instruction: &quot;She said I was trying to make a stereotyped singer out of her.&quot;

In addition to the high spirited choir performances, Dorsey began introducing uptempo Negro spirituals, what he referred to as &quot;jubilees&quot;, alongside published hymns in worship services. Faced with rapid changes, old-line church members who preferred formal, more sedate music programs objected, leading to conflicts in and between Chicago&#x27;s black churches. As a result, his sales pitches and chorus performances were not always well received. He is often quoted saying that he had &quot;been kicked out of the best churches in the country&quot;. He found resistance among ministers, musicians, and parishioners alike. Some objected to the degradation of worship through blues shouting. Others took offense to such lively music overshadowing the minister&#x27;s spoken word, or women delivering spiritual messages through song, taking the place of the preacher who was typically male.

Simultaneously, a shift in Chicago&#x27;s black churches was taking place. Hundreds of thousands of newly arrived migrants from the South, with an appreciation of blues, began to outnumber an older guard of ministers and parishioners who favored classical European music in services. Ministers who would not have considered changing their music programs just a few years before became more open to new ideas. Services were thus altered in multiple ways to welcome the influx of migrants, for spiritual and pragmatic reasons: attracting and keeping new members helped reconcile many churches&#x27; debts.

Despite the objections, within months gospel blues had proven to be established in Chicago&#x27;s black churches. In 1933, Dorsey directed a 600-person chorus at the second meeting of the NCGCC, now boasting 3,500 members in 24 states. Black gospel choirs were asked to perform at several white churches in Chicago. And Dorsey&#x27;s own Pilgrim Baptist Church choir performed at the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair.

==Later life (1934–1993)==
Dorsey lived a quiet life despite his influence. He did not seek publicity, preferring to remain at his position as music director at the 3,000-seat Pilgrim Baptist Church and running his publishing company. As the head of the NCGCC, he traveled the &quot;gospel highway&quot;: a circuit of churches and similar venues throughout the U.S. where he trained singers and choirs. Between 1932 and 1944, he held &quot;Evenings with Dorsey&quot; on this circuit, teaching novices the best ways to deliver his songs. He also toured extensively with Mahalia Jackson in the 1940s, who was by this time the preeminent gospel singer in the world. Never considering himself a strong singer, Dorsey recorded gospel music sporadically up to 1934, and two songs in 1953 were his last, though he continued to write.

During his blues period, Dorsey presented himself as dapper and dignified, which carried over into his gospel work. He is described as stately and often detached, one writer attesting that from a distance, &quot;Dorsey is not presented as a happy man. Fulfilled, perhaps. Doing the Lord&#x27;s work, absolutely. But he never smiles, rarely relaxes, and when he talks it&#x27;s with a brooding vigilance bordering on surliness. He is a truly mesmerizing figure, the stuff of which legends are made.&quot; However, once known, Dorsey could offer a &quot;charming smile&quot;, according to Heilbut, and his enthusiasm &quot;often lifts his voice to an irrepressible falsetto&quot;. After writing to his sister that he was lonely and wanted to be around children, she sent Dorsey&#x27;s niece Lena McLin to live with him. McLin remembered that her uncle was &quot;soft-spoken, not loud at all, and very well dressed... he always had a shirt and a tie and a suit, and he was always elegant, very mannerly, very nice. And he would sit at the piano and play something and say, &#x27;That&#x27;s good stuff!&#x27;&quot;

He remarried in 1941 to Katheryn Mosley. They had two children, a son named Thomas M. &quot;Mickey&quot; and a daughter, Doris. Even with a family he remained active in music, attending multiple engagements each year. Katheryn Dorsey stated, &quot;I&#x27;d have to catch him between trains because he was hardly ever at home... The only thing he cared about was saving souls through his music.&quot;

To accomplish this, Dorsey traveled beyond the U.S., through Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East. He recalled visiting Damascus, Syria, where he was approached in a bathroom by a man who recognized his name. A tour group of 150 demanded he sing &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; right there. Obliging, Dorsey began, but the multinational group took over: &quot;And they knew it in Damascus, too. Folk was wipin&#x27; their eyes, and some cryin&#x27; and bawlin&#x27; on, and I told ‘em, &#x27;What is this happenin&#x27; here? I&#x27;ll never get out of this place alive.&#x27;&quot;

When he gave interviews later in his life, he never condemned blues music or his experiences in that period. He remained in contact with his friends and fellow blues musicians, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not ashamed of my blues. It&#x27;s all the same talent. A beat is a beat whatever it is.&quot; Dorsey began to slow down in the 1970s, eventually showing symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He retired from Pilgrim Baptist Church and the NCGCC soon after, though he continued to participate and perform when he was able. He and the NCGCC were featured in the critically acclaimed documentary &quot;Say Amen, Somebody&quot; in 1982. The 1981 meeting featured in the film was the last convention he was able to attend. Dorsey died of Alzheimer&#x27;s at his home in Chicago on January 23, 1993, listening to music on a Walkman. He is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.

==Legacy==
Gospel historian Horace Boyer writes that gospel music &quot;has no more imposing figure&quot; than Dorsey, and the &quot;Cambridge Companion to Blues and Gospel Music&quot; states that he &quot;defined&quot; the genre. Folklorist Alan Lomax claims that Dorsey &quot;literally invented gospel&quot;. In &quot;Living Blues&quot;, Jim O&#x27;Neal compares Dorsey in gospel to W. C. Handy, who was the first and most influential blues composer, &quot;with the notable difference that Dorsey developed his tradition from within, rather than &#x27;discovering&#x27; it from an outsider&#x27;s vantage point&quot;. Although he was not the first to join elements of the blues to religious music, he earned the honorific &quot;Father of Gospel Music&quot;, according to gospel singer and historian Bernice Johnson Reagon, for his &quot;aggressive campaign for its use as worship songs in black Protestant churches&quot;.

Throughout his career, Dorsey composed more than 1,000 gospel and 2,000 blues songs, an achievement Mahalia Jackson considered equal to Irving Berlin&#x27;s body of work. The manager of a gospel quartet active in the 1930s stated that songs written by Dorsey and other songwriters copying him spread so far in such a short time that they were called &quot;dorseys&quot;. Horace Boyer attributes this popularity to &quot;simple but beautiful melodies&quot;, unimposing harmonies, and room for improvisation within the music. Lyrically, according to Boyer, Dorsey was &quot;skilled at writing songs that not only captured the hopes, fears, and aspirations of the poor and disenfranchised African Americans but also spoke to all people&quot;. Anthony Heilbut further explains that &quot;the gospel of [Charles] Tindley and Dorsey talks directly to the poor. In so many words, it&#x27;s about rising above poverty while still living humble deserting the ways of the world while retaining its best tunes.&quot;

Aside from his prodigious songwriting, Dorsey&#x27;s influence in the gospel blues movement brought about change both for individuals in the black community and communities as a whole. He introduced rituals and standards among gospel choirs that are still in use. At the beginning of worship services, Dorsey instructed choruses to march from the rear of the sanctuary to the choir-loft in a specific way, singing all the while. Choir members were encouraged to be physically active while singing, rocking and swaying with the music. He insisted that songs be memorized rather than chorus members reading music or lyrics while performing. This freed the choir members&#x27; hands to clap, and he knew anyway that most of the chorus singers in the early 1930s were unable to read music. Moreover, Dorsey refused to provide musical notation, or use it while directing, because he felt the music was only to be used as a guide, not strictly followed. Including all the embellishments in gospel blues would make the notation prohibitively complicated. Dorsey instead asked his singers to rely on feeling.

While presiding over rehearsals, Dorsey was strict and businesslike. He demanded that members attend practice regularly and that they should live their lives by the same standards promoted in their songs. For women, that included not wearing make-up. Choruses were stocked primarily with women, often untrained singers with whom Dorsey worked personally, encouraging many women who had little to no participation in church before to become active. Similarly, the NCGCC in 1933 is described by Dorsey biographer Michael W. Harris as &quot;a women&#x27;s movement&quot; as nine of the thirteen presiding officer positions were held by women.

Due to Dorsey&#x27;s influence, the definition of gospel music shifted away from sacred song compositions to religious music that causes a physical release of pain and suffering, particularly in black churches. He infused joy and optimism in his written music as he directed his choirs to do perform with uplifting fervor as they sang. The cathartic nature of gospel music became integral to the black experience in the Great Migration, when hundreds of thousands of black Southerners moved to Northern cities like Detroit, Washington, D.C., and especially Chicago between 1919 and 1970. These migrants were refugees from poverty and the systemic racism endemic throughout the Jim Crow South. They created enclaves within neighborhoods through church choirs, which doubled as social clubs, offering a sense of purpose and belonging.

Encountering a &quot;golden age&quot; between 1940 and 1960, gospel music introduced recordings and radio broadcasts featuring singers who had all been trained by Dorsey or one of his protégées. As Dorsey is remembered as the father of gospel music, other honorifics came from his choirs: Sallie Martin, considered the mother of gospel (although Willie Mae Ford Smith, also a Dorsey associate, has also been called this), Mahalia Jackson, the queen of gospel, and James Cleveland, often named the king of gospel. In 1936, members of Dorsey&#x27;s junior choir became the Roberta Martin Singers, a successful recording group which set the standard for gospel ensembles, both for groups and individual voice roles within vocal groups. In Dorsey&#x27;s wake, R&amp;B artists Dinah Washington, who was a member of the Sallie Martin Singers, Sam Cooke, originally in the gospel band the Soul Stirrers, Ray Charles, Little Richard, James Brown, and the Coasters recorded both R&amp;B and gospel songs, moving effortlessly between the two, as Dorsey did, and bringing elements of gospel to mainstream audiences.

Despite racial segregation in churches and the music industry, Dorsey&#x27;s music had widespread crossover appeal. Prominent hymnal publishers began including his compositions in the late 1930s, ensuring his music would be sung in white churches. His song &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot;, written in 1937 originally for Mahalia Jackson, was recorded by, among others, Red Foley in 1951, and Elvis Presley in 1957, selling more than a million copies each. Foley&#x27;s version has been entered into the National Recording Registry as a culturally significant recording worthy of preservation.

Notably, &quot;Take My Hand, Precious Lord&quot; was the favorite song of Martin Luther King Jr., who asked Dorsey to play it for him on the eve of his assassination. Mahalia Jackson sang at his funeral when King did not get to hear it. Anthony Heilbut writes that &quot;the few days following his death, &#x27;Precious Lord&#x27; seemed the truest song in America, the last poignant cry of nonviolence before a night of storm that shows no sign of ending&quot;. Four years later, Aretha Franklin sang it at Jackson&#x27;s funeral. Since its debut it has been translated into 50 languages.

Chicago held its first gospel music festival as a tribute to Dorsey in 1985; it has taken place each year since then. Though he never returned to his hometown, efforts to honor Dorsey in Villa Rica, Georgia, began a week after his death. Mount Prospect Baptist Church, where his father preached and Dorsey learned music at his mother&#x27;s organ, was declared a historic site by the city, and a historical marker was placed at the location where his family&#x27;s house once stood. The Thomas A. Dorsey Birthplace and Gospel Heritage Festival, established in 1994, remains active.

As of 2020, the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses has 50 chapters around the world.

<text>Muriel Teresa Wright (October 27, 1918 – March 6, 2005) was an American actress. She won the 1942 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Carol Beldon in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;. She was nominated for the same award in 1941 for her debut work in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. Also in 1942, she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, opposite Gary Cooper. She is also known for her performances in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; (1943), and in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946).

Wright received three Emmy Award nominations for her performances in the original &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; television version of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1957), in the &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot; feature &quot;The Margaret Bourke-White Story&quot; (1959), and in the CBS drama series &quot;Dolphin Cove&quot; (1989). She earned the acclaim of top film directors, including William Wyler, who called her the most promising actress he had directed, and Alfred Hitchcock, who admired her thorough preparation and quiet professionalism.

==Early life==
Muriel Teresa Wright was born on October 27, 1918, in New York City, the daughter of Martha Espy and Arthur Hendricksen Wright, an insurance agent. Her parents separated when she was young. She grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, where she attended Columbia High School. After seeing Helen Hayes star in &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; at the Broadhurst Theatre in New York City in 1936, Wright took an interest in acting and began playing leading roles in school plays.

Wright earned a scholarship to the Wharf Theater in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she was an apprentice for two summers. Following her high school graduation in 1938, she went to New York, shortened her name to &quot;Teresa Wright&quot;, and was hired as understudy to Dorothy McGuire and Martha Scott for the role of Emily in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s stage production of &quot;Our Town&quot; at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre. Wright took over the role when Scott left for Hollywood to film the on-screen version of the play.

==Acting career==

In autumn 1939, Wright began a two-year appearance in the stage play &quot;Life with Father&quot;, playing the role of Mary Skinner. It was there that she was discovered by Samuel Goldwyn, who came to see her in the show she had been appearing in for almost a year. Goldwyn would later recall his first encounter with her backstage:

Goldwyn immediately hired the young actress for the role of Bette Davis&#x27; daughter in the 1941 adaptation of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, signing her to a five-year Hollywood contract with the Goldwyn Studios. Asserting her seriousness as an actress, Wright insisted her contract contain unique clauses by Hollywood standards:

In 1941, Wright was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her film début in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. The following year, she was nominated again, this time for Best Actress for &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, in which she played opposite Gary Cooper as the wife of Lou Gehrig. The same year, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as the daughter-in-law of Greer Garson&#x27;s character in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;. Wright is the first of only nine actors who have been nominated in both categories in the same year. Her three Academy Award nominations and one Academy Award in her first three films is unique. She remains the only performer to have received Academy Award nominations for her first three films.

In 1943, Wright appeared in the acclaimed Universal film &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, playing a young woman who discovers her beloved uncle (played by Joseph Cotten) is a serial murderer. Hitchcock thought Wright was one of the more intelligent actors he had worked with, and through his direction, he brought out her vivacity, warmth, and youthful idealism—characteristics uncommon in Hitchcock&#x27;s heroines. In 1946, Wright delivered another notable performance in William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, an award-winning film about the adjustments of servicemen returning home after World War II. Critic James Agee praised her performance in &quot;The Nation&quot;:

Four years later, she would appear in another story of war veterans, Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;The Men&quot; (1950), which starred Marlon Brando in his film debut. In 1947, Wright appeared in the western &quot;Pursued&quot; opposite Robert Mitchum. The moody &quot;Freudian western&quot; was written by her first husband Niven Busch. The following year, she starred in &quot;Enchantment&quot;, a story of two generations of lovers in parallel romances. Wright received glowing reviews for her performance. &quot;Newsweek&quot; commented: &quot;Miss Wright, one of the screen&#x27;s finest, glows as the Cinderella who captivated three men.&quot; And &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded: &quot;Teresa Wright plays with that breathless, bright-eyed rapture which she so remarkably commands.&quot;

In December 1948, after rebelling against the studio system that brought her fame, Wright had a public falling out with Samuel Goldwyn, which resulted in the cancellation of Wright&#x27;s contract with his studio. In a statement published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Goldwyn cited as reasons her refusal to publicize the film &quot;Enchantment&quot;, and her being &quot;uncooperative&quot; and refusing to &quot;follow reasonable instructions&quot;. In her written response, Wright denied Goldwyn&#x27;s charges and expressed no regret over losing her $5,000 per week contract.
Years later, in an interview with &quot;The New York Post&quot;, Wright recalled: &quot;I was going to be Joan of Arc, and all I proved was that I was an actress who would work for less money.&quot; For her next film, &quot;The Men&quot; (1950), instead of the $125,000 she had once commanded, she received $20,000.
In the 1950s, Wright appeared in several unsuccessful films, including &quot;The Capture&quot; (1950), &quot;Something to Live For&quot; (1952), &quot;California Conquest&quot; (1952), &quot;The Steel Trap&quot; (1952), &quot;Count the Hours&quot; (1953), &quot;The Actress&quot; (1953) and &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (1954), opposite Robert Mitchum again. Despite the poor box-office showing of these films, Wright was usually praised for her performances. Toward the end of the decade, Wright began to work more frequently in television and theatre. She received Emmy Award nominations for her performances in the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; original television version of &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; (1957) and in the Breck Sunday Showcase feature &quot;The Margaret Bourke-White Story&quot; (1960). In 1955 she played Doris Walker in &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot; remake of the 1947 movie &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, opposite MacDonald Carey and Thomas Mitchell. In 1957, she starred on Broadway in &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; by William Inge. Directed by Elia Kazan, it ran for 468 performances.

On February 8, 1960, Wright was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame with two stars: one for motion pictures at 1658 Vine Street, and one for television at 6405 Hollywood Boulevard.

In the 1960s, Wright returned to the New York stage appearing in three plays: &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; (1962) at the Helen Hayes Theatre in the role of Mary McKellaway, &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot; (1968) at the Longacre Theatre in the role of Alice, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Happy Now?&quot; (1969) at the Village South Theatre in the role of Mary Hallen. During this period, she toured throughout the United States in stage productions of &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; (1962), &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot; (1963) in the role of Pamela Pew-Picket, and &quot;The Locksmith&quot; (1965) in the role of Katherine Butler Hathaway. In addition to her stage work, Wright made numerous television appearances throughout the decade, including episodes for &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (1964) on CBS, &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1964) on NBC, &quot;The Defenders&quot; (1964, 1965) on CBS and &quot;CBS Playhouse&quot; (1969).
In 1975, Wright appeared in the Broadway revival of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and in 1980, appeared in the revival of &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;, for which she won a Drama Desk Award as a member of the Outstanding Ensemble Performance. 

She appeared on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; S6 E11 &quot;A Christmas Presence&quot; as Sister Regina, who foils a con man&#x27;s scheme to smuggle stolen gold molded as a painted creche scene. The episode aired on 12/18/1982. In 1989, she received her third Emmy Award nomination for her performance in the CBS drama series &quot;Dolphin Cove&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in the episode &quot;Mr. Penroy&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. Her last television role was in an episode of the CBS drama series &quot;Picket Fences&quot; in 1996.

Wright&#x27;s later film appearances included a major role in &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1980), the grandmother in &quot;The Good Mother&quot; (1988) with Diane Keaton, and her final role as Miss Birdie in John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

==Personal life==
Wright was married to writer Niven Busch from 1942 to 1952. They had two children: a son, Niven Terence Busch, born December 2, 1944; and a daughter, Mary-Kelly Busch, born September 12, 1947. She married playwright Robert Anderson in 1959. They divorced in 1978, but maintained a close relationship until the end of her life.

In her last decade, Wright lived quietly in her New England home in the town of Bridgewater, Connecticut, in Litchfield County, appearing occasionally at film festivals and forums and at events associated with the New York Yankees. In 1996, she reminisced about Alfred Hitchcock at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and in 2003, she appeared on the Academy Awards show in a segment honoring previous Oscar-winners.

Her daughter, Mary-Kelly, is an author of books for children and young adults. Wright has two grandchildren, one of whom, Jonah Smith, co-produced Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s films &quot;Pi&quot; (1998) and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000). In 1998, Smith accompanied Wright on her first visit to Yankee Stadium when she was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch. Her appearance in &quot;Pride of the Yankees&quot; had sparked an interest in baseball and led her to become a Yankees fan.

==Death and legacy==
Teresa Wright died on March 6, 2005, of a heart attack at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut at the age of 86. She is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.

When the roll call of former Yankees who had died was announced at Old Timer&#x27;s Day on July 5, 2005, Wright&#x27;s name was read among the ballplayers and members of the Yankees family.

&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Got to Breathe: The Life of Teresa Wright&quot; by Donald Spoto was published in February 2016. Spoto was a close friend to Wright for more than 30 years, and was given exclusive access by her family to her papers and correspondence.

<text>Species 8472, formally known as Undine, is a fictional extraterrestrial species in the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Species 8472 is a designation given to them by the Borg. The multiplayer game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; gives their proper name as Undine.

When the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; made contact with them, Species 8472 were engaged in a war with one of &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s perennial antagonists, the Borg. They are noted for being a tripedal and telepathic species and for their use of biotechnology. They originated from what is called fluidic space and fought a successful war against the Borg for a time. They made peace with the Federation by negotiations with Captain Kathryn Janeway of the Starfleet vessel USS &quot;Voyager&quot; in the later 24th century.

==&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;==
Relevant episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in which Species 8472 appear include season 3 episode 26 (season finale) &quot;Scorpion: Part 1&quot; and season 4 episode 1 (season premiere) &quot;Scorpion: Part 2&quot;, season 4 episode 16 &quot;Prey&quot;, and season 5 episode 4 &quot;In the Flesh&quot;.

Species 8472 are discovered by the Borg in 2373 when the Borg invade fluidic space (&quot;Scorpion: Part 2&quot;) by opening a rift in space using a deflector dish. The Borg discover Species 8472 in the Delta Quadrant and try to assimilate its biotechnology, which is more advanced than anything the Borg have seen. The Borg quickly realize that Species 8472 is immune to assimilation and that contemporary Borg technology is no match for it. In fact, 8472 is one of the few species so advanced that its ships are able to destroy Borg cubes in seconds. Species 8472 invades the Delta Quadrant in retaliation for Borg aggression and begins a systematic extermination of the Borg as well as innocent species. Over the course of five months, tens of billions of drones are lost, as well as several hundred planets and ships. When the crew of &quot;Voyager&quot; realizes that it has no choice but to go through Borg space to continue home in any kind of timely manner, Captain Kathryn Janeway hatches a plan to construct a weapon, based on a treatment that the Doctor had created, to kill Species 8472 and use it as a bargaining chip with the Borg, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space. The Borg reluctantly accept. In conjunction with Janeway, the Borg develop a high-yield warhead armed with modified nanoprobes, developed by the Doctor from the Borg&#x27;s own technology, that is effective at killing 8472 and forces them to retreat to fluidic space. In return for Janeway&#x27;s help, the Borg allow &quot;Voyager&quot; safe passage through their space for the duration of their cooperative efforts. However, upon Species 8472&#x27;s retreat from normal space, the Borg terminate the alliance in favor of (unsuccessfully) assimilating &quot;Voyager&quot;.

A member of Species 8472 is left in the Delta Quadrant during the retreat and is relentlessly hunted by a group of Hirogen for several months.

Concerned about the threat posed by humanity, Species 8472 builds 13 &quot;terraspheres&quot; in the Delta Quadrant and recreates Starfleet Academy within, as a staging ground for an intelligence gathering mission on Earth. The plan is uncovered by &quot;Voyager&quot; and peace talks commence. Janeway convinces 8472, led by an individual posing as Boothby, that the United Federation of Planets has no quarrel with them – in fact, the Federation is not even aware of the existence of Species 8472, except for the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew, and the crew is well aware that the Borg themselves started the war between the two species by invading fluidic space to assimilate the superior technology of Species 8472.

==Video games==
Species 8472 appear as villains in the video games &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Armada II&quot;. They also make an appearance in &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, in which they are referred to as the Undine. In &quot;Star Trek: Alien Domain&quot;, they are the primary antagonists.

==Reception==
In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the Species 8472 the eleventh most bizarre aliens in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Vera Rule said that their design reminded them &quot;of HR Gigerish bio-nastiness but with Ray Harryhausen animation&quot;.

<text>STS-2 was the second Space Shuttle mission conducted by NASA, and the second flight of the orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission, crewed by Joe H. Engle and Richard H. Truly, launched on November 12, 1981, and landed two days later on November 14, 1981. STS-2 marked the first time that a crewed, reusable orbital vehicle returned to space. This mission tested the Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) as part of the OSTA-1 (Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications) payload, along with a wide range of other experiments including the Shuttle robotic arm, commonly known as Canadarm. Other experiments or tests included Shuttle Multispectral Infrared Radiometer, Feature Identification and Location Experiment, Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites, Ocean Color Experiment, Night/Day optical Survey of Lightning, Heflex Bioengineering Test, and Aerodynamic Coefficient Identification Package (ACIP). One of the feats accomplished was various tests on the Orbital Maneuvring System (OMS) including starting and restarting the engines while in orbit and various adjustments to its orbit. The OMS tests also helped adjust the Shuttle&#x27;s orbit for use of the radar. During the mission, President Reagan called the crew of STS-2 from Mission Control Center in Houston.

In the early planning stages of the Space Shuttle program, STS-2 was intended to be a reboost mission for the aging Skylab space station. However, such a mission was impeded by delays with the Shuttle&#x27;s development and the deteriorating orbit of Skylab. Skylab ultimately de-orbited on July 11, 1979, two years before the launch of STS-2.

== Crew ==
Engle had been the original selection as Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 17, but was bumped in favor of geologist Harrison Schmitt when it became clear that the mission would be the last lunar landing. As a consequence, both Engle and Truly were rookies during STS-2 (Engle had flown the X-15 above and so had earned USAF astronaut wings, but was still considered a NASA rookie), constituting the first all-rookie crew since Skylab 4, and the first and only all-rookie crew on the space shuttle. Engle was the last NASA rookie to command his first flight until Raja Chari in 2021 with SpaceX Crew-3. Engle and Truly had also served as one of the two Shuttle crews during the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) program in 1977. 

Following STS-2, NASA required all shuttle commanders to have previous spaceflight experience.

== Mission summary ==


The second Space Shuttle mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on November 12, 1981, with liftoff occurring at 15:10:00 UTC, 7 months after STS-1. The planned launch time of 12:30UTC was delayed while a faulty data transmitting unit on &quot;Columbia&quot; was replaced with one from new , which had been shipped overnight from the Palmdale, California factory where &quot;Challenger&quot; was still being manufactured. Richard Truly became the first astronaut to fly into space on his birthday.

Originally, the launch had been set for October 9, 1981, but it was delayed by a nitrogen tetroxide spill during the loading of the forward Reaction Control System (RCS) tanks. The spill necessitated the removal, decontamination and reapplication of over 300 thermal tiles. The tiles could be reached from platforms at Launch Complex 39A, allowing the work to take place without destacking &quot;Columbia&quot; and returning it to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). It was next scheduled for November 4, 1981, but was again scrubbed when high oil pressures were discovered in two of the three Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) that controlled the orbiter&#x27;s hydraulic system. That issue was attributed to hydrazine seepage contaminating the lubrication system in the APUs.

The flight marked the first time an orbital crewed space vehicle had been re-flown with a second crew. Prior to launch, &quot;Columbia&quot; spent 103days in the Orbiter Processing Facility. It again carried the DFI package, as well as the OSTA-l payload (named for the NASA Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications), which consisted of a number of remote-sensing instruments mounted on a Spacelab pallet in the payload bay. These instruments, including the Shuttle Imaging Radar-A (SIR-A), successfully carried out remote sensing of Earth&#x27;s resources, environmental quality, and ocean and weather conditions. In addition, the Canadian-built &quot;Canadarm&quot; Remote Manipulator System (RMS) was successfully operated in all its various operating modes for the first time.

During the mission, the Mission Control Center was visited by President Ronald Reagan. He was supposed to visit during STS-1, but was forced to cancel due to an assassination attempt on March 30, 1981.

Although the STS-2 mission had been planned for a duration of five days, with a few hours a day spent testing the Canadarm, the flight was cut short when one of the three fuel cells that produced electricity and drinking water failed. The mission was shortened to two days, and the Canadarm tests were canceled. The crew stayed awake during a scheduled sleep period and tested the arm anyway, working during the loss of signal (LOS) periods when they were not in contact with Mission Control. The deorbit and reentry phase of this mission differed from STS-1, in that while the first shuttle entry was flown as a &quot;middle of the road&quot; test of the automatic guidance, the success of that mission allowed for the STS-2 crew to explore the stability margins of the vehicle&#x27;s performance. Twenty-nine planned Programmed Test Inputs (PTIs) were manually flown in the Control Stick Steering (CSS) mode, with Engle making use of his past experience in the X-15. These PTIs provided useful data for subsequent engineering modifications. Contrary to the interviewer&#x27;s assertion in a JSC Oral history conversation with Engle, he hand flew maneuvers throughout the entire entry speed range, but not for the entire duration. As a consequence of STS-1 entry anomalies, the first roll maneuver was flown manually and the elevon scheduling was adjusted to offload the body flap.

Chase 1 crewed by astronauts &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson and Kathy Sullivan escorted &quot;Columbia&quot; on final approach. Landing took place on Runway23 at Edwards Air Force Base at 21:23UTC, on November 14, 1981, after a 37-orbit flight which covered a total of over the course of 2days, 6hours, 13minutes and 12seconds.

Despite the truncated flight, more than 90% of the mission&#x27;s objectives were achieved. Moreover, modifications of the water sound suppression system at the pad, to absorb the solid rocket booster overpressure wave during launch, were effective; no tiles were lost and only 12 were damaged. &quot;Columbia&quot; was flown back to the Kennedy Space Center on November 25, 1981.

STS-2 was the first Space Shuttle flight where O-ring blow-by was observed. After the damage was discovered, another O-ring was intentionally damaged to a further degree. It was then put through a flight simulation at three times the flight pressure. It survived the test, and was endorsed as flightworthy. This same problem would occur on fourteen more Shuttle flights, before contributing to the loss of orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986.

STS-2 was the last shuttle flight to have its external fuel tank (ET) painted white. In an effort to reduce the Shuttle&#x27;s overall weight, STS-3 and all subsequent missions used an unpainted tank, saving approximately of launch weight. This lack of paint gave the ET a distinctive orange-brown color, which eventually became emblematic of the Space Shuttle.

Decades later, in 2006, some in the spaceflight community questioned whether the white paint would have prevented the ice-soaked foam shedding issue that led to the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;. NASA consensus was that it would not.

<doc id="181029" wikidata="Q83273" url="?curid=181029" title="Ibaraki Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu. Ibaraki Prefecture has a population of 2,828,086 (1 July 2023) and has a geographic area of . Ibaraki Prefecture borders Fukushima Prefecture to the north, Tochigi Prefecture to the northwest, Saitama Prefecture to the southwest, Chiba Prefecture to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the east.

Mito, the capital, is the largest city in Ibaraki Prefecture. Other major cities include Tsukuba, Hitachi, and Hitachinaka. Ibaraki Prefecture is located on Japan&#x27;s eastern Pacific coast to the northeast of Tokyo, and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Ibaraki Prefecture features Lake Kasumigaura, the second-largest lake in Japan; the Tone River, Japan&#x27;s second-longest river and largest drainage basin; and Mount Tsukuba, one of the most famous mountains in Japan. Ibaraki Prefecture is also home to Kairaku-en, one of the Three Great Gardens of Japan, and is an important center for the martial art of Aikido.

==History==

Ibaraki Prefecture was previously known as Hitachi Province. In 1871, the name of the province became Ibaraki, and in 1875 it became its current size, by annexing some districts belonging to the extinct Shimōsa Province.
===Paleolithic===
In Japanese Paleolithic, humans are believed to have started living in the present-day prefecture area before and after the deposition of the volcanic ash layer from the Aira Caldera about 24,000 years ago. At the bottom of this layer are local tools of polished stone and burnt pebbles.

===Asuka period===
During the Asuka period the provinces of Hitachi and Fusa were created. Later Fusa was divided, among them, the Shimōsa Province.

===Muromachi period===
At the beginning of the Muromachi period, in the 14th century, Kitabatake Chikafusa made of the Oda Castle his field headquarters for over a year, and wrote the Jinnō Shōtōki (Chronicles of the Authentic Lineages of the Divine Emperors), while he was at castle.
===Edo period===
During the Edo period, one of the three houses or clans originating from Tokugawa Ieyasu (Gosanke 御 三家, three houses), settled in the Mito Domain, the clan is known as the Mito Tokugawa family or simply the Mito clan. Mito Domain, was a Japanese domain of the Edo-period Hitachi Province.

In 1657, a &quot;Mitogaku&quot; was created when Tokugawa Mitsukuni, head of the Mito Domain, commissioned the compilation of the &quot;Dai Nihonshi&quot;, a book on the history of Japan.

=== Meiji period===
In Meiji era, during the Meiji Restoration, the political map changes, the old provinces are converted or merged, to create the current prefectures, in this case the Ibaraki Prefecture.

==Geography==



Ibaraki Prefecture is the northeastern part of the Kantō region, stretching between Tochigi Prefecture and the Pacific Ocean and bounded on the north and south by Fukushima Prefecture and Chiba Prefecture. It also has a border on the southwest with Saitama Prefecture. The northernmost part of the prefecture is mountainous, but most of the prefecture is a flat plain with many lakes and is part of Kantō Plain.

===Natural parks===
, 15% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park, and nine Prefectural Natural Parks. Also, Ibaraki has one Prefectural Geopark. The Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park, also includes the northeast area of Chiba Prefecture.

===Mountains===
The northern third of the prefecture is mountainous and in the center is the Tsukuba Mountains (筑波 山地). Its main mountains are: mount Yamizo with an elevation of 1022 m on the border with Fukushima and Tochigi prefectures (tripoint), mount Takasasa with 922 m, mount Tsukuba with two peaks Nyotai-San at 877 m and Nantai-San at 871 m, mount Osho at 804 m, mount Hanazono at 798 m, and mount Kaba at 709 m.

===Water system===
The main rivers that flow through the prefecture include the Tone, Naka (Ibaraki), and Kuji rivers, all of which flow into the Pacific Ocean. Before the seventeenth century, the lower reaches of the Tone were different from its current layout, and the Tone ran south and emptied into Tokyo Bay, and tributaries such as the Watarase and Kinu rivers had independent water systems.

The main tributaries of the Tone River basin are the Kinu River and Kokai River, which flow from north to south in the western part of the prefecture. The Shintone and Sakura rivers flow into Lake Nishiura.

The Edo River flows into Tokyo Bay; its source currently rises as an arm of the Tone River. In the past, the course of the Edo River was different, its source was corrected and diverted to the Tone River in the 17th century by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the city of Edo (now Tokyo) from flooding.

The Tone River, in addition to the Edo River, is part of the southern border of Ibaraki Prefecture with Chiba Prefecture, and the Watarase River, Tone River, Gongendō River, and Naka River (Saitama) in the southwestern border of Ibaraki with Saitama Prefecture. The Watarase River has become a small boundary of the southern border between Ibaraki and Tochigi prefectures.

From ancient times to the beginning of the Edo period, the lower reaches of the Tone River did not exist and the mouth of the Tone was in Tokyo Bay. On the plain was the Katori Sea, which existed in ancient times, the Lake Kasumigaura and other lagoons in present-day Chiba prefecture are remnants of that sea. Katori Sea was connected to the Kashima-nada (Pacific Ocean).

Lake Kasumigaura is currently divided into three lakes: Nishiura, Kitaura, Sotonasakaura. In addition, in the prefecture there are freshwater lagoons such as Hinuma, Senba, and Ushiku.

Fukuoka Dam, is a dam that spans the Kokai River in Tsukubamirai, it is one of the three largest dams in the Kantō region. Ryūjin Dam in Hitachiōta, is a beautiful dam on the Ryūjin River with a large pedestrian suspension bridge above the dam lake.

==Pronunciation==
The prefecture is often alternatively pronounced &quot;Ibara&quot;gi&quot; by those who speak the regional dialect known as Ibaraki-ben. However, the standard pronunciation is &quot;Ibara&quot;ki&quot;. According to the author of &quot;Not Ibara&quot;gi&quot;, Ibara&quot;ki&quot;, this is most likely due to a mishearing of the softening of the &quot;k&quot; sound in Ibaraki dialect.

==Sister regions==
Ibaraki is twinned with:
* Essonne, France

<text>STS-3 was NASA&#x27;s third Space Shuttle mission, and was the third mission for the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. It launched on March 22, 1982, and landed eight days later on March 30, 1982. The mission, crewed by Jack R. Lousma and C. Gordon Fullerton, involved extensive orbital endurance testing of &quot;Columbia&quot; itself, as well as numerous scientific experiments. STS-3 was the first shuttle launch with an unpainted external tank, and the only mission to land at the White Sands Space Harbor near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The orbiter was forced to land at White Sands due to flooding at its originally planned landing site, Edwards Air Force Base.

== Crew ==
Commander Jack R. Lousma previously flew as pilot of the second Skylab crew (Skylab 3), staying aboard the space station for 59 days from July to September 1973. Lousma had previously been selected in 1978 as Pilot for STS-2, which was then scheduled as a Skylab reboost mission. When delays in the Shuttle&#x27;s development prevented &quot;Columbia&quot; from being launched in time to rendezvous with Skylab in 1979, STS-2 Commander Fred W. Haise Jr. retired from NASA and Lousma was then moved up as Commander of STS-3. Lousma also served on the support crews for Apollo 9, 10 and 13; he was the CAPCOM during the time of the latter mission&#x27;s near-disastrous accident. He was also selected as backup Docking Module Pilot for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in 1975.

Fullerton was a rookie who transferred to NASA in 1969 after the cancelation of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. Fullerton had previous experience with the Shuttle as he had flown the shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; as Pilot alongside Haise during the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) program in 1977. He also served as part of the support crew for Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17.

== Mission summary ==
&quot;Columbia&quot; was launched from Kennedy Space Center at 16:00UTC, on March 22, 1982, the planned launch date. This was the first launch with an unpainted external tank (ET). The launch was delayed by one hour due to the failure of a heater on a nitrogen-gas ground support line. Prior to the launch, &quot;Columbia&quot; had spent only 70 days in the Orbiter Processing Facility – a record checkout time.


The primary objectives of the flight were to continue testing the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm), and to carry out extensive thermal testing of &quot;Columbia&quot; by exposing its tail, nose and top to the Sun for varying periods of time. The crew found that prolonged exposure to the Sun caused the cargo bay doors to warp slightly, preventing them from closing fully. Rolling the orbiter to balance temperatures around the orbiter resolved the issue.

In addition, in its payload bay, &quot;Columbia&quot; again carried the Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package, and OSS-l (named for the NASA Office of Space Science and Applications) which consisted of a number of instruments mounted on a Spacelab pallet, intended to obtain data on the near-Earth environment and the extent of contamination caused by the orbiter itself. Among other experiments, the OSS pallet contained a X-ray detector for measuring the polarization of X-rays emitted by solar flares. A test canister for the Small Self-Contained Payload program – also known as the Getaway Special (GAS) – was mounted on one side of the payload bay.

For the first time, a number of experiments were carried in the shuttle&#x27;s mid-deck lockers. These included an Electrophoresis Equipment Verification Test experiment to study the separation of biological components, and a Mono-disperse Latex Reactor experiment, to produce uniform micrometer-sized latex particles. The first Shuttle Student Involvement Project (SSIP) – a study of insect motion – also was carried in a mid-deck locker.

A variety of minor problems were experienced during the flight. The orbiter&#x27;s toilet malfunctioned on first use resulting in, according to Lousma, &quot;eight days of colorful flushing&quot;; one Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) overheated (but worked properly during descent); both crew members experienced some space sickness; and on March 26, 1982, three communications links were lost.

STS-3 was planned as a 7-day flight. The landing was moved to Northrop Strip (later renamed White Sands Space Harbor) at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico since the planned landing site at Edwards Air Force Base had flooded. Lousma and Fullerton chose to land at White Sands instead of the new Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) because they had trained there. A large-scale equipment movement (reportedly &quot;40 train carloads&quot;) from Edwards Air Force Base to White Sands was undertaken before and during the mission, to ensure that a landing could be fully supported. Although time-sensitive equipment movements of this nature were originally to be handled by Air Force cargo planes, NASA altered those plans and moved the equipment in two dedicated trains over the - distance via the Santa Fe Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad. The choice to move the support equipment by rail saved NASA approximately US$2 million in transportation costs. High winds at White Sands reduced visibility and delayed the landing by a day. As all mission objectives had been accomplished, the crew enjoyed what Lousma described as &quot;an extra day in our world&#x27;s favorite vacation spot ... We finally had a chance to look out the window and enjoy being there&quot;.

As on the previous day&#x27;s wave off, strong westerly high level winds were in excess of system verification values. As a result, &quot;Columbia&quot; had to fly a less desirable high &quot;right base&quot; turn onto final approach instead of the more usual and forgiving overhead pattern. At this stage in the test program the Orbiter had significantly less electronic energy management information available to the crew than on later missions. With the runway visible only on his side Fullerton called the turn in for his commander. Their escorting T-38s were led by astronaut Dick Covey and NASA photographer Pete Stanley. The final approach was in part flown by the shuttle&#x27;s autopilot, but the autoland software was not complete so it could not include an automatic landing. Rolling out on final approach, the autopilot was reengaged, and responded by closing the speedbrakes (despite the orbiter being on profile), resulting in increased speed. The autopilot then commanded full speedbrakes, and kept oscillating like this for some time. Lousma left the autopilot activated in order to gather data on its behavior, but disconnected it again at a very late stage to touch down manually. The landing was also one of the more dramatic of the program, with the landing gear deploying at an altitude of at a speed of and locking just five seconds before touchdown. Early automatic speed brake closure had resulted in high speed on the inner glideslope and Lousma opted to touchdown fast rather than excessively long. The nose then began to lower at greater than planned airspeed and raised again right before nose-gear touchdown. Touchdown occurred at 16:04:46UTC on March 30, 1982, on runway 17 at Northrop Strip.

Former Administrator of NASA Charles F. Bolden Jr. stated that Lousma was trained to disengage autoland by moving the control stick. He rolled the stick, but did not pitch it sufficiently, so autoland was still partially engaged until Fullerton warned him, causing Lousma to pitch up; Bolden, who had worked on the autoland system early in his astronaut career prior to his first space flight, stated in 2004 that the crew &quot;saved the vehicle&quot; by doing so.

STS-3 was the only shuttle mission to land at White Sands Missile Range. The unexpectedly difficult landing and post flight conditions damaged the shuttle, requiring extensive repair at KSC. So much gypsum dust covered &quot;Columbia&quot; that Bolden recalled, &quot;I flew it several flights later on my first flight, STS-61-C, and when we got on orbit, there was &quot;still&quot; gypsum coming out of everything! They thought they had cleaned it ... but it was just &quot;unreal&quot; what it had done!&quot; Dust continued to be found in the spacecraft for the rest of its career.

&quot;Columbia&quot; made 130 orbits and traveled during its 8day, 0 hour, 4minute, 46second flight. A total of 36 thermal protection tiles were lost and 19 were damaged. The orbiter was returned to Kennedy Space Center on April 6, 1982. STS-3 was the last mission for which NASA named a complete backup crew.

While on a post-mission goodwill tour in Beijing, Lousma displayed a photo he had taken from space of a &quot;beautiful emerald-colored lake&quot; in China and was surprised by the audience reaction. He later learned that the picture was likely of a secret atomic test site for the Chinese nuclear weapons program.

== Mission insignia ==
On the mission patch, &quot;Columbia&quot; is shown emerging from a star, representing the bright aspiration of space exploration. The orbiter is seen grabbing a PDP with the Canadarm, and is shown with many experiments in its payload bay. The three large orange triangular points of the mission patch indicate the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="181035" wikidata="Q132720" url="?curid=181035" title="Yamanashi Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūbu region of Honshu. Yamanashi Prefecture has a population of 817,192 (1 January 2019) and has a geographic area of 4,465 km2 (1,724 sq mi). Yamanashi Prefecture borders Saitama Prefecture to the northeast, Nagano Prefecture to the northwest, Shizuoka Prefecture to the southwest, Kanagawa Prefecture to the southeast, and Tokyo to the east.

Kōfu is the capital and largest city of Yamanashi Prefecture, with other major cities including Kai, Minamiarupusu, and Fuefuki. Yamanashi Prefecture is one of only eight landlocked prefectures, and the majority of the population lives in the central Kōfu Basin surrounded by the Akaishi Mountains, with 27% of its total land area being designated as Natural Parks. Yamanashi Prefecture is home to many of the highest mountains in Japan, and Mount Fuji, the tallest mountain in Japan and cultural icon of the country, is partially located in Yamanashi Prefecture on the border with Shizuoka Prefecture.

== Etymology ==
The name Yamanashi Prefecture literally means Pear Mountain. Nashi specifically refers to a local Japanese cultivar of the Asian pear, &quot;Pyrus pyrifolia&quot;.

== History ==
===Pre-history to the 14th century===
As in most other Japanese regions, prehistoric society in Yamanashi progressed through the hunting, fishing and gathering stage of the Jōmon period, then the rice-producing stage of the Yayoi period and subsequent village and regional formation. The Maruyama and Choshizuka Kofun (earthen burial mounds) located on Sone Hill of Nakamichi Town (Southern Kōfu) are believed to have been built from the end of the 4th century. From these remains it can be assumed that the people of Sone Hill had great influence.

During the Heian period, Kai Province was created in this area.

===15th to 19th centuries===
Among the many Kaigenji generations, those of the Takeda, Ogasawara, and Nanbu families were particularly prosperous. During the Sengoku period of the 16th century, Takeda Shingen attained the status of daimyō and built Tsuzuji Mansion and the Yōgai Castle in Kōfu. From this base, he attempted to unify and control Japan.

After Takeda&#x27;s death in 1582, Kai-no-Kuni came under the control of the Oda and Toyotomi clans before being subsumed into the Tokugawa shogunate during the Edo period. Beneath the Edo shogunate, the Kōfu clan (based in Kuninaka, or Central and Western Yamanashi) and the Yamura clan (based in Gunnai, or Eastern Yamanashi) were formed, but in 1724 the area came under the direct control of the Shogunate. With the development of the Kōshū Kaidō (highway) and Fuji River transport, goods, materials and culture flowed into the region.

By the mid-19th century, the contradictions of military government and clan system caused stability to erode and resistance to erupt across Japan, paving the way for the Meiji Restoration of 1868.

===Meiji Restoration (1868) to end of World War II (1945)===
During the Boshin War, the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma on the 29 March 1868 was a significant battle between pro-Imperial and Tokugawa shogunate forces immediately prior to the Imperial Forces march on Edo Castle. Preceding the Kōshū-Katsunuma battle, Kōfu Castle had been captured by troops loyal to the Emperor Meiji.

The province was renamed Kōfu Prefecture in 1869 and then Yamanashi Prefecture in 1871. The anniversary of this event on November 20, 1872, is now celebrated as Prefectural Citizen&#x27;s Day in Yamanashi.

In the early part of the Meiji period (1868–1911), industrial promotion policies furthered sericulture, silk textile production and wine making industries. In 1903, after seven years of construction, including the building of a nearly three mile long tunnel at the Sasago Pass, the Chūō Railway Line from Hachiōji and central Tokyo finally reached Kōfu. The reduced journey times to the capital and the port of Yokohama brought significant change to local industry and culture.

Agricultural production in farming communities was still on a small scale at the turn of the century and land reforms had yet to be introduced. From the 1920s however, tenancy and contract disputes between landowners and farmers in Yamanashi grew increasingly common.

In 1926, the Minobu Railway Line connecting Kōfu with Shizuoka Prefecture opened, bringing an end to Fuji River transportation. The Koumi Line connecting Kobuchizawa to Kiyosato was opened by Japanese National Railways (JNR) in 1933, providing access to hitherto remote highland areas on the slopes of Mt. Yatsugatake in the North of the prefecture.

===1945 to present===
The capital city, Kōfu, suffered extensive damage during a major air raid on the night of 6 July 1945. From 1945 onwards, as part of economic initiatives introduced under the post war Government of Occupation, agricultural land reforms significantly increased the number of individual farms and promoted fruit farming and viticulture throughout the prefecture. At first with limited success in 1946, but on a much more sustained basis in 1951, dairy farming, introduced by American Paul Rusch, became a feature of highland pastures surrounding the town of Kiyosato.

Small scale manufacturing industries and commerce grew at rapid speed during the expansion of the post-war Japanese economy. The 1982 opening of the Chūō Expressway also led to significant growth in service industries, transport logistics and tourism.

In common with many similar sized cities during the 1990s, rapid growth in car ownership, out of town shopping, and improved transportation links to Tokyo, caused a drop in commercial activity and land values in the center of the prefectural capital Kōfu. To counterbalance this trend the prefectural government launched a city center revitalization plan in 2008, promoting downtown tourist attractions such as redeveloped land North of Kōfu station, Maizuru Castle Park and new residential, cultural and government office facilities.

Planned changes in transportation infrastructure also promise to significantly impact the Yamanashi economy in the coming decades; under mountains in the eastern part of the prefecture is a completed 42.8 km section of the SCMaglev test track, a section of the planned Chūō Shinkansen.

The maglev line is designed to ultimately connect Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka with a station also planned to the South of Kōfu.

Central Government permission to proceed with an extension to the existing test track was granted on May 27, 2011. At the end of 2013 construction was already well advanced as far as Fuefuki.

JR Central is considering opening a demonstration service from a new station in Kōfu by the 2020 Summer Olympics so that visitors can also ride on the experimental track through the Yamanashi mountains.

== Geography ==
Yamanashi Prefecture is bordered by Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefecture, Saitama Prefecture, Shizuoka Prefecture, and Nagano Prefecture. The prefecture is landlocked, with high mountains surrounding the central Kōfu Basin. Mount Fuji and the Fuji Five Lakes region is located on the southern border with Shizuoka. Mount Fuji provides rain shadow effects, and as a result, the prefecture receives only about 818 mm of rainfall a year.As of April 1, 2012, 27% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Minami Alps National Parks; Yatsugatake-Chūshin Kōgen Quasi-National Park; and Minami Alps Koma and Shibireko Prefectural Natural Parks.

78% of the prefecture is covered by forests, making it one of the most densely wooded prefectures in Japan. Land cultivated for agriculture is mainly restricted to the lower elevations of the Kōfu basin.

===Cities===

Thirteen cities are located in Yamanashi Prefecture:

== Economy ==
Yamanashi has a sizable industrial base in and around Kōfu city, with jewelry and robotics industries being particularly prominent. The headquarters of FANUC, manufacturer of factory automation systems, is based in Oshino in the south of the prefecture.

The prefecture is also host to numerous fruit farms and vineyards. Yamanashi is one of the major fruit producing regions in Japan, being the top domestic producer of grapes, peaches, plums as well as wine.

In addition, roughly 40% of the mineral water bottled in Japan comes from Yamanashi, mainly from around the Southern Alps, Mount Fuji, and Mitsutōge areas. The quality of the water sources in the Southern Alps prompted Suntory Group to open the Hakushu distillery in the northern Yamanashi town of Hokuto.

== Population ==

Per Japanese census data, Yamanashi prefecture had negative population growth from 1950 to 1970 and again in the 21st century, with the population peaking at roughly 890,000 around the turn of the millennium.

== Tourism ==

The natural scenery and cultural sights of Yamanashi are popular destinations for both domestic and international tourists due to the prefecture&#x27;s proximity to the crowded Tokyo conurbation and ease of access by road and rail. Mount Fuji, the Fuji Five Lakes region, the highland resort region of Kiyosato, the city of Kōfu, the Senga Falls, Koshu wineries, the temple of Erin-ji in Koshu, and the Kuonji Temple at Minobu are a few of the most popular places to visit.

The Fuji-Q Highland amusement park at Fujiyoshida with roller coasters Eejanaika, and Takabisha, the world&#x27;s steepest roller coaster, is also a popular destination for day trips. It also features Do-Dodonpa, the world&#x27;s fastest accelerating roller coaster. At one point, it was also the world&#x27;s fastest roller coaster before Cedar Point&#x27;s Top Thrill Dragster took the record in 2003.

The natural topography of the region makes Yamanashi popular with mountaineering, hiking and climbing enthusiasts throughout the year. The highest mountain in Japan, Mount Fuji, at and the second highest mountain in Japan, Mount Kita, at are both located within Yamanashi. The Mt. Fuji summer hiking season in July and August attracts thousands of overnight hikers typically starting at the Fifth Station in the late evening and climbing through the night to witness the sunrise at the summit.

Although not as tall, Mount Minobu, a popular place for Buddhist pilgrimage, offers extensive views from the summit of the mountain. Parts of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park, and Minami Alps National Park are all located in Yamanashi.

Given the area&#x27;s volcanic activity, natural hot springs, or onsens, are found in abundance. Some of the more well known are Shimobe Onsen, Isawa Onsen and Yamanami Onsen.

The mascot of the prefecture is Hishimaru (菱丸), a Kai Ken dog who is based on the local Sengoku-era daimyō Takeda Shingen. He wears a kabuto with the crest of the Takeda clan.

<text>STS-4 was the fourth NASA Space Shuttle mission, and also the fourth for Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Crewed by Ken Mattingly and Henry Hartsfield, the mission launched on June 27, 1982, and landed a week later on July 4, 1982. Due to parachute malfunctions, the SRBs were not recovered.

STS-4 was the final test flight for the Space Shuttle; it was thereafter officially declared to be operational. &quot;Columbia&quot; carried numerous scientific payloads during the mission, as well as military missile detection systems.

== Crew ==
STS-4, being the last test flight of the Space Shuttle, was also the last to carry a crew of two astronauts. Commander Ken Mattingly had previously flown as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 16, and was also the original Command Module Pilot for Apollo 13 before being replaced by his backup, Jack Swigert, after being exposed to German measles. Hartsfield was a rookie astronaut who had transferred to NASA in 1969 after the cancellation of the Air Force&#x27;s Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. He had previously served as a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) on Apollo 16, all three Skylab missions, and STS-1. Both men had graduated from Auburn University, the only time an entire Space Shuttle flight crew were graduates of the same university. 

=== Backup crew ===
From STS-4 onwards, NASA halted the appointment and training of complete backup flight crews. Instead, individual flight crew members were assigned backups who could take their place within the prime crew. The decision on whether to appoint a reserve crew member was made on a per-flight basis by flight management teams at Johnson Space Center. Consequently, the last NASA flight to have a full-time backup crew was STS-3.

=== Support crew ===
* Roy D. Bridges Jr. (entry CAPCOM)
* Michael L. Coats
* S. David Griggs (ascent CAPCOM)
* George D. Nelson
* Brewster H. Shaw

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
STS-4 launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on June 27, 1982, at 15:00:00UTC, with Ken Mattingly as commander and Henry Hartsfield as pilot. This mission marked the first time the Space Shuttle launched precisely at its scheduled launch time. It was also the last research and development flight in the program, after which NASA considered the shuttle operational. After this flight, &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; ejection seats were deactivated, and shuttle crews did not wear pressure suits again until STS-26 in 1988.

STS-4&#x27;s cargo consisted of the first Getaway Special (GAS) payloads, including nine scientific experiments provided by students from Utah State University, and a classified U.S. Air Force payload. A secret mission control center in Sunnyvale, California participated in monitoring the flight. Mattingly, an active-duty naval officer, later described the classified payload – two sensors for detecting missile launches – as a &quot;rinky-dink collection of minor stuff they wanted to fly&quot;. The payload failed to operate. The National Reconnaissance Office intended to fly DAMON, a secret payload intended to replace KH-9 HEXAGON, but it was canceled in December 1980.

In the shuttle&#x27;s mid-deck, a Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System and the Mono-disperse Latex Reactor flew for the second time. The crew conducted a lightning survey with hand-held cameras, and performed medical experiments on themselves for two student projects. They also operated the Remote Manipulator System (Canadarm) with an instrument called the Induced Environment Contamination Monitor mounted on its end, designed to obtain information on gases or particles being released by the orbiter in flight.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed on July 4, 1982, at 16:09:31UTC, on the concrete runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, the first orbital Shuttle landing on a concrete runway. This time the lead escorting T-38 &quot;Chase 1&quot; was piloted by Guy Gardner with crewmate Jerry L. Ross. President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan greeted the crew upon arrival. Following the landing, President Reagan gave a speech to the crowd gathered at Edwards, during which he declared the Space Shuttle operational. He was followed by remarks from Mattingly and Hartsfield and a flyover of the new shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), headed for KSC.

The flight lasted 7days, 1hour, 9minutes, and 31seconds, and covered a total distance of in 112 complete orbits. The mission achieved all objectives except for the Air Force payload, but the SRBs were lost when their main parachutes failed, causing the empty casings to impact the ocean at high velocity and sink. This and STS-51-L were the only missions where the SRBs were not recovered. &quot;Columbia&quot; returned to KSC on July 15, 1982.

== Mission insignia ==
The path of the red, white, and blue streak on the mission patch forms the numeral &quot;4&quot;, indicating the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="181040" wikidata="Q5584989" url="?curid=181040" title="Gordon Chung-Hoon">
<text>Gordon Paiea Chung-Hoon (July 25, 1910 – July 24, 1979) was an admiral in the United States Navy, who served during World War II and was the first Asian American flag officer. He received the Navy Cross and Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism as commanding officer of from May 1944 to October 1945.

==Early life==

He was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on July 25, 1910. His father, William Chung-Hoon Jr., was a county treasurer and his mother Agnes Punana, a Hawaiian, was a member of the Kaʻahumanu Society. Chung-Hoon was the fourth of five children born to his family. He graduated from Punahou School in 1929.

==Military career==
Chung-Hoon attended the United States Naval Academy and graduated in May 1934, becoming the first Asian American graduate of the academy. While a student he gained national prominence as the football team&#x27;s halfback and punter, and in 1934 starred on the team that broke an 11-year winless streak against the Army team. In 1958 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&#x27;s Silver Anniversary All-American issue featured Chung-Hoon as one of its 1933 football stars.

After graduation Chung-Hoon was assigned to the cruiser as an ensign. As of January 1937 he was serving as an ensign aboard the destroyer . He was a lieutenant (junior grade) on as of January 1939.

===World War II===

Chung-Hoon served on the battleship as a lieutenant, but was in Honolulu on a weekend pass during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Chung-Hoon heard the attack from Honolulu and attempted to return to his ship but was delayed by roadblocks and traffic jams. By the time he reached the &quot;Arizona&quot; the ship had already exploded and sunk.

After the sinking of &quot;Arizona&quot;, Chung-Hoon served as a naval liaison officer with coastal artillery before becoming executive officer on a destroyer in 1942, working convoy details in the Atlantic. He also served on board the cruiser .

From May 1944 to October 1945 Chung-Hoon commanded the destroyer . In the spring of 1945, &quot;Sigsbee&quot; assisted in the destruction of 20 enemy planes while screening an aircraft carrier strike force off the Japanese island of Kyūshū. On April 14, 1945, while on radar picket station off Okinawa, a kamikaze crashed into &quot;Sigsbee&quot;, reducing her starboard engine to and knocking out the ship&#x27;s port engine and steering control. Despite the damage, then Commander Chung-Hoon kept his antiaircraft batteries delivering &quot;prolonged and effective fire&quot; against the continuing Japanese air attack while simultaneously directing the damage control efforts that allowed &quot;Sigsbee&quot; to make port under her own power.

The damage had been severe enough that Admiral William Halsey, Jr. told Chung-Hoon to scuttle the ship. However, Chung-Hoon declined to do so, telling the admiral &quot;No, I have kids on here that can&#x27;t swim and I&#x27;m not putting them in the water. I&#x27;ll take her back.&quot;

The next day Chung-Hoon led a burial at sea for the dead. One crewmate said of Chung-Hoon during the burial, &quot;I often remember that the only man tough enough not to duck, was also the only man tender enough to cry.&quot;

For Chung-Hoon&#x27;s service aboard &quot;Sigsbee&quot; he received the Navy Cross and the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and extraordinary heroism.

During the war, two of Chung-Hoon&#x27;s brothers served in the army in the Pacific theater.

===Postwar ===

After &quot;Sigsbee&quot; was inactivated following the end of the war, Chung-Hoon was transferred to Pearl Harbor in November as officer in charge of the Special Activities Division of Service Force, Pacific Fleet, responsible for various administrative duties.

From August 16, 1950, to March 7, 1952, Chung-Hoon commanded the destroyer during the Korean War. Under Chung-Hoon&#x27;s command the destroyer operated as part of the 7th Fleet, patrolling off the coast of Korea and taking part in gun bombardments.

He was promoted to the rank of captain on 1 July 1953.

He served as the Commanding Officer of Afloat Training Group Middle Pacific from March to June of 1954, where he directed the training and certification of Hawaii based ships. 

Chung-Hoon served as captain of the guided missile testing ship between July 1956 and August 1957. He was subsequently transferred to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., his last post. Chung-Hoon retired in October 1959 and was promoted to rear admiral upon retirement, making him the first Asian American flag officer of the United States Navy.

==Later life and legacy==

He was appointed to be the director of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture by the first Governor of the State of Hawaii, William F. Quinn, and held that position between January 1961 and June 1963. Chung-Hoon subsequently worked as a Realtor. He made a foray into politics by running as a Republican for one of the four seats representing the Hawaii 7th State Senate District in 1966, but finished fifth in the primary. Chung-Hoon died on July 24, 1979, at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu.

The , commissioned in 2004, is named for him.

== Personal life ==
Chung-Hoon first married Anita Corson while serving aboard &quot;Dent&quot; in December 1938; she died of cancer in 1950. He married Ola Luckey in 1952, and later retired in order to spend more time with her. Luckey died of cancer in April 1960, months after they had returned to Honolulu following his retirement. He married his third wife, travel consultant Jean Carlisle (died 2001), in January 1961, adopting her son, Perry White; Chung-Hoon was otherwise childless.

<doc id="181042" wikidata="Q258825" url="?curid=181042" title="Patty Murray">
<text>Patricia Lynn Murray (; born October 11, 1950) is an American politician serving in her sixth term as a United States senator from Washington, beginning her tenure in 1993, and is the state&#x27;s senior senator. She also served as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 2023 to 2025. 

A member of the Democratic Party, Murray served in the Washington State Senate from 1989 to 1993. She was Washington&#x27;s first female U.S. senator and is the first woman in American history to hold the position of president pro tempore. Murray is also the youngest senator to occupy the office of president pro tempore in more than five decades.

Born and raised in Bothell, Washington, Murray graduated from Washington State University with a degree in physical education. She worked as a pre-school teacher and, later, as a parenting teacher at Shoreline Community College. A long-time advocate for environmental and education issues, Murray was elected to serve on her local school board in King County. She ran for the Washington State Senate in 1988, and defeated two-term incumbent Bill Kiskaddon. She served one term before launching a campaign for the United States Senate in 1992. She has been re-elected five times, most recently in 2022.

As a senator, Murray has been a part of party leadership since 2001, having served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Conference secretary, and assistant Democratic leader. She currently chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Before assuming her current roles, Murray has previously chaired at various times, the Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Murray garnered national attention in 2013, when she and Republican representative Paul Ryan announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Murray is currently the third-most senior senator, the most senior Senate Democrat, the longest-serving female senator ever, and the dean of Washington&#x27;s congressional delegation.
==Early life and education==
One of seven children, Murray was born in Bothell, Washington, a daughter of David L. Johns and Beverly A. McLaughlin. Her mother was an accountant. Her father served in World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart. Her ancestry includes Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian. When she was a teenager, her family was forced to apply for welfare assistance when her father became disabled due to multiple sclerosis. He had been the manager of a five-and-ten store. Murray attended Saint Brendan Catholic School as a young child.

Murray received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education from Washington State University in 1972.

== Early career ==
Murray was a preschool teacher for several years, and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College from 1984 to 1987. As a citizen-lobbyist for environmental and educational issues, Murray has said that a state representative once told her she could not make a difference because she was just a &quot;mom in tennis shoes&quot;. The phrase stuck, and she later used it in her successful campaigns for the Shoreline School District board of directors (1985–89), Washington State Senate (1989–93), and United States Senate (1993–present). Murray was successful in gathering grassroots support to strike down proposed preschool program budget cuts.

In 1988, Murray unseated two-term incumbent Republican state Senator Bill Kiskaddon.

==U.S. Senate (1993–present)==
Murray has served in the United States Senate since her election in 1992. For the 118th Congress in 2023, she was elected Senate president pro tempore after Patrick Leahy retired from the Senate; the office is usually held by the longest served senior senator of the majority party, but Senator Dianne Feinstein (who was also elected in 1992, but took her seat a few months prior to Murray because she won a special election, rather than a regularly scheduled one) declined the post due to ailing health, leaving Murray the next in line for the position. Murray would ultimately become the most senior serving Democrat upon Feinstein&#x27;s death later that year. Murray is the first woman to hold the position. 

Murray is the first woman, and 33rd senator overall, to have cast 10,000 votes in the Senate, having reached the threshold on April 20, 2023.

=== Elections ===

==== 1992 ====

In 1992, Murray announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate after &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; published a series of articles alleging that incumbent Democratic Senator Brock Adams had sexually assaulted a number of women. Adams denied the allegations, but his popularity weakened considerably and he chose to retire rather than risk losing the seat for his party. Murray defeated Congressman Don Bonker for the Democratic nomination. In the general election she defeated Republican Congressman Rod Chandler, 54% to 46%, despite being outspent by a wide margin. Chandler seemed to have the upper hand in one of the debates until he responded to Murray&#x27;s criticism for spending $120,000 on congressional mailings during rising unemployment and declining family income as part of an economic recession by quoting the Roger Miller song &quot;Dang Me&quot;. Chandler was further damaged by the unpopularity in the Pacific Northwest of President George H. W. Bush, who was largely blamed for the recession.







==== 1998 ====

In 1998, Murray faced Congresswoman Linda Smith, a staunch conservative and maverick who was one of nine House Republicans to vote against confirming U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich in early 1997, opposed gay rights and viewed homosexuality as a &quot;morally unfit inclination&quot;. Murray heavily outspent her and was reelected, 58% to 42%.









==== 2004 ====

In 2004, Murray faced Republican U.S. Representative George Nethercutt. Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt&#x27;s broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unexpectedly unseated Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state&#x27;s population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the Cascades since Miles Poindexter in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start and his campaign never gained much traction. Murray was reelected, 55% to 43%.



==== 2010 ====

The 2010 election was the first Senate election to be held under the new blanket primary since Initiative 872 had passed in 2004. In the August 17 primary, Murray appeared on the ballot alongside four other Democratic candidates, six Republican candidates, a Reform Party candidate and three independent candidates. She received a plurality, 46%, and advanced to the general election along with her main Republican challenger, former state Senator and two-time gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi, who received 33%. Leading up to the election, several prominent Washington State newspapers endorsed Murray. Rossi conceded the election to Murray on November 4, 2010, two days after election day. She won 52.36% of the vote to Rossi&#x27;s 47.64%, Murray&#x27;s smallest reelection margin to date.









==== 2016 ====

Murray ran for a fifth term in 2016. She faced three Democratic challengers in the August 2, 2016, primary election. In the general election, she faced King County Councilman Chris Vance. She defeated Vance, 59% to 41%.










==== 2022 ====

In the 2022 election, Murray won reelection to a sixth term over Republican Tiffany Smiley.









===119th United States Congress Committee assignments ===

* Committee on Appropriations (ranking member)
* Committee on the Budget
* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
* Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs

===Caucus memberships===
* Senate Oceans Caucus
* Senate Aerospace Caucus
*Afterschool Caucuses
*Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus
* Congressional Coalition on Adoption

===Legislation===
On February 28, 2013, Murray introduced the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act into the Senate. The bill would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in the state of Washington unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors. Murray argued that the bill should be passed in order to help the tourism industry in the area while protecting the lookout point in question. The bill would be &quot;a very small step in what will be a very long recovery&quot; and would &quot;provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area&quot;, she said, referring to the area&#x27;s recovery from the casualties and damage caused by the 2014 Oso mudslide. The bill passed both the House and the Senate.

==Political positions==
=== Abortion ===
Murray supports abortion rights. She opposed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill criminalizing abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, saying on the Senate floor: &quot;I oppose the fact that we are still voting on whether women and doctors are best equipped to make health care decisions — or politicians here in D. C.&quot; She also voted against restricting US funding for UN family planning programs.

=== Agriculture ===
In March 2019, Murray was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers &quot;have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices&quot; and urging his department to &quot;strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program&quot;.

In June 2019, Murray and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General (IG) Phyllis K. Fong a letter requesting that the IG investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserting that not to do so would mean these &quot;actions could be perceived as a part of this administration’s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists&quot;.

=== Environmental policy ===
In October 2017, Murray was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt&#x27;s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal&#x27;s proposal used &quot;mathematical sleights of hand to overstate the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized&quot;, and that denying science and fabricating math would fail to &quot;satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing&quot;.

In February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Murray was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&quot;.

=== Federal budget ===
On December 10, 2013, Murray announced that she and Republican Representative Paul Ryan had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.

The deal was scheduled to be voted on first in the House and then the Senate. Some believed House Democrats would pass the deal as a way to reduce the sequester cuts, but the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Chris Van Hollen, said on December 12, 2013, that members of his party were outraged that House Republicans were planning to adjourn without addressing unemployment benefits. Van Hollen said that &quot;it is too early to say&quot; whether a majority of House Democrats would vote for the budget bill. The deal was also unpopular with many conservatives.

Murray put the controversial intelligence ports-data project Global Trade Exchange into the Homeland Security budget.

=== Foreign relations ===
==== Central America ====
In April 2019, Murray was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Trump, encouraging him &quot;to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America&quot;, asserting that Trump had &quot;consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance&quot; since becoming president, and that he was &quot;personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity&quot; through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding&#x27;s helping to improve conditions in those countries.

==== Myanmar ====
Murray condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and called for a stronger response to the crisis.

==== Russia ====
In December 2010, Murray voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Murray was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration &quot;now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America&#x27;s nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.

====Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan====

In October 2002, Murray was one of 21 Democrats in the Senate to vote against the War Authorization for invading Iraq. Quoted from her Senate speech:

Mr. President, if we do take action in Iraq, there is no doubt that our armed forces will prevail. We will win a war with Iraq decisively, and, God willing, we will win it quickly. But what happens after the war? That will have as big an impact on our future peace and security. Will we be obligated to rebuild Iraq? If so, how? Our economy is reeling, our budget is in deficit, and we have no estimate of the cost of rebuilding. And with whom? As &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Tom Friedman points out, there&#x27;s a retail store mentality that suggests to some—if &quot;you break it, you buy it.&quot;
In December 2002, speaking to students at Columbia River High School in Vancouver, Murray made a number of remarks about Osama bin Laden as she attempted to explain why the US had such problems winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world, and how bin Laden had garnered support among some in the Middle East. Among other things, she said that bin Laden has &quot;been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building daycare facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. He&#x27;s made their lives better. We have not done that.&quot; This attracted attention from political opponents, who argued that this was inaccurate and constituted support for bin Laden.

=== Health care ===
In 2014, Murray introduced legislation in the Senate called The Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act. The bill would require hospitals that receive federal funding to provide rape victims with emergency contraception. In July 2014, she introduced an amendment to a bill in the Senate to require health insurance plans to offer contraceptive coverage to patients regardless of employers&#x27; beliefs, religious or otherwise. Her amendment required 60 votes to move forward, and all but three Republicans voted against the measure.

In December 2018, Murray was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steven Mnuchin, arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to &quot;increase health care costs for millions of consumers, while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions&quot;. The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and &quot;re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress&quot;.

=== Labor ===
In July 2019, Murray signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald&#x27;s that detailed workplace violence incidents, including interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald&#x27;s could and must &quot;do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace&quot;.

In response to a February 2021 report by the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of a minimum wage increase, Murray said: &quot;Today&#x27;s report makes clear what we&#x27;ve known all along: raising the minimum wage — which hasn&#x27;t increased since 2009 — to $15 an hour isn&#x27;t just the right thing to do, it&#x27;s good policy.&quot; She was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a federal raise of the minimum wage to $15 per hour in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

=== LGBTQIA+ rights ===
In 1996, Murray voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage by limiting the definition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman. DOMA was ruled unconstitutional in 2015, and later in 2023, she reversed her previous position and spoke in support of the Respect for Marriage Act, which officially repealed DOMA.

In September 2014, Murray was one of 69 members of the House and Senate to sign a letter to then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.

=== Opioids ===
In March 2017, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter led by Ed Markey to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that noted that 12% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form of substance abuse disorder, in addition to one third of treatment for opioid and other substance-use disorders in the United States being financed through Medicaid, and opined that the American Health Care Act could &quot;very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders&quot; due to the insurance coverage lacking adequate funds for care, often causing people to abandon treatment.

=== Veterans ===
In August 2013, Murray was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department, warning of some payday lenders &quot;offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law&quot;, and asserting that service members, along with their families, &quot;deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound&quot;.

In December 2018, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, calling it &quot;appalling that the VA is not conducting oversight of its own outreach efforts&quot;, in spite of suicide prevention being the VA&#x27;s highest clinical priority, and requesting Wilkie &quot;consult with experts with proven track records of successful public and mental health outreach campaigns, with a particular emphasis on how those individuals measure success&quot;.

=== Gun control ===
Murray supports gun control. She supports a national assault weapons ban.

===Other positions===
In May 2006, Murray, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611). The bill includes provisions to improve border security, increases fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, and creates a guest worker program (which includes an almost doubling of the number of H-1B visas) and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country. The bill, with support from some in the GOP leadership, passed 62–36.

Murray repeatedly cosponsored legislation to create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in the Washington Cascade Range. She eventually succeeded, with the bill signed by President George W. Bush on May 8, 2008. Murray has also supported legislation to increase the size of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, also in the Washington Cascades.

On January 30, 2008, Murray endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. One month later, the Washington Democratic caucus awarded two-thirds of its delegates to Barack Obama and one-third to Clinton. After Clinton&#x27;s June 7 concession, Murray endorsed Obama.

On May 28, 2021, Murray abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission. She cited a &quot;personal family matter&quot; for the abstention. Murray had expressed support for the commission and had talked about her experience on the day of the demonstration.

==Electoral history==

==Personal life==
Murray is married to Rob Murray and has two grown children: Sara and Randy. She lives on Whidbey Island.

On August 2, 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that in 1994, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina attempted to grope his then-freshman colleague Patty Murray of Washington. &quot;The Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; reported that Murray asked for, and received, an apology. Through a spokeswoman, Murray declined to comment further on the incident.

<text>The Cleveland Rockers were a Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Cleveland, that played from 1997 until 2003. The Rockers were one of the original eight franchises of the WNBA, which started in 1997. The owner was Gordon Gund, who at the time also owned the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers. In October 2003, Gund announced that his Gund Arena Company would no longer operate the Rockers. The team folded after the 2003 season as the league was not able to find new ownership for the team.

==History==
The city of Cleveland was granted one of the original 8 franchises of the WNBA in October 1996. The Cleveland Rockers got their nickname from Cleveland&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1997, they started with such players like Isabelle Fijalkowski and former Harlem Globetrotters member Lynette Woodard, who had been the first female player in Globetrotter history.

The Rockers finished 15–13 in the first WNBA season ever, missing the playoffs in 1997. In 1998, the Rockers went 20–10 and won the Eastern Conference title. However, the Rockers lost to the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA semifinals (before the WNBA split the playoffs by conference).

The Rockers had their best regular season in 2001, going 22–10 and winning the Eastern Conference, getting the No. 1 seed. Their relentless defense allowed just 55.9 points per game that year, a record that still stands. But the Rockers would be upended by the Charlotte Sting in the 1st round, losing 2 games to 1. The 2002 Rockers fell by 12 games over the previous year&#x27;s mark, posting a 10–22 record. In 2003, the Rockers would go 17–17, good enough for the No. 4 seed in the East; however, they would fall in the first round of the playoffs to the eventual champion Detroit Shock, 2–1. 2003 was the Rockers&#x27; last playoff appearance, and is the only team in the WNBA to qualify for the playoffs in their last season of play.

==Folding==
After the 2002 season, the Gunds decided to buy the Rockers from the WNBA, seemingly ensuring the Rockers&#x27; future. However, despite fielding competitive teams and having decent attendance for most games, the Gund family decided they did not wish to operate the Rockers after the 2003 season, citing a lack of revenue and lackluster attendance. No local ownership was found for the team, forcing the Rockers to fold in December 2003, and the players went to the other teams in the league via a dispersal draft in January 2004. The Rockers ceased operation after seven seasons, posting an all-time record of 108–112. A WNBA franchise would next fold in 2008 when the Houston Comets ceased operations because of lack of ownership.

==Potential revival== 
In 2025, it was reported that the Rockers would possibly return in 2028 as an expansion franchise.

<text>STS-5 was the fifth NASA Space Shuttle mission and the fifth flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. It launched on November 11, 1982, and landed five days later on November 16, 1982. STS-5 was the first Space Shuttle mission to deploy communications satellites into orbit, and the first officially &quot;operational&quot; Space Shuttle mission.

== Crew ==
=== Support crew ===
* Roy D. Bridges Jr. (entry CAPCOM)
* Michael Coats
* Richard O. Covey
* Bryan D. O&#x27;Connor
* Jon McBride
* Robert L. Stewart (ascent CAPCOM)

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission summary ==
&quot;Columbia&quot; launched on schedule from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) at 07:19:00a.m. EST, on November 11, 1982. The shuttle carried a crew of four – the largest spacecraft crew up to that time – and the first two commercial communications satellites to be flown aboard a shuttle.

The commercial satellites were deployed successfully and subsequently propelled into their operational geosynchronous orbits by McDonnell Douglas PAM-D kick motors. The two satellites were SBS-3, owned by Satellite Business Systems, and Anik-C3, owned by Telesat Canada; both were Hughes-built HS-376-series satellites. In addition, STS-5 carried a West German-sponsored microgravity Getaway Special (GAS) experiment canister in the payload bay. The crew also conducted three student-designed experiments during the flight.

Lenoir and Allen were to perform a spacewalk, the first of the Space Shuttle program, to test newly developed space suits. The space suits were developed as cheaper and less complicated alternatives to the Apollo versions. The test was delayed by one day due to Lenoir succumbing to motion sickness. Then a poorly functioning oxygen regulator in Lenoir&#x27;s suit and a broken recirculation fan in Allen&#x27;s caused them to cancel the extravehicular activity (EVA) entirely. It was the first time in the history of the space program that an EVA had been cancelled due to space suit issues.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base on November 16, 1982, at 06:33:26a.m. PST, having traveled in 81 orbits during a mission that lasted 5days, 2hours, 14minutes and 26seconds. &quot;Columbia&quot; was returned to KSC on November 22, 1982. STS-5 was the first Space Shuttle flight in which the crew did not wear pressure suits for the launch, reentry, and landing portions of the flight, similar to the Soviet Voskhod and Soyuz missions prior to the ill-fated Soyuz 11 mission in 1971.

== Operational status ==
The Space Shuttle was formally declared &quot;operational&quot; after STS-4. However, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), in its report on the loss with all crew aboard of &quot;Columbia&quot; during STS-107 in 2003, asserted that the orbiter should never have been considered operational and that, while not intrinsically unsafe, it was in fact an experimental vehicle. The CAIB&#x27;s rationale was that civilian and military aircraft that are considered operational must have been tested and proven over thousands of safe flights in their final operational configurations, whereas the shuttle had conducted under 200 flights, with continuous modification. NASA operated the Space Shuttle as an experimental vehicle for the remainder of the program.

== Mission insignia ==
The five points of the blue star of the mission patch indicate the flight&#x27;s numerical designation in the Space Transportation System&#x27;s mission sequence.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.

<doc id="181052" wikidata="Q60851" url="?curid=181052" title="Alfred Andersch">
<text>Alfred Hellmuth Andersch (; 4 February 1914 – 21 February 1980) was a German writer, publisher, and radio editor. The son of a conservative East Prussian army officer, he was born in Munich, Germany, and died in Berzona, Ticino, Switzerland. Martin Andersch, his brother, was also a writer.

==Life==
His parents were Alfred Andersch (1875–1929) and his wife Hedwig, née Watzek (1884–1976). His school master was Joseph Gebhard Himmler, the father of Heinrich Himmler. He wrote about this in &quot;The Father of a Murderer&quot;.

===1914 to 1945===
In 1930, after an apprenticeship as a bookseller, Andersch became a youth leader in the Communist Party. As a consequence, he was held for six months in the Dachau concentration camp in 1933. He then left the party and entered a depressive phase of &quot;total introversion&quot;. It was during this period that he first became engaged in the arts, adopting the stance that became known as &quot;innere Emigration&quot; (&quot;internal emigration&quot;) – despite remaining in Germany, he was spiritually opposed to Hitler&#x27;s regime.

In 1940, Andersch was conscripted into the Wehrmacht, but deserted at the Arno Line in Italy on 6 June 1944. He was interned at Camp Ruston, Louisiana and other POW camps among German prisoners of war in the United States. He became the editor of a prisoners&#x27; newspaper, &quot;Der Ruf&quot; (&quot;The Call&quot;).

A critical review of Andersch&#x27;s &quot;internal émigré&quot; status, his marriage to a German Jew and subsequent divorce in 1943, as well as of his writing, may be read in W.G. Sebald&#x27;s &quot;Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea&quot; attached to his essay &quot;On the Natural History of Destruction&quot;. Sebald accused Andersch of having presented through literature a version of his life (and of the &quot;internal emigration&quot; more generally) that made it sound more acceptable to a post-Nazi public.

===1945 to 1980===
Having returned to Germany, he worked from 1945 as an editing assistant for Erich Kästner&#x27;s &quot;Neue Zeitung&quot; in Munich. From 1946 to 1947, he worked alongside Hans Werner Richter to publish the monthly literary journal &quot;Der Ruf&quot;, which was sold in the American occupation zone of Germany. The publication was discontinued following the non-renewal of its license by the U.S military government. Presumably, the discontinuation of &quot;Der Ruf&quot; followed &quot;promptings by the Soviet authorities, provoked by Hans Werner Richter&#x27;s open letter to the French Stalinist, Marcel Cachin.&quot; In the following years, Andersch worked with the literary circle &quot;Group 47&quot;, members of which included the authors Ingeborg Bachmann, Wolfgang Hildesheimer, Arno Schmidt, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Helmut Heissenbüttel, among others. 1948 saw the publication of Andersch&#x27;s essay &quot;Deutsche Literatur in der Entscheidung&quot; (&quot;German Literature at the Turning Point&quot;), in which he concluded, in the spirit of the American post-war &quot;re-education&quot; programme, that literature would play a decisive role in the moral and intellectual changes in Germany.
Beginning in 1948, Andersch was a leading figure at radio stations in Frankfurt and Hamburg. In 1950, he married the painter Gisela Dichgans. His autobiographical work &quot;Die Kirschen der Freiheit&quot; (&quot;The Cherries of Freedom&quot;) was published in 1952, in which Andersch dealt with the experience of his wartime desertion and interpreted it as the &quot;turning point&quot; (&quot;Entscheidung&quot;) at which he could first feel free. On a similar theme, he published in 1957 perhaps the most significant work of his career, &quot;Sansibar oder der letzte Grund&quot; (published in English as &quot;Flight to Afar&quot;). A few of Andersch&#x27;s books were turned into films.

From 1958, Andersch lived in Berzona in Switzerland, where he became mayor in 1972. After &quot;Sansibar&quot; followed the novels &quot;Die Rote&quot; in 1960, &quot;Efraim&quot; in 1967, and, in 1974, &quot;Winterspelt&quot;, which is, thematically, very similar to &quot;Sansibar&quot;, but is more complex in its composition. In 1977, he published the poetry anthology &quot;empört euch der himmel ist blau&quot; . Alfred Andersch died on 21 February 1980 in Berzona, Ticino. The incomplete story &quot;Der Vater eines Mörders&quot; (&quot;The Father of a Murderer&quot;) was published posthumously in the same year.

==Themes==
Alfred Andersch is considered an author of critical post-war literature. In his novels, narratives, audiobooks, and few poems, the key theme is the individual&#x27;s freedom of will. To elaborate on this, his autobiographic report &quot;The Cherries of Freedom&quot; was published in 1952, in which Andersch took on his own experience of desertion from the Wehrmacht and subsequently interpreted it as a choice towards freedom in an existential sense.

The novel &quot;Flight to Afar&quot; takes up this theme again, as well as the following works &quot;The Redhead&quot; and &quot;Efraim&quot;, which play through the theme in a contemporary setting. &quot;Efraim&#x27;s&quot; protagonist is an emigrated jewish journalist, who partakes in a desperate effort to escape from his reality by introducing himself, a person corroded by self-doubt, into his novel as a fictional character.

Rather than a traditional narration style, Andersch often used assemblages in form of documentaries, citations, and other narrative elements. One example of that would be his novel &quot;Winterspelt&quot;. A work that is close in style to the one of James Joyce, in which assemblage techniques such as commentary, inner monologues, and chronicle insertions create a war-like atmosphere that tells the story of desertion as an opportunity for one’s individual and collective freedom. 
Andersch also considered his audiobook &quot;Der Tod des James Dean&quot;, a story that contains texts of John Dos Passos, a radio assemblage.

<doc id="181060" wikidata="Q7810179" url="?curid=181060" title="Tito Kayak">
<text>Alberto de Jesús Mercado (born 1958), better known as Tito Kayak, is an activist from Jayuya, Puerto Rico, and founder of the Puerto Rican environmental group, Amig@s Del Mar. The organization utilizes a dual approach, which they call &quot;manatiburón (manatee/shark)&quot;, which Kayak describes as a combination of &quot;peaceful and simple ways to fulfill our environmental ideals&quot; (like the manatee), and the more “revolutionary approach&quot; (like the shark), which is &quot;only used when we are prohibited from working peacefully towards our goals of improving the environment.&quot; Kayak is best known for his activism against the damaging environmental effect of the U.S. Navy presence on Vieques.

==Protest involvement==
===Raising of Puerto Rican flag at Statue of Liberty===
On November 5, 2000, Tito Kayak and five other Vieques activists stepped onto the top deck of the Statue of Liberty in New York City in protest and Kayak then placed a Puerto Rican flag on the statue&#x27;s crown.

===Carolina apartment complex protest===
On March 15, 2005, Kayak chained himself to a vehicle after entering a Marriott Hotel property on a Carolina, Puerto Rico, beach to protest against the building of an apartment complex. &quot;Like many other Puerto Ricans, they were concerned about the Courtyard Marriott Hotel’s plan to expand in an area contiguous to the terrestrial marine zone and located on a beach area used by families and workers for recreation. If the construction were allowed to continue, it would have had a substantial negative impact on the environment and make the public beach inaccessible, to non-hotel guests.&quot;

===Raising of Puerto Rican flag at the United Nations===
On June 13, 2005, Kayak was arrested inside the United Nations headquarters in New York City after he attempted to switch the United Nations flag with the Puerto Rican one, while the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization discussed the political status of Puerto Rico. He was subsequently (October 11, 2013) found not guilty by a Manhattan Criminal Court judge of the filed State charge but was fined $500 for trespassing.

===Arrest in Israel while in support of the Palestine cause===
On April 20, 2007, Kayak was arrested in Israel after he climbed a surveillance tower near Israel&#x27;s West Bank apartheid wall and planted a Palestinian flag in support of Palestine. Kayak spent about five hours in the tower, before climbing down. After his arrest, Kayak stated that &quot;All I did was to express my identification with the villagers against the wall which is believed to be evil and illegal by the whole world and many leaders like Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter and the United Nations&quot;.

===San Juan&#x27;s Paseo Caribe crane case===
On November 14, 2007, Kayak climbed the construction cranes at the Paseo Caribe project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and remained perched on the crane for one week. In a daring escape, Kayak rappelled down from the crane and unto a red kayak in the water below while police officers were kept at bay by his supporters. Tito Kayak then rowed himself under a bridge whose clearance was too low for the police powerboats and switched out of the kayak, so when the kayak was apprehended he was no longer on board. Meanwhile, he swam across to the other shore. When he was spotted by the police helicopters, supporters jumped into the water further confusing the police and facilitating Kayak&#x27;s final getaway.

===Commemorating David Sanes&#x27; death===
On April 14, 2009, during the anniversary celebrations of David Sanes&#x27;s death, Tito Kayak arrived at the former bombing range of Vieques, a restricted area operated by the Federal Fish and Wildlife, and painted a sign saying &quot;Bieke or Death. The Struggle Continues&quot; (&quot;Bieke&quot; was a reference to the Taíno name for Vieques) on the former navy Operation Post (OP). Sanes, a civilian Navy security guard, had died 10 years earlier victim of a U.S. Navy bomb while on duty at the Operation Post.

===2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strike activism===
On January 25, 2011, Puerto Rico Police officers arrested a number of protesters who, using Civil Disobedience, attempted to bar entry and exit from the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus, during the 2010–2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes. One of the protesters, wearing a hood, was later found to be Tito Kayak.

===2012 Oscar López Rivera incarceration===
On 7 June 2012, Tito Kayak started a two-leg, lone high seas voyage from Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Washington, D.C., USA, to protest the U.S. incarceration of Puerto Rican political prisoner Oscar López Rivera. López Rivera is said to be &quot;among the longest held political prisoners in the history of Puerto Rico and in the world.&quot;

==Legacy==
An amendment to the Puerto Rico penal code (Article 208A) is largely attributed as a reaction to Tito Kayak’s protests against urban and commercial development and is commonly known as The Tito Kayak Law (even though there is no such declaration in the law itself). The Law attempted to criminalize activism at construction sites.

Law 149 of 2004 was amended by Law No. 158 of 2010, adding Article 208-A which made it a felony to enter, without authorization, a properly approved construction site for the purpose of temporarily or permanently obstructing work. It also penalized the occupation of the construction site&#x27;s associated land or equipment. Although the legislative act makes no mention of the Tito Kayak name nor exists any such designation in the amendment proper, the legislation is commonly cited in the press as &quot;Ley Tito Kayak&quot; (Tito Kayak Law) and has entered the local lexicon as such. In March 2013, Tito Kayak celebrated as the Law was declared unconstitutional by a Commonwealth of Puerto Rico judge sitting at the Ponce Superior Court.

<doc id="181061" wikidata="Q207958" url="?curid=181061" title="Joseph Joffre">
<text>Joseph Jacques Césaire Joffre , (; 12 January 1852 – 3 January 1931) was a French general who served as Commander-in-Chief of French forces on the Western Front from the start of World War I until the end of 1916. He is best known for regrouping the retreating allied armies to defeat the Germans at the strategically decisive First Battle of the Marne in September 1914.

His political position waned after unsuccessful offensives in 1915, the German attack on Verdun in 1916, and the disappointing results of the Anglo-French offensive on the Somme in 1916. At the end of 1916 he was promoted to Marshal of France, the first such elevation under the Third Republic, and moved to an advisory role, from which he quickly resigned. Later in the war he led an important mission to the United States.

== Early career ==
Joffre was born in Rivesaltes, Pyrénées-Orientales, into a family of vineyard owners. At a young age, he was a studious student, excelling at mathematics, descriptive geometry, and drawing. In 1870, he entered the École Polytechnique and became a career officer. He first saw active service as a junior artillery officer during the Siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War. After the war he underwent further training at the École Polytechnique before transferring to the &quot;génie&quot; (engineers). Joffre subsequently spent much of his career in the colonies as a military engineer, serving with distinction in the Keelung Campaign during the Sino-French War (August 1884 – April 1885). As a major, he led a column from Ségou to Timbuktu in Mali, where he recovered the remains of Lt. Col. Bonnier, who had been killed on a recent expedition. His mission killed over a hundred Tuareg and captured fifteen hundred cattle. He was promoted as a result. He served under Joseph Gallieni in Madagascar and was promoted to Général de brigade while serving there.

After returning to France in 1903 to command the 19th Cavalry Brigade, he then moved to the War Ministry in Paris as Director of Engineers in 1904. The next year he was promoted to Général de division, the highest rank in the French Army at the time. Subsequently, he commanded the 6th Infantry Division and served as Inspector of Military Schools. Joffre commanded the 2nd Army Corps from 1908 until 1910 when he was appointed to the Conseil supérieur de la guerre.

The Minister of War Adolphe Messimy reorganized the high command of the French Army in July 1911. General Victor-Constant Michel, the Vice President of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre and Commander-in-Chief designate, was sacked after proposing a defensive strategy in the event of war with Germany. Messimy took the opportunity to merge the office of vice president with the Chief of the General Staff and create a single professional head of the Army. The newly enhanced post was first offered to Gallieni and Paul Pau, who both declined, leading to Joffre&#x27;s appointment.

With the revival of the army and a purge of &quot;defensive-minded&quot; officers, he adopted the strategy devised by Ferdinand Foch, the deployment plan known as Plan XVII. He was selected to command despite never having commanded an Army, even on paper, and &quot;having no knowledge whatever of General Staff work.&quot; After a left-wing government came to power in 1914, he was due to be replaced by Maurice Sarrail in the autumn, but war broke out before this could take place.

== World War I ==
=== 1914 ===

==== Battle of the Frontiers ====

At the outbreak of war, the French plan clashed with the German Schlieffen Plan, much to the detriment of the French. On 15 August, after German cavalry had been spotted at Dinant on the Meuse, and after repeated warnings from Charles Lanrezac of the Fifth Army, Joffre issued his &quot;Instruction Particuliere No 10&quot;, stating that the main German effort would come through Belgium.

Although Joffre was aware (8am on 18 August) that as many as fifteen German corps were moving through Belgium (in fact it was sixteen, and twenty-eight if the German Fourth and Fifth Armies are also included), he believed that only a few of these would come west of the Meuse, where he believed they could be held by the British and Belgians. The French Third and Fourth Armies were preparing to attack into the Ardennes, and he wanted Lanrezac&#x27;s Fifth Army to attack the bulk of the German right wing on its west flank as – it was assumed – it attacked the left flank of French Fourth Army.

The French First and Second Armies attacked into Alsace-Lorraine on 19 and 20 August and were beaten back with severe loss by German forces, which were preparing for a counteroffensive. Joffre believed (20 August) that Liège was still holding out (in fact the last of the Liège forts had fallen on 16 August), and hoped that Lanrezac would be able to reach Namur, which was expected to hold out for even longer. The Germans entered Brussels that day, but Joffre was convinced, after the defeat in Alsace-Lorraine and air and cavalry reports of strong German forces in Belgium, that the German centre in the Ardennes must be weak. On 21 August the French Second Army was pressed by a German counterattack. Édouard de Castelnau asked for permission to abandon Nancy and its fortified heights, but Joffre forbade him to do so.

With the French Third and Fourth Armies now attacking into the Ardennes, and the infantry outpacing their horsedrawn artillery, von Bülow&#x27;s German Second Army attacked Lanrezac and forced bridgeheads across the Meuse. The Fifth Army was also now attacked on its right by Max von Hausen&#x27;s German Third Army; although these attacks were held, Lanrezac asked Joffre for permission to retreat. On 23 August the Fifth Army was attacked again.

On 23 August Joffre reported to Adolphe Messimy, the French war minister, that his Fourth Army was pressing into the Ardennes with (he believed, wrongly) local numerical superiority, despite the fact that he had already received reports of French defeats in this sector on previous days. The German Fourth and Fifth Armies were in fact advancing against the French forces in front of them rather than moving westwards as Joffre believed. In his memoirs Joffre later admitted that he had been mistaken (he was also unaware of the fall of Namur and of the extent of the fighting at Mons and Charleroi on his left), but at the time he demanded that the French Fourth Army resume the offensive and provide lists of unsatisfactory officers for dismissal. Messimy fully supported Joffre in his purge of unsuccessful generals, even suggesting that, as in 1793, some of them simply ought to be executed.

==== Retreat ====
On 25 August, rejecting the advice of his staff officer General Berthelot that Lanrezac be ordered to attack westwards against the inside of the German right wing, he instead had Major Maurice Gamelin draw up plans for a French concentration at Amiens, with many of the troops drawn from the French right wing in Alsace, and with regret also ordered the successful counterattacks of the Third Army and the Army of Lorraine be called off. Michel-Joseph Maunoury was put in command of the newly formed Sixth Army, which initially assembled near Amiens and then fell back toward Paris (26 August).

Concerned at reports (which later turned out to be exaggerated) that the British had been defeated at Le Cateau and would need French protection to recover cohesion, early on 27 August Joffre gave Lanrezac a direct written order to counterattack as soon as his forces were on open ground, where they could use their artillery, which Lanrezac had told him was the key factor. After Lanrezac spent the day arguing against the order, Joffre visited him at 8.30 am on 28 August and ordered him to attack to the west. After a &quot;heated&quot; discussion, Joffre had Gamelin draw up a written order and signed it in Lanrezac&#x27;s presence.

Fernand de Langle de Cary&#x27;s Fourth Army, originally intended to be the spearhead of the attack into the Ardennes, was a strong force and had made several counterattacks, but Joffre now ordered it to cease counterattacking and to send a detachment under Ferdinand Foch to cover the gap between Fourth and Fifth Armies; this became the new Ninth Army.

Joffre turned up at Lanrezac&#x27;s headquarters to supervise his conduct of the Battle of Guise (29 August), willing if necessary to sack him there and then. In the event he was impressed by Lanrezac&#x27;s cool demeanour and handling of the battle. As a result of the battle, Alexander von Kluck&#x27;s German First Army broke off its attacks on Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army and swung south-east, inside of Paris.

==== The Marne ====
Messimy, the war minister, ordered Joffre to provide three active corps to defend Paris on 25 August, but Joffre, regarding this as interference with strategy, ignored him. On 26 August René Viviani formed a new government (the &quot;Union sacrée&quot;), and on 27 August the new war minister, Alexandre Millerand, who had replaced Messimy largely because of the poor state of the Paris defences, visited Joffre. The general promised to provide the three corps for Paris if Maunoury&#x27;s attack near Amiens failed.

On 30 August Joffre recommended that the French government evacuate Paris and learned of the Russian disaster at Tannenberg, although he was aware that two German corps were still headed east as reinforcements for East Prussia. On 1 September the Fifth Army retreated across the Aisne in some confusion, and Joffre issued his &quot;Instruction Generale No 4&quot;, placing Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army under the command of Joseph Gallieni as military governor of Paris and forming a new cavalry corps under Louis Conneau to fill the gap between the Fifth Army and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). At this stage his mind was still leaning towards Berthelot&#x27;s old suggestion that the Fifth Army attack westwards against the inside of the German right wing.

On 2 September, the anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, the government left Paris for Bordeaux. That day Joffre placed Maunoury under Gallieni&#x27;s direct command as the &quot;Armies of Paris&quot; and had Millerand place Gallieni under his own command. Joffre planned to retreat behind the Seine before counterattacking. He envisaged &quot;a battle&quot;, probably to take place around 8 September, &quot;between the horns of Paris and Verdun.&quot;. He sacked Lanrezac on the afternoon of 3 September, replacing him with the more aggressive Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey.

On the night of 3–4 September Joffre sent a handwritten note to Gallieni, wanting Maunoury to push east along the north bank of the Marne, although not specifying a date. This was in line with his modification of &quot;Instruction General No 4&quot; (2 September), envisaging a giant pocket from Paris to Verdun, of which he enclosed copies to Gallieni. At 9.45 am on 4 September Gallieni, who had learned from Paris aviators the previous day that Kluck&#x27;s German First Army was marching south-east across Paris, had the first of a series of telephone calls, conducted through aides, as Joffre would not come to the phone, and Gallieni refused to speak to anyone else. Gallieni proposed, depending on how much further the Germans were to be allowed to advance, to attack north of the Marne on 6 September or south of the Marne on 7 September.

Joffre&#x27;s reply saying he preferred the southern option (which would take a day longer as it forced the Sixth Army to cross to south of the Marne, but would keep the Sixth Army and BEF from being separated by the river) arrived too late to reach Gallieni, who had left for a meeting with the BEF chief of staff, Archibald Murray. That same afternoon, Henry Wilson, the BEF sub-chief of staff, was negotiating separate plans with Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, on the British right, which envisaged the Sixth Army attacking &quot;north&quot; of the Marne.

In the absence of news from Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, Joffre ordered Gamelin to draft orders for Maunoury to attack south of the Marne on 7 September. This intention was also passed on to Sir John French. While Joffre was having dinner with the British liaison officer, Sidney Clive, and two visiting Japanese officers, neither of whom appeared to understand a word of French, a message arrived from Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey saying that he would be ready to attack on 6 September. At this point Gallieni, who returned to Paris to find Joffre&#x27;s message from earlier in the day and a message from Wilson, insisted on speaking to Joffre personally on the telephone, informing him that it was too late to cancel the movement of Maunoury&#x27;s army. Joffre agreed to bring forward the Allied offensive to 6 September and to have the Sixth Army attack north of the Marne instead, later writing that he had done so reluctantly as Maunoury would probably make contact with the Germans on 5 September, but that an extra day would have left the Germans in a more &quot;disadvantageous&quot; position. Tuchman argues that he may simply have been swayed by the dominant personality of Gallieni, his former superior. At 10 pm Joffre issued &quot;General Order No 6&quot;, ordering a General Allied Offensive.

On 7 September Gallieni, who had been going over Joffre&#x27;s head and speaking to the war minister and President Raymond Poincaré, was ordered not to communicate directly with the government. This left Joffre &quot;all-powerful&quot; (in Gallieni&#x27;s description), as he had sacked so many generals, leaving Gallieni his only serious rival. By early December 1914 Gallieni was being mooted as a potential commander-in-chief in Joffre&#x27;s place, or minister of war, or both.

=== 1915 ===

==== Spring offensive ====
On 7 January 1915, over Joffre&#x27;s opposition, President Poincaré came out in favour of the proposal of Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, Gallieni and justice minister Aristide Briand for an expedition to Salonika, which he hoped would detach first Turkey then Austria-Hungary, leaving Germany &quot;doomed.&quot;

Joffre fought a further major offensive in the Artois in spring 1915. He told Wilson (23 March) that &quot;by the end of Apr[il] he would be in a condition to attack &amp; break (underline) the line.&quot; On 4 May &quot;he talked of getting to Namur &amp; the war being over in 3 (months).&quot;

==== Further promotion ====
With Viviani&#x27;s government in trouble following the resignation of Theophile Delcasse as foreign minister, the unsuccessful autumn offensive and the entry of Bulgaria into the war, Viviani asked Joffre, who had told him that nine out of ten generals would make poor ministers of war, whether Gallieni would be a good replacement for Millerand. Joffre replied, &quot;Perhaps,&quot; then, after a pause for thought, &quot;Maybe.&quot; In the event, Briand formed a new government on 29 October 1915, with Viviani as vice-president of the council of ministers (deputy prime minister) and Gallieni as war minister.

As far back at 29 July 1915 Joffre had demanded that he be appointed commander-in-chief over all French forces, including those at the Dardanelles. By November he was again lobbying Poincaré that either a strong minister of war, backed by a strong chief of staff (e.g. Castelnau) be given strategic direction of the war—Joffre did not favour this option, believing that governments rose and fell too frequently for this to be sensible—or else that Joffre himself be appointed commander-in-chief over all fronts. Poincaré was persuaded of the latter option, and persuaded Briand, who arranged for Joffre and Gallieni to meet and shake hands.

At the meeting of the Superior Council of Defence (24 November 1915) Joffre had Briand address the demarcation of his own and Gallieni&#x27;s authority, and objected to the council discussing operational matters, threatening to resign if they attempted to interfere with his &quot;liberty.&quot;. Joffre met with Poincaré and Briand both before and after the meeting to discuss the issue. Gallieni, who favoured a strong war ministry with his own operational staff, complained bitterly in his diary about the politicians&#x27; unwillingness to stand up to Joffre. On 1 December Poincaré and Briand met with Gallieni, who agreed that Joffre be commander-in-chief, with Castelnau—who was soon sidelined—as his chief of staff, although under the war minister&#x27;s orders. A presidential decree of 2 December made Joffre &quot;Commander-in-Chief of the French Armies&quot; (&quot;generalissimo&quot;). After considerable discussion this was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by 406–67 on 9 December. In practice, Joffre now took command over both Salonika and the Western Front, but not Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia. There was also friction over Gallieni&#x27;s assertion of his right to appoint generals, Joffre&#x27;s practice of communicating directly with the British generals rather than going through the war ministry, and Gallieni&#x27;s maintaining contacts with generals whom Joffre had replaced.

In autumn 1915 Colonel Émile Driant, commander of a chasseurs brigade and a member of the Army Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, complained to Gallieni of how Joffre had been removing guns and garrisons from Verdun and even preparing some forts for demolition. Joffre was furious and disputed Gallieni&#x27;s right to comment. The council of ministers discussed his reports, and Poincaré asked Gallieni to investigate. Gallieni wrote to Joffre (16 or 18 December 1915), expressing concern at the state of trenches at Verdun and elsewhere on the front; in fact, matters were already being taken in hand at Verdun.

=== 1916 ===

==== Verdun ====
The British government accepted the need to maintain the Salonika bridgehead to keep the French happy, despite being sceptical about the idea that it would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, but British military opinion did not favour any more commitment than necessary. Argument continued with Joffre throughout the year. Late in March 1916 Joffre and Briand blocked a proposal by Lord Kitchener and Sir William Robertson to gradually withdraw five British divisions from Salonika as the Serb troops arrived.

After months of discussion, Haig and Joffre agreed on 14 February 1916 to an Anglo-French offensive on the Somme, although the British were not pleased at Joffre&#x27;s suggestion that the British engage in &quot;wearing out&quot; attacks prior to the main offensive. The German attack on Verdun began on 21 February, reducing the planned French commitment to the Somme.

The French General Staff had decided in August 1915 to partially disarm all the Verdun forts, under the erroneous assumption that they could not resist the effects of modern heavy artillery, and the Germans initially made good progress against fortifications that had had their guns removed. Fort Douaumont, the keystone of the system of Verdun forts, had been given up without a fight, becoming a shelter and operational base for German forces just behind their front line. In the words of one French divisional commander, its loss would cost the French army a hundred thousand lives.

Joffre&#x27;s political position had already weakened after the enormous losses of 1915, and now rumours circulated in Paris that Joffre had ordered the abandonment of Verdun when the Germans first attacked. Gallieni demanded to see all paperwork from the period, but Joffre had made no such order in writing, merely despatching Castelnau to assess the situation.

The political atmosphere had become poisonous. Gallieni presented a highly critical report to the council of ministers on 7 March—read in his usual precise way—criticising Joffre&#x27;s conduct of operations over the last eighteen months and demanding ministerial control, then resigned. It is unclear whether he was specifically trying to have Joffre ousted as Poincaré believed. With the survival of the government at stake, General Roques was appointed minister of war after it had been ensured that Joffre had no objections. Joffre himself had been mooted for the job.

==== The Somme ====
Early in 1916 Joffre asked the British commander-in-chief, Sir Douglas Haig, to put in a good word with Lord Bertie, the British ambassador in Paris, so that it would get back to the French government. General Haig wanted to delay the Anglo-French offensive at the Somme until 15 August to allow for more training and more artillery. When told of this Joffre shouted at Haig that &quot;the French Army would cease to exist&quot; and had to be calmed down with &quot;liberal doses of 1840 brandy.&quot; The British refused to agree to French demands for a joint Anglo-French offensive from the Salonika bridgehead. Eventually, perhaps influenced by reports of French troop disturbances at Verdun, Haig agreed to attack at the start of July. This was just in time, as it later turned out that Philippe Pétain, commander at Verdun, was warning the French government that the &quot;game was up&quot; unless the British attacked.

Joffre was successfully lobbied by Robertson, and at the second Chantilly Conference (15–16 November 1916) they agreed to concentrate on the Western Front in 1917 rather than sending greater resources to Salonika.

==== Fall from power ====
The fall of Bucharest (6 December 1916) not only ruled out a Russo-Romanian attack on Bulgaria, but also made possible a Central Powers attack on Salonika. One of Joffre&#x27;s last official duties (11 December) was to order Maurice Sarrail to cease his offensive and establish a strong defensive position, from which further offensives might be launched in the future. To Briand&#x27;s and Joffre&#x27;s surprise, Roques, the minister of war, returned from a fact-finding mission to Salonika recommending that Sarrail be reinforced and that he no longer report to Joffre. Coming on the back of the disappointing results of the Somme campaign and the fall of Romania, Roques&#x27;s report further discredited Briand and Joffre and added to the parliamentary deputies&#x27; demands for a closed session. On 27 November the council of ministers met to debate rescinding the decree of 2 December 1915, which had placed Sarrail under Joffre; Briand proposed that Joffre be effectively demoted to commander-in-chief in North-East France, reporting to the war minister along with the commander-in-chief at Salonika, although he withdrew this proposal after Joffre threatened resignation. During the closed session (28 November – 7 December) Briand had little choice but to make concessions to preserve his government, and in a speech of 29 November he promised to repeal the decree of 2 December 1915 and in vague terms to appoint a general as technical adviser to the government. He met Joffre on 3 December 1916—according to Joffre, promising to appoint him Marshal of France and to give him a staff of his own and &quot;direction of the war&quot;.

On 13 December Briand formed a new government, which that day survived a vote of confidence by only thirty votes. Joffre was appointed &quot;general-in-chief of the French armies, technical adviser to the government, consultative member of the War Committee&quot;, with Robert Nivelle as commander-in-chief of the Armies of the North and Northeast. It is unclear exactly what Briand had told Joffre about his role; he commented, &quot;This is not what they promised me,&quot; when reading the newspaper on the morning of 13 December and was put out to be described as &quot;general-in-chief&quot; rather than &quot;commander-in-chief.&quot; He departed at once for Paris, but was persuaded to accept by Briand. On 17 December, he told the British liaison officer, Sidney Clive, &quot;I am the commander-in-chief and I intend to command effectively.&quot; However, he soon found that he had no real power—the acting war minister (Admiral Lacaze, as General Lyautey had not yet returned from North Africa to take up the position) forbade him even to approve units&#x27; being granted the fourragère—and on 26 December, the day he was promoted Marshal of France, he asked to be relieved. Joffre was still popular and was the first man to be promoted Marshal under the Third Republic.

=== Post-command career ===

On 1 April 1917 Prime Minister Ribot asked Joffre to go on Viviani&#x27;s mission to the United States. There was already a similar British mission being prepared, led by Arthur Balfour, Foreign Secretary and a former Prime Minister. The French along with the British had been preparing to do so since February after the announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, in the expectation that an American declaration of war against Germany was imminent. He was initially reluctant to go as the Nivelle Offensive was underway. On 6 April the United States Congress declared war on Germany. The main problem for their new army would be training men and, especially, officers. Joffre initially considered recommending the incorporation of US companies and battalions into the French and British armies, but realised that the Americans would never accept this.

The party sailed to the US on the &quot;Lorraine II&quot;, making an effort to cultivate reporters on board, who noticed how busy Joffre kept his small staff. While at sea he learned of the failure of Nivelle&#x27;s offensive. He landed on 24 April at Hampton Roads, where he was welcomed by Admiral Henry Mayo, commander-in-chief of the US Atlantic Fleet, Ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt. He arrived in Washington the following morning, where he met Secretary of State Robert Lansing and Arthur Balfour. Joffre stayed in Washington for ten days, and addressed both Houses of Congress individually. On 27 April he met Army Chief of Staff Hugh Scott and his deputy, Tasker Bliss. Joffre recommended sending a single American unit to France at once and requested that the Americans send railroads, automobiles and trucks for the French Army. On 30 April the British Major-General Tom Bridges lobbied for US troops to be used to reinforce the British Army, arguing this would lessen the language and food differences.

Joffre left a paper arguing for a separate American force, then on 4 May began a week&#x27;s tour of the eastern US. In full view of the press, he waited his turn in a barber&#x27;s shop in St. Louis for a haircut, visited the hometowns of Abraham Lincoln (Springfield, Illinois) and Ulysses Grant, laid wreaths at the statues of Joan of Arc and Lafayette, and visited West Point. He returned on 10 May to find that the US authorities agreed with the recommendations in his paper. The 1st US Infantry Division, mainly regulars, was to be sent at the start of June. On the last day of his visit to Washington, Newton D. Baker, the secretary of war, introduced him to General John J. Pershing, just selected to command the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Joffre told him that &quot;he can always count on me for anything in my power.&quot;

On 13 June Pershing, who had landed at Boulogne that morning, met Joffre, Paul Painlevé (war minister), Viviani and Foch (chief of staff) in Paris. Joffre recommended that an American unit be rushed to France to show the flag. 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment was sent, and was reviewed by Joffre and President Poincaré as it marched up the Champs-Élysées on 4 July. Pershing rejected Painlevé&#x27;s suggestion that Joffre head the liaison group of French officers who were helping to set up his supply lines; Pershing insisted on using the Atlantic ports of Brest, St Nazaire and Rochefort.

Joffre became leader of the Supreme War Council in 1918. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. When he retired in 1919, he was made a member of the Académie française and an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1920 he presided over the &quot;Jocs Florals&quot; in Barcelona, a Catalan literary certamen (he was born in French Catalonia and his mother tongue was Catalan).

In 1922 he was welcomed in Broadway, New York with a ticker-tape parade, a few months after Ferdinand Foch, the Supreme Allied Commander during World War I.

== Death ==
Joffre died at the age of 78 in Paris on 3 January 1931. His body was buried on his estate at Louveciennes. His memoirs, in two volumes, were published posthumously in 1932.

== Personality and assessments ==
Joffre was initiated into Freemasonry in 1875, at the lodge Alsace-Lorraine. According to British author Alan Palmer, many French generals were of the generation educated in the Catholic teaching which had grown up after the &quot;Loi Falloux&quot; and therefore, unlike Joffre, suspected of hostility to the Third Republic.

Joffre was generally taciturn and a man of impenetrable calm, sometimes interspersed with furious anger. He would sometimes turn up at a unit&#x27;s headquarters, listen to reports, and then depart having said hardly a word, to the consternation of the officers he had just inspected. At the time of the Battle of the Marne, he was heavily dependent on his deputy chief of staff, General Henri Mathias Berthelot. Sir John French, commander-in-chief of the British Expeditionary Force, thought highly of him. Georges Boillot, winner of the French Grand Prix in 1912 and 1913, was Joffre&#x27;s personal driver in 1914, and Joffre&#x27;s car tearing along roads became a familiar sight.

General Hubert Lyautey thought Joffre a better logistician than strategist. His major positive contributions in 1914 were his sustained calm under pressure and the calculated reasoning of an alumnus from École Polytechnique, his ruthless dismissal of unsuccessful generals (three army commanders, ten corps commanders and thirty-eight divisional commanders, replacing them with combative men like Foch, Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey and—more junior at that stage—Pétain and Nivelle), and his outstanding logistical handling of French infantry divisional movements and artillery ammunition supplies during and after the French retreat of August 1914.

Doughty writes of the Marne: &quot;Gallieni&#x27;s role was important, but the key concept and decisions lay with Joffre.&quot; Joffre recovered from the initial disastrous attacks into Lorraine and the Ardennes and redeployed forces to the west. He kept his cool when the initial attempt to have Maunoury envelop the German west flank at Amiens failed, requiring a retreat on Paris. While the Battle of the Marne was going on, he handled the problems faced by Foch&#x27;s Ninth Army at the St Gond Marshes, by de Langle&#x27;s Fourth and Sarrail&#x27;s Third near Verdun and by Castelnau&#x27;s Second in the Nancy area.

John Eisenhower writes that Joffre&#x27;s &quot;personality had a profound effect on the course of history&quot; and he became a household name in the United States.

<text>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&#x27;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web for people with disabilities. People with disabilities encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since they often require non-standard devices and browsers, making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources. According to a US government study, 71% of website visitors with disabilities will leave a website that is not accessible.

The W3C launched the Web Accessibility Initiative in 1997 with endorsement by The White House and W3C members. It has several working groups and interest groups that work on guidelines, technical reports, educational materials and other documents that relate to the several different components of web accessibility. These components include web content, web browsers and media players, authoring tools, and evaluation tools.

==Organization==
WAI develops guidelines and other technical reports through the same process as other parts of the W3C. Like other W3C initiatives, the WAI consists of several working groups and Special interest groups, each with its own focus. Only working groups can produce technical reports that become W3C recommendations. A working group can sometimes delegate specific work to a task force, which then presents its results back to the working group for approval. Interest groups may produce reports (for example, as W3C Notes), but not recommendations.
Each of these types of groups (working group, task force, interest group) can have one or more mailing lists. They meet through conference calls at regular intervals (typically every week or every other week) and sometimes use web-based surveys to collect input or comments from participants. They can also meet face to face (one to five times per year).

In 1997 Judy Brewer has been the director of the WAI. In this role she has championed improving accessibility of the web for people with disabilities and older users.

===Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (ATAG WG)===
The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group develops guidelines, techniques and supporting resources for tools that create web content, ranging from desktop HTML editors to content management systems.
The accessibility requirements apply to two types of things: the user interface on the one hand, and the content produced by the tool on the other.
The working group consists of representatives from organizations that produce authoring tools, researchers, and other accessibility experts.
The working group produced the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 in 2000 and completed Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 in 2015. A supporting document, Implementing ATAG 2.0, provides additional explanation, examples and resources for ATAG 2.0. It also published a document on Selecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility.

===Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)===
The Education and Outreach Working Group develops materials for training and education on Web accessibility. This working group has produced documents on a wide range of subjects, including:
* Accessibility Features of CSS
* Curriculum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
* Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility, a suite of documents about subjects such as conformance evaluation, evaluation approaches for specific contexts, involving users in web accessibility evaluation, and selecting web accessibility evaluation tools
* Planning Web Accessibility Training
* Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization
* How People with Disabilities Use the Web, a document that describes various fictitious characters with disabilities and how they use the Web in different scenarios
* many introduction pages on the WAI website.

Currently, the working group has a task force to support the work done in the WAI-AGE project. This project published a document that reviews literature about the needs of older users and compares these needs with those of people with disabilities as already addressed in WAI guidelines.

The Education and Outreach Working Group can also review working drafts produced by other WAI working groups.

===Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG)===
The Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group develops technical specifications that support the accessibility evaluation and repair of Web sites. It also maintains a database of tools for evaluating Web sites and for making them more accessible (&quot;repair&quot;, &quot;retrofitting&quot;).
The working group consists mainly of developers of such tools and researchers.
Current work focuses on
* Evaluation and Report Language (EARL): a language for expressing evaluation reports in a machine-readable way
* HTTP Vocabulary in RDF, which specifies how HTTP requests and responses can be expressed in RDF
* Representing Content in RDF, which specifies how content (retrieved from the Web or a local storage device) can be represented in RDF
* Pointer Methods in RDF, early work on how locations in and parts of online documents can be expressed in RDF.

===Protocols &amp; Formats Working Group (PFWG)===
The Protocols &amp; Formats Working Group reviews all W3C technologies for accessibility before they are published as a recommendation. It has also published a note on accessibility issues of CAPTCHA, 
a paper on natural language usage for people with cognitive disabilities, and initial work on accessibility requirements for XML-based markup languages (XML Accessibility Guidelines).

In 2006, the working group started development of a set of document and specifications for accessible rich internet applications: WAI-ARIA.

===Research and Development Interest Group (RDIG)===
The goal of the Research and Development Interest Group is 
* to increase the incorporation of accessibility considerations into research on Web technologies, and
* to identify projects researching Web accessibility and suggest research questions that may contribute to new projects.

This interest group has seen very little activity since 2004. Its current charter expired at the end of 2006.

===User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG)===
The User Agent Accessibility Guideline Working Group develops guidelines, techniques and other documents to promote the accessibility of user agents: browsers and plug-ins.
The working group consists mainly of organizations that develop user agents, researchers, and other accessibility experts.
UAWG published User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0 in December 2015. Supporting documentation includes: UAAG 2.0 Reference and UAAG Mobile Examples. The working group published User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (UAAG 1.0) as a W3C Recommendation in 2002.

===WAI Interest Group (WAI IG)===
The WAI Interest Group is an open group with a mailing list to which anyone can subscribe. W3C staff post announcements of new WAI documents to this mailing list to invite reviews and comments. Members of the list also post announcements of relevant events and publications, and ask advice on issues related to web accessibility. The language of the mailing list is English; there are no parallel mailing lists in other languages.

===Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AGWG)===
The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (formerly the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group) produces guidelines, techniques and other supporting documents relating to the accessibility of Web content. Web content refers to any information you may find on a Web site: text, images, forms, sound, video, etcetera, regardless whether these were produced on the server side or on the client side (with a client-side scripting language such as JavaScript). Thus, the guidelines also apply to rich internet applications.

The working group consists of representatives from industry, accessibility consultancies, universities, organizations that represent end users, and other accessibility experts.

The working group published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) as W3C Recommendation in 1999, followed by techniques documents in 2000.
In 2001, the working group started work on WCAG 2.0, which became a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008.

===WAI Coordination Group===
The WAI Coordination Group co-ordinates that activities of the WAI working groups (and interest groups). Its activities are not public.

==Guidelines and technical reports==
===Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)===

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (known as WCAG) were published as a W3C Recommendation on 5 May 1999. A supporting document, Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was published as a W3C Note on 6 November 2000. WCAG 1.0 is a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to persons with disabilities. They also help make web content more usable for other devices, including mobile devices (PDAs and cell phones).
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 are recognized as a de facto standard and have served as a basis for legislation and evaluation methodologies in many countries.

The WCAG working group published WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.0 is based on very different requirements from WCAG 1.0:
* the guidelines needed to be technology-neutral, whereas WCAG 1.0 was strongly based on HTML and CSS;
* the guidelines needed to be worded as testable statements instead of instructions to authors.
The combination of more general applicability and higher precision proved very challenging.

In 2018, the WCAG working group published WCAG 2.1. This remains fundamentally similar to the guidance in WCAG 2.0, with some additional recommendations made in particular areas:
* Mobile device accessibility 
* Low vision users

===Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)===

Developed by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the ATAG 2.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 24 September 2015. 
ATAG is a set of guidelines for developers of any kind of authoring tool for Web content: simple HTML editors, tools that export content for use on the Web (for example, word processors that can save as HTML), tools that produce multimedia, content management systems, learning management systems, social media, etc..

The goal is for developers to create tools that:
* are accessible to authors regardless of disability;
* produce accessible content by default;
* support and encourage authors to create accessible content.

Implementing ATAG 2.0 is a companion document that provides guidance on understanding and implementing ATAG 2.0. It gives an explanation of the intent of each success criterion, examples of the success criterion, and additional resources. Implementing ATAG 2.0 recommendations can reduce the costs for accessibility because authors are given the tools they need to create accessible content.

List of authoring tools looking to implement ATAG 2.0:
* CKEditor
* Drupal

Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was published in 2000 by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group.

===User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)===
Developed by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the UAAG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 17 December 2002. The UAAG is a set of guidelines for user agent developers (such as web browsers and media players) aimed at making the user agent accessible to users with disabilities. Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was published as a W3C Note on the same day; it provides techniques for satisfying the checkpoints defined in UAAG 1.0.
Working group members also produced other supporting documents, including initial notes on How to evaluate a user agent for conformance to UAAG 1.0; this document was not formally approved by the working group. No user agents have been reported as fully conforming to UAAG 1.0.

The working group is currently working on a new version of the guidelines. The first public draft of User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 was published on 12 March 2008.

===XML Accessibility Guidelines (XAG)===
The XAG explains how to include features in XML applications (i.e. markup languages conforming to the XML specification) that promote accessibility. Work on these guidelines stopped in 2002; the guidelines are still a working draft.

===Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)===

WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a technical specification which became a W3C Recommended Web Standard on 20 March 2014. It allows web pages (or portions of pages) to declare themselves as applications rather than as static documents, by adding role, property, and state information to dynamic web applications. ARIA is intended for use by developers of web applications, web browsers, assistive technologies, and accessibility evaluation tools.

<text>Secret police (or political police) are police, intelligence, or security agencies that engage in covert operations against a government&#x27;s political, ideological, or social opponents and dissidents. Secret police organizations are characteristic of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. They protect the political power of a dictator or regime and often operate outside the law to repress dissidents and weaken political opposition, frequently using violence. They may enjoy legal sanction to hold and charge suspects without ever identifying their organization.

== History ==
=== Africa ===
==== Egypt ====
Egypt is home to Africa&#x27;s and the Middle East&#x27;s first internal security service: The State Security Investigations Service. Initially it was formed during the British occupation of Egypt as the Intelligence wing of the regular police. After the 1952 coup, the State Security apparatus was reformed and reorganized to suit the security concerns of the new socialist regime of Gamal Abdel Nasser. The SSIS was made a separate branch of the Ministry of Interior and separated from the regular police command. During the Nasser era, It was intensively trained by the Soviet KGB on coercive interrogation techniques, mass surveillance, public intimidation and political suppression. The SSIS was responsible for suppressing opposition groups to Nasser and his successors (Sadat and Mubarak). Torture was a systematic practice by that repressive apparatus. During the War on Terror, The SSIS used to receive suspected terrorists that were sent to Egypt from the United States and used to interrogate them using torture. After the 2011 revolution, demonstrators demanded that the service be dissolved and several buildings (including the headquarters in Nasr City) were stormed by protesters that gathered evidence of torture tools, secret cells and documents showing surveillance on citizens. On March 15 2011, Egypt&#x27;s Minister of Interior announced the dissolution of the State Security and declared the new National Security Agency would replace it and be responsible for its internal security and counter-terrorist duties.

==== Uganda ====
In Uganda, the State Research Bureau (SRB) was a secret police organisation for President Idi Amin. The Bureau tortured many Ugandans, operating on behalf of a regime responsible for more than five hundred thousand violent deaths. The SRB attempted to infiltrate every area of Ugandan life.

==== Zimbabwe ====
In Zimbabwe, the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) was the secret police of President Robert Mugabe who is responsible for detaining, torturing, mass beating, raping and starving thousands of civilians on the orders of Mugabe.

=== Asia ===
==== China ====
In East Asia, the Embroidered Uniform Guard () of the Ming dynasty was founded in the 1360s by the Hongwu Emperor and served as the dynasty&#x27;s secret police until the collapse of Ming rule in 1644. Originally, their main functions were to serve as the emperor&#x27;s bodyguard and to spy on his subjects and report any plots of rebellion or regicide directly to the emperor. Over time, the organization took on law enforcement and judicial functions and grew to be immensely powerful, with the power to overrule ordinary judicial rulings and to investigate, interrogate, and punish anyone, including members of the imperial family. In 1420, a second secret police organization run by eunuchs, known as the Eastern Depot (), was formed to suppress suspected political opposition to the usurpation of the throne by the Yongle Emperor. Combined, these two organizations made the Ming dynasty one of the world&#x27;s first police states.

The Ministry of State Security () in modern China controls a network of provincial and local State Security Bureaus, integrated with local Public Security Bureaus which make up part of the policing system of China. The MSS has its own branch of the People&#x27;s Police, known as the State Security Police, with officers which have the dual tasks of law enforcement and repressing political dissent. State security bureaus and public security bureaus are functionally co-located within the same buildings as each other. The MSS and the Ministry of Public Security control the overall national police network of China and the two agencies share resources and closely coordinate with each other.

====Hong Kong====

In British Hong Kong, the Special Branch was established in 1934 originally as an anti-communist squad under MI5 with assistance from MI6. The branch later joined the Crime Department of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force in 1946 and focused on preventing pro-KMT rightists and pro-CCP leftists from infiltrating the colony.

The National Security Department in the current HKSAR is a secret police agency created after the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law. The NSD has accused and arrested dissenting voices in Hong Kong for &quot;endangering&quot; the national security, including pro-democracy politicians, protestors, and journalists. Some websites were also reportedly banned by the department, including Hong Kong Watch.

==== Iraq ====
In the Middle East, located in Baghdad. Shurta was one of the most both powerful intelligence and secret police organizations of the Abbasid era which was led by the Abbasids in the 8th and 9th centuries during the Golden Age of Islam.

==== Japan ====
In Japan, the Kenpeitai existed from 1881 to 1945 and were described as secret police by the Australian War Memorial. It had an equivalent branch in the Imperial Japanese Navy known as the Tokkeitai. However, their civilian counterpart known as the Tokkō was formed in 1911. Its task consisted of controlling political groups and ideologies in Imperial Japan, resembling closer the other secret police agencies of the time period. For this it earned the nickname &quot;the Thought Police&quot;.

==== South Korea ====
The Korean Central Intelligence Agency or KCIA is a secret police agency which acted extra-judicially and was involved in such activities as kidnapping a presidential candidate and the assassination of Park Chung-hee, among other things.

==== Syria ====
The General Intelligence Directorate or the GID was the secret police organization of the Assad regime which ruled Syria that suppressed the people until it disbanded in December 2024 during the Syrian Revolution with a popular uprising against the dictator Bashar al-Assad when he fled to Russia that night.

==== Taiwan ====
In Taiwan, the National Security Bureau, established in 1954, is the regime&#x27;s main intelligence agency. The Taiwan Garrison Command acted as a secret police/national security body which existed as a branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces. The agency was established at the end of World War II and operated throughout the Cold War. It was disbanded on 1 August 1992. It was responsible for suppressing activities viewed as promoting democracy and Taiwan independence.

=== Europe ===
Secret police organizations originated in 18th-century Europe after the French Revolution and the Congress of Vienna. Such operations were established in an effort to detect any possible conspiracies or revolutionary subversion. The peak of secret-police operations in most of Europe was 1815 to 1860, &quot;when restrictions on voting, assembly, association, unions and the press were so severe in most European countries that opposition groups were forced into conspiratorial activities.&quot; The &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; of Austria and the &quot;Geheimpolizei&quot; of Prussia were particularly notorious during this period. After 1860, the use of secret police declined due to increasing liberalization, except in autocratic regimes such as Tsarist Russia.

==== Germany ====
In Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945, the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Secret State Police, Gestapo) and &quot;Geheime Feldpolizei&quot; (Secret Field Police, GFP) were a secret police organization used to identify and eliminate opposition, including suspected organized resistance. Its claimed main duty, according to a 1936 law, was &quot;to investigate and suppress all anti-State tendencies&quot;. One method used to spy on citizens was to intercept letters or telephone calls. They encouraged ordinary Germans to inform on each other. As part of the Reich Security Main Office, it was also a key organizer of the Holocaust. Although the Gestapo had a relatively small number of personnel (32,000 in 1944), &quot;it maximized these small resources through informants and a large number of denunciations from the local population&quot;.

After the defeat of the Nazis in World War II, Germany was split into West and East Germany. East Germany became a socialist state and ruled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It was closely aligned with communist Russia and the Soviet Union. It had secret police, commonly referred to as the Stasi, which made use of an extensive network of civilian informers. From the 1970&#x27;s, the main form of political, cultural and religious repression practiced by the Stasi, was a form of &#x27;silent repression&#x27; called Zersetzung (&quot;Decomposition&quot;). This involved the sustained use of covert psychological harassment methods against people, which were designed to cause mental and emotional health problems, and thereby debilitate them and cause them to become socially isolated. Directed-energy weapons are considered by some survivors and analysts to have also been used as a constituent part of Zersetzung methods, although this is not definitely proven.

==== Hungary ====
The House of Terror museum in Budapest displays the headquarters for the Arrow Cross Party, which killed hundreds of Jews in its basement, among other targets considered &quot;enemies of the race-based state&quot;. The same building was used by the State Protection Authority (or ÁVH) secret police. The Soviet-aligned ÁVH moved into the former fascist police headquarters and used it to torture and execute state opponents.

==== Italy ====

In the Fascist Italy (1922-1943) and the Italian Social Republic (RSI), OVRA were a fascist Italian secret police organization.

==== Russia ====
Ivan the Terrible implemented Oprichnina in Russia between 1565 and 1572. In the Russian Empire, the secret police forces were the Third Section of the Imperial Chancery and then the Okhrana. Agents of the Okhrana were vital in identifying and suppressing opponents of the Tsar. The Okhrana engaged in torture and infiltration of opponents. They infiltrated labor unions, political parties, and newspapers. After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union established the Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, NKGB, and MVD. Cheka, as an authorized secret police force under the rule of the Bolsheviks, suppressed political opponents during the Red Terror. It also enacted counterintelligence operations such as Operation Trust, in which it set up a fake anti-Bolshevik organization to identify opponents. It was the temporary forerunner to the KGB, a later secret police agency used for similar purposes. The NKVD participated in the Great Purge under Stalin.

=== North America ===
==== Cuba ====
In Cuba, President Fulgencio Batista&#x27;s secret police, known as the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities (or BRAC), suppressed political opponents such as the 26th of July Movement through methods including violent interrogations.

Under the Communist Party of Cuba, the Ministry of the Interior has served a number of secret policing functions. As recently as 1999, the Human Rights Watch reported that repression of dissidents was routine, albeit harsher after heightened periods of opposition activity. The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor under the US State Department reported that Cuba&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior utilizes a network of informants known as the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (or CDR) to monitor government opponents. Secret state police have operated in secret among CDR groups, and most adult Cubans are officially members. CDR are tasked with informing on other Cubans and monitoring activity in their neighborhoods.

====Mexico====
During the Truman Doctrine, Mexican president Miguel Alemán Valdés created DFS to combat communist opposition. The agency was later replaced by DISEN in 1985 after DFS agents were working for the Guadalajara Cartel. In 1989, it was replaced by CISEN.

==== United States ====

In Mississippi, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (or &quot;Sov-Com&quot;) was a state agency given unusual authority by the governor of Mississippi from 1956 to 1977, to investigate and police private citizens in order to uphold racial segregation. This authority was used to suppress and spy on the activities of civil rights workers, along with others suspected of sentiments contrary to white supremacy. Agents from the Sov-Com wiretapped and bugged citizens of Mississippi, and historians identify the agency as a secret police force. Among other things, the Sov-Com collaborated with the Ku Klux Klan and engaged in jury tampering to harass targets. The agency ceased to function in 1973, but was not officially dissolved until 1977. The Sov-Com served as a model for the Louisiana State Sovereignty Commission, the Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, and the Alabama State Sovereignty Commission.

In private writings in 1945, President Harry S. Truman wrote that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (under Director J. Edgar Hoover) was tending towards becoming a secret police force:We want no Gestapo or Secret Police. F.B.I. is tending in that direction. They are dabbling in sex life scandles [sic] and plain blackmail when they should be catching criminals. They also have a habit of sneering at local law enforcement officers.Yet in spite of these sentiments, Truman took no action to try to abolish the FBI, or even more modest reforms. Beginning a decade later in 1956, Hoover&#x27;s FBI began the COINTELPRO project, aimed at suppressing domestic political opponents. Among other targets, this included Martin Luther King Jr.

=== South America ===
==== Brazil ====
During the Getúlio Vargas dictatorship, between 1930 and 1946, the Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS) was the government&#x27;s secret police.

During the military dictatorship in Brazil, DOPS was employed by the military regime along with the Department of Information Operations - Center for Internal Defense Operations (or DOI-CODI) and the National Intelligence Service (or SNI), and engaged in kidnappings, torture, and attacks against theaters and bookstores.

==== Chile ====
The National Intelligence Directorate, or DINA, was a powerful secret police agency under the rule of Augusto Pinochet, which was charged with killings and torture related to repression of political opponents. Chilean government investigations found that over 30,000 people were tortured by the agency.

==== Venezuela ====
During the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the Seguridad Nacional secret police investigated, arrested, tortured, and assassinated political opponents to the Venezuelan government. From 1951 until 1953, it operated a prison camp on , which was effectively a forced labour camp. The Seguridad Nacional was abolished following the overthrow of Pérez Jiménez on 23 January 1958.

During the crisis in Venezuela and Venezuelan protests, Vice Presidents Tareck El Aissami and Delcy Rodríguez have been accused of using SEBIN to oppress political demonstrations. SEBIN director and general Manuel Cristopher Figuera reported that SEBIN would torture political demonstrators during interrogation sessions.

==Functions and methods==
Ilan Berman and J. Michael Waller describe the secret police as central to totalitarian regimes and &quot;an indispensable device for the consolidation of power, neutralization of the opposition, and construction of a single-party state&quot;. In addition to these activities, secret police may also be responsible for tasks not related to suppressing internal dissent, such as gathering foreign intelligence, engaging in counterintelligence, organizing border security, and guarding government buildings and officials. Secret police forces sometimes endure even after the fall of a totalitarian regime.

Arbitrary detention, abduction and forced disappearance, torture, and assassination are all tools wielded by secret police &quot;to prevent, investigate, or punish (real or imagined) opposition.&quot; Because secret police typically act with great discretionary powers &quot;to decide what is a crime&quot; and are a tool used to target political opponents, they operate outside the rule of law.

People apprehended by the secret police are often arbitrarily arrested and detained without due process. While in detention, arrestees may be tortured or subjected to inhumane treatment. Suspects may not receive a public trial, and instead may be convicted in a kangaroo court-style show trial, or by a secret tribunal. Secret police known to have used these approaches in history included the secret police of East Germany (the Ministry for State Security or Stasi) and Portuguese PIDE.

==Control==

A single secret service may pose a potential threat to the central political authority. Political scientist Sheena Chestnut Greitens writes that: When it comes to their security forces, autocrats face a fundamental &#x27;coercing dilemma&#x27; between empowerment and control. ... Autocrats must empower their security forces with enough coercing capacity to enforce internal order and conduct external defense. Equally important to their survival, however, they must control that capacity, to ensure it is not turned against them. Authoritarian regimes therefore attempt to engage in &quot;coup-proofing&quot; (designing institutions to minimize risks of a coup). Two methods of doing so are:
* Increasing fragmentation (i.e., dividing powers among the regime security apparatuses to prevent &quot;any single agency from amassing enough political power to carry out a coup&quot;) and
* Increasing exclusivity (i.e., purging the regime security apparatus to favor familial, social, ethnic, religious, and tribal groups perceived as more loyal).

<text>In the Old Norse written corpus, berserkers () were those who were said to have fought in a trance-like fury, a characteristic which later gave rise to the modern English adjective &quot;&quot; . Berserkers are attested to in numerous Old Norse sources.

== Etymology ==
The Old Norse form of the word was (plural ), a compound word of &quot;ber&quot; and &quot;serkr&quot;. The second part, &quot;serkr&quot;, means (also found in Middle English, see ). The first part, &quot;ber&quot;, on the other hand, can mean several things, but is assumed to have most likely meant , with the full word, &quot;berserkr&quot;, meaning just , as in . 

Thirteenth-century historian Snorri Sturluson, an Icelander who lived around 200 years after berserkers were outlawed in Iceland (outlawed in 1015), on the other hand, interpreted the meaning as , that is to say that the warriors went into battle without armour, but that view has largely been abandoned, due to contradicting and lack of supporting evidence.

== Early beginnings ==
It is proposed by some authors that the northern warrior tradition originated from hunting magic. Three main animal cults appear to have developed: the cult of the bear, the wolf, and the wild boar.

=== Germanic mercenaries in the Roman army ===

The bas-relief carvings on Trajan&#x27;s column in Rome, completed in 113 AD, depict scenes of Trajan&#x27;s conquest of Dacia in 101–106 AD. The scenes show his Roman soldiers plus auxiliaries and allies from Rome&#x27;s border regions, including tribal warriors from both sides of the Rhine. There are warriors depicted as barefoot, bare-chested, bearing weapons and helmets that are associated with the Germani.

Scene 36 on the column shows some of these warriors standing together, with some wearing bearhoods and some wearing wolfhoods. This is the only potential record of Germanic bear-warriors and wolf-warriors fighting together until 872 AD, with Thórbiörn Hornklofi&#x27;s description of the battle of Hafrsfjord, when they fought together for King Harald Fairhair of Norway.

=== Migration Period depictions ===
In 1639 and 1734 respectively, two vastly decorated horns made of sheet gold, the Golden Horns of Gallehus, were discovered in Southern Jutland, Denmark. As part of its decoration, the first horn, the larger of the two, depicts two animal headed men facing each other, armed with what appears to be a sickle and a wood-splitting axe. Dated to the early 5th century, these depictions could represent something related to berserkers.

In the spring of 1870, four Vendel era cast-bronze dies, the Torslunda plates, were found by Erik Gustaf Pettersson and Anders Petter Nilsson in a cairn on the lands of the farm No 5 Björnhovda in Torslunda parish, Öland, Sweden, one of them showing what appears to be a berserker ritual.

In 1887, the graves of two 7th century Alemanni men were found during construction work in the immediate vicinity of the St. Gallus Church in the Gutenstein district of the city of Sigmaringen, Germany. One of the graves contained, among other things, a silver sword scabbard, the . Highly ornate, it features a warrior figure with a wolf&#x27;s head, holding a sword and a spear. It is thought this depicts an &quot;ulfheðinn&quot; (wolf warrior), as pre-Christian Central Europe was part of the same tradition as the Norse.

Other animal headed figures have been found, such as an antlered figure on the Gundestrup cauldron, found on northern Jutland, Denmark, in 1891, which has been dated from 200 BC to 300 AD.

== Types ==
=== Berserkers – bear warriors ===
It is proposed by some authors that the berserkers drew their power from the bear and were devoted to the bear cult, which was once widespread across the northern hemisphere. The berserkers maintained their religious observances despite their fighting prowess, as the &quot;Svarfdæla saga&quot; tells of a challenge to single-combat that was postponed by a berserker until three days after Yule. The bodies of dead berserkers were laid out in bearskins prior to their funeral rites. The bear-warrior symbolism survives to this day in the form of the bearskin caps worn by the guards of the Danish monarchs.

In battle, the berserkers were subject to fits of frenzy. They would howl like wild beasts, foam at the mouth, and gnaw the rims of their shields. According to belief, during these fits, they were immune to steel and fire, and made great havoc in the ranks of the enemy. When this fever abated, they were weak and tame. Accounts can be found in the sagas.

To &quot;go berserk&quot; was to &quot;hamask&quot;, which translates as &quot;change form&quot;, in this case, as with the sense &quot;enter a state of wild fury&quot;. Some scholars have interpreted those who could transform as a berserker as &quot;hamrammr&quot; or &quot;shapestrong&quot; – literally able to shapeshift into a bear&#x27;s form. For example, the band of men who go with Skallagrim in &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; to see King Harald about his brother Thorolf&#x27;s murder are described as &quot;the hardest of men, with a touch of the uncanny about a number of them ... they [were] built and shaped more like trolls than human beings.&quot; This has sometimes been interpreted as the band of men being &quot;&quot;hamrammr&quot;, though there is no major consensus.

Another example of &quot;hamrammr&quot;&quot; comes from the &quot;Saga of Hrólf Kraki&quot;. One tale within tells the story of Bödvar Bjarki, a berserker who is able to shapeshift into a bear and uses this ability to fight for king Hrólfr Kraki. &quot;Men saw that a great bear went before King Hrolf&#x27;s men, keeping always near the king. He slew more men with his fore paws than any five of the king&#x27;s champions.&quot;

=== Ulfheðnar – wolf warriors ===
Wolf warriors appear among the legends of the Indo-Europeans, Turks, Mongols, and Native American cultures. The Germanic wolf-warriors have left their trace through shields and standards that were captured by the Romans and displayed in the &quot;armilustrium&quot; in Rome.

Frenzy warriors wearing the skins of wolves called &quot;ulfheðnar&quot; (&quot;wolf-skin-ers&quot; or possibly &quot;wolf-heathens&quot;; singular &quot;ulfheðinn&quot;), are mentioned in the &quot;Vatnsdæla saga&quot;, the &quot;Haraldskvæði&quot; and the &quot;Grettis saga&quot; and are consistently referred to in the sagas as a group of berserkers, always presented as the elite following of the first Norwegian king Harald Fairhair. They were said to wear the pelt of a wolf over their chainmail when they entered battle. Unlike berserkers, direct references to &quot;ulfheðnar&quot; are scant.

&quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; features a man called Kveldulf (&quot;Evening-Wolf&quot;) who is said to have transformed into a wolf at night. This Kveldulf is described as a berserker, as opposed to an &quot;ulfheðinn&quot;. &quot;Ulfheðnar&quot; are sometimes described as Odin&#x27;s special warriors: &quot;[Odin&#x27;s] men went without their mailcoats and were mad as hounds or wolves, bit their shields...they slew men, but neither fire nor iron had effect upon them. This is called &#x27;going berserk&#x27;.&quot;

The helm-plate press from Torslunda depicts a scene of a one-eyed warrior with bird-horned helm, assumed to be Odin, next to a wolf-headed warrior armed with a spear and sword as distinguishing features, assumed to be a berserker with a wolf pelt: &quot;a wolf-skinned warrior with the apparently one-eyed dancer in the bird-horned helm, which is generally interpreted as showing a scene indicative of a relationship between berserkgang ... and the god Odin&quot;.

=== &quot;Jǫfurr&quot; – proposed boar warriors ===
In Norse poetry, the word &quot;jǫfurr&quot;, which originally meant &quot;wild boar&quot;, is used metaphorically for &quot;a prince, monarch or warrior&quot;, which probably stems from the custom of wearing boar&#x27;s heads as helmets or boar crested helmets in battle.

Swine played a central role in Germanic paganism, featuring in both mythology and religious practice, particularly in association with the Vanir, Freyr and Freyja. It has been proposed that similar to berserkers, warriors could ritually transform into boars so as to gain strength, bravery and protection in battle. It has been theorised that this process was linked to the wearing of boar helmets as a ritual costume.

== Attestations ==
Berserkers appear prominently in a multitude of other sagas and poems. Many earlier sagas portrayed berserkers as bodyguards, elite soldiers, and champions of kings. This image would change as time passed and sagas would begin to describe berserkers as boasters rather than heroes, and as ravenous men who loot, plunder, and kill indiscriminately. Within the sagas, Berserkers can be narrowed down to four different types. The King&#x27;s &quot;Berserkr,&quot; the Hall-Challenging &quot;Berserkr&quot;, the &quot;Hólmgangumaðr&quot;, and the Viking &quot;Berserkr&quot;. Later, by Christian interpreters, the berserker was viewed as a &quot;heathen devil&quot;.

The earliest surviving reference to the term &quot;berserker&quot; is in &quot;Haraldskvæði&quot;, a skaldic poem composed by Thórbiörn Hornklofi in the late 9th century in honor of King Harald Fairhair, as &quot;ulfheðnar&quot; (&quot;men clad in wolf skins&quot;). This translation from the Haraldskvæði saga describes Harald&#x27;s berserkers:

The &quot;tasters of blood&quot; (a kenning) in this passage are thought to be ravens, which feasted on the slain.

The Icelandic historian and poet Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) wrote the following description of berserkers in his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;:

King Harald Fairhair&#x27;s use of berserkers as &quot;shock troops&quot; broadened his sphere of influence. Other Scandinavian kings used berserkers as part of their army of hirdmen and sometimes ranked them as equivalent to a royal bodyguard. It may be that some of those warriors only adopted the organization or rituals of berserk Männerbünde, or used the name as a deterrent or claim of their ferocity.

Emphasis has been placed on the frenzied nature of the berserkers, hence the modern sense of the word &quot;berserk&quot;. However, the sources describe several other characteristics that have been ignored or neglected by modern commentators. Snorri&#x27;s assertion that &quot;neither fire nor iron told upon them&quot; is reiterated time after time. The sources frequently state that neither edged weapons nor fire affected the berserks, although they were not immune to clubs or other blunt instruments. For example:

Similarly, Hrolf Kraki&#x27;s champions refuse to retreat &quot;from fire or iron&quot;. Another frequent motif refers to berserkers blunting their enemy&#x27;s blades with spells or a glance from their evil eyes. This appears as early as Beowulf where it is a characteristic attributed to Grendel. Both the fire eating and the immunity to edged weapons are reminiscent of tricks popularly ascribed to fakirs.
In 1015, Jarl Eiríkr Hákonarson of Norway outlawed berserkers. Grágás, the medieval Icelandic law code, sentenced berserker warriors to outlawry. By the 12th century, organised berserker war-bands had disappeared.
The Lewis Chessmen, found on the Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, and thought to be of Norse manufacture, include berserkers depicted biting their shields.

== Theories ==

Scholar Hilda Ellis-Davidson draws a parallel between berserkers and the mention by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII (CE 905–959) in his book &quot;De cerimoniis aulae byzantinae&quot; (&quot;Book of Ceremonies of the Byzantine court&quot;) of a &quot;Gothic Dance&quot; performed by members of his Varangian Guard, Norse warriors in the service of the Byzantine Empire, who took part wearing animal skins and masks: she believes this may have been connected with berserker rites.

The rage the berserker experienced was referred to as &quot;berserkergang&quot; (&#x27;berserk fit/frenzy&#x27; or &#x27;berserk movement&#x27;). This condition has been described as follows:


Some scholars propose that certain examples of berserker rage had been induced voluntarily by the consumption of drugs such as hallucinogenic mushrooms, massive amounts of alcohol, or a mixture only known as &#x27;butotens.&#x27; This is much debated but the theory is further supported by the discovery of seeds belonging to black henbane (&quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot;) in a Viking grave that was unearthed near Fyrkat, Denmark in 1977. An analysis of the symptoms caused by &quot;Hyoscyamus niger&quot; revealed that they are also similar to the symptoms ascribed to the berserker state, which suggest it may have been used to generate their warlike mood. Other explanations for the berserker&#x27;s madness that have been put forward include self-induced hysteria, epilepsy, or mental illness, among other causes.

One theory of the berserkers suggests that the physical manifestations of the berserker alongside their rage was a form of self-induced hysteria. Initiated before battle through a ritualistic performance meant for effect, which included actions such as shield-biting and animalistic howling.

Jonathan Shay makes an explicit connection between the berserker rage of soldiers and the hyperarousal of posttraumatic stress disorder. In &quot;Achilles in Vietnam&quot;, he writes:

It has been suggested that the berserkers&#x27; behavior inspired the legend of the werewolf.

== In popular culture ==

* &quot;Gears of War&quot; features an enemy known as the Locust. Within the Locust caste are drones, with the females named berserkers.
* Thor Odinson has been depicted with a berserker rage like state called &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Madness&quot; which enhances his strength, speed, durability and stamina for months though Thor has very little control in this state. A &#x27;Berserker staff&#x27; is featured in the Marvel TV show &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;.
* &quot;Falling Skies&quot; is a science fiction series produced by Steven Spielberg where a post-massacre remnant society of humans offers armed resistance to an alien invasion. A small faction of mercenary fighters within the human cohort that is at the center of the series&#x27; action is known as The Berzerkers.
* In the 2022 film &quot;The Northman&quot;, the main character Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) is raised as part of a group of berserkers. A berserker ritual is also featured in the film.

<text>The Berserker series is a series of space opera science fiction short stories and novels by Fred Saberhagen, in which robotic self-replicating machines strive to destroy all life.

These Berserkers, named after the human berserker warriors of Norse legend, are doomsday weapons left over from an interstellar war between two races of extraterrestrials. They all have machine intelligence, and their sizes range from that of an asteroid, in the case of an automated repair and construction base, down to human size (and shape) or smaller. The Berserkers&#x27; bases are capable of manufacturing more and deadlier Berserkers as the need arises. The Berserker hypothesis, formed as a possible solution to the Fermi paradox, takes its name from the series.

The &quot;Berserker&quot; stories (published as novels and short stories) depict the fight between Berserkers and the sentient species of the Milky Way Galaxy: &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (referred to as &quot;Earth-descended&quot; or &quot;ED&quot; humans, or as &quot;Solarians&quot;) which is the only sentient species aggressive enough to counter Berserkers.

== First appearances ==

The first story, &quot;Without a Thought&quot; (originally published as &quot;Fortress Ship&quot;) (1963), is a puzzle story, whose protagonist must find a way to simulate intelligence to fool an enemy trying to determine whether there was any conscious being present in a spaceship.

Saberhagen came up with the Berserker as the rationale for the story on the spur of the moment, but the basic concept was so fruitful, with so many possible ramifications, that he used it as the basis of many stories. A common theme in the stories is of how the apparent weaknesses and inconsistencies of living beings are actually the strengths that bring about the killer machines&#x27; eventual defeat.

The second story, &quot;Goodlife&quot; (1963), introduces human traitors or collaborators who cooperate with the Berserker machines to stay alive for a little longer.

== Backstory ==
The original Berserkers were designed and built as an ultimate weapon, by a race now known only as the Builders, to wipe out their rivals, the Red Race, in a war which took place at a time corresponding to Earth&#x27;s Paleolithic era. The Builders failed to ensure their own immunity from Berserker attack, or they lost those safeguards through an unknown malfunction that changed the Berserker programming, and they were exterminated by their own creation very shortly after the demise of the Red Race. The Berserkers then set out across the galaxy to fulfill their core programmed imperative, which is now, simply, to destroy all life wherever they can find it.

A similar premise, though on a much smaller scale, was previously introduced by Walter M. Miller, Jr., in the 1954 short story &quot;I Made You&quot;, described by reviewer N. Samuelson as &quot;A pure &#x27;sorcerer’s apprentice&#x27; sketch, about a war machine on the moon which kills anyone who comes within its range, including one of its programmers, because its control circuits are damaged.&quot;

== List of species ==
The Berserker stories features many different characters originating from many different species, human and alien. These include:

=== Berserkers ===
The Berserkers are intelligent machines, created by an organic race in the past, as a doomsday weapon, a group of robots with one goal: to destroy all organic life. They turned on their own creators, wiping them out.

The Berserker brain is based on the decay of radioactive elements, to enable their moves to be unpredictable in the event that some race should ever &#x27;crack their source code&#x27; and be able to predict perfectly their battle strategies. In rare instances, the unpredictable nature of Berserker decision making has actually worked in humans&#x27; favor.

Berserkers exist in a multitude of shapes, sizes and forms. The most common Berserkers are large spherical interstellar spacecraft, heavily armed and armored, equipped with self-replicating factories, and capable of producing numerous scout craft, foot soldiers, and other weapons of war.

Little is known of the Berserkers&#x27; history other than that they were created to destroy the Red Race, who are now extinct. The creators of the Berserkers are known as the Builders, who were also later destroyed by the Berserkers.

=== The Builders ===
The Builders were a precursor race, of whom little is known other than they created and were later destroyed by the Berserkers. Saberhagen describes them thus:

The Builders created the Berserkers in a genocidal war with the Red Race, which ended in both races&#x27; extinction by the Berserkers.

=== Carmpan ===
The Carmpan are a patient and peaceful species; their culture is one of logic, reason, pacifism, and philosophy. They lend what support they can to the Humans, but in non-martial forms. They are incapable of direct aggression, but they do possess one special power, a telepathic ability to speak to other sentients across the stars, a method of communication that the Berserkers cannot spy on. Their most effective help to ED (Earth Descended) Solarians is the &#x27;Prophecy of Probability&#x27; in which they can give information on future events. This prophecy is very taxing and can even cause the death of a Carmpan.

Although their bodies are described as boxy and machine-like, the Carmpan are also a biological lifeform and thus a target for the genocidal programming of the Berserkers. As such, they have allied themselves with the human race against the Berserkers.

The first stories in the series are related by an individual Carmpan, the &quot;3rd Historian&quot;, who seeks to chronicle life in the Galaxy and the struggle against the Berserkers.

=== Goodlife ===
The Berserkers are known to cooperate with each other, most of the time. They sometimes spare the lives of human (or other organic) traitors or collaborators, known as &quot;goodlife&quot;, who are willing to cooperate to help destroy other lifeforms.

=== Humanity ===
&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, referred to as &quot;Earth-descended&quot; or &quot;ED&quot; Humans, or as &quot;Solarians&quot;, is the only sentient species aggressive enough to counter Berserkers.

The Berserkers have severely threatened human civilizations and wiped out billions of humans and other more exotic species. The remnants of human civilization have learned to be wily in order to survive. Berserker technology is much more advanced than that of any known human society. The survivors are disparate and lack the ability to act as a united foe to the Berserkers. While ED humans have massed powerful fleets on many occasions, bickering and strife between factions both political and cultural have often blunted the Solarian Armadas&#x27; effectiveness, ironically furthering the power of their machine foes, the Berserkers.

=== Qwib-qwib ===
Later stories involve the Qwib-qwib, an anti-Berserker berserker. Quib-quib&#x27;s full name was &quot;quibbian-qwibbian-kel.&quot; &quot;Qwibbian&quot; was the name the alien red race used for Berserkers.

=== Red Race ===
The Red Race was another precursor race, of which little is known other than that their extinction was the Builders&#x27; purpose in creating the Berserkers millennia ago.

== Adaptations ==
* A board game based on the series was produced by Flying Buffalo Inc in 1982.
* A comic book adaptation is being created by Fan-Atic Press.
* The play-by-mail game &quot;Starweb&quot; uses the term &quot;Berserker&quot; with permission of Fred Saberhagen; Saberhagen returned the favor by using a fictionalized &quot;Starweb&quot; game as a backdrop for the novel &quot;Octagon&quot;.

<text>Courland is one of the Historical Latvian Lands in western Latvia. Courland&#x27;s largest city is Liepāja, which is the third largest city in Latvia. The regions of Semigallia and Selonia are sometimes considered as part of Courland as they were formerly held by the same duke.

The literal meaning of the name is &quot;Land of Curonians&quot;.

== Geography and climate ==
Situated in western Latvia, Courland roughly corresponds to the former Latvian districts of Kuldīga, Liepāja, Saldus, Talsi, Tukums and Ventspils.

When combined with Semigallia and Selonia, Courland&#x27;s northeastern boundary is the Daugava River, which separates it from the regions of Latgale and Vidzeme. To the north, Courland&#x27;s coast lies along the Gulf of Riga. On the west it is bordered by the Baltic Sea, and on the south by Lithuania. It lies between 55° 45′ and 57° 45′ North and 21° and 27° East.

The name is also found in the Curonian Spit and Lithuanian &quot;Karšuvos giria&quot; - the Courland wood.

The area comprises , of which is made up of lakes. The landscape generally has a low and undulating character, with flat and marshy coastlands. The interior features wooded dunes, covered with pine, spruce, birch, and oak, with swamps and lakes, and fertile patches between. Courland&#x27;s elevation never rises more than above sea level.

The Jelgava plain divides Courland into two parts, the western side, which is fertile and densely inhabited, except in the north, and the eastern side, less fertile and thinly inhabited.

Nearly one hundred rivers drain Courland, but only three of these rivers – the Daugava, the Lielupe and the Venta – are navigable. They all flow northwestward and discharge into the Baltic Sea.

Owing to its numerous lakes and marshes, Courland has a damp, often foggy, and changeable climate; its winters are severe.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In ancient times the Curonians, a pagan tribe, inhabited Courland. The Brethren of the Sword, a German Catholic military order, subdued the Curonians and converted them to Christianity in the first quarter of the 13th century. Thus in 1230, the Curonian king (Latvian: Lamekins) made peace directly with the papal legate. He accepted baptism, and became a vassal of the pope. In 1237 the area passed into the rule of the Teutonic Order owing to the amalgamation of this order with that of the Brethren of the Sword.

=== Livonian Confederation ===

The Livonian Confederation was a loosely organized confederation formed by the German-led Livonian Order and various bishoprics that encompassed much of present-day Estonia and Latvia. It existed from 1228 to the 1560s, when it was dismembered by the Tsardom of Russia during the Livonian War.

=== Duchy of Courland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, 1561–1795 ===
The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a semi-independent duchy that existed from 1561 until 1795, encompassing the areas of Courland and Semigallia. Although nominally a vassal state of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the dukes operated autonomously. In the 18th century, Russia acquired great influence over the Duchy; the future Empress Anna of Russia served as regent there from 1711 until her accession to the Russian throne in 1730. After the last of the ducal line into which she had married died in 1737, she arranged for the Duchy to be given to her lover, Ernst Johann von Biron instead.

The Duchy was one of the smallest European nations to colonize overseas territories, establishing short-lived outposts on the Caribbean islands of Tobago and Trinidad and at the mouth of the Gambia River in Africa on what was then known as James Island.

In 1795, the last Duke, Peter von Biron, ceded the Duchy to the Russian Empire.

The former Bishopric of Courland was directly incorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as the District of Pilten of the Wenden and later Inflanty Voivodeship.

=== Courland as part of the Russian Empire ===
After annexation by the Russian Empire, the territory of the former Duchy formed the Courland Governorate.

From the time of the Northern Crusades in the early 13th century, most land was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders. In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired labourers, occupying a low position in the social scale.

Agriculture was the chief occupation, with the principal crops being rye, barley, oats, wheat, flax, and potatoes. The large estates conducted agriculture with skill and scientific knowledge. Fruit grew well. Excellent breeds of cattle, sheep and pigs were kept. Liepāja and Jelgava operated as the principal industrial centres, with ironworks, agricultural machinery works, tanneries, glass and soap works. Flax spinning took place mostly as a domestic industry. Iron and limestone were the chief minerals; a little amber was found on the coast. The only seaports were Liepāja, Ventspils and Palanga, there being none on the Courland coast of the Gulf of Riga.

==== Population ====

In 1870 the population was 619,154; in 1897 it was 674,437 (of whom 345,756 were women); in 1906 it was estimated at 714,200. Of the whole, 79% were Latvians, 8.4% Baltic Germans, about 8% Jews, 1.4% Russians, 1% Lithuanians, 1% Poles, and some Livonians.

The chief towns of the ten districts were Jelgava (Mitau), Courland&#x27;s capital (pop. 35,011 in 1897); Liepāja (Libau) (pop. 64,500 in 1897); Bauska (6,543); Jaunjelgava (Friedrichstadt) (5,223); Kuldīga (Goldingen) (9,733); Grobiņa (1,489); Aizpute (Hasenpoth) (3,338); Ilūkste (Illuxt) (2,340); Talsi (Talsen) (6,215); Tukums (Tuckum) (7542); and Ventspils (Windau) (7,132).

75% of the population belonged to the prevailing denomination, Lutheranism; the rest belonged to the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. There was a small but vigorous Jewish population.

=== Courland during and after World War I ===
During World War I, Courland formed part of the Eastern Front theatre of operations that saw fighting primarily between forces of the Russian and German Empires. Following Russia&#x27;s Great Retreat of 1915, Courland came under the control of the Imperial German Army&#x27;s Ober Ost commander in the person of Paul von Hindenburg, a Prussian military hero. (The Russian authorities of the Courland Governorate were exiled to Tartu, never to return.) With large territories coming under the Ober Ost&#x27;s administration as a result of military successes on the Eastern Front, General Erich Ludendorff was charged with managing the large area now under its jurisdiction. Courland District (which included parts of Semigallia) was made one of three districts of the region, which also came to be known as &quot;Ober Ost&quot;.

As Russian rule in the rest of what is now Latvia began collapsing at the end of World War I, Baltic Germans began a process of forming provincial councils between September 1917 and March 1918, competing with ethnic Latvians&#x27; moves toward independence. With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 3 March 1918, the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic formally relinquished control of Courland to Germany. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was proclaimed on 8 March 1918 by a Baltic German &quot;Landesrat&quot;, who offered the crown of the duchy to German Kaiser Wilhelm II. Wilhelm recognised the duchy as a German vassal that same month. However, the duchy was absorbed on 22 September 1918 by the United Baltic Duchy.

On 18 November 1918, Latvia proclaimed its independence and on 7 December 1918, the German military handed over authority to the pro-German Latvian Provisional Government headed by Kārlis Ulmanis. By January 1919, much of Courland had been overrun by the Bolsheviks&#x27; Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic, but the provisional government with the aid of German forces pushed back and took back Courland by April. Throughout the Latvian War of Independence, much of Courland remained a German stronghold. Latvia eventually signed a cease-fire with Germany on 15 July 1920, and the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty of 11 August ended the war.

=== Courland as part of interbellum Latvia ===
After World War I, Courland became one of five provinces of the newly formed nation of Latvia. These provinces corresponded to Latvia&#x27;s four traditional regions plus Riga. In 1935, Courland had an area of and a population of 292,659 making it the least populous of the provinces.

=== Courland during and after World War II ===
The Soviet Army occupied Latvia in conformity with the terms of 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 17 June 1940. On 5 August 1940, the Soviet Union annexed the region along with the rest of Latvia which was made a constituent republic of the USSR, the Latvian SSR.

At the start of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941, the German Wehrmacht&#x27;s Army Group North headed by Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb overran Courland, along with the rest of the Baltic littoral. During the German occupation Courland was administered as Liepāja County area (&quot;Kreisgebiet Libau&quot;).

In 1944 the Red Army lifted the siege of Leningrad and re-conquered the Baltic countries along with much of Ukraine and Belarus. However, some 200,000 German troops held out in Courland. With their backs to the Baltic Sea, they remained trapped in what became known as the Courland Pocket, blockaded by the Red Army and by the Red Baltic Fleet. Colonel-General Heinz Guderian, the Chief of the German General Staff, pleaded with Adolf Hitler to allow evacuation of the troops in Courland by sea for use in the defense of Germany. Hitler refused and ordered the Wehrmacht, Waffen-SS, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine forces in Courland to continue the defense of the area. Germany’s naval capacity to evacuate these forces was restricted as it needed the majority of its transport ships to evacuate troops from East Prussia and maintain vital trade with Sweden. On January 15, 1945, Army Group Courland (&quot;Heeresgruppe Kurland&quot;) formed under Colonel-General Dr. Lothar Rendulic. The blockade by elements of the Leningrad Front remained until May 8, 1945, when Army Group Courland, then under its last commander, Colonel-General Carl Hilpert, surrendered to Marshal Leonid Govorov, the commander of the Leningrad Front (reinforced by elements of the 2nd Baltic Front) on the Courland perimeter. At this time the group consisted of the remnants of some 31 divisions. After May 9, 1945, approximately 203,000 troops of Army Group Courland began to be moved to Soviet prison camps to the east. The majority of them never returned to Germany (Haupt, 1997).

Courland remained part of the Latvian SSR within the Soviet Union following World War II. Courland was no longer an administrative unit under the Soviets. Liepājas apgabals (1952-1953), one of three oblasts in Latvia, roughly corresponded to Courland.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Courland became part of independent Latvia once more and it remains so to this day. Although Courland is not an administrative entity today, the Courland &quot;(Kurzeme)&quot; Planning Region, with an area of and a population of 301,621 in 2008, includes much of the traditional region. The remainder of Courland is part of the planning regions of Riga and Semigallia &quot;(Zemgale)&quot;.

<text>By an ordinance issued by the government of Sweden, a number of days of the calendar year are designated as official flag flying days when the Swedish flag is flown on all public flagpoles and buildings. Hoisting of the Swedish flag on private flagpoles on these days is strongly encouraged but not mandatory.


The time of day at which the flag is raised and lowered is generally dictated by the position of the sun, but there are also guidelines specified by military tradition. The flag is hoisted at 08:00 in the summer and 09:00 in the winter, and it is lowered by sunset but never later than 21:00. In parts of Sweden north of the Arctic Circle, the sun does not rise at all for several weeks during winter. For example, in the northern town of Kiruna, the flag is flown from 09:00 until 11:50.

<text>Mother and Son is an Australian television sitcom that was broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) from 16 January 1984 until 21 March 1994. The show stars Ruth Cracknell, Garry McDonald, Henri Szeps and Judy Morris. It featured many Australian actors of the time in guest roles. It was created and written by Geoffrey Atherden. Its theme song features the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, playing &quot;I Want a Girl (Just Like the Girl That Married Dear Old Dad)&quot;, a jazz standard which was recorded by Al Jolson in the 1920s.

A stage version of &quot;Mother and Son&quot; was written by Geoffrey Atherden and premiered at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne, on 18 July 2014.

In November 2022, it was announced the series would be given an eight-episode reboot with Denise Scott and Matt Okine playing Maggie and Arthur, respectively. Filming for the series began in Sydney in March 2023.

==Premise==
The plot of the show addresses the problems of ageing and caring for somebody with increasing memory loss, with an often sharp-edged humour which carried with it a tinge of sadness. Despite its unlikely subject matter for a comedy, the show was a favourite with audiences. Maggie&#x27;s and Arthur&#x27;s relationship was presented with a fascinating complexity—Maggie&#x27;s cruel attacks on and emotional manipulation of Arthur disguised her deep dependence on and need of him, and Arthur&#x27;s dutiful love of Maggie was constantly in conflict with his guilty frustration at the huge limitations for his own life which looking after his mother entailed. The performance of Cracknell, a famous stage actress, as Maggie was particularly lauded as one of the finest characterisations on Australian television. The series itself became extremely popular and has screened in constant re-runs, particularly by Network Ten. Garry McDonald and Ruth Cracknell in character would appear in television adverts for Dynamo laundry liquid.

==Main characters==

===Maggie Beare===
Maggie (Ruth Cracknell), full name Margaret May Lapsley Beare, is the widow of World War II veteran Leo, mother of Robert and Arthur, sister to Lorna and grandmother to Damien and Teonie. Maggie is apparently in the early stages of some form of dementia and her younger son Arthur lives with and takes care of her. However, despite being increasingly forgetful, Maggie is lucid enough to manipulate Arthur when she wants to, usually for something devilish that will seriously inconvenience him. Maggie was a former nurse and met Leo while treating him for war wounds.

===Arthur Beare===
Younger son of Maggie and Leo, brother of Robert, uncle to Damien and Teonie and recent ex-husband of Deidre, Arthur (Garry McDonald) is an editor and journalist for a newspaper. When he is not working, he is usually at home attending to the demands of his impish and increasingly confused mother. He drives a 1955 Morris Minor Series II Tourer convertible that is constantly breaking down, has trouble bringing female friends back to the house because of his mother&#x27;s deliberate interference, and is almost always thwarted by Maggie whenever he attempts to socialize with his work friends. Maggie frequently excoriates Arthur, labelling all his would-be girlfriends as &quot;floozies&quot;, Arthur is nicknamed &quot;Artie&quot; by brother Robert.

===Robert Beare===
Elder son of Maggie and Leo, brother of Arthur, husband to Liz and father of Damien and Teonie, Robert (Henri Szeps) is a successful dentist who takes many holidays and has extramarital affairs. He does so by disguising his overseas holiday trysts as dental research conferences. His mother tells him off for his womanising and says that it is the reason he failed medical school, much to the disappointment of his late father. He is a &#x27;man of leisure&#x27; who is adept at providing excuses as to why it is Arthur and not he that must take the primary care of their elderly mother. Robert loves to play tennis and golf, listening to classical music, and throughout the show owns a series of luxury cars: a Jaguar, Volvo and a BMW. When Arthur asked him for a loan to buy a new car, all Robert would offer him was a seriously impaired Volvo at a discount.

===Liz Beare===
Wife of Robert, mother to Damien and Teonie, the long-suffering Liz (Judy Morris) is well aware of her husband&#x27;s affairs but finds it difficult to prove any of them, because of Robert&#x27;s well-honed skill at covering them up. So in the meantime, Liz compensates by spending Robert&#x27;s money and socialising with her equally rich, bored and unhappy friends. She occasionally seeks consolation from Arthur, using behaviour that could suggest that she is attracted to him. She is frequently, however, just as insensitive and selfish as Robert is and just as eager to put Maggie in a home. Liz has a verbal drawl, and is frequently heard to say &quot;Oh Gawd&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re weird, Arthur&quot;.

==Recurring characters==
Deidre Beare (Suzanne Roylance): Ex-wife of Arthur. Appears in five episodes. Deidre seems to want the best for her ex-husband Arthur and dislikes him looking after his mother. Maggie resents the fact that Arthur had divorced. They end up getting back together in the final episode.

Aunty Lorna (Melissa Jaffer): Sister of Maggie. Appears in three episodes. She is married to Stan and has three children—Colin, Dawn and Murray. Lorna is the &quot;younger and prettier&quot; sister, much to Maggie&#x27;s chagrin. Stan, Colin, Dawn and Murray do not appear in the show, and are only mentioned by name. In the second episode in which she appears it is revealed that Stan has died.

Dr. Holloway (Martin Vaughan): (3 episodes) the family&#x27;s doctor, who apparently suffers from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==The house==

The house used for outside shots with the cast, at 16 Rickard Street Rodd Point, was built by John Cockerill in 1927, had an auction which was &quot;off the Richter scale with well and truly over 100 people, at least&quot;.

The house was mainly unknown in connection to the show (with most bidders being too young to know the sitcom) and sold in 2014 for $1.95 million to build a dual-occupancy dwelling with an underground garage and swimming pool.

No objections were received, the application was amended and demolition and construction was approved in June 2015.

<doc id="181084" wikidata="Q57768" url="?curid=181084" title="Ernst Johann von Biron">
<text>Ernst Johann von Biron (; ; ) was the duke of Courland and Semigallia from 1737 to 1740 and again from 1763 to 1769. He was also briefly the regent of the Russian Empire in 1740.

==Early years==
Biron was born as Ernst Johann von Bühren in Kalnciems, Semigallia as a second son of Cornet Karl von Bühren (1653–1733) and his wife Katharina Hedwig von der Raab genannt Thülen (1660–1740). His grandfather Carl von Bühren (d. 1674) had been a groom in the service of Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland, and had received a small estate from his master, which Biron&#x27;s father inherited and where Biron himself was born. He received some education at the academy of Königsberg, but was expelled from there for riotous conduct. In 1714, he set out to seek his fortune in Russia, and unsuccessfully solicited a place at the offices of Princess Charlotte of Brunswick-Lüneburg, wife of the Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich.

Unsuccessful in Russia, Biron returned after a while to Mitau (Courland), where one of his sisters, who served as a lady in waiting to Anna, regent of Courland, had become the fancy of the ruling minister, Peter Bestuzhev. Through his sister&#x27;s intercession and the minister&#x27;s favour, Biron gained a place at Anna&#x27;s court. Later, during his patron&#x27;s absence, Biron, a handsome, insinuating fellow, succeeded in supplanting him in Anna&#x27;s favour, and even procuring the disgrace and banishment of Bestuzhev and his family. From this time to the end of her life, Biron&#x27;s influence over Anna was paramount, and he would be at the pinnacle of this life during the period when she ruled Russia as Empress Anna.

==Ruling Russia==
In 1723, Biron married Benigna Gottlieb von Trotha genannt Treyden (1703–1782), lady-in-waiting to Regent Anna and the daughter of a Baltic-German nobleman. The marriage, which was reportedly arranged by Anna in an attempt to conceal her own relationship with Biron, proved harmonious and felicitous. His wife remained devoted to Biron not only throughout his years as Anna&#x27;s favorite and confidant, but also during his two decades of exile to Siberia after her death, which Benigna shared with Biron. They had three children together, a son, Peter, prince of Courland, a son Karl Ernst von Biron (1728–1801) and a daughter, Hedvig Elizabeth.

In 1730, Anna was elevated to the Russian throne. Biron and his wife moved to Moscow, both of them retaining their position as adviser and lady-in-waiting, and received many honours and riches. At Anna&#x27;s coronation (19 May 1730), Biron was appointed grand chamberlain, made a count of the Empire, and granted an estate at Wenden with an income of 50,000 crowns a year. It was on this occasion that his name was first rendered in court documents as &#x27;Biron&#x27; (rather than &#x27;Biren&#x27;), and he is said to have adopted the arms of the French Ducal House of Biron, to which house he did not in fact have the slightest connection.

The Council of the Empire attempted to secure from Anna an aristocratic constitution, but she crushed the powerful nobility, notably the Dolgorukis and the Galitsins, and placed her reliance exclusively on Biron, who became for all practical purposes the ruler of the Empire. His ascendancy over the empress was unshakable, and whenever required, Biron&#x27;s enemies and rivals were swept out of the way quite literally; he is said to have caused over 1000 executions, while the number of persons exiled by him to Siberia is estimated at between 20,000–40,000. Meanwhile, the common people were ground down by taxation. Russians have described this reign as the &quot;Bironovshchina&quot; and the &quot;German yoke.&quot; Nevertheless, he showed himself an administrator of considerable ability, and maintained order in the Empire at a time when troubles could have been expected, because the main Romanov line was now extinct, and even the empress did not have children or definite heirs.

During the latter years of Anna&#x27;s reign in Russia, Biron increased enormously in power and riches. His apartments in the palace adjoined those of the empress, and his liveries, furniture and equipages were scarcely less expensive or splendid than hers. The magnificence of his plate astonished the French ambassador, and the diamonds of his duchess were the envy of princes. A special department of state looked after his brood mares and stallions. He had landed estates everywhere. Half the bribes intended for the Russian court passed through his coffers.

==Duke of Courland and Semigallia==

The climax of his elevation occurred in June 1737 when, on the extinction of the line of Kettler, the nobility (&#x27;estates&#x27;) of Courland were arm-twisted into electing Biron as their reigning duke. Anna had been the wife of the penultimate duke, whose successor, his uncle Ferdinand, died childless in that year. The Kettler dynasty being now extinct, the estates were called upon to elect a new duke, and Anna proposed Biron. He was almost as unpopular in Courland and Semigallia as in Russia, and the estates were mortified at the prospect of this upstart holding sway over them, but the will of the empress could not be easily gainsaid. Still, it was found necessary to supply large sums of money, smuggled into Courland and Semigallia in the shape of bills payable in Amsterdam to bearer, in order to persuade the electors to fall in with Anna&#x27;s choice. There was another complication: the duchy of Courland and Semigallia was then in dispute between Poland and Lithuania and Russia. Russian armies were employed to place Augustus III, Elector of Saxony, on the Polish throne. In return, the Elector promised that Biron would be invested with the duchy of Courland and Semigallia. The Emperor Charles VI, subordinating everything to his Pragmatic Sanction, readily countenanced these violent acts, and the king of Prussia was bought by certain territorial concessions. The investiture took place in 1739 at Warsaw by authority of the Polish king and senate.

==Fall from power==
Outwardly humble during his first years in power, Biron became haughty and overbearing towards the end of Anna&#x27;s reign. This behavior and the gruesome execution on somewhat dubious charges of his erstwhile protégé, the cabinet minister Artemy Volynsky (insisted upon by Biron), made Biron unpopular with Russians of all classes.

On her deathbed, very unwillingly and only at his urgent entreaty, Anna appointed Biron regent during the minority of the baby emperor, Ivan VI of Russia. Her common sense told her that the only way she could save the man she loved from the vengeance of his enemies after her death was to facilitate in time his descent from his untenable position. Finally, on 26 October 1740, a so-called &quot;positive declaration&quot; signed by 194 dignitaries, in the name of the Russian nation, conferred the regency on Biron.

Anna died on October 28. Biron&#x27;s regency lasted exactly three weeks - at midnight on 19 November 1740 he was seized in his bedroom by his ancient rival, Field Marshal Münnich. A commission was appointed to try his case, and it condemned him (11 April 1741) to death by quartering. However, this sentence was commuted by the clemency of the new regent, Anna Leopoldovna, the mother of Ivan VI, to banishment for life at Pelym in Siberia. All of Biron&#x27;s vast property was confiscated, including his diamonds, worth £600,000. A second palace revolution occurred soon afterwards, and the new empress, Elizabeth Petrovna, banished Münnich and permitted Biron to take up his residence at Yaroslavl.

==Later years==
For 22 years, the ex-regent disappeared from the high places of history. He re-emerged for a brief moment in 1762, when the Germanophile Peter III of Russia summoned him to court. In 1763, Catherine II of Russia re-established him in his duchy of Courland, which he bequeathed to his son Peter in 1769. The last years of his rule were just and even benevolent, if somewhat autocratic. He died at Rastrelli&#x27;s palace in Mitava, his capital, on 29 December 1772. His wife, who had been his faithful companion in all his travails, as in his ascendency, survived him by ten years. Biron was succeeded as Duke of Courland by their son, Peter von Biron.

<doc id="181094" wikidata="Q50599" url="?curid=181094" title="Ted Stevens">
<text>Theodore Fulton Stevens Sr. (November 18, 1923 – August 9, 2010) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a U.S. Senator from Alaska from 1968 to 2009.

He was the longest-serving Republican Senator in history at the time he left office. Stevens was the president pro tempore of the United States Senate in the 108th and 109th Congresses from 2003 to 2007, and was the third U.S. Senator to hold the title of president pro tempore emeritus. He was previously Solicitor of the Interior Department from 1960 to 1961. Stevens has been described as one of the most powerful members of Congress and as the most powerful member of Congress from the Northwestern United States.

Stevens served for six decades in the American public sector, beginning with his service as a pilot in World WarII. In 1952, his law career took him to Fairbanks, Alaska, where he was appointed U.S. Attorney the following year by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956, he returned to Washington, D. C., to work in the Eisenhower Interior Department, eventually rising to become Senior Counsel and Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, where he played an important role as an executive official in bringing about and lobbying for statehood for Alaska, as well as forming the Arctic National Wildlife Range.

After unsuccessfully running to represent Alaska in the United States Senate, Stevens was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964 and became House majority leader in his second term. In 1968, Stevens again unsuccessfully ran for Senate, but he was appointed to Bob Bartlett&#x27;s vacant seat after Bartlett&#x27;s death later that year. As a senator, Stevens played key roles in legislation that shaped Alaska&#x27;s economic and social development, with Alaskans describing Stevens as &quot;the state&#x27;s largest industry&quot; and nicknaming the federal money he brought in &quot;Stevens money&quot;. This legislation included the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Title IX, gaining him the nickname &quot;The Father of Title IX&quot;, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. He was also known for his sponsorship of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which established the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee.

In 2008, Stevens was embroiled in a federal corruption trial as he ran for re-election to the Senate. He was initially found guilty, and, eight days later, he was narrowly defeated by Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich. Stevens was the longest-serving U.S. Senator to have ever lost a bid for re-election. However, when a Justice Department probe found evidence of gross prosecutorial misconduct, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder asked the court to vacate the conviction and dismiss the underlying indictment, and Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted the motion. Stevens died on August 9, 2010, near Dillingham, Alaska, when a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter he and several others were flying in crashed en route to a private fishing lodge.

==Early life and career==
===Childhood and youth===

Stevens was born November 18, 1923, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the third of four children, in a small cottage built by his paternal grandfather after the marriage of his parents, Gertrude S. Chancellor and George A. Stevens. The family later lived in Chicago, where George was an accountant before losing his job during the Great Depression. Around this time, when Ted Stevens was six years old, his parents divorced, and Stevens and his three siblings moved back to Indianapolis so they could reside with their paternal grandparents, followed shortly thereafter by their father, who developed problems with his eyes which eventually blinded him. Stevens&#x27;s mother moved to California and sent for Stevens&#x27;s siblings as she could afford to, but Stevens stayed in Indianapolis helping to care for his father and a mentally disabled cousin, Patricia Acker, who also lived with the family. The only adult in the household with a job was Stevens&#x27;s grandfather. Stevens helped to support the family by working as a newsboy, and would later remember selling many newspapers on March 1, 1932, when newspaper headlines blared the news of the Lindbergh kidnapping.
In 1934 Stevens&#x27;s grandfather punctured a lung in a fall down a tall flight of stairs, contracted pneumonia, and died. Stevens&#x27;s father, George, died in 1957 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, of lung cancer. Stevens and his cousin Patricia moved to Manhattan Beach, California in 1938, by which time both of Stevens&#x27;s grandparents had died, to live with Patricia&#x27;s mother, Gladys Swindells. Stevens attended Redondo Union High School, participating in extracurricular activities including working on the school newspaper and becoming a member of a student theater group affiliated with the YMCA, and, during his senior year, the Lettermen&#x27;s Society. Stevens also worked at jobs before and after school, but still had time for surfing with his friend Russell Green, the son of the Signal Gas and Oil Company&#x27;s president, who remained a close friend throughout Stevens&#x27;s life.

===Military service===

After he graduated from Redondo Union High School in 1942, Stevens enrolled at Oregon State University to study engineering, attending for a semester. With World WarII in progress, Stevens attempted to join the Navy and serve in naval aviation, but failed the vision exam. He improved his vision through a course of prescribed eye exercises, and in 1943 he was accepted into an Army Air Force Air Cadet program at Montana State College. Stevens said that, after scoring near the top of his class on an aptitude test for flight training, he was transferred from the program to preflight training in Santa Ana, California, and he received his wings early in 1944.

Stevens served in the China-Burma-India theater with the Fourteenth Air Force Transport Section, which supported the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, from 1944 to 1945. He and other pilots in the transport section flew C-46 and C-47 transport planes, often without escort, mostly in support of Chinese units fighting the Japanese. Stevens received the Distinguished Flying Cross for flying behind enemy lines, the Air Medal, and the Yuan Hai Medal awarded by the Chinese Nationalist government. He was discharged from the Army Air Forces in March 1946.

===Higher education and law school===
After the war, Stevens attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1947. While at UCLA, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Theta Rho chapter). He applied to law school at Stanford and the University of Michigan, but on the advice of his friend Russell Green&#x27;s father to &quot;look East&quot;, he applied to Harvard Law School, which he ended up attending. Stevens&#x27;s education was partly financed by the G.I. Bill; he made up the difference by selling his blood, borrowing money from an uncle, and working several jobs including one as a bartender in Boston. During the summer of 1949, Stevens was a research assistant in the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California (now the Central District of California).

While at Harvard, Stevens wrote a paper on maritime law that received honorable mention for the Addison Brown prize, a Harvard Law School award for the best student-penned essay related to private international law or maritime law. The essay later became a &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; article, and, 45 years later, Justice Jay Rabinowitz of the Alaska Supreme Court praised Stevens&#x27;s scholarship, telling the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; that the high court had issued a recent opinion citing the article. Stevens graduated from Harvard Law School in 1950.

===Early legal career===
After graduating, Stevens went to work in the Washington, D.C., law offices of Northcutt Ely. Twenty years earlier, Ely had been executive assistant to Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur during the Hoover administration, and, by 1950, he headed a prominent law firm specializing in natural resources issues. One of Ely&#x27;s clients, Emil Usibelli, founder of the Usibelli Coal Mine in Healy, Alaska, was trying to sell coal to the military, and Stevens was assigned to handle his legal affairs.

===Marriage and family===
Early in 1952, Stevens married Ann Mary Cherrington, a Democrat and the adopted daughter of University of Denver Chancellor Ben Mark Cherrington. She had graduated from Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and during the Truman administration had worked for the State Department.

On December 4, 1978, the crash of a Learjet 25C on approach at Anchorage International Airport killed five of the seven aboard; Stevens survived, suffering a concussion and broken ribs, but his wife, Ann, did not. Stevens would later state in an interview with the Anchorage Times &quot;I can&#x27;t remember anything that happened.&quot; Smiling, he added, &quot;I&#x27;m still here. It must be my Scots blood.&quot; The building which houses the Alaska chapter of the American Red Cross at 235 East Eighth Avenue in Anchorage is named in her memory; likewise a reading room at the Loussac Library.

Stevens and Ann had three sons (Ben, Walter, and Ted) and two daughters (Susan and Elizabeth). Democratic Governor Tony Knowles appointed Ben to the Alaska Senate in 2001, where he served as the president of the state senate until the fall of 2006.

Ted Stevens remarried in 1980. He and his second wife, Catherine, had a daughter, Lily.

Stevens&#x27;s last Alaska home was in Girdwood, a ski resort community near the southern edge of Anchorage&#x27;s city limits, about by road from downtown. The home was the subject of media attention after it was raided by FBI &amp; IRS agents in 2007.

====Prostate cancer====
Stevens was a survivor of prostate cancer and had publicly disclosed his cancer. He was nominated for the first Golden Glove Awards for Prostate Cancer by the National Prostate Cancer Coalition (NPCC). He advocated the creation of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program for Prostate Cancer at the Department of Defense, which has funded nearly $750million for prostate cancer research. Stevens was a recipient of the Presidential Citation by the American Urological Association for significantly promoting urology causes.

==Early Alaska career==
In 1952, while still working for Northcutt Ely, Stevens volunteered for the presidential campaign of Dwight D. Eisenhower, writing position papers for the campaign on western water law and lands. By the time Eisenhower won the election that November, Stevens had acquired contacts who told him, &quot;We want you to come over to Interior.&quot; Stevens left his job with Ely, but a job in the Eisenhower administration did not materialize as a result of a temporary hiring freeze instituted by Eisenhower in an effort to reduce spending.

Instead, Stevens was offered a job with the Fairbanks, Alaska, law firm of Charles Clasby, Emil Usibelli&#x27;s Alaska attorney whose firm (Collins &amp;Clasby) had just lost one of its attorneys. Stevens and his wife had met and liked both Usibelli and Clasby, and decided to make the move. Loading up their 1947 Buick and traveling on a $600 loan from Clasby, they drove across country from Washington, D.C., and up the Alaska Highway in the dead of winter, arriving in Fairbanks in February 1953. Stevens later recalled kidding Governor Walter Hickel about the loan. &quot;He likes to say that he came to Alaska with 38 cents in his pocket&quot;, he said of Hickel. &quot;I came $600 in debt.&quot; Ann Stevens recalled in 1968 that they made the move to Alaska &quot;on a six-month trial basis&quot;.

In Fairbanks, Stevens made contacts within the city&#x27;s Republican party division. He befriended conservative newspaper publisher C.W. Snedden, who had purchased the &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot; in 1950. Snedden&#x27;s wife, Helen, later recalled that Snedden and Stevens were &quot;like father and son&quot;. However, she would add in 1994 that &quot;The only problem Ted had was that he had a temper&quot;, crediting her husband with helping to steady Stevens like you would do with a son, and with teaching Stevens the art of diplomacy.

===U.S. Attorney===
==== Nomination ====
Stevens had been with Collins &amp; Clasby for six months when Robert J. McNealy, a Democrat appointed as U.S. Attorney for Fairbanks during the Truman administration, informed U.S. District Judge Harry Pratt he would be resigning effective August 15, 1953, having already delayed his resignation by several months at the request of Justice Department officials newly appointed by Eisenhower. The latter had asked McNealy to delay his resignation until Eisenhower could appoint a replacement. Despite Stevens&#x27;s short tenure as an Alaska resident and his relative lack of trial or criminal law experience, Pratt asked Stevens to serve in the position until Eisenhower acted. Stevens agreed. &quot;I said, &#x27;Sure, I&#x27;d like to do that,&#x27;&quot; Stevens recalled years later. &quot;Clasby said to me, &#x27;It&#x27;s not going to pay you as much money&#x27;, but, &#x27;if you want to do it, that&#x27;s your business.&#x27; He was very pissed that I decided to go.&quot; Most members of the Fairbanks Bar Association voiced their disapproval of the appointment of a newcomer, and members in attendance at the association&#x27;s meeting that December voted to instead support Carl Messenger for the permanent appointment, an endorsement seconded by the Alaska Republican Party Committee for the Fairbanks-area judicial division. However, Stevens was favored by Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Senator William F. Knowland of California, and the Republican National Committee, (Alaska itself had no Senators at this time, as it was still a territory). Eisenhower sent Stevens&#x27;s nomination to the U.S. Senate on February 25, 1954, and the Senate confirmed him on March 30.

==== Career as U.S. Attorney ====
Stevens soon gained a reputation as an active prosecutor who vigorously prosecuted violations of both federal and territorial liquor, drug, and prostitution laws, characterized by Fairbanks area homesteader Niilo Koponen (who later served in the Alaska State House of Representatives from 1982 to 1991) as &quot;this rough tough shorty of a district attorney who was going to crush crime&quot;. Stevens sometimes accompanied U.S. Marshals on raids. As recounted years later by Justice Jay Rabinowitz, &quot;U.S. marshals went in with Tommy guns and Ted led the charge, smoking a stogie and with six guns on his hips.&quot; However, Stevens himself said the colorful stories spread about him as a pistol-packing D.A. were greatly exaggerated, and recalled only one incident when he carried a gun: on a vice raid to the town of Big Delta about southeast of Fairbanks, he carried a holstered gun on a marshal&#x27;s suggestion.

Stevens also became known for his explosive temper, which was focused particularly on a criminal defense lawyer named Warren A. Taylor who would later go on to become the Alaska Legislature&#x27;s first Speaker of the House in the First Alaska State Legislature. &quot;Ted would get red in the face, blow up and stalk out of the courtroom&quot;, a former court clerk later recalled of Stevens&#x27;s relationship with Taylor. Later on, a former colleague of Stevens would &quot;cringe at remembering hearing Stevens through the wall of their Anchorage law office berating clients.&quot; Stevens&#x27;s wife, Ann, would make her husband read self-help books to try and calm him down, although this effort was to no avail. As one observer remembered: &quot;He would lose his temper about the dumbest things. Even when you would agree with him, he got mad at you for agreeing with him.&quot;

In 1956, in a trial which received national headlines, Stevens prosecuted Jack Marler; a former Internal Revenue Service agent who had been indicted for failing to file tax returns. Marler&#x27;s first trial, which was handled by a different prosecutor, had ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial. For the second trial, Stevens was up against Edgar Paul Boyko, a flamboyant Anchorage attorney who built his defense of Marler on the theory of no taxation without representation, citing the Territory of Alaska&#x27;s lack of representation in the U.S. Congress. As recalled by Boyko, his closing argument to the jury was a rabble-rousing appeal for the jury to &quot;strike a blow for Alaskan freedom&quot;, claiming that &quot;this case was the jury&#x27;s chance to move Alaska toward statehood.&quot; Boyko remembered that &quot;Ted had done a hell of a job in the case&quot;, but Boyko&#x27;s tactics paid off, and Marler was acquitted on April 3, 1956. Following the acquittal, Stevens issued a statement saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe the jury&#x27;s verdict is an expression of resistance to taxes or law enforcement or the start of a Boston Tea Party.&quot; Stevens then followed &quot;I do believe, however, that the decision will be a blow to the hopes for Alaska statehood.&quot;

===Department of the Interior===
====Alaska statehood====

In March 1956, Stevens&#x27;s friend Elmer Bennett, legislative counsel in the Department of the Interior, was promoted by Secretary of the Interior Douglas McKay to the Secretary&#x27;s office. Bennett successfully lobbied McKay to replace him in his old job with Stevens, and Stevens returned to Washington, D.C., to take up the position. By the time he arrived in June 1956, McKay had resigned in order to run for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Oregon, and Fred Andrew Seaton had been appointed to replace him. Seaton, a newspaper publisher from Nebraska, was a close friend of &quot;Fairbanks Daily News-Miner&quot; publisher C.W. Snedden, who was in addition friends with Stevens, and in common with Snedden was an advocate of Alaska statehood, unlike McKay, who had been lukewarm in his support. Upon his appointment, Seaton asked Snedden if he knew anyone from Alaska who could come down to Washington, D.C. to work for Alaska statehood; Snedden replied that the man he needed (Stevens) was already there working in the Department of the Interior. The fight for Alaska statehood became Stevens&#x27;s principal work at Interior. &quot;He did all the work on statehood&quot;, Roger Ernst, the then Assistant Secretary of Interior for Public Land Management, later said of Stevens. &quot;He wrote 90 percent of all the speeches; Statehood was his main project.&quot; A sign on Stevens&#x27;s door proclaimed his office as &quot;Alaskan Headquarters&quot;, and Stevens became known at the Department of the Interior as &quot;Mr. Alaska&quot;.
Efforts to make Alaska a state had been going on since 1943, and had nearly come to fruition during the Truman administration in 1950 when a statehood bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives, only to die in the Senate. The national Republican Party opposed statehood for Alaska, in part out of fear that Alaska would, upon statehood, elect Democrats to the U.S. Congress, while the Southern Democrats opposed statehood, believing that the addition of 2 new pro-civil rights Senators would jeopardize the Solid South&#x27;s control on Congressional law. At the time Stevens arrived in Washington, D.C., to take up his new job, a constitutional convention to write an Alaska constitution had just been concluded on the campus of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. The 55 delegates also elected three unofficial representatives (all Democrats) as unofficial Shadow congressmen: Ernest Gruening and William Egan as Shadow U.S. Senators and Ralph Rivers as Shadow at-large U.S. representative.
President Eisenhower, a Republican, regarded Alaska as too large in area and with a population density too low to be economically self-sufficient as a state, and furthermore saw statehood as an obstacle to effective defense of Alaska should the Soviet Union seek to invade it. Eisenhower was especially worried about the sparsely populated areas of northern and western Alaska. In March 1954, he had reportedly &quot;drawn a line on a map&quot; indicating his opinion of the portions of Alaska which he felt ought to remain in federal hands even if Alaska were granted statehood.

Seaton and Stevens worked with Gen. Nathan Twining, the incumbent Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who himself had previously served in Alaska; and Jack L. Stempler, a top Defense Department attorney, to create a compromise that would address Eisenhower&#x27;s concerns. Much of their work was conducted in a hospital room at Walter Reed Army Hospital, where Interior Secretary Seaton was receiving treatment for reoccurring health issues with his back. Their work concentrated on refining the line on the map that Eisenhower had drawn in 1954, one which became known as the PYK Line after three rivers (the Porcupine, Yukon, and Kuskokwim) whose courses defined much of the line. The PYK Line was the basis for Section10 of the Alaska Statehood Act, which Stevens wrote. Under Section 10, the land north and west of the PYK Linewhich included the entirety of Alaska&#x27;s North Slope, the Seward Peninsula, most of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the western portions of the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islandswould be part of the new state, but the president would be granted emergency powers to establish special national defense withdrawals in those areas if deemed necessary. &quot;It&#x27;s still in the law but it&#x27;s never been exercised&quot;, Stevens later recollected. &quot;Now that the problem with Russia is gone, it&#x27;s surplusage. But it is a special law that only applies to Alaska.&quot;

Stevens, illegally, also took part in lobbying for the statehood bill, working closely with the Alaska Statehood Committee from his office at Interior. Stevens hired Marilyn Atwood, daughter of &quot;Anchorage Times&quot; publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department. &quot;We were violating the law&quot;, Stevens told a researcher in an October 1977 oral history interview for the Eisenhower Library. Stevens explained in the interview that they were violating a long-standing statute against lobbying from the executive branch. &quot;We more or less masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch.&quot; Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on Congressmen based on their backgrounds, identity and religious beliefs, as he later recalled in the 1977 interview. &quot;We&#x27;d assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that had something in common with them.&quot; The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. &quot;We set Ike (Eisenhower) up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood&quot;, Stevens said in the 1977 interview. &quot;We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try to ask him about statehood.&quot; Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens. &quot;We planted editorials in weeklies and dailies and newspapers in the district of people we thought were opposed to us or states where they were opposed to us.&quot; Stevens then added &quot;...Suddenly they were thinking twice about opposing us.&quot;

The Alaska Statehood Act became law with Eisenhower&#x27;s signature on July 7, 1958, and Alaska formally was admitted to statehood on January 3, 1959, when Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Proclamation.

==== Solicitor of Interior ====
On September 15, 1960, George W. Abbott resigned as Solicitor of the Interior to become Assistant Secretary, and Stevens became Solicitor. He stayed in this office until the Eisenhower administration left office on January 20, 1961. In his position as the highest attorney in the Interior Department, he authored the order that created the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1960.

===Return to Alaska and service in the Alaska House of Representatives===
After returning to Alaska, Stevens managed Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1960 campaign in Alaska. Nixon lost the election narrowly to John F. Kennedy, but won Alaska, which was unexpected due to Alaska&#x27;s Democratic lean. Shortly after, Stevens founded Stevens &amp; Savage, a law firm in Anchorage. Stevens was then joined by H. Russel Holland, who later became a federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, and the firm&#x27;s name changed to Stevens, Savage &amp; Holland. Stevens became a member of Operation Rampart, a group in favor of building the Rampart Dam, a hydroelectric project on the Yukon River. Elected to the Alaska House of Representatives in 1964, he became House Majority Leader in his second term. In this position, he helped push through the repeal of a law that the Governor must appoint a U.S. Senator of the same party as their predecessor when filling a Senate vacancy, benefitting from this law change the next year when Bob Bartlett died.

==U.S. Senator==
===Service===

Stevens&#x27;s service as a United States Senator was, at first, marked with instability and controversy. Mike Gravel stated that he had no issue with Stevens being the senior senator, because he was seven years Stevens&#x27;s junior, and Stevens had been in public service for longer than he had. Even after losing the 1968 Republican primary, Stevens embarked on a state-wide campaign for the Republican nominee, Elmer Rasmuson, attacking Gravel on his time as Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives. When they were being sworn in together in 1969, Stevens approached Gravel and apologized, asking if they could &quot;let political bygones be bygones&quot;, so that they could work together. However, Gravel replied &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be your friend, Ted. I didn&#x27;t appreciate you going around the state and lying about me.&quot; Gravel and Stevens never recovered, with Gravel later recalling &quot;We&#x27;d talk about things. I&#x27;d joke with him. He&#x27;s got a sense of humor.&quot; However, Gravel would add &quot;He didn&#x27;t use it on me unless I was the butt of it.&quot;
During the inaugural meeting of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs during the 91st United States Congress, Stevens commandeered the meeting, booming: &quot;The first priority has to be settlement of Alaska Native land claims. This committee hadn&#x27;t had the guts to do it at statehood.&quot; By the end of the meeting, Stevens and Gravel had ended up in a shouting match, constantly interrupting and disrespecting each other, boiling out into the hallway, fists raised, giving statements to the press in a makeshift conference before Chairman Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson interrupted and broke up the fight. In one incident, Stevens began lecturing Jackson, the chairman. Jackson put his foot down, stating &quot;Now just a minute. You&#x27;re new here and I want to tell you how these things are handled.&quot; Ed Weinberg would recall that Jackson treated Ted Stevens like he was a rebellious schoolboy and, as such, would make him &quot;sit in the corner with a dunce cap on.&quot; &quot;Jackson wasn&#x27;t about to let Ted Stevens take over the hearings and the framing of this legislation.&quot;

Following the 1974 campaign, where Stevens begrudgingly campaigned for the Republican nominee, leading John Birch Society member C.R. Lewis, Stevens again tried to put their rivalry aside, sending a letter inviting Gravel and his wife to a &quot;nice dinner&quot; with him and his wife. However, Gravel turned it down, later recalling he showed Stevens that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to socialize with him.&quot; Gravel felt Stevens did not behave appropriately during the campaign, adding &quot;I wanted nothing to do with him socially.&quot;

On October 13, 1978, the last day of the second sitting of the 95th Congress, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, an act to conserve around a third of Alaska as &#x27;America&#x27;s last huge, untouched wilderness&#x27;, an act which Stevens championed after providing a compromise with Mo Udall, was killed by Gravel. One theory why was that Gravel killed the bill in an attempt to spite Stevens, but it is more widely accepted that Gravel had killed the bill as part of his 1980 re-election campaign. The day before, Gravel had written to Stevens that he &#x27;supported Stevens&#x27; and was reconsidering his opposition of any attempt of a compromise. On the day, the bill was granted an extension for a year by the House, but when the Senate debated the extension, Stevens did not present Gravel&#x27;s objections to the Senate. In response, Gravel stood up and killed the extension, stating that astounded him how members of Congress could &quot;meet so much on a subject&quot; that &quot;affected someone else&#x27;s state.&quot; Gravel would then add that he &quot;had been willing to rise above this and work on the compromise&quot;, even though he believed the bill &quot;...was anathema to what I thought was right and in the best interests of Alaska...&quot;
Democratic New Hampshire Senator John A. Durkin rose. &quot;The whole chamber knows what the senator is up to. He is out to torpedo this bill!&quot; Gravel rebutted &quot;I will not admit that!&quot;, continuing to speak until Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd took the bill off of the floor. The Senate descended into rage, Gravel unsuccessfully trying to talk over the Senators&#x27; angry commotion. Stevens then rose and stated that &quot;I feel like a father who has just arrived at the delivery room and found out his son has been stillborn.&quot; He accused Gravel of lying, adding Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus and President Jimmy Carter would take away &#x27;millions of acres of Alaska from development&#x27;. Durkin then rose again; &quot;We worked out an extension to protect Alaska, and he is torpedoing that now. I hope the press is listening, as well as every village in Alaska, so when the secretary (Andrus) invokes the Antiquities Act there will be no ticker-tape parade.&quot; Hard to hear over the anger of the Senate, Durkin then finally added that Alaskans should know that the compromise &quot;foundered on two words, after forty-seven markups, and those two words are &#x27;Mike Gravel.&#x27;&quot; Gravel argued that Stevens was selling out, and, in rebuttal, Stevens told the press that Gravel had broken his word, adding &quot;Gravel is an international playboy who needs psychiatric help.&quot;, following &quot;I&#x27;m not even sure if God could fathom his thinking.&quot;

=== 1978 plane crash ===

On December 4, 1978, Stevens had a meeting in Anchorage with executives of the major pro-development lobby &quot;Citizens for the Management of Alaska&#x27;s Lands&quot;. On the same day, Governor of Alaska Jay Hammond, would be sworn in for a second term in Alaska&#x27;s capital, Juneau. Tony Motley, the Chair of CMAL, arranged for a friend&#x27;s private plane to pick them up after the inauguration had finished, and then fly them from Juneau to Anchorage so Stevens could attend the meeting. During takeoff from Anchorage International, the plane had risen only a few feet above the runway when it was hit by a sudden, strong gust of wind, which flipped the plane around and pointed it straight up in the air. In an attempt to re-orient the plane, the pilot pulled back the throttle, but the plane stalled and crashed violently into the ground. Out of the seven people on board, including the pilot, only Stevens and Motley survived the crash. The other five passengers, a group which included Ann Stevens, who was Stevens&#x27; wife of decades, died on impact.
Stevens&#x27;s wife&#x27;s death hit him very hard. On the day of the crash Gravel was on a trip to Saudi Arabia, but he flew back to attend Ann&#x27;s funeral. Afterwards, Gravel asked a Stevens aide if he could express his condolences personally, but he was informed that Stevens didn&#x27;t want to see him. Upon Stevens&#x27; return, he seemed &quot;bitter and in terrible emotional pain&quot;, hinting in both Alaska and D.C. that he believed that the only reason he made the flight was that he had to rebuild the effort for a land bill back together, and that thus the primary reason was Mike Gravel killing the bill. Most of his remarks were not printed by reporters, who saw them as statements of someone &quot;half-crazy with grief&quot;.
However, on February 6, 1979, Stevens spoke to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, which Udall chaired, which had just begun to debate the new edition of the lands bill, and he brought up the plane crash. &quot;It was on that trip to Alaska to reconstitute the efforts for the coming year that I and Tony Motley, who passed away ... were involved in an accident&quot;, he said, the fact that Motley had survived seemingly lapsing his mind. &quot;The trip was neither spur-of-the-moment nor stopgap. It was and is to me the beginning of this year&#x27;s effort to achieve an acceptable D2 lands bill. As I am sure you realize, and many of you can imagine, the solution of the issue means even more to me than it did before.&quot; He shortly talked about the bill, before finally adding: &quot;I think if that bill had passed, I might have a wife sitting and waiting when I get home tonight, too.&quot;
In 1979, Stevens began to recruit primary challengers for the Democratic nomination to Gravel for his re-election campaign the following year. After some courting, Stevens decided to back Clark Gruening, the grandson of Ernest Gruening, who Gravel had defeated in the primary 12 years prior. Stevens had also reportedly (and unsuccessfully) attempted to court Tony Motley, the other survivor of the 1978 crash to run as the Republican nominee, but Motley stated he had only briefly touched upon entering the race with Stevens and that he was not a candidate. The junior Gruening would defeat Gravel in the primary by a margin of 11 points. Gruening would then lose the election to banker Frank Murkowski by 7 points.

== Early legislative achievements ==

Stevens&#x27;s fiery attitude greatly assisted him in pushing the highly controversial nomination of Alaska Governor Wally Hickel to the office of Interior Secretary through the workings of the Senate, as well as passing numerous major bills, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971, Title IX in 1972, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act in 1973, something which endeared the Senator to President Richard Nixon, and, an act which Stevens had picked as his key legislative achievement in 2006, the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, along with Washington Senator Warren Magnuson. Stevens&#x27;s ability to do so helped propel him in popularity, allowing him to easily win re-election in 1970 in an upset. Stevens would continue to win re-election easily until his defeat in 2008 by Anchorage Mayor, Mark Begich, the son of former U.S. Representative from Alaska Nick Begich Sr..

=== Pork barrel spending ===
Throughout his career, Stevens would bring in billions of dollars of pork barrel funding for Alaska, something which Stevens was unapologetic for, once stating &quot;I&#x27;m guilty of asking for pork, and I&#x27;m proud of the Senate for giving it to me.&quot; Stevens was nicknamed the &quot;King of Pork&quot; by CBS News &amp; NBC News. In 2007, Texas received approximately $98 per person in federal appropriations, with a similar share accorded New York, while Alaska came in a far first place, receiving $4,300 per person. In his final year in the Senate, Stevens secured $469 million for Alaskan projects. Citizens Against Government Waste stated that Stevens had secured over a billion dollars in federal funding for Alaska from 1991 to 2000.

===Elections===
After practicing private law for a year, Stevens ran for the U.S. Senate in 1962 and won the Republican nomination, defeating only trivial opposition. Stevens was considered a long-shot candidate against the popular former Governor and incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Ernest Gruening, and he lost in the general election by a 16-point margin, a margin which was much closer than expected, considering Bartlett&#x27;s 27-point win in the prior election, the stronghold of the Democratic Party in Alaska, and the long service of Gruening. In 1968, Stevens once again ran for the U.S. Senate, but lost in the Republican primary to Anchorage Mayor Elmer E. Rasmuson. Rasmuson lost the general election to Democrat Mike Gravel. In December 1968, after the death of Alaska&#x27;s other senator, Democrat Bob Bartlett, Governor Wally Hickel appointed Stevens to the seat. Since Gravel took office ten days after Stevens did, Stevens was Alaska&#x27;s senior senator for all but ten days of his forty-year tenure in the Senate. However, on the account of Stevens&#x27;s long career in public service, and age, Gravel took no issue with the situation.

In a special election in 1970, Stevens won the right to finish the remainder of Bartlett&#x27;s term. He won the seat in his own right in 1972, and was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996 and 2002 elections. His final term expired in January 2009. Since his first election to a full term in 1972, Stevens never received less than 66% of the vote before his 2008 defeat for re-election.

When asked if he would hypothetically accept the 2008 Republican vice presidential nomination if offered, Stevens replied &quot;No. I&#x27;ve got too many things that I still want to do as a senator. Plus, I don&#x27;t like the idea of a job where you sit around and wait for someone to die.&quot;

Stevens lost his Senate re-election bid in 2008. He won the Republican primary in August and was defeated by Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich in the general election. He was the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history to lose re-election, beating out Warren Magnuson, who had served over 36 years before his defeat to Slade Gorton in 1980.

Stevens, who would have been 90 years old on election day, had filed to run for a rematch against Begich in the 2014 election, but he was killed in a plane crash on August 9, 2010. Dan Sullivan would defeat Begich in the election by a margin of 3.1%.

===Committees and leadership positions===

Stevens served as the Assistant Republican Leader (Whip) from 1977 to 1985. Stevens served as Acting Minority Leader during Howard Baker&#x27;s 1980 run for president during the 1980 Republican primaries. In 1994, after the Republicans took control of the Senate, Stevens was appointed chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. Stevens became the Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore when Republicans regained control of the chamber as a result of the 2002 mid-term elections, during which the previous most senior Republican senator and former president pro tempore Strom Thurmond retired.

After Howard Baker retired in 1984, Stevens sought the position of Republican (and then-Majority) leader, running against Bob Dole, Dick Lugar, Jim McClure and Pete Domenici. As Republican whip, Stevens was theoretically the favorite to succeed Baker, but lost to Dole in a fourth ballot, by a vote of 28–25.
Stevens chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee from 1997 to 2005, except for the 18 months when Democrats controlled the chamber. The chairmanship gave Stevens considerable influence among fellow Senators, who relied on him for home-state project funds. Even before becoming chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Stevens secured large sums of federal money for the State of Alaska. Due to Republican Party rules that limited committee chairmanships to six years, Stevens gave up the Appropriations gavel at the start of the 109th Congress, in January 2005. He was succeeded by Thad Cochran of Mississippi.

Stevens chaired the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation during the 109th Congress, becoming the committee&#x27;s ranking member after the Democrats regained control of the Senate for the 110th Congress. He resigned his ranking-member position on the committee due to his indictment.

At various times, Stevens also served as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senate Ethics Committee, the Arms Control Observer Group, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress.

Due to Stevens&#x27;s long tenure and that of the state&#x27;s sole congressman, Don Young, Alaska was considered to have clout in national politics well beyond its small population (the state was long the smallest in population and is currently 48th, ahead of only Wyoming and Vermont).

Stevens was strongly considered for Secretary of Defense in the H.W. Bush Administration (1989–1993), a position which ultimately went to Dick Cheney.

===Political positions===
Stevens was long considered a Rockefeller Republican and described as a liberal or moderate Republican, managing Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s 1964 campaign in Alaska. By one measure of all members of Congress from 1937 to 2002, Stevens, with a score of 0.183, usually voted to the left of the average Republican (who scored an average of 0.271 in the Senate and 0.300 in the House), and to the left of notable liberal &amp; moderate Republicans such as Illinois Representative &amp; 1980 presidential candidate John B. Anderson, with a score of 0.185, Virginia Senator John Warner, with a score of 0.251, &amp; even Democrats such as Ohio Senator Frank Lausche, with a score of 0.200. In 1977, the American Conservative Union gave Ted Stevens a ranking of less than 50%, indicating that Stevens had voted more liberally than he had conservatively. In 1974, Stevens was given a 25% year-round rating, his lowest rating that year, putting him to the left of noted liberal Republicans Mark Hatfield, Bob Packwood, Charles Percy, liberal Democratic leader Frank Church, and even his Democratic colleague from Alaska, Mike Gravel. In 1974, Stevens&#x27;s lifetime rating was 43%. By the end of his career, Stevens had a 64.78% lifetime rating, over 15% short of the required rating to be considered sufficiently conservative by the organization.

====Internet and net neutrality====
On June 28, 2006, the Senate Commerce Committee was in the final day of three days of hearings, during which the Committee members considered more than two hundred amendments to an omnibus telecommunications bill. Stevens authored the bill, S. 2686, the Communications, Consumer&#x27;s Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006.

Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND) cosponsored and spoke on behalf of an amendment that would have inserted strong network neutrality mandates into the bill. In between speeches by Snowe and Dorgan, Stevens gave a vehement 11-minute speech using colorful language to explain his opposition to the amendment. Stevens referred to the Internet as &quot;not a big truck&quot;, but a &quot;series of tubes&quot; that could be clogged with information. Stevens also confused the terms &quot;Internet&quot; and &quot;e-mail&quot;. Soon after, Stevens&#x27;s interpretation of how the Internet works became a topic of amusement and ridicule by some in the blogosphere. The phrases &quot;the Internet is not a big truck&quot; and &quot;series of tubes&quot; became internet memes and were prominently featured on U.S. television shows including Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

CNET journalist Declan McCullagh called &quot;series of tubes&quot; an &quot;entirely reasonable&quot; metaphor for the Internet, noting that some computer operating systems use the term &#x27;pipes&#x27; to describe interprocess communication. McCullagh also suggested that ridicule of Stevens was almost entirely political, espousing his belief that if Stevens has spoken in a similar manner, yet in support of Net Neutrality, &quot;the online chortling would have been muted or nonexistent.&quot;

====Logging====
Stevens was a long-standing proponent of logging and championed a plan that would allow of roadless old growth forest to be clear-cut. Stevens said this would revive Alaska&#x27;s timber industry and bring jobs to unemployed loggers; however, the proposal would mean that thousands of miles of roads would be constructed at the expense of the United States Forest Service, judged to cost taxpayers $200,000 per job created.

====Abortion====
According to &quot;On the Issues&quot; and NARAL, Stevens had a mildly anti-abortion voting record, despite some notable pro-abortion votes.

However, as a former member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership, Stevens supported human embryonic stem cell research.

====Global warming====
Stevens was long an avowed skeptic of anthropogenic climate change, instead believing the threat was from natural causes. In 2004, Stevens said &quot;No place is experiencing a more startling change from rising global temperatures than Alaska. Among the consequences are sagging roads, crumbling villages, dead trees, catastrophic fires and possible disruption of marine life. These problems will cause Alaska hundreds of millions of dollars. Alaska is harder hit by global climate change than any place in the world.&quot; At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in 2005, Stevens warned Congress to approach climate change with caution, stating &quot;Dr. Syun-Ichi Akasofu sent me his most recent assessment earlier this month. I hope you all know that we helped finance three, maybe four icebreaker research vessels now for the third year in the Arctic Ocean to try and really keep track of what is happening there. He noted the amount of and CH4 now in the air is well above what the earth has experienced during the last 450,000 years and climate change is in progress in full steam in the Arctic. But he emphasized that there is &#x27;no definitive proof&#x27; that receding glaciers and shrinking sea ice &#x27;are caused entirely and specifically by the greenhouse effect.&#x27;&quot;, adding &quot;I have urged my colleagues in the Senate not to substitute casual judgments for sound science. That would only lead to confusion, which Dr. Akasofu has warned me may be more dangerous than global warming itself.&quot;

In early 2007, he acknowledged that humans were changing the climate, and began supporting legislation to combat climate change. &quot;Global climate change is a very serious problem for us, becoming more so every day&quot;, he said at a Senate hearing in February 2007, adding that he was &quot;concerned about the human impacts on our climate&quot;. He then spoke to the St. Petersburg Times, stating &quot;We&#x27;ve got global climate change, and it&#x27;s coming about partly naturally and part of it may be, I believe, caused by the accumulation of the activities of man.&quot; But in September 2007, he claimed, &quot;We&#x27;re at the end of a long term of warming.&quot;, adding &quot;700 to 900 years of increased temperature&quot;, and then &quot;If we&#x27;re close to the end of that, that means that we&#x27;ll starting getting cooler gradually, not very rapidly, but cooler once again and stability might come to this region for a period of another 900 years.&quot;

====Civil rights====
Stevens voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Stevens was one of the sponsors the Title IX amendment to the Education Amendments of 1972, and was influential in its passage, with the Washington Post nicknaming him &quot;The Father of Title IX&quot;. The American Civil Liberties Union rated Stevens 20% in 2002, indicating an anti civil rights voting record, and the NAACP rated Stevens 14% in 2006, indicating an anti-affirmative action stance. Stevens would, however, vote against an amendment to ban affirmative action in federally funded businesses in 1995.

===== LGBT+ rights =====
Stevens voted in favor of an amendment to classify abuse based on sexual orientation a hate crime in 2000, though he voted against a similar amendment in 2002. Stevens voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act. The Human Rights Campaign rated Stevens 0% in 2006, indicating an anti-gay rights stance.

====U.S. Supreme Court====
Stevens voted in favor of the nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

====Criticism of political positions and actions====
During his tenure as Senator, Stevens was subject to frequent criticism that included:
* Citizens Against Government Waste accused Stevens of pork barrel politics and kept a list of his pet projects.
* In 2005, Stevens strongly supported federal transportation funds to build the Gravina Island Bridge, which quickly became derided due to its price tag (approximately $398million) and as an unnecessary Bridge to Nowhere. Stevens threatened to quit the Senate if the funds were diverted.
* Additionally, he received criticism for introducing a bill in January 2007 that would heavily restrict access to social networking sites from public schools and libraries. Sites falling under the language of this bill could have included MySpace, Facebook, Digg, English Wikipedia, and Reddit.
* In 2007, Stevens added $3.5 million into a Senate omnibus bill to help finance an airport which serves a remote Alaskan island. The proposed airstrip would allow around a hundred permanent residents of Akutan access, but the biggest beneficiary would have been the Seattle-based Trident Seafoods, a corporation which reportedly operated &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest seafood processing plants&quot;, on a volcanic Aleutians island. In December 2006, a federal grand jury involved in the Alaska political corruption probe ordered Trident (as well as other seafood companies) to render private documents about ties to the senator&#x27;s youngest son, former Alaska Fisheries Marketing Board Chairman and, at the time, the incumbent President of the Alaska State Senate Ben Stevens. Trident&#x27;s chief executive, Charles Bundrant, was a longtime supporter of the elder Stevens, and Bundrant with his family donated $17,300 in a time period spanning since 1995 to Stevens&#x27;s political campaigns and another $10,800 to his leadership PAC, while also donating $55,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

==Controversies==
In December 2003, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Stevens had taken advantage of lax Senate rules to use his political influence to obtain a large amount of his personal wealth. According to the article, while Stevens was already a millionaire &quot;thanks to investments with businessmen who received government contracts or other benefits with his help&quot;, the lawmaker who was in charge of $800billion a year, writes &quot;preferences he wrote into law&quot;, from which he then benefits.

===Home remodeling and VECO===
On May 29, 2007, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; reported that the FBI and a federal grand jury were investigating an extensive remodeling project at Stevens&#x27;s home in Girdwood. Stevens&#x27;s Alaska home was raided by the FBI and IRS on July 30, 2007. The remodeling work doubled the size of the modest home. The remodel in 2000 was organized by Bill Allen, a founder of the VECO Corporation (an oil-field service company) and was alleged by prosecutors to have cost VECO and the various contractors $250,000 or more. However, the residential contractor who finished the renovation for VECO, Augie Paone, &quot;believes the [Stevens&#x27;s] remodeling could have costif all the work was done efficientlyaround $130,000 to $150,000, close to the figure Stevens cited last year.&quot; Stevens paid $160,000 for the renovations &quot;and assumed that covered everything&quot;.

In June, the &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; reported that a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., heard evidence in May about the expansion of Stevens&#x27;s Girdwood home and other matters connecting Stevens to VECO. In mid-June, FBI agents questioned several aides who worked for Stevens as part of the investigation. In July, &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine reported that Stevens had hired &quot;Washington&#x27;s most powerful and expensive lawyer&quot;, Brendan Sullivan Jr., in response to the investigation. In 2006, during wiretapped conversations with Bill Allen, shortly after the VECO offices were searched and Allen agreed to cooperate with the investigation, Stevens expressed worries over legal complications arising from the sweeping federal investigations into Alaskan politics. &quot;The worst that can happen to us is we run up a bunch of legal fees, and might lose and we might have to pay a fine, might have to serve a little time in jail. I hope to Christ it never gets to that, and I don&#x27;t think it will&quot;, Stevens said. Stevens continued, &quot;I think they might be listening to this conversation right now, for Christ Sake.&quot; On the witness stand, Allen testified that VECO staff who had worked on his own house had charged &quot;way too much&quot;, leaving him uncertainthat he would be embarrassed to bill Stevens for overpriced labor.

===Former aide===
The Justice Department also examined whether federal funds that Stevens steered to the Alaska SeaLife Center may have illegally benefited an aide. However, no charges were ever filed.

===Bob Penney===
In September 2007, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that Stevens had &quot;steered millions of federal dollars to a sportfishing industry group founded by Bob Penney, a longtime friend&quot;. In 1998, Stevens invested $15,000 in a Utah land deal managed by Penney; in 2004, Stevens sold his share of the property for $150,000.

==Trial, conviction, and reversal==
===Indictment===
On July 29, 2008, Stevens was indicted by a federal grand jury on seven counts of failing to properly report gifts, a felony, and found guilty at trial three months later (October 27, 2008). The charges related to renovations to his home and alleged gifts from VECO Corporation, claimed to be worth more than $250,000. The charges were associated with those exposed in what became known as &quot;Operation Polar Pen&quot;. The indictment followed a lengthy investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for possible corruption by Alaskan politicians and was based in part on Stevens&#x27;s extensive relationship with Bill Allen. Allen owned racehorses, including a partnership in the stud-horse &quot;So Long Birdie&quot;, which included Stevens and eight others, and which was managed by Bob Persons. The FBI not only had calls between Allen and Stevens (made after Allen became a cooperating witness), they had thousands of wiretapped conversations involving the phones of both Allen and VECO Vice President Rick Smith. They had also videotaped meetings between Allen and state legislators at VECO&#x27;s hotel suite in Juneau, the state capitol. Allen had testified that he bribed Ted&#x27;s son Ben, the former Alaska Senate president. A former VECO employee said he did campaign fundraising work for Stevens while on VECO&#x27;s payroll, a violation of federal law. Allen, then an oil service company executive, had earlier pleaded guilty (sentence suspended pending his cooperation in gathering evidence and giving testimony in other trials) to bribing several Alaskan state legislators. Stevens declared, &quot;I&#x27;m innocent&quot;, and pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal district court on July 31, 2008. Stevens asserted his right to a speedy trial so he could have the opportunity to clear his name promptly and requested that the trial be held before the 2008 election.

U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, on October 2, 2008, denied the mistrial petition of Stevens&#x27;s chief counsel, Brendan Sullivan, that made allegations of withholding evidence by prosecutors. Thus, the latter were admonished and would submit themselves for an internal probe by the United States Department of Justice. &quot;Brady v. Maryland&quot; requires prosecutors to give a defendant any material exculpatory evidence. Judge Sullivan had earlier admonished the prosecution for sending home to Alaska a witness who might have helped the defense.

The case was prosecuted by Principal Deputy Chief Brenda K. Morris, Trial Attorneys Nicholas A. Marsh and Edward P. Sullivan of the Criminal Division&#x27;s Public Integrity Section, headed by Chief William M. WelchII; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joseph W. Bottini and James A. Goeke from the District of Alaska.

===Guilty verdict and repercussions===
On October 27, 2008, Stevens was found guilty of all seven counts of making false statements. Stevens was only the fifth sitting senator to be convicted by a jury in U.S. history, and the first since Senator Harrison A. Williams (D-NJ) in 1981 (although Senator David Durenberger (R-MN) pleaded guilty to a felony more recently, in 1995). Stevens faced a maximum penalty of five years per charge. His sentencing hearing was originally arranged February 25, but his attorneys told Judge Sullivan they would file applications to dispute the verdict by early December. However, it was thought unlikely that Stevens would spend significant time in prison.

Within a few days of his conviction, Stevens faced bipartisan calls for his resignation. Both parties&#x27; presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, were quick to call for Stevens to stand down. Obama said Stevens needed to resign to help &quot;put an end to the corruption and influence-peddling in Washington&quot;. McCain said Stevens &quot;has broken his trust with the people&quot; and needed to step down, a call echoed by his running mate, Sarah Palin, governor of Stevens&#x27;s home state. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as fellow Republican Senators Norm Coleman, John Sununu and Gordon Smith also called for Stevens to resign. McConnell said there would be &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for a convicted felon serving in the Senate, strongly hinting that he would support Stevens&#x27;s expulsion from the Senate unless Stevens resigned first. Late on November 1, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confirmed that he would schedule a vote on Stevens&#x27;s expulsion, saying &quot;a convicted felon is not going to be able to serve in the United States Senate.&quot;

Nonetheless, during a debate with his opponent, Anchorage, Alaska Mayor Mark Begich, days after his conviction, Stevens continued to claim innocence. &quot;I have not been convicted. I have a case pending against me, and probably the worst case of prosecutorial misconduct by the prosecutors that is known.&quot; Stevens also cited plans to appeal. On November 4, 2008, eight days after his conviction, Begich went on to defeat Stevens by 3,724 votes, a 1.3% margin. Stevens was the longest-serving U.S. Senator in history to have ever lost a bid for re-election, beating out Warren Magnuson&#x27;s record in 1980. Had Stevens won his re-election bid, and then been expelled, a special election would have been held to fill his seat through the remainder of the term, until January 2015. No sitting U.S. senator has ever been expelled since the Civil War.

On November 13, Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina announced he would move to have Stevens expelled from the Senate Republican Conference (caucus) regardless of the results of the election. (Absentee, provisional, and early ballots were, at the time, still being tallied in the close election.) Losing his caucus membership would cost Stevens his committee assignments. However, DeMint later decided to postpone offering his motion, saying that while there were enough votes to throw Stevens out, it would be moot if Stevens lost his reelection bid. Stevens ended up losing the Senate race, and on November 20, 2008, gave his last speech to the Senate, which was met with a loud standing ovation by the other members of the chamber.

===Government concealment of evidence===
In February 2009, FBI agent Chad Joy filed a whistleblower affidavit, alleging that prosecutors and FBI agents conspired to withhold and conceal evidence that could have resulted in acquittal. In his affidavit, Joy alleged that prosecutors intentionally sent a key witness, former VECO employee Robert Burnette &quot;Rocky&quot; Williams, who had testified before a grand jury in 2006, back home to Alaska. Williams had performed poorly during a mock cross-examination. The prosecution informed Judge Sullivan that it had concerns regarding the health of the witness. Williams was terminally ill, experiencing liver failure, which causes confusion. He died on December 30, 2008. Joy further alleged that the prosecutors intentionally withheld &quot;Brady&quot; material including redacted prior statements of a witness, and a memo from Bill Allen stating that Senator Stevens probably would have paid for the goods and services if asked. Joy further inferred that a female FBI agent had an inappropriate relationship with Allen, who also gave gifts to FBI agents and helped one agent&#x27;s relative get a job.

As a result of Joy&#x27;s affidavit and claims by the defense that prosecutorial misconduct had caused an unfair trial, Judge Sullivan ordered a hearing to be held on February 13, 2009, to determine whether a new trial should be ordered. At the February 13 hearing, Judge Sullivan held the prosecutors in contempt for having failed to deliver documents to Stevens&#x27;s legal counsel.

===Convictions voided and indictment dismissed===
On April 1, 2009, on behalf of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Paul O&#x27;Brien submitted a &quot;Motion of The United States To Set Aside The Verdict And Dismiss The Indictment With Prejudice&quot; in connection with case No. 08-231. Federal judge Emmet G. Sullivan soon signed the order. During the trial, Sullivan had expressed anger after Allen, the prosecution&#x27;s witness, recounted a note Stevens sent him insisting that a bill for work Veco had done be sent to Stevens. Allen said that Persons subsequently told him that Stevens was just &quot;covering his ass&quot;. Holder, who had taken office only three months earlier, stated that it was &quot;in the interest of justice&quot; not to hold a new trial, adding that he was &quot;horrified&quot;. After Sullivan held the prosecutors in contempt, Holder replaced the entire trial team, including top officials in the public integrity section. The discovery of a previously undocumented interview with Allen raised the possibility prosecutors had knowingly allowed Allen to perjure himself. Allen said the fair market value of the repairs to the Stevenses&#x27; house was around $80,000, considerably less than the $250,000 he said it cost at trial. More seriously, Allen said in the interview that he didn&#x27;t recall talking to Persons, a friend of Stevens, regarding the repair bill for the Stevenses&#x27; house. Even without the notes, Stevens&#x27;s attorneys claimed Allen was lying about the conversation.

Later that day, Stevens&#x27;s attorney, Brendan Sullivan, said Holder&#x27;s decision was forced by &quot;extraordinary evidence of government corruption&quot;. He also claimed that prosecutors not only withheld evidence but &quot;created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom&quot;.

On April 7, 2009, Judge Sullivan formally accepted Holder&#x27;s motion to set aside the verdict and throw out the indictment, declaring, &quot;There was never a judgment of conviction in this case. The jury&#x27;s verdict is being set aside and has no legal effect&quot;, and calling it the worst case of prosecutorial misconduct he&#x27;d ever seen. He also initiated a criminal contempt investigation of six members of the prosecution. Although an internal investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility was already underway, Sullivan said he was not willing to trust it due to the &quot;shocking and disturbing&quot; nature of the misconduct.

In 2012, the Special Counsel report on the case was released. It said,
Upon the release of the Special Counsel report, the Stevens defense team released an analysis of its own, which said, &quot;The meticulous detail paints a picture of the government&#x27;s shocking conduct in which prosecutors repeatedly ignored the law. The Report shows how prosecutors abandoned their oath of office and the ethical standards of their profession. They abandoned all decency and sound judgment when they indicted and prosecuted an 84-year old man who served his country in World WarII combat, and who served with distinction for 40 years in the U.S. Senate.&quot;

A statement issued by Stevens&#x27;s widow Catherine said, &quot;I can say that the Stevens family continues to be shocked by the depth and breadth of the government&#x27;s misconduct.&quot;

Mark Bonner, associate professor of law at Ave Maria School of Law, has argued that the court acted improperly by appointing a special prosecutor, claiming that, among other things, the &quot;trial court had no lawful authority to hold the prosecutors in contempt for Brady violations...&quot;

==Achievements and honors==
Stevens was voted Alaskan of the Century in 2000 by the Alaskan of the Year Committee. In the same year, the Alaska Legislature renamed the Anchorage airport, the largest in the state, to the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.

The Ted Stevens Foundation is a charity established to &quot;assist in educating and informing the public about the career of Senator Ted Stevens&quot;. The chairman is Tim McKeever, a lobbyist who was treasurer of Stevens&#x27;s 2004 campaign. In May 2006, McKeever said the charity was &quot;nonpartisan and nonpolitical&quot;, and that Stevens does not raise money for the foundation, although he has attended some fund-raisers.

November 18, 2003, the senator&#x27;s 80th birthday, was declared Senator Ted Stevens Appreciation Day by Governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski.

When discussing issues that were especially important to him (such as opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling), Stevens wore a necktie with The Incredible Hulk on it to show his seriousness. Marvel Comics has sent him free Hulk paraphernalia and has thrown a Hulk party for him. On December 21, 2005, Stevens said the vote to block drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge &quot;has been the saddest day of my life&quot;.

On December 30, 2006, Stevens delivered a eulogy of Gerald R. Ford at the 38th President&#x27;s funeral service. On April 13, 2007, Stevens was recognized as the longest-serving (38 years) Republican senator in history. (He served in total forty years and ten days.) Senator Daniel Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii, referred to Stevens as &quot;The Strom Thurmond of the Arctic Circle&quot;. Stevens held this record until he was overtaken by Orrin Hatch on January 14, 2017.

==Death and legacy==
On August 9, 2010, Stevens and seven other passengers including former NASA administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe were aboard a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter plane when it crashed about 17 miles north of Dillingham, Alaska, while en route to a private fishing lodge. Stevens was confirmed dead in the crash via a statement from his family. He and others were aboard the single-engine plane registered to Anchorage-based GCI Communication.

===Tributes and memorials===
As Stevens&#x27;s death was confirmed, Alaskan and national political figures from all sides of the political spectrum spoke highly of the man many Alaskans knew as &quot;Uncle Ted&quot;. Senator Lisa Murkowski said of Stevens: &quot;His entire life was dedicated to public servicefrom his days as a pilot in World WarII to his four decades of service in the United States Senate. He truly was the greatest of the &#x27;Greatest Generation. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated &quot;In the history of our country, no one man has done more for one state than Ted Stevens. His commitment to the people of Alaska and his nation spanned decades, and he left a lasting mark on both.&quot; Senator Mary Landrieu also spoke &quot;Ted always said, &#x27;To hell with politics. Do what is best for Alaska.&#x27; He never apologized for fighting for his state, and Alaska is better for it today.&quot;

The Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor honored Stevens with a plaque and a display of memorabilia of his wartime service in China-Burma-India. Senator Mark Begich, his successor, stated, &quot;Over his four decades of public service in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stevens was a forceful advocate for Alaska who helped transform our state in the challenging years after Statehood&quot; and former president George H. W. Bush released a statement that &quot;Ted Stevens loved the Senate; he loved Alaska; and he loved his familyand he will be dearly missed.&quot; President Barack Obama said in a statement, &quot;Ted Stevens devoted his career to serving the people of Alaska and fighting for our men and women in uniform.&quot;

Hundreds of Alaskans attended a memorial Mass for Stevens at Holy Family Cathedral in downtown Anchorage on August 16. On August 17, mourners paid their respects as he laid in a closed casket at All Saints Episcopal Church, also in downtown Anchorage, which was Stevens&#x27;s home church. His funeral at Anchorage Baptist Temple on August 18 was attended by some three thousand people, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, former Governor Sarah Palin, then-Governor Sean Parnell and three other former governors, eleven senators, nine former senators, and two congressmen. Stevens was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on September 28.

===USS &quot;Ted Stevens&quot;===
In January 2019, the US Navy announced that a FlightIII would be named . It will be constructed at Huntington Ingalls Industries&#x27; Ingalls shipbuilding division in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

<text>Lourdes (, , ; ) is a market town situated in the Pyrenees. It is part of the Hautes-Pyrénées department in the Occitanie region in southwestern France. Prior to the mid-19th century, the town was best known for its Château fort, a fortified castle that rises up from a rocky escarpment at its center.

In 1858, Lourdes rose to prominence in France and abroad due to the Marian apparitions to the peasant girl Bernadette Soubirous (later canonized a saint by the Catholic Church for her virtuous life). Shortly thereafter, the city and its Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes became among the world&#x27;s most important sites for pilgrimage and religious tourism.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The current municipal area of Lourdes was inhabited in prehistoric times. In Roman times, from the first century BC, it was an oppidum hill on the site of the present-day fortress, as shown by the numerous archaeological finds after the demolition of the parish of Saint Pierre in the early twentieth century: remains of walls, fragments of a citadel, a pagan temple dedicated to the gods of water, and three votive altars. In the fifth century, the temple was replaced by an early Christian church, which later burned down, with a necropolis nearby. A Roman road along with a possible crossing path connecting the Pyrenean piedmont with Narbonne suggest that the town could be the &quot;quell&#x27;oppidum novum&quot; fortress mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary.

From 732 to 778, Lourdes was occupied by Muslims of Al-Andalus. Mirat, the Muslim local leader, came under siege by Charlemagne, King of the Franks, but the Moor refused to surrender. According to legend, a passing eagle dropped a huge trout at Mirat&#x27;s feet. Dismayed by this omen, Mirat was urged to surrender to the Queen of Heaven by the local bishop. He visited the Black Virgin of Puy, and was so astounded by the icon&#x27;s exceptional beauty that he decided to surrender the fort and convert to Christianity. He was baptised with the name &quot;Lorus&quot;, which was given to the town as Lourdes.

===Middle Ages===

Little is known of Lourdes in the period from the barbarian invasions to the Carolingian period when the town was part of the County of Bigorre. The fortress was at times the seat of counts and, during the Albigensian Crusade, it was the subject of disputes between various local lords. Ultimately it came under the domination of the Counts of Champagne. In the fourteenth century Lourdes was first occupied by Philip the Fair, then, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, by the English, who controlled it for nearly half a century, from 1360 to 1407, through local feudal lords such as Pierre Arnaud de Béarn and, later, his brother Jean de Béarn. The English were able to take advantage of the excellent strategic situation and the prosperity of an eleventh century market that had been increasingly consolidated thanks to its proximity and good communications with Toulouse and Spain, managing to secure important gains for those who held the town. In the town, which developed in the valley, east of the fort, there were 243 fires at the beginning of the fifteenth century, compared to 150 of the thirteenth century.

After being the residency of the Bigorre counts, Lourdes was given to England by the Treaty of Brétigny which bought a temporary peace to France during the course of the Hundred Years War, with the French losing the town to the English in 1360. In 1405, Charles VI laid siege to the castle during the course of the war and eventually captured the town from the English after an 18-month siege.

===Modern Age===

During the late 16th century, France was ravaged by the Wars of Religion between Roman Catholics and Huguenots. In 1569, Count Gabriel de Montgomery attacked the nearby town of Tarbes when Queen Jeanne d&#x27;Albret of Navarre established Protestantism there. In 1592, the town was taken by forces of the Catholic League, and the Catholic faith was re-established. In 1607, Lourdes was incorporated into the Kingdom of France.

The castle became a jail under Louis XV but, in 1789, the Estates General ordered the liberation of prisoners. Following the rise of Napoleon in 1803, he again made the Castle a state jail. Towards the end of the Peninsular War between France, Spain, Portugal, and Britain in 1814, British and Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington entered France and took control of the region. They pursued Marshall Soult&#x27;s army, defeating the French near the adjoining town of Tarbes, before the final battle outside Toulouse on 10 April 1814 brought the war to an end.

Up until 1858, Lourdes was a sleepy country town with a population of around 4,000 hosting an infantry garrison in the castle, a transit point to the waters at Barèges, Cauterets, Luz-Saint-Sauveur and Bagnères-de-Bigorre, and for mountaineers on their way to Gavarnie.

Then on 11 February 1858, the 14-year-old local girl Bernadette Soubirous claimed a beautiful lady appeared to her in the remote grotto of Massabielle. The lady later identified herself as the Immaculate Conception and the faithful believed her to be the Blessed Virgin Mary. She appeared 18 times, and by 1859 thousands of pilgrims were visiting Lourdes. A statue of Our Lady of Lourdes was erected at the site in 1864.

During World War II, pilgrimage to Lourdes declined dramatically, but Lourdes became a focus for religious resistance. Refugees from Lorraine visited in 1941, led by their own exiled bishop Joseph Jean Heintz. Lourdes was the destination for a tour of the statue of Our Lady of Boulogne (known as Le Grand Retour) which aimed to secure the spiritual salvation of France. In 1944, a peace pilgrimage to Lourdes took place. Even when war ended, pilgrimages took a while to return to their pre-war levels as the usual trains and pilgrimage ships were in use elsewhere, or destroyed.

Since the apparitions, Lourdes has become one of the world&#x27;s leading Catholic Marian shrines. Pope John Paul II visited twice, on 15 August 1983, and 14–15 August 2004. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI authorized special indulgences to mark the 150th anniversary of Our Lady of Lourdes.
==Geography==

Lourdes is located in southern France in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains near the prime meridian. It is overlooked from the south by the Pyrenean peaks of Aneto, Montaigu, and Vignemale (), while around the town there are three summits reaching up to which are known as the &quot;Béout&quot;, the &quot;Petit Jer&quot; (with its three crosses) and the &quot;Grand Jer&quot; (with its single cross). The Grand Jer is accessible via the funicular railway of the Pic du Jer. The Béout was once accessible by cable car, although this has fallen into disrepair. A pavilion is still visible on the summit.

Lourdes lies at an elevation of and in a central position through which runs the fast-flowing river Gave de Pau from the south, coming from its source at Gavarnie; into it flow several smaller rivers from Barèges and Cauterets. The Gave then branches off to the west towards the Béarn, running past the banks of the Grotto and on downstream to Pau and then Biarritz.

On land bordered by a loop of the Gave de Pau is an outcrop of rock called &quot;Massabielle&quot; (from &quot;masse vieille&quot;: &quot;old mass&quot;). On the northern aspect of this rock, near the riverbank, is a naturally occurring, irregularly shaped shallow cave or grotto, in which the apparitions of 1858 took place.

===Climate===
The climate of Lourdes, due to the proximity of the city to the Atlantic, is oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). It is quite mild for most of the year with moderate rainfall in summer and quite high rainfall in winter – about 120 rainy days and more than of average annual precipitation. The summers are warm, the autumn and spring mild, while winter is cool. Because of the proximity of the city to the Pyrenees, Lourdes, like other areas of the Pyrenean Piedmont, however, can be affected in winter by sporadic waves of frost: in January 1985 the thermometer marked -17° Fahrenheit, -27 °C (historical record from 1934 to the present). A summer temperature of 102 °F, 39 °C, was recorded in August 2003. The reference station of Lourdes is to Tarbes-Ossun-Lourdes, located approximately from the town, in the airport area of Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées, 360 m.


== Apparitions and pilgrimages ==


In 1858, the Virgin Mary allegedly appeared to Bernadette Soubirous (Maria Bernada Sobirós in her native Occitan language) on a total of eighteen occasions at Lourdes (Lorda in her local Occitan language). Lourdes has become a major place of Roman Catholic pilgrimage and of miraculous healings. The 150th Jubilee of the first apparition took place on 11 February 2008 with an outdoor Mass attended by approximately 45,000 pilgrims.

In 2020, Lourdes had a population of around 15,000. In 2012, 715,000 pilgrims attended Our Lady of Lourdes-related events, falling to 570,000 in 2016. In 2011, Lourdes contained about 270 hotels, the second-greatest number of hotels per square kilometer in France after Paris. Its deluxe hotels include Grand Hotel Moderne, Hotel Grand de la Grotte, Hotel St. Étienne, Hotel Majestic, and Hotel Roissy.

===Marian apparitions===
On the evening of February 11, 1858, a young Roman Catholic girl, Bernadette Soubirous, reported that she went to fetch some firewood with her sister and another companion when a lady who was indescribably beautiful appeared to her at the Massabielle grotto. Although the lady did not tell Bernadette her name when asked at first, she told her to return to the grotto. On subsequent visits, the lady revealed herself to be the &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;. This was a reference to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception which had been defined only four years earlier in 1854 by Pope Pius IX, stating that the Virgin Mary herself had been conceived free from the consequences of original sin. Bernadette, having only a rudimentary knowledge of the Catholic faith, did not understand what this meant, but she reported it to her parish priest, Father Peyremale. Peyremale, though initially very skeptical of Bernadette&#x27;s claims, became convinced by hearing this because he knew that the young girl had no knowledge of the doctrine.

The lady also told Bernadette to dig in the ground at a certain spot and to drink from the small spring of water that began to bubble up. Almost immediately, cures were reported from the water. Today thousands of gallons of water gush from the source of the spring, and pilgrims are able to bathe in it. Countless purported miracle cures have been documented there, from the healing of nervous disorders and cancers to cases of paralysis and even of blindness. During the apparitions, Bernadette Soubirous prayed the Rosary. Pope John Paul II wrote: &quot;The Rosary of the Virgin Mary [is] a prayer of great significance, destined to bring forth a harvest of holiness&quot;.

===Messages===
The words spoken by Our Lady to Saint Bernadette include:

Feb 18, 1858 (Ash Wednesday)
:It is not necessary [to write down my name]. Would you be kind enough to come here for 15 days? I do not promise to make you happy in this world, but in the next.

Feb 21, 1858
:(Sorrowful tone of voice) Pray for sinners.

Feb 24, 1858
:Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners.

Feb 25, 1858
:Go, drink of the spring and wash yourself there. You will eat the grass that is there.

Feb 27, 1858
:Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners. Go, kiss the ground for the conversion of sinners. Go and tell the priests to have a chapel built here.

Feb 28, 1858
:Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners. Go, kiss the ground for the conversion of sinners.

March 2, 1858
:Go, tell the priests to bring people here in procession and have a Chapel built here.

March 25, 1858
:I am the Immaculate Conception.

==Religious sites==
===Sanctuary of Lourdes===
Yearly from March to October the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes is a place of mass pilgrimage from Europe and other parts of the world. The spring water from the grotto is believed by some Catholics to possess healing properties.

An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860, and the Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 69 healings considered miraculous.
Cures are examined using Church criteria for authenticity and authentic miracle healing with no physical or psychological basis other than the healing power of the water.

Tours from all over the world are organized to visit the Sanctuary. Connected with this pilgrimage is often the consumption of or bathing in the Lourdes water which wells out of the Grotto.

At the time of the apparitions, the grotto was on common land which was used by the villagers variously for pasturing animals and collecting firewood, and it possessed a reputation for being an unpleasant place.

===Ukrainian Church===
The five-domed St. Mary&#x27;s Ukrainian Catholic Church in Lourdes was designed by Myroslav Nimciv, while its Byzantine interior polychrome decorations were executed by artist Jerzy Nowosielski and the iconostasis by Petro Kholodny. The church was consecrated in 1982. It is about a 10-minute walk from the basilica and the grotto, on a street named in honour of Ukraine, 8 Rue de l&#x27;Ukraine, situated on a narrow piece of property close to the railroad station. Visible from the basilica, the height of the building makes up for its narrow breadth.

==Population==
==International relations==
Lourdes is twinned with:
* Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Vailankanni, Tamil Nadu, India
* Częstochowa in Poland
* Fátima in Portugal
* Loreto in Italy
* Altötting in Germany
* Cheyenne in Wyoming, United States
* Mariazell in Austria

==Sport==
Although most famous for its shrines, the town is also notable for its Rugby union team, FC Lourdes, which was one of the most successful teams in France during the mid-twentieth century, winning the national championship eight times from 1948 to 1968. Their most famous player was Jean Prat, who represented his country 51 times.

There is also an amateur association football team in the town.

Since 2015, the local mountain biking course has been home to a UCI Downhill World Cup round each season.

== In arts and fiction ==

* Émile Zola (1840–1902) wrote the 1884 novel &quot;Lourdes&quot; that deals with faith and healing, particularly of Marie de Guersaint.
* The 1943 film &quot;Song of Bernadette&quot;, based on the 1941 novel by Franz Werfel which tells of the occurrences at Lourdes, won four Academy Awards in 1944. Producer William Perlberg carefully re-created the appearance of the town and outlying rural areas using a golf course.
* In 1960, Andy Williams released his album &quot;The Village of St. Bernadette&quot;, which featured the 1959 song &quot;The Village of St. Bernadette&quot;.
* The film &quot;Behold a Pale Horse&quot; (1963), directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, and Omar Sharif, includes a scene in Lourdes that is crucial to the plot. The scene was shot on location and includes actual pilgrims visiting the basilica.
* The 1984 book &quot;The Miracle&quot; by Irving Wallace is speculative fiction based on the story of Saint Bernadette.
* The 2007 film &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; features a flashback in which Jean-Dominique Bauby travels to Lourdes with a girlfriend and walks through the streets of the town.
*The 2019 César Award-nominated documentary film &quot;Lourdes&quot; directed by Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai provides an intimate portrait of different individuals and families in their struggles and journey to the Lourdes site. 
* The 2023 film &quot;The Miracle Club&quot; is about a pilgrimage from Dublin to Lourdes.

==Transport==

Lourdes is served by Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées Airport situated from the town centre. (Many visitors also fly to Pau Pyrénées Airport.) The town&#x27;s railway station Gare de Lourdes is served by SNCF and TGV trains, including a high-speed TGV service from Paris which takes four-and-a-half hours. Many pilgrims also arrive via bus service from France and Spain.

==Education==
Lourdes has two main schools, one public and one private. The private school, the &quot;Lycée Peyramale St Joseph&quot;, was founded by two monks just two years before the apparitions; it is named after the priest Dominique Peyramale, who was present during the apparitions. It celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007. The newer public school is called the &quot;Lycée de Sarsan&quot;.

<doc id="181102" wikidata="Q2998001" url="?curid=181102" title="Corryong">
<text>Corryong is a town in Victoria, Australia east of Albury-Wodonga, near the upper reaches of the Murray River and close to the New South Wales border. At the , Corryong had a population of 1,348.

The post office opened on 1 February 1874. The town also has its own airport.

Corryong hosts &quot;The Man from Snowy River Bush Festival&quot;, held annually in April.

==Education==
Corryong is supported by a variety of service clubs, a hospital and schools. It has a Catholic primary and Corryong College P-12 school. The college has approximately 300(2019) students. Corryong is also home to the Australian Institute of Flexible Learning (AIFL) which offers 100% online education to all of Australia.

==Geography==

Its location makes it the Victorian gateway to the New South Wales snowfields, including the Thredbo ski village, and the Snowy Mountains Scheme. It is a way station for many travellers, particularly those on motorcycles, travelling across Australia&#x27;s highest mountains. Other tourists come to fish in the river and other nearby waterways, or to partake in horseriding around the mountain areas surrounding the town.

It is also of note as the home of Jack Riley, a hermit stockman employed by John Pierce of Greg Greg Station for 23 years to run cattle at Tom Groggin upriver from . The local government uses this claim extensively in its tourist promotions, and holds The Man from Snowy River Bush Festival annually 

Corryong is close to the Burrowa-Pine Mountain National Park and the massive Alpine National Park. The Kosciuszko National Park is located nearby across the state border. Both of these areas were extensively burnt in the bushfires which raged through the region in January 2003 and in the summer of 2019/20.
==Industry==
Industries in the area involve mainly agriculture and forestry, particularly beef and dairy farming. The forestry industries include both the harvesting of native eucalypts and of the extensive pine plantations in the area, which extend along a general high-rainfall zone from Tumbarumba in the northeast to Shelley in the southwest.

==Climate==
Corryong has a borderline oceanic / humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot; / &quot;Cfa&quot;) with warm to hot, dry summers that are chilly by morning and cool, wet winters with persistent cloud cover. The seasonal range of maximum temperatures between January and July, is especially marked. Sleet occurs in winter and snow may also occur.

The airport site is somewhat lower and flatter than the now decommissioned town site, attaining greater extremes in temperature. Since 2006 there is a general increase in rainfall with a newfound tendency to fall in the summer months (though still retaining a winter peak). 


==Sport==
Golfers play at the Corryong Golf Club on Donaldson Street, a nine-hole course.

The town is the centre of the Upper Murray Football League, an Australian Rules Football competition which began in 1893. Corryong is home to two of the three foundation clubs: Corryong FC, which has been based in the town from 1893 and Federal FC, formerly the Mount Elliot Miners and renamed in 1901 to celebrate the Federation of Australia and moved to be fully based at Corryong around the same time.

===Historical grandstand===
The Corryong Recreation Reserve was the home of the Grandstand, known as &quot;The Grand Old Lady&quot; to some locals in the Upper Murray community.

In late 1902 the idea was raised for the possible building of a grandstand at the Corryong Recreation Reserve which would be shared between the Corryong Race Club &amp; the A&amp;P Society (today known as the Corryong &amp; Upper Murray A&amp;P Society Inc.). Fundraising started almost immediately through a range of means including &quot;Bazaars&quot;, and by 1905 arrangements were in place to erect the grandstand. On 14 February 1906 an ad was placed calling for tenders, and on 22 June 1906 the contract was let for A£393 with work to proceed shortly.

Many years passed since the Grandstand was opened before the Corryong Racing Club left, leaving the A&amp;P Society with sole ownership of the grandstand. Additional the neighbouring Towong Turf Club&#x27;s &quot;Towong Grandstand&quot; was built by Tom Greenhill around the same time and done in a similar style to the &quot;Corryong Grandstand&quot;. It&#x27;s unclear when the Corryong Recreation Reserve was repurposed for football but sometime after both the Corryong Football Club &amp; the Federal Football Club moved here, with each building their own clubrooms.

However, by early 2014, after many years of neglect the grandstand was deemed unsafe to the public, and was fenced off to stop any public access. On 2 September 2014, it was announced that there were plans to demolish the historic 108-year-old Corryong Grandstand as part of plans to refurbish the Towong Grandstand at the Towong Turf Club. The Corryong Grandstand was not heritage listed on either the Australian National Heritage List or the Victorian Heritage Register. After public backlash from the Upper Murray community the Facebook page &quot;Corryong Grandstand - Stand By Me&quot; was established on 29 September 2014 and a petition started on Change.Org. After gathering submissions from members of the community, the group had a meeting with VCAT scheduled for 10 April 2015 in Melbourne, but was later rescheduled for 8 May 2015, in Wodonga. An announcement regarding its fate was scheduled to take place on 1 June 2015. In the 10 September 2015 edition of the &quot;Corryong Courier&quot; the grandstand made the front page with the headline reading &quot;Last Stand? Death knell sounds for grandstand.&quot;

==Notable residents==
* John M. Hull, a professor of religious education (born in Corryong on 22 April 1935)
* Lee Kernaghan, a country musician (born in Corryong on 15 April 1964) 
* Corrine Grant, an actress and comedian (born in Corryong on 12 June 1973)
* Horrie the Wog Dog, a terrier, unofficial mascot of the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion (died in Corryong 12 March 1945)
* Elyne Mitchell, champion skier, cattlewoman, and author of the &quot;Silver Brumby&quot; series of children&#x27;s books (who died in Corryong). The local library is named after her.

<text>Elizabeth Fry (née Gurney; 21 May 1780 – 12 October 1845), sometimes referred to as Betsy Fry, was an English prison reformer, social reformer, philanthropist and Quaker. Fry was a major driving force behind new legislation to improve the treatment of prisoners, especially female inmates, and as such has been called the &quot;Angel of Prisons&quot;. She was instrumental in the 1823 Gaols Act which mandated sex-segregation of prisons and female warders for female inmates to protect them from sexual exploitation. Fry kept extensive diaries, in which she wrote explicitly of the need to protect female prisoners from rape and sexual exploitation.

She was supported in her efforts by Queen Victoria and by Emperors Alexander I and Nicholas I of Russia; she was in correspondence with both Alexander and Nicholas, their wives, and the Empress Mother. In commemoration of her achievements she was depicted on the Bank of England £5 note that was in circulation from 2002 until May 2017.

==Background and early life==
Elizabeth Fry was born in Gurney Court, off Magdalen Street, Norwich, into a prominent Quaker family, the Gurneys. Her childhood family home was Earlham Hall, which is now part of the University of East Anglia. Her father, John Gurney, was a partner in Gurney&#x27;s Bank. Her mother, Catherine, was a member of the Barclay family, who were among the founders of Barclays Bank. Her mother died when Elizabeth was twelve years old. As one of the oldest girls in the family, Elizabeth was partly responsible for the care and education of the younger children, including her brother Joseph John Gurney, a philanthropist. One of her sisters was Louisa Gurney Hoare, a writer on education.

==Family life==
She met Joseph Fry, a banker and a cousin of the Bristol Fry family, who was also a Quaker, when she was 20 years old. They married on 19 August 1800 at the Norwich Goat Lane Friends Meeting House, and moved to St Mildred&#x27;s Court in the City of London. Elizabeth Fry was recorded as a minister of the Religious Society of Friends in 1811.

Joseph and Elizabeth Fry lived in Plashet House in East Ham between 1809 and 1829, then moved to The Cedars on Portway in West Ham, where they lived until 1844.

===Offspring===
They had eleven children, five sons and six daughters:
# Katharine (Kitty) Fry (1801–1886); she wrote &quot;A History of the Parishes of East and West Ham&quot; (published posthumously, 1888). She did not marry.
# Rachel Elizabeth Fry (1803–1888); married to Francis Cresswell.
# John Gurney Fry of Warley Lodge (1804–1872), married to Rachel Reynolds (whose mother was a Barclay).
# William Storrs Fry (1806–1844), married to Juliana Pelly.
# Richenda Fry (1808–1884), married to Foster Reynolds.
# Joseph Fry (1809–1896), married to Alice Partridge.
# Elizabeth (Betsy) Fry (1811–1816), died aged 5 years.
# Hannah Fry (1812–1895), married to William Champion Streatfeild.
# Louisa Fry (1814–1896), married to Raymond Pelly (brother of Juliana, William&#x27;s wife).
# Samuel Fry (1816–1902; known as &quot;Gurney&quot;); married to Sophia Pinkerton (aunt of poet and translator Percy Edward Pinkerton).
# Daniel Fry (1821–1892; known as &quot;Henry&quot; or &quot;Harry&quot;), married to Lucy Sheppard.

==Humanitarian work==

===Awakening concern===
According to her diary, Elizabeth Fry was moved by the preaching of Priscilla Hannah Gurney, Deborah Darby, and William Savery. She had more religious feelings than her immediate family. Prompted by a family friend, Stephen Grellet, Fry visited Newgate Prison in 1813. The conditions she saw there horrified her. Newgate prison was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. The prisoners did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept on straw. Newgate was also the last stop for many before being deported to Australia, in ships that Fry described—in 1814, 20 years before the abolition of slavery—as little better than slave ships. She returned the following day with food and clothes for some prisoners.

Fry was unable to personally further her work for nearly four years after that because of difficulties within the Fry family, including the financial ills of the Fry bank. During the 1812 financial panic in the City of London, William Fry had lent a large amount of the bank&#x27;s money to his wife&#x27;s family, undermining the bank&#x27;s solvency. Fry&#x27;s brother John Gurney, brother-in-law Samuel Hoare III, and cousin Hudson Gurney made a large investment in the W.S. Fry &amp; Sons bank to stabilise its situation.

===Prison reform and prisoner rehabilitation===
Fry returned to her project in 1816, and was eventually able to fund a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their mothers. Rather than attempt to impose discipline on the women, she suggested rules and then asked the prisoners to vote on them. In 1817, she helped found the Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate. This association provided materials for women so that they could learn to sew patchwork, which was calming for the women and also helped them develop skills such as needlework and knitting; this opened up a prospect, when in future they were released from prison, of them entering employment and earning money for themselves. This approach was copied elsewhere and led to the eventual creation of the British Ladies&#x27; Society for Promoting the Reformation of Female Prisoners in 1821. She also promoted the idea of rehabilitation instead of harsh punishment which was taken on by the city authorities in London as well as many other authorities and prisons.

&quot;A Committee of the House of Commons was appointed to examine into evidence respecting the prisons of the metropolis&quot; and Elizabeth Fry was called to give evidence on 27 February 1818. It is believed that she was the first woman ever to be called to give evidence to a Select Committee of the Houses of Parliament.

The passing of the Gaols Act in 1823 had a limited effect on prison conditions. It was largely ineffective, as it contained no mechanism to ensure its provisions were followed; some institutions, such as town gaols and debtors&#x27; prisons, were not regulated by the Act. The one change widely and successfully adopted was the separation of male from female inmates. Fry, whose ideas and representations had been influential in the drafting and passage of the Act, was well aware of the shortcomings in its implementation. She gave evidence to a Select Committee of the House of Lords in 1835, saying of prisons in England and Wales, that, despite the Gaols Act, &quot;in many instances their condition is melancholy...they may truly be called schools for crime&quot; and that some still had &quot;no instruction, no employment, no classification [of inmates]...and they get into a most low and deplorable state of morals...I would not say that all are in that condition, but I fear many are&quot;. Only with the passing of the Prisons Act 1835 were prison inspectors appointed, and all gaols and prisons brought under central control.

===Penal transportation===
The death penalty was common for even minor offences. Initially giving what comfort she could to those facing death, Fry worked to get death sentences commuted to deportation to Australia. By 1818 Hannah Bevan, Elizabeth Pryor, Elizabeth Hanbury, and Katherine Fry were visiting convict ships, providing the female convicts comforts for the voyage, and promoting measures for the fulfilling and useful occupation for the women and education for their children. (Later, Elizabeth Pryor was censured by the Ladies&#x27; Society, after she asked the government authorities for remuneration for her years of unpaid work.)

Fry campaigned for the rights and welfare of prisoners who were being transported. Women from Newgate Prison on their way to the ships were being taken through the streets of London in open carts, often in chains, huddled together with their few possessions. They were pelted with rotten food and filth by the people of the city. Fear of what was about to happen was often enough to cause riots among the women condemned to transportation, on the evening before they were to go. Fry persuaded the governor of the prison to send the women in closed carriages and spare them this last indignity before transportation, with Fry and the other women of the Ladies&#x27; Society accompanying those transports to the docks. She visited prison ships and persuaded captains to implement systems to ensure each woman and child would at least get a share of food and water on the long journey. Later she arranged for each woman to be given packages of material and sewing tools so that they could use the long journey to make quilts and have something to sell, as well as useful skills, when they reached their destination. She also included a bible, and useful items such as string and knives and forks, in this vital care package. Fry also lobbied for better conditions for the women who had already been transported to the colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, including aspects of the factories that they worked in.

Fry visited 106 transport ships and saw 12,000 convicts. Her work helped to start a movement for the abolition of transportation. Transportation was officially abolished in 1868; however, Elizabeth Fry was still visiting transportation ships until 1843.

===Widening prison reform===
Fry wrote in her book &quot;Prisons in Scotland and the North of England&quot; that she stayed the night in some of the prisons and invited nobility to come and stay and see for themselves the conditions prisoners lived in. Her kindness helped her gain the friendship of the prisoners and they began to try to improve their conditions for themselves. Thomas Fowell Buxton, Fry&#x27;s brother-in-law, was elected to Parliament for Weymouth and began to promote her work among his fellow MPs. In 1818 Fry gave evidence to a House of Commons committee on the conditions prevalent in British prisons, becoming the first woman to present evidence in that house of Parliament.

Fry saw her friend Stephen Grellet and another Quaker, William Allen, off at the docks on their own journey in the cause of prison reform in the autumn of 1818. Having met the Emperor Alexander I in London in 1814, they travelled to visit the prisons of his empire. They had the backing of a letter from the emperor commanding his subjects to cooperate with these English Quakers. They departed for home from Odessa in July 1819. Both men wrote of this mission in their journals, where they also give accounts of their work with Fry.

In 1827, Fry visited women&#x27;s prisons and other places of female confinement in Ireland. She encouraged the women of Belfast to organise their own committee to improve conditions in the women&#x27;s poorhouse.

After her husband went bankrupt in 1828, Fry&#x27;s brother became her business manager and benefactor. Thanks to him, her work went on and expanded. Later, in 1838, the Friends sent a party to France. Fry and her husband, as well as Lydia Irving, and abolitionists Josiah Forster and William Allen were among the people sent. They were there on other business but despite the language barrier, Fry and Lydia Irving visited French prisons.

===Welfare and homelessness===
Elizabeth Fry also helped the homeless, establishing a &quot;nightly shelter&quot; in London after seeing the body of a young boy in the winter of 1819–1820. In 1824, during a visit to Brighton, she instituted the Brighton District Visiting Society. The society arranged for volunteers to visit the homes of the poor and provide help and comfort to them. The plan was successful and was duplicated in other districts and towns across Britain.

In 1840 Fry opened a training school for nurses in Guy&#x27;s Hospital known as &#x27;The Institution of Nursing Sisters&#x27;. Her programme inspired Florence Nightingale, who took a team of Fry&#x27;s nurses to assist wounded soldiers in the Crimean War. Eliza Mackenzie, who travelled to Therapia to work as a Superintendent of nurses for the Admiralty during the Crimean War, also took three Fry nurses. Her programme of nurse training also inspired Theodor Fliedner who visited her in London and set up something similar in Kaiserswerth, near Düsseldorf.

===Slavery===
After the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire, slavery remained in European colonies. Thomas Fowell Buxton became a leader in its abolition. Elizabeth Fry in particular campaigned for abolition in Danish and Dutch colonies.

===Reputation===
One admirer was Queen Victoria, who granted her an audience several times before she was Queen and contributed money to her cause after she ascended to the throne. Another admirer was Robert Peel who passed several acts to further her cause including the Gaols Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 64).

In 1842, Frederick William IV of Prussia went to see Fry in Newgate Prison during an official visit to Great Britain. The King of Prussia, who had met the social reformer during her previous tours of the continent promoting welfare change and humanitarianism, was so impressed by her work that he told his reluctant courtiers that he would personally visit the gaol when he was in London.

==Death and legacy==
Fry died from a stroke in Ramsgate, England, on 12 October 1845. Her remains were buried in the Friends&#x27; burial ground at Barking. Seamen of the Ramsgate Coast Guard flew their flag at half mast in respect for Fry; a practice that until this occasion had been officially reserved for the death of a ruling monarch. More than a thousand people stood in silence during the burial at the Ramsgate memorial.

===Elizabeth Fry Refuge===
With the intention of organising a suitable memorial to Fry, a meeting was held in June 1846, chaired by the Lord Mayor of London. Some early proposals for a statue of Fry—to be placed perhaps in either Westminster Abbey or St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral—had already been floated. Instead, it was recommended to the meeting that a practical commemoration of her life would be more fitting. Lord Ashley, amongst a group of prominent reformers and admirers of Fry, including the Bishop of Norwich and the diplomat Christian von Bunsen, promoting adoption of a charitable scheme to honour Fry, told the meeting that founding an asylum would be in &quot;perfect harmony with her life, her character, her feelings&quot;. Such a project would stand for the nation&#x27;s gratitude to her and &quot;the sympathy they entertain for her righteous endeavours&quot;.

The proposal met with general support and the first Elizabeth Fry refuge opened its doors in 1849 in the London Borough of Hackney – initially in a temporary location and then, from 1860, in a fine late-17th-century town house nearby at 195 Mare Street, which the refuge purchased and occupied for the next half century. It was intended to provide temporary shelter for young women discharged from metropolitan gaols or police offices. Funding came via subscriptions from various city companies and private individuals, supplemented by income from the inmates&#x27; laundry and needlework. Such training was an important part of the refuge&#x27;s work.

In 1924, the refuge merged with the Manor House Refuge for the Destitute, in Dalston in Hackney. The hostel soon moved to larger premises in Highbury, Islington and then, in 1958, to Reading, where it remains today. The original building in Hackney became the CIU New Lansdowne Club but became vacant in 2000 and has fallen into disrepair. Hackney Council, in 2009, was leading efforts to restore the building and bring it back into use. The building did undergo substantial refurbishment work in 2012 but as of July 2013, the entire building is for sale. The building and Elizabeth Fry are commemorated by a plaque at the entrance gateway.

===Memorials===
There are a number of memorials which commemorate places where Fry lived. There are plaques located at her birthplace of Gurney Court in Norwich; her childhood home of Earlham Hall; St. Mildred&#x27;s Court, City of London, where she lived when she was first married; and Arklow House, her final home and place of death in Ramsgate. Her name heads the list on the southern face of the Reformers&#x27; Monument in Kensal Green Cemetery, London. She is depicted in stained glass at All Saints&#x27; Church, Cambridge alongside Edith Cavell and Josephine Butler.

Due to her work as a prison reformer, there are several memorials to Elizabeth Fry. One of the buildings which make up the Home Office headquarters, 2 Marsham Street, is named after her. She is also commemorated in prisons and courthouses, including a terracotta bust in the gatehouse of HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs and a stone statue in the Old Bailey. The Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies honours her memory by advocating for women who are in the criminal justice system. They also celebrate and promote a National Elizabeth Fry Week in Canada each May.

Fry is also commemorated in a number of educational and care-based settings. The University of East Anglia&#x27;s School of Social Work and Psychology is housed in a building named after her. There is an Elizabeth Fry Ward at Scarborough General Hospital in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. A road is named for Fry at Guilford College, a school in Greensboro, North Carolina, which was founded by Quakers. There is a bust of Elizabeth Fry located in East Ham Library, in the London Borough of Newham.

Quakers also acknowledge Elizabeth Fry as a prominent member. Her grave at the former Society of Friends Burial Ground, located off Whiting Avenue in Barking, Essex, was restored and received a new commemorative marble plinth in October 2003. In February 2007, a plaque was erected in her honour at the Friends Meeting House in Upper Goat Lane, Norwich. Fry is also depicted in the Quaker Tapestry, on panels E5 and E6. The Elizabeth Fry room at Friends House, London is named after her.

She is also honoured by other Christian denominations. In the Lady Chapel of Manchester&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, one of the portrait windows of Noble Women on the west wall of the Chapel features Elizabeth Fry. Fry is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 12 October.

Lydia Sigourney met Mrs. Fry at Newgate in 1840 and wrote the poem &quot;Mrs. Fry at Newgate Prison&quot; in her honour, this being published in her volume, &quot;Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands&quot;, in 1842. 

From 2001 to 2016, Fry was depicted on the reverse of £5 notes issued by the Bank of England. She was shown reading to prisoners at Newgate Prison. The design also incorporated a key, representing the key to the prison which was awarded to Fry in recognition of her work. However, as of 2016, Fry&#x27;s image on these notes was replaced by that of Winston Churchill. She was one of the social reformers honoured on an issue of UK commemorative stamps in 1976.

There is a road in Johannesburg, South Africa named Elizabeth Fry Street after Fry.

Fry&#x27;s extensive diaries have been transcribed and studied.

<text>Johann Reuchlin (; 29 January 1455 – 30 June 1522), sometimes called Johannes, was a German Catholic humanist and a scholar of Greek and Hebrew, whose work also took him to modern-day Austria, Switzerland, Italy, and France. Most of Reuchlin&#x27;s career centered on advancing German knowledge of Greek and Hebrew.

Johann Reuchlin was born at Pforzheim in the Black Forest in 1455, where his father was an official of the Dominican monastery. According to the fashion of the time, his name was graecized by his Italian friends into Capnion (Καπνίων), a nickname which Reuchlin used as a sort of transparent mask when he introduced himself as an interlocutor in the &quot;De Verbo Mirifico&quot;. He remained fond of his home town; he constantly calls himself Phorcensis, and in the &quot;De Verbo&quot; he ascribes to Pforzheim his inclination towards literature.

Here he began his Latin studies in the monastery school, and, though in 1470 he was for a short time at Freiburg, that university seems to have taught him little. Reuchlin&#x27;s career as a scholar appears to have turned almost on an accident; his fine voice gained him a place in the household of Charles I, Margrave of Baden, and soon, having some reputation as a Latinist, he was chosen to accompany Frederick, the third son of the prince, to the University of Paris. Frederick was some years his junior, and was destined for an ecclesiastical career. This new connection did not last long, but it determined the course of Reuchlin&#x27;s life. He now began to learn Greek, which had been taught in the French capital since 1470, and he also attached himself to the leader of the Paris realists, Jean à Lapide (d. 1496), a worthy and learned man, whom he followed to the vigorous young University of Basel in 1474.

==Teaching and writing career==
At Basel Reuchlin took his master&#x27;s degree (1477), and began to lecture with success, teaching a more classical Latin than was then common in German schools, and explaining Aristotle in Greek. His studies in this language had been continued at Basel under Andronicus Contoblacas. In Basel he made the acquaintance of the bookseller Johann Amerbach, for whom he prepared a Latin lexicon (&quot;Vocabularius Breviloquus&quot;, 1st edition, 1475–76), which ran through many editions. This first publication, and Reuchlin&#x27;s account of his teaching at Basel in a letter to Cardinal Adrian (Adriano Castellesi) in February 1518, show that he had already found his life&#x27;s work. He was a born teacher, and this work was not to be done mainly from the professor&#x27;s chair.

By 1477, Reuchlin had left Basel to seek further Greek training with George Hermonymus in Paris, and to learn to write a fair Greek hand that he might support himself by copying manuscripts. And now he felt that he must choose a profession. His choice fell on law, and he was thus led to the great school of Orléans (1478), and finally to Poitiers, where he became licentiate in July 1481.

From Poitiers, Reuchlin went in December 1481 to Tübingen with the intention of becoming a teacher in the local university, but his friends recommended him to Count Eberhard of Württemberg, who was about to travel to Italy and required an interpreter. Reuchlin was selected for this post, and in February 1482 left Stuttgart for Florence and Rome. The journey lasted but a few months, but it brought the German scholar into contact with several learned Italians, especially at the Medicean Academy in Florence; his connection with the count became permanent, and after his return to Stuttgart he received important posts at Eberhard&#x27;s court.

About this time, he appears to have married, but little is known of his married life. He left no children, but in later years, his sister&#x27;s grandson Philipp Melanchthon was like a son to him until the Reformation estranged them.

In 1490, he was again in Italy. Here he saw Pico della Mirandola, to whose Kabbalistic doctrines he afterward became heir, and made a friend of the pope&#x27;s secretary, Jakob Questenberg, which was of service to him in his later troubles. Again in 1492 he was employed on an embassy to the emperor Frederick at Linz, and here he began to read Hebrew with the emperor&#x27;s Jewish physician Jakob ben Jehiel Loans, whose instruction laid the basis of that thorough knowledge which Reuchlin afterward improved on his third visit to Rome in 1498 by the instruction of Obadja Sforno of Cesena. In 1494, his rising reputation was greatly enhanced by the publication of &quot;De Verbo Mirifico&quot;.

In 1496, Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg died, and enemies of Reuchlin had the ear of his successor, Duke Heinrich of Württemberg (formerly Heinrich Count of Württemberg-Mömpelgard). He was glad, therefore, hastily to follow the invitation of Johann von Dalberg (1445–1503), the scholarly bishop of Worms, and flee to Heidelberg, which was then the seat of the Rhenish Society In this court of letters Reuchlin&#x27;s appointed function was to make translations from the Greek authors, in which his reading was already extremely wide. Though Reuchlin had no public office as a teacher, he was for much of his life the real centre of all Greek and Hebrew teaching in Germany. To carry out this work he provided a series of aids for beginners and others. He never published a Greek grammar, but he had one in manuscript for use with his pupils, and also published several little elementary Greek books. Reuchlin, it may be noted, pronounced Greek as his native teachers had taught him to do, i.e., in the modern Greek fashion. This pronunciation, which he defends in &quot;De recta Latini Graecique sermonis pronuntiatione&quot; (1528), came to be known, in contrast to that used by Desiderius Erasmus, as the Reuchlinian.

At Heidelberg, Reuchlin had many private pupils, among whom Franz von Sickingen is the best-known name. With the monks he had never been liked; at Stuttgart, his great adversary was the Augustinian Conrad Holzinger. On this man he took a scholar&#x27;s revenge in his first Latin comedy &quot;Sergius&quot;, a satire on worthless monks and false relics. Through Dalberg, Reuchlin came into contact with Philip, Count Palatine of the Rhine, who employed him to direct the studies of his sons, and in 1498 gave him the mission to Rome, which has been already noticed as fruitful for Reuchlin&#x27;s progress in Hebrew. He came back laden with Hebrew books and found when he reached Heidelberg that a change of government had opened the way for his return to Stuttgart, where his wife had remained all along. His friends had now again the upper hand and knew Reuchlin&#x27;s value. In 1500, or perhaps in 1502, he was given a very high judicial office in the Swabian League, which he held until 1512, when he retired to a small estate near Stuttgart.

==Hebrew studies and advocacy==
For many years Reuchlin had been increasingly absorbed in Hebrew studies, which had for him more than a mere philological interest. He was interested in the reform of preaching as shown in his &quot;De Arte Predicandi&quot; (1503)—a book that became a sort of preacher&#x27;s manual; but above all, as a scholar, he was eager that the Bible should be better known, and could not tie himself to the authority of the Vulgate.

The key to the &quot;Hebraea veritas&quot; was the grammatical and exegetical tradition of the medieval rabbis, especially of David Kimhi, and when he mastered this, he was resolved to open it to others. In 1506, appeared his epoch-making &quot;De Rudimentis Hebraicis&quot;—grammar and lexicon—mainly after Kimhi, yet not a mere copy of one man&#x27;s teaching. The edition was costly and sold slowly. One great difficulty was that the wars of Maximilian I in Italy prevented Hebrew Bibles from coming into Germany. But for this also Reuchlin found help by printing the Penitential Psalms with grammatical explanations (1512), and other helps followed from time to time. But his Greek studies had interested him in those fantastical and mystical systems of later times with which the Kabbala has no small affinity. Following Pico, he seemed to find in the Kabbala a profound theosophy that might be of the greatest service for the defence of Christianity and the reconciliation of science with the mysteries of faith, a common notion at that time. Reuchlin&#x27;s mystico-cabalistic ideas and objects were expounded in the &quot;De Verbo Mirifico&quot;, and finally in the &quot;De Arte Cabalistica&quot; (1517).

Many of his contemporaries thought that the first step to the conversion of the Jews was to take away their books. This view was advocated by Johannes Pfefferkorn, a German Catholic theologian. Pfefferkorn, himself converted from Judaism, actively preached against the Jews and attempted to destroy copies of the &quot;Talmud&quot;, and engaged in what became a long-running pamphleteering battle with Reuchlin. He wrote that &quot;The causes which hinder the Jews from becoming Christians are three: first, usury; second, because they are not compelled to attend Christian churches to hear the sermons; and third because they honor the &quot;Talmud&quot;.&quot; Pfefferkorn&#x27;s plans were backed by the Dominicans of Cologne; and in 1509 he obtained the emperor&#x27;s authority to confiscate all Jewish books directed against the Christian faith. Armed with this mandate, he visited Stuttgart and asked Reuchlin&#x27;s help as a jurist and expert in putting it into execution. Reuchlin evaded the demand, mainly because the mandate lacked certain formalities, but he could no longer remain neutral. The execution of Pfefferkorn&#x27;s schemes led to difficulties and to a new appeal to Maximilian.

In 1510, Reuchlin was appointed by Emperor Maximilian to a commission that was convened to review the matter. His answer is dated from Stuttgart, 6 October 1510; in it, he divides the books into six classes — apart from the Bible which no one proposed to destroy — and, going through each class, he shows that the books openly insulting to Christianity are very few and viewed as worthless by most Jews themselves, while the others are either works necessary to the Jewish worship, which was licensed by papal as well as imperial law or contain matter of value and scholarly interest which ought not to be sacrificed because they are connected with another faith than that of the Christians. He proposed that the emperor should decree that for ten years there should be two Hebrew chairs at every German university, for which the Jews should furnish books.

Maximilian&#x27;s other experts proposed that all books should be taken from the Jews; and, as the emperor still hesitated, his opponents threw on Reuchlin the whole blame of their ill success. Pfefferkorn circulated at the Frankfurt Fair of 1511 a gross libel (&quot;Handspiegel wider und gegen die Juden&quot;) declaring that Reuchlin had been bribed. Reuchlin defended himself in a pamphlet titled &quot;Augenspiegel&quot; (1511), which the theologians at the University of Cologne attempted to suppress. On 7 October 1512, they, along with the inquisitor Jacob van Hoogstraaten, obtained an imperial order confiscating the &quot;Augenspiegel&quot;.

In 1513, Reuchlin was summoned before a court of the inquisition. He was willing to receive corrections in theology, which was not his subject, but he could not unsay what he had said; and as his enemies tried to press him into a corner, he met them with open defiance in a &quot;Defensio contra Calumniatores&quot; (1513). The universities were now appealed to for opinions and were all against Reuchlin. Even Paris (August 1514) condemned the &quot;Augenspiegel&quot;, and called on Reuchlin to recant. Meantime a formal process had begun at Mainz before the grand inquisitor. But Reuchlin managed to have the jurisdiction changed to the episcopal court of Speyer. The Reuchlin affair caused a wide rift in the church and eventually the case came before the papal court in Rome. Judgment was not finally given until July 1516; and then, though the decision was really for Reuchlin, the trial was simply quashed.

And while the obscurantists escaped easily at Rome, with only a half condemnation, they received a crushing blow in Germany. In Reuchlin&#x27;s defense, &quot;Virorum Epistolæ Clarorum ad Reuchlinum Phorcensem&quot; (Letters of famous men to Reuchlin of Pforzheim), had been published. It was closely followed by &quot;Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum&quot; (Letters of obscure men), a satirical collection purporting to defend his accusers, but actually directed against them. No party could survive the ridicule that was poured on Reuchlin&#x27;s opponents by this document.

Ulrich von Hutten and Franz von Sickingen did all they could to force Reuchlin&#x27;s enemies to restitution of his material damages; they even threatened a feud against the Dominicans of Cologne and Spires. In 1520, a commission met in Frankfurt to investigate the case. It condemned Hoogstraaten. But the final decision of Rome did not indemnify Reuchlin. The contest ended, however; public interest had grown cold, absorbed entirely by the Lutheran question, and Reuchlin had no reason to fear new attacks. When, in 1517, he received the theses propounded by Luther, he exclaimed, &quot;Thanks be to God, at last, they have found a man who will give them so much to do that they will be compelled to let my old age end in peace.&quot;

Heinrich Graetz and Francis Yates contended that this affair helped spark the Protestant Reformation. Although suspected of a leaning toward Protestantism, Reuchlin never left the Catholic Church. In 1518, he was appointed professor of Hebrew and Greek at Wittenberg, but instead sent his nephew Melanchthon.

===Influence on Luther===
Luther&#x27;s comment that justification by faith was the &quot;true Cabala&quot; in his &quot;Commentary on Galatians&quot; has been explained as relating to Reuchlin&#x27;s influence. While Luther had consulted Reuchlin as a Hebrew expert and used &quot;De Arte Cabalistica&quot; as support for an argument, Luther took objection to Reuchlin&#x27;s comment in &quot;De rudimentis hebraicis&quot; that the Hebrew letters for Jesus&#x27; name meant &quot;the hidden God,&quot; which Luther found contrary to Matthew, Chapter 1:21, which describes the meaning as being about &quot;he would save His people from their sins.&quot;

===End of life===

Reuchlin did not long enjoy his victory over his accusers in peace. In 1519, Stuttgart was visited by famine, civil war and pestilence. In response to concerns about growing religious controversies Leo X had Reuchlin&#x27;s &quot;Augenspiegel&quot; condemned on 23 June 1520, claiming it to be &quot;scandalous and offensive&quot; and upholding the University of Cologne&#x27;s previous condemnation. From November of 1519 to the spring of 1521, the veteran statesman sought refuge in the University of Ingolstadt where he received an appointment as professor from William of Bavaria. He taught Greek and Hebrew there for a year. It was 41 years since at Poitiers he had last spoken from a public chair; but at 65 he retained his gift of teaching, and hundreds of scholars crowded round him. This gleam of autumn sunshine was again broken by the plague; but now he was called to Tübingen and again spent the winter of 1521–22 teaching in his own systematic way. But in the spring he found it necessary to visit the baths of Liebenzell, and there contracted jaundice, of which he died, leaving in the history of the new learning a name only second to that of his younger contemporary Erasmus.

Reuchlin died in Stuttgart and is buried at St. Leonhard church.

<text>An epistle (; ) is a writing directed or sent to a person or group of people, usually an elegant and formal didactic letter. The epistle genre of letter-writing was common in ancient Egypt as part of the scribal-school writing curriculum. The letters in the New Testament from Apostles to Christians are usually referred to as epistles. Those traditionally attributed to Paul are known as Pauline epistles and the others as catholic (i.e., &quot;general&quot;) epistles.

==Ancient Egyptian epistles==
The ancient Egyptians wrote epistles, most often for pedagogical reasons. Egyptologist Edward Wente (1990) speculates that the Fifth-dynasty Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi—in his many letters sent to his viziers—was a pioneer in the epistolary genre. Its existence is firmly attested during the Sixth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, and is prominently featured in the educational guide &quot;The Book of Kemit&quot; written during the Eleventh Dynasty. A standardized formulae for epistolary compositions existed by the time of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The epistolary formulae used in the Ramesside Period found its roots in the letters composed during the Amarna Period of the Twentieth Dynasty. Wente describes the &quot;Satirical Letter&quot; found on the Papyrus Anastasi I of the Nineteenth Dynasty as an epistle which was commonly copied as a writing exercise by Egyptian schoolchildren on ceramic ostraca (over eighty examples of which have been found so far by archaeologists). Epistle letters were also written to the dead, and, by the Ramesside Period, to the gods; the latter became even more widespread during the eras of Persian and Greek domination.

==Ancient Greece and Rome==

Epistles in prose and verse were a major genre of literature among the Greeks and particularly the Romans. The letters of Cicero are one of the most important sources on the history of the late Roman Republic and preserve features of colloquial Latin not always in evidence in his speeches and treatises. The letters of Pliny the Younger likewise are studied as both examples of Latin prose with self-conscious literary qualities and sources for historical information. Ovid produced three collections of verse epistles, composed in elegiac couplets: the &quot;Heroides&quot;, letters written in the person of legendary women to their absent lovers; and the &quot;Tristia&quot; and &quot;Ex Ponto&quot;, written in first person during the poet&#x27;s exile. The epistles of Seneca, with their moral or philosophical ruminations, influenced later patristic writers.

==Form of Christian epistles==
Christian epistles, both those in the New Testament and among the early Christian Fathers, were written in accordance with the formalized, Hellenistic tradition. This reflects the amount of Hellenistic influence upon the epistle writers, especially in the case of Paul. Classicist Steve Reece has compared thousands of Greek, Roman, and Jewish letters contemporary with Paul and observes that Paul follows many of the normal epistolary conventions.

===Opening/greetings===
In contrast to modern letters, epistles usually named the author at the very beginning, followed by the recipient (for example, see Philippians 1:1). The scribe (or more correctly, the amanuensis) who wrote down the letter may be named at the end of the epistle (e.g., Romans 16:22). In the absence of a postal system, the courier may also be named (e.g. Ephesians 6:21–22).

After the names of the author and recipient, Pauline epistles often open with the greeting, &quot;Grace and peace to you.&quot; &quot;Grace&quot; was a common Hellenistic greeting, while &quot;peace&quot; (shalom) was the common Jewish greeting; this reflected Paul&#x27;s dual identity in Jewish faith and Hellenistic culture. There may also be a word of thanks to the audience. In secular letters, a prayer or wish for health followed.

=== Content/body ===
The body begins with a brief statement introducing the main topic of the entire body.

==New Testament epistles==
The epistles of the New Testament canon are usually divided as follows:

===Pauline epistles===
The Pauline epistles, also called Epistles of Paul or Letters of Paul, are the thirteen books of the New Testament attributed to Paul the Apostle, although the authorship of some is in dispute. Among these epistles are some of the earliest extant Christian documents. They provide an insight into the beliefs and controversies of early Christianity. As part of the canon of the New Testament, they are foundational texts for both Christian theology and ethics. The Epistle to the Hebrews, although it does not bear his name, was traditionally considered Pauline (although Origen questioned its authorship in the 3rd century CE), but from the 16th century onwards opinion steadily moved against Pauline authorship and few scholars now ascribe it to Paul, mostly because it does not read like any of his other epistles in style and content. Most scholars agree that Paul actually wrote seven of the Pauline epistles, but that four of the epistles in Paul&#x27;s name are pseudepigraphic (Ephesians, First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus) and that two other epistles are of questionable authorship (Second Thessalonians and Colossians). According to some scholars, Paul wrote these letters with the help of a secretary, or amanuensis, who would have influenced their style, if not their theological content.

The Pauline epistles are usually placed between the Acts of the Apostles and the Catholic epistles in modern editions. Most Greek manuscripts, however, place the General epistles first, and a few minuscules (175, 325, 336, and 1424) place the Pauline epistles at the end of the New Testament.

===Catholic (i.e., &quot;general&quot;) epistles===
The catholic epistles (also called the general epistles) are seven epistles of the New Testament. Listed in order of their appearance in the New Testament, the catholic epistles are:
=== Non canonical epistles ===
* Correspondence of Paul and Seneca, a set of 14 letters also known as the Epistle to Seneca the Younger
* Third Epistle to the Corinthians (canonical for a time in the Armenian Orthodox), also a correspondence of two letters
* Epistle to the Laodiceans (Latin version found in Codex Fuldensis)
* Letter of Peter to Philip

=== Lost epistles ===
* The first Epistle to Corinth referenced at 
* The third Epistle to Corinth called Severe Letter referenced at and 
* The Corinthian letter to Paul referenced at 
* The Earlier Epistle to the Ephesians referenced at 
* The Epistle to the Laodiceans referenced at 
* The Earlier Epistle of Jude referenced at 
* The Earlier Epistle of John referenced at 

== Epistles of Apostolic Fathers ==
These are letters written by some very early Christian leaders, in the 1st or 2nd century, which are not part of the New Testament. They are generally considered to form part of the basis of Christian tradition. The ennobling word &quot;epistle&quot; is used partly because these were all written in Greek, in a time period close to when the epistles of the New Testament were written, and thus &quot;epistle&quot; lends additional weight of authority.

* Epistle of the Romans to the Corinthians (1 Clement)
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians
* Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans
* Epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp
* Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians
* Epistle of Barnabas
* Epistle to Diognetus

==Liturgical use==

In the context of a liturgy, epistle may refer more specifically to a particular passage from a New Testament epistle (the Pauline epistles and the General epistles)—sometimes also from the Book of Acts or the Revelation of John, but not the Four Gospels—that is scheduled to be read on a certain day or at a certain occasion.

===Western churches===
In the Roman Catholic Mass and Anglican Eucharist, epistles are read between the Collect and the Gospel reading. The corresponding Gregorian chants have a special tone (&quot;tonus epistolae&quot;). When the epistle is sung or chanted at Solemn Mass it is done so by the subdeacon. Epistles are also read by an Elder or Bishop in the Lutheran Divine Service, between the gradual and the Gospel.

===Eastern churches===

In the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Byzantine Rite Catholics the Epistle reading is called the &quot;Apostol&quot; (the same name is given to the lectionary from which it is read). The Apostol includes the Acts of the Apostles as well as the Epistles, but never the Apocalypse (Revelation of John). Unlike in the Latin liturgical rites, there are never readings from the Old Testament. There are Epistle lessons for every day of the year, except for weekdays during Great Lent, when the Divine Liturgy is not celebrated. These daily Epistle readings are a part of the Paschal cycle, being ultimately dependent upon the date of Pascha (Easter). There are also lessons appointed for the feast days of numerous saints and commemorations. There may be one, two, or three readings from the Apostol during a single Liturgy. The Epistle is read between the Prokeimenon and the Alleluia. The Epistle reading is always linked to a reading from the Gospel, though some services, such as Matins, will have a Gospel lesson, but no Epistle (Vespers on a number of feast days (typically for Apostles) will also have three epistle readings but no Gospel). A number of services besides the Divine Liturgy will have an Epistle and Gospel reading. Such services often include a Prokeimenon and Alleluia as well. The Epistle is chanted by the reader, though at a Hierarchical Liturgy (a Divine Liturgy celebrated by a bishop), it is read by a deacon. The one who chants the Epistle also reads the verses of the Prokeimenon.

==Medieval epistles==
During the Middle Ages, the art of letter writing was taught in numerous manuals, and the ars dictaminis became an important genre of instructional discourse. The necessity for letter writing was in large part due to the general deterioration of civil life and the decay of the Roman road system in the early Middle Ages, factors that obliged literate people with business to transact to send letters instead of travel themselves. A vast number of letters and letter-writing manuals were written in the period&#x27;s &quot;lingua franca&quot;, Latin.

<doc id="181123" wikidata="Q891559" url="?curid=181123" title="Mexican Stock Exchange">
<text>The Mexican Stock Exchange (), commonly known as Mexican Bolsa, Mexbol, or BMV, is one of two stock exchanges in Mexico, the other being BIVA - Bolsa Institucional de Valores. It is the second largest stock exchange in Latin America, only after São Paulo based B3 in Brazil. It is also the fifth largest stock exchange in the Americas. The exchange platform is owned by BMV Group, which also owns the derivative exchange &quot;MexDer&quot; and the custody agency &quot;Indeval&quot;.

The BMV was created out of the merger of the three stock exchanges which formerly operated in Mexico: The &quot;Bolsa de Valores de México&quot;, which operated in Mexico City, the Bolsa de Occidente (&quot;Occidental Stock Exchange&quot;) in Guadalajara, and the Bolsa de Monterrey (&quot;Monterrey Stock Exchange&quot;). The exchange kept modernising until its introduction of a fully electronic system for trading which was consolidated in 1999.

In 2014, the Mexican Stock Exchange completed its first trade as a part of MILA which, together with the stock exchanges of Santiago, Lima, and Colombia, is the largest securities market by total capitalisation in Latin America.

== History ==
=== Bolsa de México===
From 1880 to 1900, Plateros and Cadena streets in the historic center of Mexico City were home to recurring meetings in which brokers and businessmen purchased and sold all kinds of commodities as well as stocks in public offerings. Afterwards, exclusive groups of shareholders and issuing company representatives would gather to negotiate behind closed doors in different places around the city.

In 1894, Manuel Algara, Camilo Arriaga, and Manuel Nicolín pushed, among the most distinguished brokers of the time, the idea of a normative and institutionalised system to trade securities. With the increased backing and widespread support for his ideas, the Bolsa Nacional (&quot;National Stock Exchange&quot;) was founded on 31 October 1894 at 9 Plateros Street, later renamed Madero Street. Less than a year later, another group of brokers, led by Francisco A. Llerena and Luis G. Necochea, formed a society named Bolsa de México (&quot;Stock Exchange of Mexico)&quot;, and registered as a competing establishment on 14 June 1895. Because of coinciding objectives and links between members of the two institutions, leaders began discussing a union between them. On 3 September 1895, the merger was finalised, keeping the name Bolsa de México, and the administrative offices at the Plateros Street address. The company was officially inaugurated on 21 October 1895.

By the start of the following year, Bolsa de México had three public issuing companies and eight private ones, among them, the Bank of Mexico, the National Bank of Mexico, and the (later acquired by Banco Santander).
On 1 March 1933, the Congress of Mexico passed and President Abelardo L. Rodríguez signed into law the Regulatory Decree of the General Law of Credit Institutions and Auxiliary Organisations, normalising the exchange of securities and the stock market in Mexico.

===Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A.===

Because of the legal reforms of the time, and the concession authorised by Congress on 28 October 1933, which for the first time included stock exchanges, the charter and bylaws of the Bolsa de Valores de México, S.A. (Stock Exchange of Mexico) were approved, and on 5 September, the institution was incorporated. That same year, the National Securities Commission, later renamed National Banking and Securities Commission, was established to supervise the Bolsa de Valores de México.

Because of substantial industrial and commercial growth in Mexico mid-century, owing to the rise in the creation of maquiladoras in northern Mexico, as well as the accumulation of capital and the constant creation of new businesses at the time, the Monterrey Stock Exchange was established, and it grew to serve the entire North of the country, reaching over 100 listings. Soon after, businesses in Guadalajara started organising a third stock exchange, and in 1960, the Occidental Stock Exchange was established to serve the West coast of Mexico.

===Mexican Stock Exchange created===
Because of low performance in the Guadalajara and Monterrey stock exchanges, however, Congress passed in 1975 the Securities&#x27; Market Law, which prompted the Bolsa de Valores de México to change its name to Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (Mexican Stock Exchange) and merge the other two exchange houses into it, creating thus the single entity that remains to this day the only stock exchange in Mexico.

On 19 April 1990, the Centro Bursátil was finished on Paseo de la Reforma, turning the Stock Exchange Centre into the heart of the financial district of Mexico City. Five years later, the BMV completely modernised the centre, introducing a completely electronic system (BMV-SENTRA) which was phased into the workings of the exchange, becoming fully operational by 1999.

In 2001, Citigroup became the first foreign company to begin trading in the BMV, opening the door to many new companies to do the same, especially from Central and South America. The same year, the Securities&#x27; Market Law was reformed according to the demutualisation of BMV. The following year, the Corporativo Mexicano del Mercado de Valores, S.A. de C.V. was constituted to manage the hiring of personnel, and administration of the Stock Exchange and other financial institutions within the centre.
In 2003, the global market was made available through the BMV, allowing national investors access to foreign securities from within the country. In 2006, the Mexican securities market was opened to foreigners through the MexDer system, allowing them operation from anywhere in the world. In October of the same year, four ETFs (exchange-traded funds) over indexes of the stock exchange itself were listed, placing BMV in the first place in Latin America in terms of ETFs listed over own indexes, and as the leading stock exchange in terms of total ETFs.

In 2010, the BMV signed an alliance with the world&#x27;s largest derivatives exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, putting Mexican derivatives within reach of international investors.

The Mexican Stock Exchange, BMV, announced its first trade made as part of the Latin American Integrated Market (MILA by its Spanish initials) on 2 December 2014. The trade on MIILA was a $1,415 purchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer Falabella, executed by GBM Mexico through GBM Chile. With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock market now counts 798 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest market by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in terms of market capitalization, according to the World Federation of Exchanges. The joint capitalization of the four bourses tops US$1.25 trillion, making it larger than the US$1.22 trillion BM&amp;F Bovespa. The move comes largely as step in the integration efforts between Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru, as members of the Pacific Alliance.

== Structure and operations ==

BMV is now a public company following its IPO in June 2008, and its shares are traded on the BMV equities market. It operates by concession of the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit.

Until its IPO, BMV was owned by its members, which were a group of banks and brokerage firms. The exchange trades debt instruments including Federal Treasury certificates (CETES), Federal Government Development bonds (BONDES), Investment Unit bonds (UDIBONOS), Bankers acceptances, promissory notes with yield payable at maturity, commercial paper and development bank bonds. It also trades stocks, debentures, mutual fund shares, and warrants. Trading is conducted electronically through the BMV-SENTRA Equities System. Settlement is T+2, and trading hours are 7:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. for the equities market and 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. for the derivatives market (Monday through Friday),

== Indices ==

The BMV calculates 13 indices of stock prices. Each index can be used as an underlying value for derivative products listed on specialized markets. The main benchmark stock index is called the IPC, which stands for Índice de Precios y Cotizaciones, and is the broadest indicator of the BMV&#x27;s overall performance. It is made up of a balanced weighted selection of shares that are representative of all the shares listed on the exchange from various sectors across the economy, and is revised twice a year. Weight is determined by market capitalization. The IPC&#x27;s value is related to the previous day&#x27;s value, rather than the base date of October 30, 1978. Since February 2009 the IPC index has included BMV&#x27;s own A shares. Indice Mexico (INMEX) is a market capitalization weighted index of 20 to 25 of the BMV&#x27;s most highly marketable issuers, using their most representative series. The sample is limited to issuers with a minimum market value of $100 million and is revised every six months. The weighting cannot be greater than 10% at the start of each calculation period.

<doc id="181130" wikidata="Q66355" url="?curid=181130" title="Johann Gottfried Eichhorn">
<text>Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (16 October 1752, in Dörrenzimmern – 27 June 1827, in Göttingen) was a German Protestant theologian of the Enlightenment and an early orientalist. He was a member of the Göttingen school of history.

==Education and early career==
Born at Dörrenzimmern (now part of the city of Ingelfingen), in the Principality of Hohenlohe-Oehringen, Eichhorn was educated at the state school in Weikersheim, where his father was superintendent, at the gymnasium at Heilbronn and at the University of Göttingen (1770–1774), studying under Johann David Michaelis. In 1774 he received the rectorship of the gymnasium at Ohrdruf, in the duchy of Saxe-Gotha.

== Professorship in Jena 1775–1788 ==
In 1775 he was made professor of Oriental languages at the Faculty of Theology at Jena University. His published habilitation lecture was about &quot;monetary matters of the early Arabs (De rei numariae apud Arabas initiis)&quot; on the basis of the chronicle of Makin ibn al-&#x27;Amid. Later he edited the &quot;Briefe über das arabische Münzwesen&quot; by Johann Jacob Reiske. As a supplement to it he compiled the first commentated bibliography of Islamic numismatics in 1786 with more than 100 pages. It is still a reference tool for numismatic literature prior to this date. He also edited some historical works of the Reiske, who died 1774. Eichhorn was acquainted with him from time of his study in Göttingen.

During his professorship in Jena he wrote his seminal &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament (Einleitung in das Alte Testament)&quot; which was a breakthrough in the historical understanding of the Pentateuch. In 1776 he founded the first important journal for Oriental studies, the &quot;Repertorium für biblische und morgenländische Litteratur&quot;, which he edited until 1788.

== Professorship in Göttingen 1788-1827 ==

In 1788 he was elected professor ordinarius at Göttingen, where he lectured not only on Oriental languages and on the exegesis of the Old and New Testaments, but also on political history. Eichhorn was elected a corresponding member, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1815. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1825. His health was shattered in 1825, but he continued his lectures until attacked by fever on 14 June 1827. His son, Karl Friedrich, became a famous jurist.

== Achievements in theology ==

Eichhorn has been called &quot;the founder of modern Old Testament criticism.&quot; He recognized its scope and problems, and began many of its most important discussions. &quot;My greatest trouble,&quot; he says in the preface to the second edition of his &quot;Einleitung,&quot; &quot;I had to bestow on a hitherto unworked field--on the investigation of the inner nature of the Old Testament with the help of the Higher Criticism (not a new name to any humanist).&quot; His investigations led him to the conclusion that &quot;most of the writings of the Hebrews have passed through several hands.&quot; He took for granted that all the supernatural events related in the Old and New Testaments were explicable on natural principles. He sought to judge them from the standpoint of the ancient world, and to account for them by the superstitious beliefs which were then generally in vogue. He did not perceive in the biblical books any religious ideas of much importance for modern times; they interested him merely historically and for the light they cast upon antiquity.

He regarded many books of the Old Testament as spurious, questioned the genuineness of the First and Second letters of Peter and the Epistle of Jude, denied the Pauline authorship of the First and Second letters to Timothy and to Titus. He suggested that the canonical gospels were based upon various translations and editions of a primary Aramaic gospel, but did not appreciate as sufficiently as David Strauss and the Tübingen critics the difficulties which a natural theory has to surmount, nor did he support his conclusions by such elaborate discussions as they deemed necessary. He challenged the Augustinian hypothesis solution to the synoptic problem and proposed an original gospel hypothesis (1804) which argued that there was a lost Aramaic original gospel that each of the Synoptic evangelists had in a different form.

<text>Karl Friedrich Eichhorn (20 November 1781 – 4 July 1854) was a German jurist.

== Life ==
Eichhorn was born in Jena as the son of Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. He entered the University of Göttingen in 1797. In 1805 he obtained the professorship of law at Frankfurt (Oder), holding it until 1811, when he accepted the same chair at the new Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. On the call to arms in 1813 he became a captain of horse, and received the Iron Cross at the end of the war.

In 1817 he was offered the chair of law at Göttingen, and, preferring it to the Berlin professorship, taught there with great success until ill-health compelled him to resign in 1828. His successor in the Berlin chair having died in 1832, he again entered on its duties, but resigned two years afterwards. In 1832 he also received an appointment in the ministry of foreign affairs, which, with his labours on many state committees and his legal researches and writings, occupied him until his death at Cologne. He was furthermore a member of the Prussian Supreme Tribunal.

Eichhorn was regarded as one of the principal authorities on German constitutional law. His chief work is &quot;Deutsche Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte&quot; (Göttingen, 1808–1823, 5th edition 1843–1844). In company with Friedrich Carl von Savigny and Johann Friedrich Ludwig Göschen he founded the &quot;Zeitschrift für geschichtliche Rechtswissenschaft&quot;. He was the author besides of &quot;Einleitung in das deutsche Privatrecht mit Einschluss des Lehenrechts&quot; (Gött., 1823) and the &quot;Grundsätze des Kirchenrechts der Katholischen und der Evangelischen Religionspartei in Deutschland&quot;, 2 Bde. (ib., 1831–1833).

<text>Georg Heinrich August Ewald (16 November 1803 – 4 May 1875) was a German orientalist, Protestant theologian, and Biblical exegete. He studied at the University of Göttingen. In 1827 he became extraordinary professor there, in 1831 ordinary professor of theology, and in 1835 professor of oriental languages. In 1837, as a member of the Göttingen Seven, he lost his position at Göttingen on account of his protest against King Ernst August&#x27;s abrogation of the liberal constitution, and became professor of theology at the University of Tübingen. In 1848, he returned to his old position at Göttingen. When Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866, Ewald became a defender of the rights of the ex-king. Among his chief works are: &quot;Complete Course on the Hebrew Language&quot; (), &quot;The Poetical Books of the Old Testament&quot; (), &quot;History of the People of Israel&quot; (), and &quot;Antiquities of the People of Israel&quot; (). Ewald represented the city of Hanover as a member of the Guelph faction in the North German and German Diets.

==Life==
Ewald was born at Göttingen where his father was a linen weaver. In 1815 he was sent to the gymnasium, and in 1820 he entered the University of Göttingen, where he studied with J.G. Eichhorn and T. C. Tychsen, specialising in oriental languages. At the close of his academic studies in 1823 he was appointed to a mastership in the gymnasium at Wolfenbüttel, and made a study of the oriental manuscripts in the Wolfenbüttel library. But in the spring of 1824 he was recalled to Göttingen as theological tutor (), and in 1827 (the year of Eichhorn&#x27;s death) he became professor extraordinarius in philosophy and lecturer in Old Testament exegesis. In 1830, Ewald married (1808–1840), the daughter of mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Of all of Gauss&#x27;s children, Wilhelmina was said to have come closest to her father&#x27;s talent, but she died in 1840. In 1831 Heinrich Ewald was promoted to professor ordinarius in philosophy; in 1833 he became a member of the Royal Scientific Society, and in 1835, after Tychsen&#x27;s death, he entered the faculty of theology, taking the chair of Oriental languages.

Two years later occurred the first important episode in Ewald&#x27;s studious life. In 1837, on 18 November, along with six of his colleagues he signed a formal protest against the action of King Ernst August in abolishing the liberal constitution of 1833, which had been granted to the House of Hanover by his predecessor William IV. This procedure of the seven professors led to their expulsion from the university (14 December). Early in 1838 Ewald received a call to Tübingen, and there for upwards of ten years he held a chair as professor ordinarius, first in philosophy and afterwards, from 1841, in theology. To this period belong some of his most important works, and also the commencement of his bitter feud with F.C. Baur and the Tübingen school. In 1847, &quot;the great shipwreck-year in Germany,&quot; as he has called it, he was invited back to Göttingen on honourable terms—the liberal constitution having been restored. He accepted the invitation.

In 1845, Ewald remarried, this time to Auguste Schleiermacher (1822–1897); the couple had a daughter in 1850 who was named Caroline Therese Wilhelmine.

In 1862-1863 Ewald took an active part in a movement for reform within the Hanoverian Church, and he was a member of the synod which passed the new constitution. He had an important share also in the formation of the &quot;Protestantenverein&quot;, or Protestant association, in September 1863. But the chief crisis in his life arose out of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. His loyalty to King George V of Hanover (son of Ernst August) would not permit him to take the oath of allegiance to the victorious King William I of Prussia, and he was therefore placed on the retired list, though with the full amount of his salary as pension.

This degree of severity might have been held by the Prussian authorities to be unnecessary, had Ewald been less hostile in his language. The violent tone of some of his printed manifestoes about this time, especially of his &quot;Lob des Königs u. des Volkes&quot;, led to his being deprived of the &quot;venia legendi&quot; (1868) and also to a criminal trial, which, however, resulted in his acquittal (May 1869). Then, and on two subsequent occasions, he was returned by the city of Hanover as a member of the North German and German parliaments. In June 1874 he was found guilty of a libel on Otto von Bismarck, whom he had compared to Frederick the Great in &quot;his unrighteous war with Austria and his ruination of religion and morality,&quot; to Napoleon III in his way of &quot;picking out the best time possible for robbery and plunder.&quot; For this offence he was sentenced to undergo three weeks&#x27; imprisonment. He died in Göttingen in his 72nd year, of heart disease.

==Influence==

In his public life Ewald displayed characteristics such as simplicity and sincerity, moral earnestness, independence, absolute fearlessness. As a teacher he had a remarkable power of kindling enthusiasm; and he taught many distinguished pupils, including August Schleicher, Ferdinand Hitzig, Eberhard Schrader, Theodor Noldeke, Diestel and Christian Friedrich August Dillmann. His disciples were not all of one school, but many eminent scholars who apparently have been untouched by his influence have in fact developed some of the many ideas which he suggested.

Ewald&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew Grammar&quot; inaugurated a new era in biblical philology. Subsequent works in that department were avowedly based on his, and Hitzig referred to him as &quot;the second founder of the science of the Hebrew language.&quot; He made important contributions as an exegete, biblical critic and grammarian. In particular, his &quot;Geschichte des Volkes Israel&quot;, the result of thirty years&#x27; labour, was important in that branch of research.

Taking up the idea of a divine education of the human race, and firmly believing that Providence assigned a special task to each of the leading nations of antiquity, Ewald felt no difficulty about Israel&#x27;s place in universal history, or about the problem which that race had been called upon to solve. The history of Israel, according to him, was the history how humanity acquired one true religion, beginning with the exodus and culminating in the appearing of Jesus.

The historical interval that separated these two events is treated as naturally dividing itself into three great periods—those of Moses, David and Ezra. The periods are externally indicated by the successive names by which the chosen people were called—Hebrews, Israelites, Jews. The events prior to the exodus are relegated by Ewald to a preliminary chapter of primitive history; and the events of the apostolic and post-apostolic age are treated as a kind of appendix. The entire construction of the history is based on a critical examination and chronological arrangement of the available documents.

==Works==

The more important of Ewald&#x27;s works are:

*&quot;Die Composition der Genesis kritisch untersucht&quot; (1823), an attempt to account for the use of the two names of God without recourse to the documentary hypothesis; he was not himself, however, permanently convinced by it.

<text>Monato is a monthly magazine produced in Esperanto which carries articles on politics, culture and economics. It is printed in Belgium and distributed to readers in 65 countries. The title simply means &quot;month&quot;.

It has 100 correspondents in 45 countries and only prints articles originally written in Esperanto and not published elsewhere.

In style, content and appearance it could be likened to &quot;Time Magazine&quot; or &quot;Newsweek&quot;; however, a key difference is that its articles are produced by the residents of the country concerned, rather than by foreign correspondents.

==History==

===&quot;Semajno&quot;===
In 1977 Stefan Maul was editor of the German newspaper Weltbild and received the task to develop &quot;Zenit&quot;, a new newspaper for the older generation. Although the project failed due to several independent factors from Maul, he became expert about the creation of a new publication, the testing of the market and other similar necessary steps. That gave strength to his old dream: to publish a weekly newspaper in Esperanto, not about Esperanto itself, but on general issues such as politics, economics, science and much more.

In 1978 Maul realized his dream. He printed a sample of &quot;Semajno&quot; (&quot;week&quot; in Esperanto), a 40-page number DIN A4-formed, black-white illustrated, with articles about terrorism, the Olympic games in Moscow in 1980, about the political situation in Spain, about gerontology and much more. This edition paid from his own pocket. He calculated that the project would succeed if &quot;Semajno&quot; had 10,000 subscribers but he did not reach that amount at all. Maul left the idea and considered it had lost a beautiful dream.

===&quot;Monato&quot;===
Torben Kehlet, whose firm &quot;TK / Stafeto&quot; had already published many books and had its own printing press suggested publishing the magazine not weekly, but monthly. Maul was not sure it would be a good idea because in his opinion a monthly magazine can not be relevant. However, Kehlet managed to convince him. Instead of relevance, the magazine can offer in-depth analytical articles written by the residents of the countries in question.

In January 1980 the first issue of the magazine &quot;Monato&quot; was published by the firm &quot;TK/Stafeto&quot;, which assumed financial risks. Torben Kehlet himself printed and distributed the magazine. The annual subscription (12 numbers) cost 800 Belgian francs, to pay for the project it needed 2000 subscribers.

Stefan Maul became the editor-in-chief of &quot;Monato&quot;; he assembled a group of competent employees (Maria Becker-Meisberger, Marjorie Bolton, Margret Brandenburg, Eugène de Zila, Bernard Golden, Trevor Steel, Eduard Symoens, etc.). At the end of the first year, &quot;Monato&quot; conducted a survey among readers. It turned out that 28% read the magazine in full and 60% read the most.

Due to some difficulties of &quot;TK/Stafeto&quot;, UEA took over the publication of &quot;Monato&quot; and was ready at its own expense to provide subscribers with the remaining numbers of 1984, and from 1985 to publish a magazine. In the doubled number 5/6 for 1984 there was an announcement &quot;Monato&quot; continues to live&quot;. In the same issue, several pages were devoted to readers&#x27; reactions to the alleged death of the magazine.

In the mid-1980s, UEA opened offices not only in Antwerp, but also in Budapest and New York. However, in 1988 the association began to close additional offices. The director of the Antwerp graphic center, Paŭl Peeraerts, was informed that all employees will be dismissed and the office closed. Since the graphic center carried out the administration and publication of &quot;Monato&quot;, closing the office would also mean closing the magazine, because there was no money for printing and printing the magazine in another firm.

However, the existence of the Antwerp graphic center had strengthened the local Esperanto movement in Flanders. Negotiations ensued between the UEA and the Flanders League of Esperanto, and soon after the FLE took over the equipment and the team, namely Guido Baeyens, Hugo Fontyn, Gerd Jacques, Paŭl Peeraerts, Guido van Damme and Jean-Pierre VandenDaele. Since then the &quot;Monato&quot; has been continuously published by the Flanders Esperanto League.

<text>Eberhard Schrader (7 January 1836 – 4 July 1908) was a German orientalist primarily known for his achievements in Assyriology.

==Biography==
He was born at Braunschweig, and educated at Göttingen under Ewald. In 1858 he won a university prize for a treatise on the Ethiopian languages, and in 1863 became professor of theology at the University of Zürich. Subsequently, he occupied chairs at Giessen (1870) and Jena (1873), and finally became professor of Oriental languages at the Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin in 1878. Though he turned first to biblical research, his chief achievements were in the field of Assyriology, in which he was a pioneer in Germany and acquired an international reputation. He died in Berlin and he was buried at the Stahnsdorf South-Western Cemetery.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1962 was the 7th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 18 March 1962 in the of the Villa Louvigny in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg and presented by Mireille Delannoy. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (CLT), and originally known as the  (), the contest was held in following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Nous les amoureux&quot; by Jean-Claude Pascal. Sixteen countries participated in the event, with the same line-up of nations as at the previous year&#x27;s contest.

For the third time in five years the winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by , written by Roland Valade and performed by Isabelle Aubret. placed second for the first time, while the host nation came third, resulting in French language-songs occupying all of the top three positions. For the first time in the contest&#x27;s history an entry received &quot;nul points&quot; from all juries, with , , the and all receiving zero points overall.

== Location ==

The 1962 contest took place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot; performed by Jean-Claude Pascal. It was the first time that Luxembourg had hosted the event. The chosen venue was the Villa Louvigny, situated within the city&#x27;s Municipal Park in the Ville Haute quarter of the city centre, which served as the headquarters of the (CLT), the Luxembourgish public broadcaster. The contest itself was held in the building&#x27;s .

== Participating countries ==


There was no change in the participants line-up for the first time, with no new countries joining the event and the same sixteen countries which had competed in 1961 returning for 1962.

Four artists in this year&#x27;s event had previously participated in past contests: &#x27;s Camillo Felgen and &#x27;s François Deguelt competed for their respective countries for the second time after both appearing in the ; Jean Philippe, representing at this event, also participated for the second time, after previously competing for in ; and Fud Leclerc made his fourth contest appearance for , following past entries in , and 1960. Philippe became the first artist to represent two different countries in separate Eurovision Song Contests, while Leclerc became the first of only four acts to compete in four separate contests, alongside Switzerland&#x27;s Peter, Sue and Marc (, , and ), &#x27;s Elisabeth Andreassen (, , and ) and &#x27;s Valentina Monetta (, , and ). Four other artists competing in this event would go on to compete in the contest on another occasion: the &#x27;s Ronnie Carroll (); &#x27;s Claudio Villa (); France&#x27;s Isabelle Aubret (); and &#x27;s Marion Rung (). As a result, half of the competing artists in this year&#x27;s event had competed, or would eventually compete, in multiple Eurovision Song Contests.

== Production and format ==

The contest was organised and broadcast by CLT. Jos Pauly and René Steichen served as producers and directors, Jean-Paul Conzemius served as designer, and Jean Roderès served as musical director, leading around forty musicians of the . Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. The contest was presented by Mireille Delannoy, one of Télé-Luxembourg&#x27;s regular continuity announcers.

Each country, participating through a single EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. The results of the event were determined through jury voting; in a change from previous events, each country awarded three points to the jury&#x27;s collective favourite entry, with two points awarded to the jury&#x27;s second favourite, and one point given the jury&#x27;s third favourite. Each jury comprised ten individuals representing the average television viewer and radio listener; as such no individuals in the music industry, including composers, music publishers, and people employed by record companies, were able to sit on the jury.

The draw to determine the running order took place on 16 March 1962 in the Villa Louvigny, conducted by Delannoy and assisted by her 4-year-old son Olivier. Rehearsals were held in the contest venue on 17 and 18 March, with two full dress rehearsals scheduled before the live broadcast on the evening of 18 March.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held at 18 March 1962 at 21:30 (CET) and lasted 1 hour and 27 minutes. Held on a Sunday, this is the last time that the contest&#x27;s grand final was not held on a Saturday. The interval act was a performance by the French clown Achille Zavatta, in a skit as the contest&#x27;s seventeenth participant representing &quot;Zavattaland&quot;. The prize for the winning artist and songwriters, a medallion engraved with the figure of a winged lion, the heraldic animal of CLT, and designed by , was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artist Jean-Claude Pascal.

The contest suffered from two power failures which impacted the broadcast of the event: the first occurred during the Dutch entry, which affected the picture quality and plunged the performance into total darkness for around 30 seconds for some broadcasters; the second occurred immediately following the French entry as the auditorium went completely dark for around 1 minutes and 30 seconds, leading to broadcasters showing &quot;breakdown&quot; captions on-screen as the issue was resolved and a delay in the performance of the Norwegian entry.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, composed by , written by Roland Valade and performed by Isabelle Aubret. This was France&#x27;s third contest victory in five years, also setting a new record as the first country to win the contest three times. secured its first second-place finish, while the finished in third place; the top three positions were therefore all performed in the French language. Monaco&#x27;s François Deguelt, who had previously come third in , became the first of only five artists who have placed second and third in the contest without having won, alongside the UK&#x27;s Cliff Richard, &#x27;s Katja Ebstein, &#x27;s Chiara Siracusa and &#x27;s Željko Joksimović. For the first time in the contest&#x27;s history an entry scored &quot;nul points&quot; from all juries; four countries ultimately scored zero points, namely , , and the .

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1962 contest are listed below.

* Tage Danielsson
* Alex Macintosh

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to that which each country performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in descending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below, with voting countries listed in the order in which they presented their votes.

The new voting system produced what some consider to be one of the least exciting voting sequences in the contest&#x27;s history, with France quickly taking the lead and ultimately finishing with double the number of points compared to the runner-up Monegasque entry. With each country only able to award points to three of the potential fifteen countries available, leaving twelve countries without points, the new system also most likely contributed to countries being awarded zero points overall for the first time.

=== 3 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum 3 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. France received the maximum score of 3 points from five of the voting countries, Luxembourg and Monaco each received three sets of 3 points, Yugoslavia received two sets of maximum scores, and Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom received one maximum score each.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. At least 15 commentators were present at the contest, with an estimated global viewership and listenership of 60 to 100 million reported in the media. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the table below.
