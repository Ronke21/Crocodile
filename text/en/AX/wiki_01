<text>Moksha (; , &quot;&quot;), also called vimoksha, vimukti, and mukti, is a term in Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism for various forms of emancipation, liberation, &quot;nirvana&quot;, or release. In its soteriological and eschatological senses, it refers to freedom from &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the cycle of death and rebirth. In its epistemological and psychological senses, &quot;moksha&quot; is freedom from ignorance: self-realization, self-actualization and self-knowledge.

In Hindu traditions, &quot;moksha&quot; is a central concept and the utmost aim of human life; the other three aims are &quot;dharma&quot; (virtuous, proper, moral life), &quot;artha&quot; (material prosperity, income security, means of life), and &quot;kama&quot; (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment). Together, these four concepts are called Puruṣārtha in Hinduism.

In some schools of Indian religions, &quot;moksha&quot; is considered equivalent to and used interchangeably with other terms such as &quot;vimoksha&quot;, &quot;vimukti&quot;, &quot;kaivalya&quot;, &quot;apavarga&quot;, &quot;mukti&quot;, &quot;nihsreyasa&quot;, and &quot;nirvana&quot;. However, terms such as &quot;moksha&quot; and &quot;nirvana&quot; differ and mean different states between various schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term &quot;nirvana&quot; is more common in Buddhism, while &quot;moksha&quot; is more prevalent in Hinduism.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Moksha&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit root word, &#x27;, which means to free, let go, release, liberate. According to Jain scriptures, it is a combination of two Sanskrit words, &quot;moh&quot; (attachment) and &quot;kshay&quot; (its destruction).

== Definition and meanings ==

The definition and meaning of &quot;moksha&quot; varies between various schools of Indian religions. &quot;Moksha&quot; means freedom, liberation, but from what and how is where the schools differ. &quot;Moksha&quot; is also a concept that means liberation from rebirth or &quot;saṃsāra&quot;. This liberation can be attained while one is on earth (&quot;jivanmukti&quot;), or eschatologically (&quot;karmamukti&quot;, &quot;videhamukti&quot;). Some Indian traditions have emphasized liberation on concrete, ethical action within the world. This liberation is an epistemological transformation that permits one to see the truth and reality behind the fog of ignorance.

&quot;Moksha&quot; has been defined not merely as absence of suffering and release from bondage to &quot;saṃsāra.&quot; Various schools of Hinduism also explain the concept as presence of the state of &quot;paripurna-brahmanubhava&quot; (the experience of oneness with Brahman, the One Supreme Self), a state of knowledge, peace and bliss. For example, Vivekachudamani – an ancient book on &quot;moksha&quot;, explains one of many meditative steps on the path to &quot;moksha&quot;, as:

=== Eschatological sense ===

&quot;Moksha&quot; is a concept associated with &quot;saṃsāra&quot; (birth-rebirth cycle). &quot;Samsara&quot; originated with religious movements in the first millennium BCE. These movements such as Buddhism, Jainism and new schools within Hinduism, saw human life as bondage to a repeated process of rebirth. This bondage to repeated rebirth and life, each life subject to injury, disease and aging, was seen as a cycle of suffering. By release from this cycle, the suffering involved in this cycle also ended. This release was called &quot;moksha&quot;, &quot;nirvana&quot;, &quot;kaivalya&quot;, &quot;mukti&quot; and other terms in various Indian religious traditions but as per Hindu scripture veda one can attain &quot;mokhsha&quot; by giving up shadripu ( kama, lobha, krodha, moha, mada and matsarya). A desire for the release from pain and suffering seems to lie at the root of striving for moksha, and it is commonly believed that moksha is an otherwordly reality, only achievable at the end of life, not during. However there is also a notion that &quot;moksha&quot; can be achieved during life in the form of a state of liberation, known as jivan-mukti, although this is still reliant on personal and spiritual endeavours attributed to attaining moksha.

Eschatological ideas evolved in Hinduism. In earliest Vedic literature, heaven and hell sufficed soteriological curiosities. Over time, the ancient scholars observed that people vary in the quality of virtuous or sinful life they lead, and began questioning how differences in each person&#x27;s &quot;puṇya&quot; (merit, good deeds) or &quot;pāp&quot; (demerit, sin) as human beings affected their afterlife. This question led to the conception of an afterlife where the person stayed in heaven or hell, in proportion to their merit or demerit, then returned to earth and were reborn, the cycle continuing indefinitely. The rebirth idea ultimately flowered into the ideas of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, or transmigration – where one&#x27;s balance sheet of &quot;karma&quot; determined one&#x27;s rebirth. Along with this idea of &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, the ancient scholars developed the concept of &quot;moksha&quot;, as a state that released a person from the &quot;saṃsāra&quot; cycle. &quot;Moksha&quot; release in eschatological sense in these ancient literature of Hinduism, suggests van Buitenen, comes from self-knowledge and consciousness of oneness of supreme soul.

=== Epistemological and psychological senses ===

Scholars provide various explanations of the meaning of &quot;moksha&quot; in epistemological and psychological senses. For example, Deutsche sees &quot;moksha&quot; as transcendental consciousness, the perfect state of being, of self-realization, of freedom and of &quot;realizing the whole universe as the Self&quot;.

&quot;Moksha&quot; in Hinduism, suggests Klaus Klostermaier, implies a setting-free of hitherto fettered faculties, a removing of obstacles to an unrestricted life, permitting a person to be more truly a person in the full sense; the concept presumes an unused human potential of creativity, compassion and understanding which had been blocked and shut out. &quot;Moksha&quot; is more than liberation from a life-rebirth cycle of suffering (&quot;samsara&quot;); the Vedantic school separates this into two: &quot;jivanmukti&quot; (liberation in this life) and &quot;videhamukti&quot; (liberation after death). &quot;Moksha&quot; in this life includes psychological liberation from &quot;adhyasa&quot; (fears besetting one&#x27;s life) and &quot;avidya&quot; (ignorance or anything that is not true knowledge).

==== As a state of perfection ====
Many schools of Hinduism according to Daniel Ingalls, see &quot;moksha&quot; as a state of perfection. The concept was seen as a natural goal beyond &quot;dharma&quot;. &quot;Moksha&quot;, in the epics and ancient literature of Hinduism, is seen as achievable by the same techniques necessary to practice &quot;dharma&quot;. Self-discipline is the path to &quot;dharma&quot;, &quot;moksha&quot; is self-discipline that is so perfect that it becomes unconscious, second nature. &quot;Dharma&quot; is thus a means to &quot;moksha&quot;.

The Samkhya school of Hinduism, for example, suggests that one of the paths to &quot;moksha&quot; is to magnify one&#x27;s &quot;sattvam&quot;. To magnify one&#x27;s &quot;sattvam&quot;, one must develop oneself where one&#x27;s &quot;sattvam&quot; becomes one&#x27;s instinctive nature. Many schools of Hinduism thus understood &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; as two points of a single journey of life, a journey for which the &quot;viaticum&quot; was discipline and self-training. Over time, these ideas about &quot;moksha&quot; were challenged.

==== Nagarjuna&#x27;s challenge ====

&quot;Dharma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot;, suggested Nagarjuna in the 2nd century, cannot be goals on the same journey. He pointed to the differences between the world we live in, and the freedom implied in the concept of &quot;moksha&quot;. They are so different that &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; could not be intellectually related. &quot;Dharma&quot; requires worldly thought, &quot;moksha&quot; is unworldly understanding, a state of bliss. &quot;How can the worldly thought-process lead to unworldly understanding?&quot;, asked Nagarjuna. Karl Potter explains the answer to this challenge as one of context and framework, the emergence of broader general principles of understanding from thought processes that are limited in one framework.

==== Adi Shankara&#x27;s challenge ====

Adi Shankara in the 8th century AD, like Nagarjuna earlier, examined the difference between the world one lives in and &quot;moksha&quot;, a state of freedom and release one hopes for. Unlike Nagarjuna, Shankara considers the characteristics between the two. The world one lives in requires action as well as thought; our world, he suggests, is impossible without &quot;vyavahara&quot; (action and plurality). The world is interconnected, one object works on another, input is transformed into output, change is continuous and everywhere. &quot;Moksha&quot;, suggests Shankara, is a final perfect, blissful state where there can be no change, where there can be no plurality of states. It has to be a state of thought and consciousness that excludes action. He questioned: &quot;How can action-oriented techniques by which we attain the first three goals of man (&quot;kama&quot;, &quot;artha&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot;) be useful to attain the last goal, namely &quot;moksha&quot;?&quot;

Scholars suggest Shankara&#x27;s challenge to the concept of &quot;moksha&quot; parallels those of Plotinus against the Gnostics, with one important difference: Plotinus accused the Gnostics of exchanging an anthropocentric set of virtues with a theocentric set in pursuit of salvation; Shankara challenged that the concept of &quot;moksha&quot; implied an exchange of anthropocentric set of virtues (&quot;dharma&quot;) with a blissful state that has no need for values. Shankara goes on to suggest that anthropocentric virtues suffice.

==== The Vaisnavas&#x27; challenge ====

Vaishnavism, one of the &quot;bhakti&quot; schools of Hinduism, is devoted to the worship of God, sings his name, anoints his image or idol, and has many sub-schools. Vaishnavas (followers of Vaishnavism) suggest that &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; cannot be two different or sequential goals or states of life.
Instead, they suggest God should be kept in mind constantly to simultaneously achieve &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot;, so constantly that one comes to feel one cannot live without God&#x27;s loving presence. This school emphasized love and adoration of God as the path to &quot;moksha&quot; (salvation and release), rather than works and knowledge. Their focus became divine virtues, rather than anthropocentric virtues. Daniel Ingalls regards Vaishnavas&#x27; position on &quot;moksha&quot; as similar to the Christian position on salvation, and Vaishnavism as the school whose views on &quot;dharma&quot;, &quot;karma&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot; dominated the initial impressions and colonial-era literature on Hinduism, through the works of Thibaut, Max Müller and others.

== History ==

The concept of &quot;moksha&quot; appears much later in ancient Indian literature than the concept of &quot;dharma&quot;. The proto-concept that first appears in the ancient Sanskrit verses and early Upanishads is &quot;mucyate&quot;, which means &quot;freed&quot; or &quot;released&quot;. In the middle and later Upanishads, such as the Svetasvatara and Maitri, the word &quot;moksha&quot; appears and begins becoming an important concept.

The Katha Upanishad, a middle Upanishadic-era script dated to the second half of the first millennium BCE, is among the earliest expositions about &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot;. In Book I, Section III, the legend of boy Nachiketa queries Yama, the lord of death to explain what causes &quot;saṃsāra&quot; and what leads to liberation. Naciketa inquires: what causes sorrow? Yama explains that suffering and &quot;saṃsāra&quot; results from a life that is lived absent-mindedly, with impurity, with neither the use of intelligence nor self-examination, where neither mind nor senses are guided by one&#x27;s &quot;atma&quot; (soul, self). Liberation comes from a life lived with inner purity, alert mind, led by &quot;buddhi&quot; (reason, intelligence), realization of the Supreme Self (&quot;purusha&quot;) who dwells in all beings. Kathaka Upanishad asserts knowledge liberates, knowledge is freedom. Kathaka Upanishad also explains the role of yoga in personal liberation, &quot;moksha&quot;.

The Svetasvatara Upanishad, another middle-era Upanishad written after &quot;Kathaka Upanishad&quot;, begins with questions such as why is man born? what is the primal cause behind the universe? what causes joy and sorrow in life? It then examines the various theories, that were then existing, about saṃsāra and release from bondage. Svetasvatara claims that bondage results from ignorance, illusion or delusion; deliverance comes from knowledge. The Supreme Being dwells in every being, he is the primal cause, he is the eternal law, he is the essence of everything, he is nature, he is not a separate entity. Liberation comes to those who know Supreme Being is present as the Universal Spirit and Principle, just as they know butter is present in milk. Such realization, claims Svetasvatara, come from self-knowledge and self-discipline; and this knowledge and realization is liberation from transmigration, the final goal of the Upanishad.
Starting with the middle Upanishad era, &quot;moksha&quot; – or equivalent terms such as &quot;mukti&quot; and &quot;kaivalya&quot; – is a major theme in many Upanishads. For example, Sarasvati Rahasya Upanishad, one of several Upanishads of the bhakti school of Hinduism, starts out with prayers to Goddess Sarasvati. She is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, learning and creative arts; her name is a compound word of &quot;sara&quot; and &quot;sva&quot;, meaning &quot;essence of self&quot;. After the prayer verses, the Upanishad inquires about the secret to freedom and liberation (mukti). Sarasvati&#x27;s reply in the Upanishad is:

=== Evolution of the concept ===

The concept of &quot;moksha&quot;, according to Daniel Ingalls, represented one of the many expansions in Hindu Vedic ideas of life and the afterlife. In the Vedas, there were three stages of life: studentship, householdship and retirement. During the Upanishadic era, Hinduism expanded this to include a fourth stage of life: complete abandonment. In Vedic literature, there are three modes of experience: waking, dream and deep sleep. The Upanishadic era expanded these modes to include &quot;turiyam&quot; – the stage beyond deep sleep. The Vedas suggest three goals of man: kama, artha and dharma. To these, the Upanishadic era added &quot;moksha&quot;.

The acceptance of the concept of &quot;moksha&quot; in some schools of Hindu philosophy was slow. These refused to recognize &quot;moksha&quot; for centuries, considering it irrelevant. The Mimamsa school, for example, denied the goal and relevance of &quot;moksha&quot; well into the 8th century AD, until the arrival of a Mimamsa scholar named Kumarila. Instead of &quot;moksha&quot;, the Mimamsa school of Hinduism considered the concept of heaven as sufficient to answer the question: what lay beyond this world after death. Other schools of Hinduism, over time, accepted the &quot;moksha&quot; concept and refined it over time.

It is unclear when the core ideas of samsara and &quot;moksha&quot; developed in ancient India. Patrick Olivelle suggests these ideas likely originated with new religious movements in the first millennium BCE. The concepts of &quot;mukti&quot; and &quot;moksha&quot;, suggests J. A. B. van Buitenen, seem traceable to yogis in Hinduism, with long hair, who chose to live on the fringes of society, given to self-induced states of intoxication and ecstasy, possibly accepted as medicine-men and &quot;sadhus&quot; by ancient Indian society. &quot;Moksha&quot; to these early concept-developers, was the abandonment of the established order, not in favor of anarchy, but in favor of self-realization, to achieve release from this world.

In its historical development, the concept of &quot;moksha&quot; appears in three forms: Vedic, yogic and bhakti.

In the Vedic period, &quot;moksha&quot; was ritualistic. Mokṣa was claimed to result from properly completed rituals such as those before &quot;Agni&quot; – the fire deity. The significance of these rituals was to reproduce and recite the cosmic-creation event described in the Vedas; the description of knowledge on different levels – &quot;adhilokam&quot;, &quot;adhibhutam&quot;, &quot;adhiyajnam&quot;, &quot;adhyatmam&quot; – helped the individual transcend to moksa. Knowledge was the means, the ritual its application.

By the middle to late Upanishadic period, the emphasis shifted to knowledge, and ritual activities were considered irrelevant to the attainment of &quot;moksha&quot;. Yogic &quot;moksha&quot; replaced Vedic rituals with personal development and meditation, with hierarchical creation of the ultimate knowledge in self as the path to &quot;moksha&quot;. Yogic &quot;moksha&quot; principles were accepted in many other schools of Hinduism, albeit with differences. For example, Adi Shankara in his book on &quot;moksha&quot; suggests:

Bhakti &quot;moksha&quot; created the third historical path, where neither rituals nor meditative self-development were the way, rather it was inspired by constant love and contemplation of God, which over time results in a perfect union with God. Some Bhakti schools evolved their ideas where God became the means and the end, transcending &quot;moksha&quot;; the fruit of bhakti is bhakti itself. In the history of Indian religious traditions, additional ideas and paths to &quot;moksha&quot; beyond these three, appeared over time.

==Synonyms==

The words &quot;moksha&quot;, nirvana (&quot;nibbana&quot;) and kaivalya are sometimes used synonymously, because they all refer to the state that liberates a person from all causes of sorrow and suffering. However, in modern era literature, these concepts have different premises in different religions. Nirvana, a concept common in Buddhism, is accompanied by the realization that all experienced phenomena are not self; while &quot;moksha&quot;, a concept common in many schools of Hinduism, is acceptance of Self (soul), realization of liberating knowledge, the consciousness of Oneness with Brahman, all existence and understanding the whole universe as the Self. Nirvana starts with the premise that there is no Self, &quot;moksha&quot; on the other hand, starts with the premise that everything is the Self; there is no consciousness in the state of nirvana, but everything is One unified consciousness in the state of &quot;moksha&quot;.

Kaivalya, a concept akin to &quot;moksha&quot;, rather than nirvana, is found in some schools of Hinduism such as the Yoga school. Kaivalya is the realization of aloofness with liberating knowledge of one&#x27;s self and disentanglement from the muddled mind and cognitive apparatus. For example, Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutra suggests:

Nirvana and &quot;moksha&quot;, in all traditions, represent resting in one&#x27;s true essence, named &quot;Purusha&quot; or Atman, or pointed at as Nirvana, but described in a very different way. Some scholars, states Jayatilleke, assert that the Nirvana of Buddhism is same as the Brahman in Hinduism, a view other scholars and he disagree with. Buddhism rejects the idea of Brahman, and the metaphysical ideas about soul (atman) are also rejected by Buddhism, while those ideas are essential to &quot;moksha&quot; in Hinduism. In Buddhism, nirvana is &#x27;blowing out&#x27; or &#x27;extinction&#x27;. In Hinduism, &quot;moksha&quot; is &#x27;identity or oneness with Brahman&#x27;. Realization of &quot;anatta&quot; (anatman) is essential to Buddhist nirvana. Realization of &quot;atman&quot; (atta) is essential to Hindu &quot;moksha&quot;.

== Hinduism ==

Ancient literature of different schools of Hinduism sometimes use different phrases for &quot;moksha&quot;. For example, &quot;Keval jnana&quot; or &quot;kaivalya&quot; (&quot;state of Absolute&quot;), &quot;Apavarga&quot;, &quot;Nihsreyasa&quot;, &quot;Paramapada&quot;, &quot;Brahmabhava&quot;, &quot;Brahmajnana&quot; and &quot;Brahmi sthiti&quot;. Modern literature additionally uses the Buddhist term nirvana interchangeably with &quot;moksha&quot; of Hinduism. There is difference between these ideas, as explained elsewhere in this article, but they are all soteriological concepts of various Indian religious traditions.

The six major orthodox schools of Hinduism have had a historic debate, and disagree over whether &quot;moksha&quot; can be achieved in this life, or only after this life. Many of the 108 Upanishads discuss amongst other things &quot;moksha&quot;. These discussions show the differences between the schools of Hinduism, a lack of consensus, with a few attempting to conflate the contrasting perspectives between various schools. For example, freedom and deliverance from birth-rebirth, argues Maitrayana Upanishad, comes neither from the Vedanta school&#x27;s doctrine (the knowledge of one&#x27;s own Self as the Supreme Soul) nor from the Samkhya school&#x27;s doctrine (distinction of the Purusha from what one is not), but from Vedic studies, observance of the &quot;Svadharma&quot; (personal duties), sticking to &quot;Asramas&quot; (stages of life).

The six major orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy offer the following views on &quot;moksha&quot;, each for their own reasons: the Nyaya, Vaisesika and Mimamsa schools of Hinduism consider &quot;moksha&quot; as possible only after death. Samkhya and Yoga schools consider &quot;moksha&quot; as possible in this life. In the Vedanta school, the Advaita sub-school concludes &quot;moksha&quot; is possible in this life, while Dvaita, Visistadvaita, Shuddhadvait sub-schools of Vedanta tradition believes that &quot;moksha&quot; is a continuous event, one assisted by loving devotion to God, that extends from this life to post-mortem. Beyond these six orthodox schools, some heterodox schools of Hindu tradition, such as Carvaka, deny there is a soul or after life &quot;moksha&quot;.

The Nyaya school does not take &quot;moksha&quot; to be a state of bliss, but only a complete absence of suffering.

=== Sāmkhya and Yoga ===

Both Sāmkhya and Yoga systems of religious thought are &quot;mokshaśāstras&quot;, suggests Knut Jacobsen, they are systems of salvific liberation and release. Sāmkhya is a system of interpretation, primarily a theory about the world. Yoga is both a theory and a practice. Yoga gained wide acceptance in ancient India, its ideas and practices became part of many religious schools in Hinduism, including those that were very different from Sāmkhya. The eight limbs of yoga can be interpreted as a way to liberation (&quot;moksha&quot;).

In Sāmkhya literature, liberation is commonly referred to as &quot;kaivalya&quot;. In this school, kaivalya means the realization of &quot;purusa&quot;, the principle of consciousness, as independent from mind and body, as different from &quot;prakrti&quot;. Like many schools of Hinduism, in Sāmkhya and Yoga schools, the emphasis is on the attainment of knowledge, &quot;vidyā&quot; or &quot;jñāna&quot;, as necessary for salvific liberation, &quot;moksha&quot;. Yoga&#x27;s purpose is then seen as a means to remove the &quot;avidyā&quot; – that is, ignorance or misleading/incorrect knowledge about one self and the universe. It seeks to end ordinary reflexive awareness (&quot;cittavrtti nirodhah&quot;) with deeper, purer and holistic awareness (&quot;asamprājñāta samādhi&quot;). Yoga, during the pursuit of &quot;moksha&quot;, encourages practice (&quot;abhyāsa&quot;) with detachment (&quot;vairāgya&quot;), which over time leads to deep concentration (&quot;samādhi&quot;). Detachment means withdrawal from outer world and calming of mind, while practice means the application of effort over time. Such steps are claimed by Yoga school as leading to samādhi, a state of deep awareness, release and bliss called &quot;kaivalya&quot;.
Yoga, or &quot;mārga&quot; (meaning &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;), in Hinduism is widely classified into four spiritual approaches. The first mārga is Jñāna Yoga, the way of knowledge. The second mārga is Bhakti Yoga, the way of loving devotion to God. The third mārga is Karma Yoga, the way of works. The fourth mārga is Rāja Yoga, the way of contemplation and meditation. These mārgas are part of different schools in Hinduism, and their definition and methods to &quot;moksha&quot;. For example, the Advaita Vedanta school relies on Jñāna Yoga in its teachings of &quot;moksha&quot;. The &quot;marga&quot;s need not lead to all forms of moksha, according to some schools of Hinduism. For example, the Ekasarana dharma denies the &quot;sayujya&quot; form of mukti, where the complete absorption in God deprives &quot;jiva&quot; of the sweetness and bliss associated with &quot;bhakti&quot;. Madhavadeva begins the Namghoxa by declaring his admiration for devotees who do not prefer &quot;mukti&quot;.

=== Vedanta ===

The three main sub-schools in Vedanta school of Hinduism – Advaita Vedanta, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita – each have their own views about &quot;moksha&quot;.

==== Advaita Vedanta ====
The Vedantic school of Hinduism suggests the first step towards mokṣa begins with &quot;mumuksutva&quot;, that is desire of liberation. This takes the form of questions about self, what is true, why do things or events make us happy or cause suffering, and so on. This longing for liberating knowledge is assisted by, claims Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta, a guru (teacher), study of historical knowledge and viveka (critical thinking). This is because a guru can help one develop knowledge of maya (the illusionary nature of the world), a critical step on the path to moksha. Shankara cautions that the guru and historic knowledge may be distorted, so traditions and historical assumptions must be questioned by the individual seeking &quot;moksha&quot;. Those who are on their path to &quot;moksha&quot; (samnyasin), suggests Klaus Klostermaier, are quintessentially free individuals, without craving for anything in the worldly life, thus are neither dominated by, nor dominating anyone else.

Vivekachudamani, which literally means &quot;Crown Jewel of Discriminatory Reasoning&quot;, is a book devoted to moksa in Advaita Vedanta philosophy. It explains what behaviors and pursuits lead to &quot;moksha&quot;, as well what actions and assumptions hinder &quot;moksha&quot;. The four essential conditions, according to Vivekachudamani, before one can commence on the path of &quot;moksha&quot; include (1) &quot;vivekah&quot; (discrimination, critical reasoning) between everlasting principles and fleeting world; (2) &quot;viragah&quot; (indifference, lack of craving) for material rewards; (3) &quot;samah&quot; (calmness of mind), and (4) &quot;damah&quot; (self restraint, temperance). The &quot;Brahmasutrabhasya&quot; adds to the above four requirements, the following: &quot;uparati&quot; (lack of bias, dispassion), &quot;titiksa&quot; (endurance, patience), &quot;sraddha&quot; (faith) and &quot;samadhana&quot; (intentness, commitment).

The Advaita tradition considers &quot;moksha&quot; achievable by removing avidya (ignorance) by knowledge. &quot;Moksha&quot; is seen as a final release from illusion, and through knowledge (&quot;anubhava&quot;) of one&#x27;s own fundamental nature, which is Satcitananda. Advaita holds there is no being/non-being distinction between &quot;Atman&quot;, &quot;Brahman&quot;, and &quot;Paramatman&quot;. True knowledge is a direct, permanent realization that the Atman and Brahman are one. This realization instantly removes ignorance and leads to &quot;moksha&quot;, and is considered timeless, eliminating the cycle of birth and death (&quot;samsara&quot;). Advaita Vedanta emphasizes Jnana Yoga as the means of achieving &quot;moksha&quot;. Bliss, claims this school, is the fruit of knowledge (vidya) and work (karma).

==== Dvaita ====
The Dvaita (dualism) traditions define &quot;moksha&quot; as the loving, eternal union with God and considered the highest perfection of existence. Dvaita schools suggest every soul encounters liberation differently. Dualist traditions (e.g. Vaishnava) see God as the object of love, for example, a personified monotheistic conception of Shiva, Vishnu or Adishakti. By immersing oneself in the love of God, one&#x27;s karmas slough off, one&#x27;s illusions decay, and truth is lived. Both the worshiped and worshiper gradually lose their illusory sense of separation and only One beyond all names remains. This is salvation to dualist schools of Hinduism. Dvaita Vedanta emphasizes Bhakti Yoga as the means of achieving &quot;moksha&quot;.

==== Vishishtadvaita ====
The Vishistadvaita tradition, led by Ramanuja, defines avidya and &quot;moksha&quot; differently from the Advaita tradition. To Ramanuja, avidya is a focus on the self, and vidya is a focus on a loving god. The Vishistadvaita school argues that other schools of Hinduism create a false sense of agency in individuals, which makes the individual think oneself as potential or self-realized god. Such ideas, claims Ramanuja, decay to materialism, hedonism and self worship. Individuals forget &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God). Mukti, to Vishistadvaita school, is release from such avidya, towards the intuition and eternal union with God.

=== Mokṣha in this life ===

Among the Samkhya, Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, liberation and freedom reached within one&#x27;s life is referred to as &quot;jivanmukti&quot;, and the individual who has experienced this state is called &quot;jivanmukta&quot; (self-realized person). Dozens of Upanishads, including those from middle Upanishadic period, mention or describe the state of liberation, &quot;jivanmukti&quot;. Some contrast &quot;jivanmukti&quot; with &quot;videhamukti&quot; (&quot;moksha&quot; from samsara after death). Jivanmukti is a state that transforms the nature, attributes and behaviors of an individual, claim these ancient texts of Hindu philosophy. For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the liberated individual shows attributes such as:
* He is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him;
* When confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words;
* Even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth;
* He does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others;
* He never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;
* He is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others;
* He is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city);
* He doesn&#x27;t care about or wear ṣikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters;
* For him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge of Self;
* He is humble, high-spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words.

When a Jivanmukta dies he achieves Paramukti and becomes a Paramukta. Jivanmukta experience liberation while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences liberation only after death.

=== Mokṣa in Balinese Hinduism ===

Balinese Hinduism incorporates &quot;moksha&quot; as one of five tattvas. The other four are: &quot;brahman&quot; (the one supreme god head, not to be confused with Brahmin), &quot;atma&quot; (soul or spirit), karma (actions and reciprocity, causality), &quot;samsara&quot; (principle of rebirth, reincarnation). &quot;Moksha&quot;, in Balinese Hindu belief, is the possibility of unity with the divine; it is sometimes referred to as nirwana.

== Buddhism ==

In Buddhism the term &quot;moksha&quot; is uncommon, but an equivalent term is &quot;vimutti&quot;, &quot;release&quot;. In the suttas two forms of release are mentioned, namely &quot;ceto-vimutti&quot;, &quot;deliverance of mind,&quot; and &quot;panna-vimutti&quot;, &quot;deliverance through wisdom&quot; (insight). &quot;Ceto-vimutti&quot; is related to the practice of dhyana, while &quot;panna-vimutti&quot; is related to the development of insight. According to Gombrich, the distinction may be a later development, which resulted in a change of doctrine, regarding the practice of dhyana to be insufficient for final liberation.

With release comes Nirvana (Pali: Nibbana), &quot;blowing out&quot;, &quot;quenching&quot;, or &quot;becoming extinguished&quot; of the fires of the passions and of self-view. It is a &quot;timeless state&quot; in which there is no more becoming.

Nirvana ends the cycle of &quot;Dukkha&quot; and rebirth in the six realms of Saṃsāra (Buddhism). It is part of the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism, which plays an essential role in Theravada Buddhism. Nirvana has been described in Buddhist texts in a manner similar to other Indian religions, as the state of complete liberation, &quot;nirvana&quot;, highest happiness, bliss, fearless, freedom, dukkha-less, permanence, non-dependent origination, unfathomable, indescribable. It has also been described as a state of release marked by &quot;emptiness&quot; and realization of &quot;non-Self&quot;. Such descriptions, states Peter Harvey, are contested by scholars because nirvana in Buddhism is ultimately described as a state of &quot;stopped consciousness (blown out), but one that is not non-existent&quot;, and &quot;it seems impossible to imagine what awareness devoid of any object would be like&quot;.

== Jainism ==
In Jainism, &quot;moksha&quot; and &quot;nirvana&quot; are one and the same. Jaina texts sometimes use the term &quot;Kevalya&quot;, and call the liberated soul as &quot;Kevalin&quot;. As with all Indian religions, &quot;moksha&quot; is the ultimate spiritual goal in Jainism. It defines &quot;moksha&quot; as the spiritual release from all karma.

Jainism is a Sramanic non-theistic philosophy that believes in a metaphysical permanent self or soul often termed &quot;jiva&quot;. Jaina believe that this soul is what transmigrates from one being to another at the time of death. The &quot;moksa&quot; state is attained when a soul (&quot;atman&quot;) is liberated from the cycles of deaths and rebirths (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;), is at the apex, is omniscient, remains there eternally, and is known as a &quot;siddha&quot;. In Jainism, it is believed to be a stage beyond ethical perfection, states Paul Dundas, because they can perform physical and mental activities such as teach, without accruing karma that leads to rebirth.

Jaina traditions believe that there exist &quot;Abhavya&quot; (incapable), or a class of souls that can never attain &quot;moksha&quot; (liberation). The &quot;Abhavya&quot; state of soul is entered after an intentional and shockingly evil act, but Jaina texts also polemically applied &quot;Abhavya&quot; condition to those who belonged to a competing ancient Indian tradition called &quot;Ājīvika&quot;. A male human being is considered closest to the apex of &quot;moksha&quot;, with the potential to achieve liberation, particularly through asceticism. The ability of women to attain &quot;moksha&quot; has been historically debated, and the subtraditions with Jainism have disagreed. In the Digambara tradition of Jainism, women must live an ethical life and gain karmic merit to be reborn as a man, because only males can achieve spiritual liberation. In contrast, the Śvētāmbara tradition has believed that women too can attain &quot;moksha&quot; just like men.

According to Jainism, purification of soul and liberation can be achieved through the path of three jewels: &quot;Samyak darśana&quot; (Correct View), meaning faith, acceptance of the truth of soul (&quot;jīva&quot;); &quot;Samyak jnana&quot; (Correct Knowledge), meaning undoubting knowledge of the &quot;tattvas&quot;; and &quot;Samyak charitra&quot; (Correct Conduct), meaning behavior consistent with the Five vows. Jain texts often add &quot;samyak tap&quot; (Correct Asceticism) as a fourth jewel, emphasizing belief in ascetic practices as the means to liberation (moksha). The four jewels are called &quot;moksha marg&quot;. According to Jain texts, the liberated pure soul (&quot;Siddha&quot;) goes up to the summit of universe (&quot;Siddhashila&quot;) and dwells there in eternal bliss.

== Sikhism ==

The Sikh concept of mukti (Gurmukhi: ਮੁਕਤੀ) is similar to other Indian religions, and refers to spiritual liberation. It is described in Sikhism as the state that breaks the cycle of rebirths. Mukti is obtained according to Sikhism, states Singha, through &quot;God&#x27;s grace&quot;. According to the Guru Granth Sahib, the devotion to God is viewed as more important than the desire for &quot;Mukti&quot;.

Sikhism recommends Naam Simran as the way to mukti, which is meditating and repeating the &quot;Naam&quot; (Name of God).

<doc id="175923" wikidata="Q301585" url="?curid=175923" title="Religious persecution">
<text>Religious persecution is the systematic oppression of an individual or a group of individuals as a response to their religious beliefs or affiliations or their lack thereof. The tendency of societies or groups within societies to alienate or repress different subcultures is a recurrent theme in human history. Moreover, because a person&#x27;s religion frequently determines his or her sense of morality, worldview, self-image, attitudes towards others, and overall personal identity to a significant extent, religious differences can be significant cultural, personal, and social factors.

Religious persecution may be triggered by religious or antireligious stances (when members of a dominant group denigrate religions other than their own or religion itself where the irreligious are the dominant group) or it may be triggered by the state when it views a particular religious group as a threat to its interests or security. At a societal level, the dehumanization of a particular religious group may readily lead to acts of violence or other forms of persecution. Religious persecution may be the result of societal and/or governmental regulation. Governmental regulation refers to the laws which the government imposes in order to regulate a religion, and societal regulation is discrimination against citizens because they adhere to one or more religions. In many countries, religious persecution has resulted in so much violence that it is considered a human rights problem.

==Definition==
David T. Smith, in &quot;Religious Persecution and Political Order in the United States&quot;, defines religious persecution as &quot;violence or discrimination against members of a religious minority because of their religious affiliation,&quot; referring to &quot;actions that are intended to deprive individuals of their political rights and force minorities to assimilate, leave, or live as second-class citizens. In the aspect of a state&#x27;s policy, it may be defined as violations of freedom of thought, conscience and belief which are spread in accordance with a systematic and active state policy which encourages actions such as harassment, intimidation and the imposition of punishments in order to infringe or threaten the targeted minority&#x27;s right to life, integrity or liberty. The distinction between religious persecution and religious intolerance lies in the fact that in most cases, the latter is motivated by the sentiment of the population, which may be tolerated or encouraged by the state. The denial of people&#x27;s civil rights on the basis of their religion is most frequently described as religious discrimination, rather than religious persecution.

Examples of persecution include the confiscation or destruction of property, incitement of hatred, arrests, imprisonment, beatings, torture, murder, and executions. Religious persecution can be considered the opposite of freedom of religion.

Bateman has differentiated different degrees of persecution. &quot;It must be personally costly... It must be unjust and undeserved... it must be a direct result of one&#x27;s faith.&quot;

From a sociological perspective, the identity formation of strong social groups such as those which are generated by nationalism, ethnicity, or religion, is a causal aspect of practices of persecution. says that it is these communities, which can be a majority or a minority, that generate violence. Since the development of identity involves &#x27;what we are not&#x27; as much as &#x27;what we are&#x27;, there are grounds for the fear that tolerance of &#x27;what we are not&#x27; can contribute to the erosion of identity. Brian J. Grim and Roger Finke say that the perception that plurality is dangerous leads to religious persecution. Both the state and any dominant religion, share the concern that to &quot;leave religion unchecked and without adequate controls will result in the uprising of religions that are dangerous to both state and citizenry,&quot; and this concern gives both the dominant religion and the state motives for restricting religious activity. Grim and Finke say it is specifically this religious regulation that leads to religious persecution. R.I. Moore says that persecution during the Middle Ages &quot;provides a striking illustration of the classic deviance theory, [which is based on identity formation], as it was propounded by the father of sociology, Émile Durkheim&quot;. Persecution is also, often, part of a larger conflict involving emerging states as well as established states in the process of redefining their national identity.

James L.Gibson adds that the greater the attitudes of loyalty and solidarity to the group identity, and the more the benefits to belonging there are perceived to be, the more likely a social identity will become intolerant of challenges. Combining a strong social identity with the state, increases the benefits, therefore it is likely persecution from that social group will increase. Legal restriction from the state relies on social cooperation, so the state in its turn must protect the social group that supports it, increasing the likelihood of persecution from the state as well. Grim and Finke say their studies indicate that the higher the degree of religious freedom, the lower the degree of violent religious persecution. &quot;When religious freedoms are denied through the regulation of religious profession or practice, violent religious persecution and conflict increase.&quot;

Perez Zagorin writes &quot;According to some philosophers, tolerance is a moral virtue; if this is the case, it would follow that intolerance is a vice. But virtue and vice are qualities solely of individuals, and intolerance and persecution [in the Christian Middle Ages] were social and collective phenomena sanctioned by society and hardly questioned by anyone. Religious intolerance and persecution, therefore, were not seen as vices, but as necessary and salutary for the preservation of religious truth and orthodoxy and all that was seen to depend upon them.&quot; This view of persecution is not limited to the Middle Ages. As Christian R. Raschle and Jitse H. F. Dijkstra, say: &quot;Religious violence is a complex phenomenon that exists in all places and times.&quot;

In the ancient societies of Egypt, Greece and Rome, torture was an accepted aspect of the legal system. Gillian Clark says violence was taken for granted in the fourth century as part of both war and punishment; torture from the &quot;carnifex,&quot; the professional torturer of the Roman legal system, was an accepted part of that system. Except for a few rare exceptions, such as the Persian empire under Cyrus and Darius, Denis Lacorne says that examples of religious tolerance in ancient societies, &quot;from ancient Greece to the Roman empire, medieval Spain to the Ottoman Empire and the Venetian Republic&quot;, are not examples of tolerance in the modern sense of the term.

The sociological view regards religious intolerance and persecution as largely social processes that are determined more by the context within which the social community exists than anything else. When governments ensure equal freedom for all, there is less persecution.

== Statistics ==
Statistics from Pew Research Center show that Christianity and Islam are persecuted in more countries around the world than other religions, and that Jews and Muslims are &quot;most likely to live in countries where their groups experience harassment&quot;. As of 2018, Christians face harassment in 145 countries, Muslims face harassment in 139 countries, and Jews face harassment in 88 countries. Respectively: Christians account for 31% of the world&#x27;s population, Muslims account for 24%, and Jews account for 0.2%. According to a 2019 report, government restrictions and social hostilities toward religion have risen in 187 countries.

==Forms==

===Religious cleansing===

&quot;Religious cleansing&quot; is sometimes used in reference to the removal of a population from a certain territory based on its religion. More recently, “religious cleansing” has been used in reference to the elimination of all religious structures or all individuals who adhere to a particular religion and live within a larger community which is composed of people who are members of the same ethnicity.

Throughout antiquity, population cleansing was largely motivated by economic and political factors, but occasionally, ethnic factors also played a role. During the Middle Ages, population cleansing took on a largely religious character. The religious motivation for population cleansing lost much of its salience early in the modern era, but until the 18th century, ethnic enmity in Europe continued to be couched in religious terms. Richard Dawkins has argued that references to &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq are euphemisms for what should more accurately be called religious cleansing. According to Adrian Koopman, the widespread use of the term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; in such cases suggests that in many situations, there is confusion between ethnicity and religion.

===Ethnicity===

Other acts of violence which are not always committed against adherents of particular religions such as war, torture, and ethnic cleansing, may take on the qualities of religious persecution when one or more of the parties which are involved in them are characterized by their religious homogeneity; an example of this occurs when conflicting populations that belong to different ethnic groups also belong to different religions or denominations. The difference between religious and ethnic identity might sometimes be obscure (see Ethnoreligious); nevertheless, cases of genocide in the 20th century cannot be fully-explained by the citation of religious differences. Still, cases of genocide such as the Greek genocide, the Armenian genocide, and the Assyrian genocide are sometimes seen as cases of religious persecution and as a result, the lines between ethnic violence and religious violence are sometimes blurry.

Since the Early modern period, an increasing number of religious cleansings were entwined with ethnic elements. Since religion is an important or a central marker of ethnic identity, some conflicts can best be described as &quot;ethno-religious conflicts&quot;.

Nazi antisemitism provides another example of the contentious divide between ethnic persecution and religious persecution, because Nazi propaganda tended to construct its image of Jews by portraying them as people who were members of an inferior race (see Racial antisemitism and Nazi racial theories), it dehumanized and demonized Jews by classifying them as a race rather than a religion. In keeping with what they were taught in Nazi propaganda, the perpetrators of the Holocaust made no distinction between secular Jews, atheistic Jews, orthodox Jews and Jews who had converted to Christianity.

==Persecution for heresy and blasphemy==
The persecution of beliefs that are deemed schismatic is one thing; the persecution of beliefs that are deemed heretical or blasphemous is another. Although a public disagreement on secondary matters might be serious enough, frequently, it has only led to religious discrimination. On the other hand, the public renunciation of the core elements of a religious doctrine under the same circumstances would have put one in far greater danger. While dissenters from the official Church only faced fines and imprisonment in Protestant England, six people were executed for heresy or blasphemy during the reign of Elizabeth I, and two other people were executed in 1612 during the reign of James I.

Similarly, heretical sects like Cathars, Waldensians and Lollards were brutally suppressed in Western Europe, but in the borderlands of Eastern Europe, at the same time, Catholic Christians and &#x27;schismatic&#x27; Orthodox Christians lived side by side after the East-West Schism.

==Persecution for political reasons==
More than 300 Roman Catholics were put to death for treason by English governments between 1535 and 1681, thus they were officially executed for secular rather than religious offenses. In 1570, Pope Pius V issued his papal bull &quot;Regnans in Excelsis&quot;, which absolved Catholics from their obligations to the government. This dramatically worsened the persecution of Catholics in England. The 1584 Parliament of England, declared in &quot;An Act against Jesuits, seminary priests, and such other like disobedient persons&quot; that the purpose of all Catholic missionaries who had come to Britain was &quot;to stir up and move sedition, rebellion and open hostility&quot;. Consequently, even strictly apolitical priests like Saint John Ogilvie, Dermot O&#x27;Hurley, and Robert Southwell were subjected to torture and execution, as were members of the laity like Sts. Margaret Clitherow and Richard Gwyn. This drastically contrasts with the image of the Elizabethan era as a golden age, but compared to the antecedent Marian Persecutions there is an important difference to consider. Queen Mary was motivated by determination to exterminate Protestantism from all her Kingdoms and to restore the independence of the English Church from control by the state. During her short reign from 1553 to 1558, about 290 Protestants were burned at the stake. While Mary&#x27;s sister Queen Elizabeth I allegedly, &quot;acted out of fear for the security of her realm&quot;, she sought to coerce both Catholics and Protestants to embrace a national church that was completely subservient to the state.

Over the centuries that followed, English governments continued to fear and prosecute both real and imaginary conspiracies like the Popish Plot, an alleged plan to assassinate King Charles II and massacre the Protestants of the British Isles. In reality, the plot was a fictitious concoction by Titus Oates and Whig politician Lord Shaftesbury. Before the falsity of their claims were exposed, however, at least 22 innocent clergy and laity, including Archbishop Oliver Plunkett, had been unjustly convicted of high treason and executed at Tyburn.

==By location==
The descriptive use of the term religious persecution is rather difficult. Religious persecution has occurred in different historical, geographical and social contexts since at least antiquity. Until the 18th century, some groups were nearly universally persecuted for their religious views, such as atheists, Jews and Zoroastrians.

===Roman Empire===
Early Christianity also came into conflict with the Roman Empire, and it may have been more threatening to the established polytheistic order than Judaism had been, because of the importance of evangelism in Christianity. Under Nero, the Jewish exemption from the requirement to participate in public cults was lifted and Rome began to actively persecute monotheists. This persecution ended in 313 AD with the Edict of Milan, and Christianity was made the official religion of the empire in 380 AD. By the eighth century, Christianity had attained a clear ascendancy across Europe and neighboring regions, and a period of consolidation began which was marked by the pursuit of heretics, heathens, Jews, Muslims, and various other religious groups.

===Europe===

====Religious uniformity in early modern Europe====
By contrast to the notion of civil tolerance in early modern Europe, the subjects were required to attend the state church; this attitude can be described as &quot;territoriality&quot; or &quot;religious uniformity&quot;, and its underlying assumption is brought to a point by a statement of the Anglican theologian Richard Hooker: &quot;There is not any man of the Church of England, but the same man is also a member of the [English] commonwealth; nor any man a member of the commonwealth, which is not also of the Church of England.&quot;

Before a vigorous debate about religious persecution took place in England (starting in the 1640s), for centuries in Europe, religion had been tied to territory. In England, there had been several Acts of Uniformity; in continental Europe, the Latin phrase &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot; had been coined in the 16th century and applied as a fundament for the Peace of Augsburg (1555). It was pushed to the extreme by absolutist regimes, particularly by the French kings Louis XIV and his successors. It was under their rule that Catholicism became the sole compulsory allowed religion in France and that the huguenots had to massively leave the country. Persecution meant that the state was committed to secure religious uniformity by coercive measures, as eminently obvious in a statement of Roger L&#x27;Estrange: &quot;That which you call persecution, I translate Uniformity&quot;.

However, in the 17th century, writers like Pierre Bayle, John Locke, Richard Overton and Roger William broke the link between territory and faith, which eventually resulted in a shift from territoriality to religious voluntarism. It was Locke who, in his Letter Concerning Toleration, defined the state in purely secular terms: &quot;The commonwealth seems to me to be a society of men constituted only for the procuring, preserving, and advancing their own civil interests.&quot; Concerning the church, he went on: &quot;A church, then, I take to be a voluntary society of men, joining themselves together of their own accord.&quot; With this treatise, John Locke laid one of the most important intellectual foundations of the separation of church and state, which ultimately led to the secular state.

===Early modern England===
One period of religious persecution which has been extensively studied is early modern England, since the rejection of religious persecution, now common in the Western world, originated there. The English &#x27;Call for Toleration&#x27; was a turning point in the Christian debate on persecution and toleration, and early modern England stands out to the historians as a place and time in which literally &quot;hundreds of books and tracts were published either for or against religious toleration.&quot;

The most ambitious chronicle of that time is W.K.Jordan&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;The Development of Religious Toleration in England, 1558–1660&quot; (four volumes, published 1932–1940). Jordan wrote as the threat of fascism rose in Europe, and this work is seen as a defense of the fragile values of humanism and tolerance. More recent introductions to this period are &quot;Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558–1689&quot; (2000) by John Coffey and &quot;Charitable hatred. Tolerance and intolerance in England, 1500–1700&quot; (2006) by Alexandra Walsham. To understand why religious persecution has occurred, historians like Coffey &quot;pay close attention to what the persecutors said they were doing.&quot;

====Ecclesiastical dissent and civil tolerance====
No religion is free from internal dissent, although the degree of dissent that is tolerated within a particular religious organization can strongly vary. This degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church is described as &quot;ecclesiastical tolerance&quot;, and is one form of religious toleration. However, when people nowadays speak of religious tolerance, they most often mean &quot;civil tolerance&quot;, which refers to the degree of religious diversity that is tolerated within the state.

In the absence of civil toleration, someone who finds himself in disagreement with his congregation does not have the option to leave and chose a different faith—simply because there is only one recognized faith in the country (at least officially). In modern western civil law any citizen may join and leave a religious organization at will; In western societies, this is taken for granted, but actually, this legal separation of Church and State only started to emerge a few centuries ago.

In the Christian debate on persecution and toleration, the notion of civil tolerance allowed Christian theologians to reconcile Jesus&#x27; commandment to love one&#x27;s enemies with other parts of the New Testament that are rather strict regarding dissent within the church. Before that, theologians like Joseph Hall had reasoned from the ecclesiastical intolerance of the early Christian church in the New Testament to the civil intolerance of the Christian state.

===Russia===
The Bishop of Vladimir Feodor turned some people into slaves, others were locked in prison, cut their heads, burnt eyes, cut tongues or crucified on walls. Some heretics were executed by burning them alive. According to an inscription of Khan Mengual-Temir, Metropolitan Kiril was granted the right to heavily punish with death for blasphemy against the Orthodox Church or breach of ecclesiastical privileges. He advised all means of destruction to be used against heretics, but without bloodshed, in the name of &#x27;saving souls&#x27;. Heretics were drowned. Novgorod Bishop Gennady Gonzov turned to Tsar Ivan III requesting the death of heretics. Gennady admired the Spanish inquisitors, especially his contemporary Torquemada, who for 15 years of inquisition activity burned and punished thousands of people. As in Rome, persecuted fled to depopulated areas. The most terrible punishment was considered an underground pit, where rats lived. Some people had been imprisoned and tied to the wall there, and untied after their death. Old Believers were persecuted and executed, the order was that even those renouncing completely their beliefs and baptized in the state church to be lynched without mercy. The writer Lomonosov opposed the religious teachings and by his initiative a scientific book against them was published. The book was destroyed, the Russian synod insisted Lomonosov&#x27;s works to be burned and requested his punishment.

==Contemporary==

Although his book was written before the September 11 attacks, John Coffey explicitly compares Islamophobia in the contemporary Western world to the English Whig Party&#x27;s paranoia about the fictitious Popish Plot. Mehdi Ghezali and Murat Kurnaz were among the Muslims who were imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but they were not found to have any connections to terrorism, because they had previously traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to pursue their religious interests.

The United States submits an annual report on religious freedom and persecution to the Congress. The report contains data which the United States collects from U.S. embassies around the world in collaboration with the Office of International Religious Freedom and other relevant U.S. government and non-governmental institutions. The data is available to the public. The 2018 study details, country by country, the violations of religious freedom taking place in approximately 75% of the 195 countries in the world. Between 2007 and 2017, the PEW organization found that &quot;Christians experienced harassment by governments or social groups in the largest number of countries&quot;—144 countries—but that it is almost equal to the number of countries (142) in which Muslims experience harassment. PEW has published a caution concerning the interpretation of these numbers: &quot;The Center&#x27;s recent report ... does not attempt to estimate the number of victims in each country... it does not speak to the intensity of harassment...&quot;

No religious group is free from harassment in the contemporary world. Klaus Wetzel, an expert on religious persecution for the German Bundestag, the House of Lords, the US House of Representatives, the European Parliament, and the International Institute for Religious Freedom, explains that &quot;In around a quarter of all countries in the world, the restrictions imposed by governments, or hostilities towards one or more religious groups, are &quot;high&quot; or &quot;very high&quot;. Some of the most populous countries in the world belong to this group, such as China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan. Therefore, around three quarters of the world&#x27;s population live in them.&quot;

At the symposium on law and religion in 2014, Michelle Mack said: &quot;Despite what appears to be a near-universal expression of commitment to religious human rights, the frequency-and severity-of religious persecution worldwide is staggering. Although it is impossible to determine with certainty the exact numbers of people persecuted for their faith or religious affiliation, it is unquestioned that &quot;violations of freedom of religion and belief, including acts of severe persecution, occur with fearful frequency.&quot; She quotes Irwin Colter, human rights advocate and author as saying &quot;[F]reedom of religion remains the most persistently violated human right in the annals of the species.&quot;
Despite the ubiquitous nature of religious persecution, the traditional human rights community typically chooses to emphasize &quot;more tangible encroachments on human dignity,&quot; such as violations which are based on race, gender, and class by using national, ethnic, and linguistic groupings rather than religious groupings.

==By religion==
===Persecution of African traditional religions===
Traditional African religions have faced religious persecution from Christians and Muslims. Adherents of these religions have been forcefully converted to Islam and Christianity, demonized and marginalized. The atrocities include killings, waging war, destroying of sacred places, and other atrocities.

====Persecution of Dogons====

For almost 1000 years, the Dogon people, an ancient tribe in Mali had faced religious and ethnic persecution—through jihads by dominant Muslim communities. These jihadic expeditions were undertaken in order to force the Dogon to abandon their traditional religious beliefs and convert to Islam. Such jihads caused the Dogon to abandon their original villages and move up to the cliffs of Bandiagara in search of a place where they could defend themselves more efficiently and escape persecution—which they often did by building their dwellings in little nooks and crannies. In the early era of French colonialism in Mali, the French authorities appointed Muslim relatives of El Hadj Umar Tall as chiefs of the Bandiagara—despite the fact that the area has been a Dogon area for centuries.

In 1864, Tidiani Tall, the nephew and successor of the 19th century Senegambian jihadist and Muslim leader—El Hadj Umar Tall, chose to make Bandiagara the capital of the Toucouleur Empire thereby exacerbating the inter-religious and inter-ethnic conflict. In recent years, the Dogon have accused the Fulanis of supporting Islamic terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and they have also accused the Fulanis of sheltering members of these same terrorist groups in Dogon country, leading to the creation of the Dogon militia Dan Na Ambassagou in 2016—whose aim is to defend the Dogon against systematic attacks. That action resulted in the Ogossagou massacre of Fulanis in March 2019, and the Fula retaliated by committing the Sobane Da massacre in June of that year. In the wake of the Ogossagou massacre, the President of Mali, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and his government ordered the dissolution of Dan Na Ambassagou—whom they hold partly responsible for the attacks. The Dogon militia group denied its involvement in the massacre and it also rejected calls to disband itself.

====Persecution of Serers====
The persecution of the Serer people of Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania is multifaceted, and as a result, it includes religious and ethnic elements. The religious and ethnic persecution of the Serer people dates back to the 11th century, when King War Jabi usurped the throne of Tekrur (a part of present-day Senegal) in 1030, and in 1035, he introduced Sharia law and forced his subjects to submit to Islam. With the assistance of his son Leb, their Almoravid allies and other African ethnic groups which had embraced Islam, the Muslim coalition army launched jihads against the Serer people of Tekrur because they refused to abandon the Serer religion in favour of Islam. The number of Serers who were killed is unknown, but the defeat of the Serers at Tekrur triggered their exodus from Tekrur to the south, where they were granted asylum by the lamanes. The persecution of the Serer people continued from the medieval era to the 19th century, resulting in the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune. Since the 20th century, the persecution of the Serers has been less visible, nevertheless, they are still the objects of scorn and prejudice.

===Persecutions of atheists===

Used before the 18th century as an insult, atheism was punishable by death in ancient Greece as well as in the Christian and Muslim worlds during the Middle Ages. Today, atheism is punishable by death in 12 countries (Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen), all of them Muslim-majority, while &quot;the overwhelming majority&quot; of the 193 United Nations member countries &quot;at best discriminate against citizens who have no belief in a god and at worst they can jail them for offences which are dubbed blasphemy&quot;.

====State atheism====

State atheism has been defined by David Kowalewski as the official &quot;promotion of atheism&quot; by a government, typically by the active suppression of religious freedom and practice. It is a misnomer which is used in reference to a government&#x27;s anti-clericalism, its opposition to religious institutional power and influence, whether it is real or alleged, in all aspects of public and political life, including the involvement of religion in the everyday life of the citizen.

State atheism was first practiced for a brief period in Revolutionary France and later it was practiced in Revolutionary Mexico and Marxist-Leninist states. The Soviet Union had a long history of state atheism, in which social success largely required individuals to profess atheism, stay away from churches and even vandalize them; this attitude was especially militant during the middle Stalinist era from 1929 to 1939. The Soviet Union attempted to suppress religion over wide areas of its influence, including places like central Asia, and the post-World War II Eastern bloc. One state within that bloc, the Socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha, went so far as to officially ban all religious practices.

===Persecution of Baháʼís===

The Baháʼís are Iran&#x27;s largest religious minority, and Iran is the location of one of the seventh largest Baháʼí population in the world, with just over 251,100 as of 2010. Baháʼís in Iran have been subject to unwarranted arrests, false imprisonment, beatings, torture, unjustified executions, confiscation and destruction of property owned by individuals and the Baháʼí community, denial of employment, denial of government benefits, denial of civil rights and liberties, and denial of access to higher education.

More recently, in the later months of 2005, an intensive anti-Baháʼí campaign was conducted by Iranian newspapers and radio stations. The state-run and influential &quot;Kayhan&quot; newspaper, whose managing editor is appointed by Iran&#x27;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei The press in Iran, ran nearly three dozen articles defaming the Baháʼí Faith. Furthermore, a confidential letter sent on 29 October 2005 by the Chairman of the Command Headquarters of the Armed Forced in Iran states that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei has instructed the Command Headquarters to identify people who adhere to the Baháʼí Faith and to monitor their activities and gather any and all information about the members of the Baháʼí Faith. The letter was brought to the attention of the international community by Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on freedom of religion or belief, in a 20 March 2006 press release .

In the press release the Special Rapporteur states that she &quot;is highly concerned by information she has received concerning the treatment of members of the Baháʼí community in Iran.&quot; She further states that &quot;The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this latest development indicates that the situation with regard to religious minorities in Iran is, in fact, deteriorating.&quot;

===Persecution of Buddhists===

The persecution of Buddhists has been a widespread phenomenon throughout the history of Buddhism, a phenomenon which continues to occur today. As early as the 3rd century AD, Buddhists were persecuted by Kirder, the Zoroastrian high priest of the Sasanian Empire. 

Anti-Buddhist sentiments in Imperial China between the 5th and 10th century led to the &quot;Four Buddhist Persecutions in China&quot; of which the &quot;Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution&quot; of 845 was probably the most severe. However Buddhism managed to survive but was greatly weakened. During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Kuomintang Muslim General Bai Chongxi led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. During the Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai, the Muslim General Ma Bufang and his army wiped out many Tibetan Buddhists in the northeast and eastern Qinghai, and destroyed Tibetan Buddhist temples.

The Muslim invasion of the Indian subcontinent was the first great iconoclastic invasion into the Indian subcontinent. According to William Johnston, hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines were destroyed, Buddhist texts were burnt by the Muslim armies, monks and nuns killed during the 12th and 13th centuries in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. The Buddhist university of Nalanda was mistaken for a fort because of the walled campus. The Buddhist monks who had been slaughtered were mistaken for Brahmins according to Minhaj-i-Siraj. The walled town, the Odantapuri monastery, was also conquered by his forces. Sumpa basing his account on that of Śākyaśribhadra who was at Magadha in 1200, states that the Buddhist university complexes of Odantapuri and Vikramshila were also destroyed and the monks massacred. Muslim forces attacked the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent many times. Many places were destroyed and renamed. For example, Odantapuri&#x27;s monasteries were destroyed in 1197 by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji and the town was renamed. Likewise, Vikramashila was destroyed by the forces of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200. The sacred Mahabodhi Temple was almost completely destroyed by the Muslim invaders. Many Buddhist monks fled to Nepal, Tibet, and South India to avoid the consequences of war. Tibetan pilgrim Chöjepal (1179–1264), who arrived in India in 1234, had to flee advancing Muslim troops multiple times, as they were sacking Buddhist sites.

In Japan, the haibutsu kishaku during the Meiji Restoration (starting in 1868) was an event triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (or shinbutsu bunri). This caused great destruction to Buddhism in Japan, the destruction of Buddhist temples, images and texts took place on a large scale all over the country and Buddhist monks were forced to return to secular life.

During the 2012 Ramu violence in Bangladesh, a 25,000-strong Muslim mob set fire to destroy at least twelve Buddhist temples and around fifty homes throughout the town and surrounding villages after seeing a picture of an allegedly desecrated Quran, which they claimed had been posted on Facebook by Uttam Barua, a local Buddhist man. The actual posting of the photo was not done by the Buddhist who was falsely slandered.

===Persecution of Christians===


From the beginnings of Christianity as a movement within Judaism, Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both Jews and the Roman Empire, which controlled much of the areas where Christianity was first distributed. This continued from the first century until the early fourth, when the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, eventually becoming the State church of the Roman Empire. Many Christians fled persecution in the Roman empire by emigrating to the Persian empire where for a century and a half after Constantine&#x27;s conversion, they were persecuted under the Sassanids, with thousands losing their lives. Christianity continued to spread through &quot;merchants, slaves, traders, captives and contacts with Jewish communities&quot; as well as missionaries who were often killed for their efforts. This killing continued into the Early modern period beginning in the fifteenth century, to the Late modern period of the twentieth century, and into the contemporary period today.
In contemporary society, Christians are persecuted in Iran and other parts of the Middle East, for example, for proselytising, which is illegal there. Of the 100–200 million Christians alleged to be under assault, the majority are persecuted in Muslim-majority nations. Every year, the Christian non-profit organization Open Doors publishes the World Watch List—a list of the top 50 countries which it designates as the most dangerous for Christians.

The 2018 World Watch List has the following countries as its top ten: North Korea, and Eritrea, whose Christian and Muslim religions are controlled by the state, and Afghanistan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, India and Iran, which are all predominantly non-Christian. Due to the large number of Christian majority countries, differing groups of Christians are harassed and persecuted in Christian countries such as Eritrea and Mexico more often than in Muslim countries, although not in greater numbers.
There are low to moderate restrictions on religious freedom in three-quarters of the world&#x27;s countries, with high and very high restrictions in a quarter of them, according to the State Department&#x27;s report on religious freedom and persecution delivered annually to Congress. The Internationale Gesellschaft für Menschenrechte—the International Society for Human Rights—in Frankfurt, Germany is a non-governmental organization with 30,000 members from 38 countries who monitor human rights. In September 2009, then chairman Martin Lessenthin, issued a report estimating that 80% of acts of religious persecution around the world were aimed at Christians at that time. According to the World Evangelical Alliance, over 200 million Christians are denied fundamental human rights solely because of their faith.

A report released by the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and a report by the PEW organization studying worldwide restrictions of religious freedom, both have Christians suffering in the highest number of countries, rising from 125 in 2015 to 144 as of 2018. PEW has published a caution concerning the interpretation of these numbers: &quot;The Center&#x27;s recent report ... does not attempt to estimate the number of victims in each country... it does not speak to the intensity of harassment...&quot; France, who restricts the wearing of the hijab, is counted as a persecuting country equally with Nigeria and Pakistan where, according to the Global Security organization, Christians have been killed for their faith.

In December 2016, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity (CSGC) at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in Massachusetts, published a statement that &quot;between 2005 and 2015 there were 900,000 Christian martyrs worldwide—an average of 90,000 per year, marking a Christian as persecuted every 8 minutes.&quot; However, the BBC has reported that others such as Open Doors and the International Society for Human Rights have disputed that number&#x27;s accuracy. Gina Zurlo, the CSGC&#x27;s assistant director, explained that two-thirds of the 90,000 died in tribal conflicts, and nearly half were victims of the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Klaus Wetzel, an internationally recognized expert on religious persecution, explains that Gordon-Conwell defines Christian martyrdom in the widest possible sense, while Wetzel and Open doors and others such as The International Institute for Religious Freedom (IIRF) use a more restricted definition: &quot;those who are killed, &quot;who would not have been killed&quot;, if they had not been Christians.&quot; Open Doors documents that anti-Christian sentiment is presently based on direct evidence and makes conservative estimates based on indirect evidence. This approach dramatically lowers the numerical count. Open Doors says that, while numbers fluctuate every year, they estimate 11 Christians are currently dying for their faith somewhere in the world every day.

====Persecution of Copts====
The persecution of Copts is a historical and ongoing issue in Egypt against Coptic Orthodox Christianity and its followers. It is also a prominent example of the poor status of Christians in the Middle East despite the religion being native to the region. Copts are the Christ followers in Egypt, usually Oriental Orthodox, who currently make up around 10% of the population of Egypt—the largest religious minority of that country. Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history and Human Rights Watch has noted &quot;growing religious intolerance&quot; and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, as well as a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible.

The Muslim conquest of Egypt took place in AD 639, during the Byzantine empire. Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained a mainly Christian, but Copts lost their majority status after the 14th century, as a result of the intermittent persecution and the destruction of the Christian churches there, accompanied by heavy taxes for those who refused to convert. From the Muslim conquest of Egypt onwards, the Coptic Christians were persecuted by different Muslims regimes, such as the Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman Empire; the persecution of Coptic Christians included closing and demolishing churches and forced conversion to Islam.

Since 2011 hundreds of Egyptian Copts have been killed in sectarian clashes, and many homes, Churches and businesses have been destroyed. In just one province (Minya), 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 have been documented by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. The abduction and disappearance of Coptic Christian women and girls also remains a serious ongoing problem.

====Persecution of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====
Political and religious animosity against Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries. Their stance regarding political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during World War II and at other times where national service has been compulsory. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, including China, Vietnam, and many Islamic states.

* In 1933, there were approximately 20,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in Nazi Germany, of whom about 10,000 were imprisoned. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were brutally persecuted by the Nazis, because they refused military service and allegiance to Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist Party. Of those, 2,000 were sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1,200 died, including 250 who were executed.
* In Canada during World War II, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Chinese and Japanese descent. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses faced discrimination in Quebec until the Quiet Revolution, including bans on distributing literature or holding meetings.
* In 1951, about 9,300 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the Soviet Union were deported to Siberia as part of Operation North in April 1951.
* In April 2017, the Supreme Court of Russia labeled Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses an extremist organization, banned its activities in Russia and issued an order to confiscate the organization&#x27;s assets.

Authors including William Whalen, Shawn Francis Peters and former Witnesses Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Alan Rogerson and William Schnell have claimed the arrests and mob violence in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s were the consequence of what appeared to be a deliberate course of provocation of authorities and other religious groups by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Whalen, Harrison and Schnell have suggested Rutherford invited and cultivated opposition for publicity purposes in a bid to attract dispossessed members of society, and to convince members that persecution from the outside world was evidence of the truth of their struggle to serve God. Watch Tower Society literature of the period directed that Witnesses should &quot;never seek a controversy&quot; nor resist arrest, but also advised members not to co-operate with police officers or courts that ordered them to stop preaching, and to prefer jail rather than pay fines.

===Persecution of Druze===

Historically the relationship between the Druze and Muslims has been characterized by intense persecution. The Druze faith is often classified as a branch of Isma&#x27;ilism. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, most Druze do not identify as Muslims, and they do not accept the Five Pillars of Islam. The Druze have frequently experienced persecution by different Muslim regimes such as the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk, Sunni Ottoman Empire, and Egypt Eyalet. The persecution of the Druze included massacres, demolishing Druze prayer houses and holy places and forced conversion to Islam. Those were no ordinary killings in the Druze&#x27;s narrative, they were meant to eradicate the whole community according to the Druze narrative. Most recently, the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, saw persecution of the Druze at the hands of Islamic extremists.

Ibn Taymiyya a prominent Muslim scholar muhaddith, dismissed the Druze as non-Muslims, and his fatwa cited that Druzes: &quot;Are not at the level of ′Ahl al-Kitāb (People of the Book) nor mushrikin (polytheists). Rather, they are from the most deviant kuffār (Infidel) ... Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized ... they are to be killed whenever they are found and cursed as they described ... It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others&quot;, which in that setting would have legitimized violence against them as apostates. Ottomans have often relied on Ibn Taymiyya religious ruling to justify their persecution of Druze.

===Persecution of Falun Gong===

The persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice began with campaigns initiated in 1999 by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to eliminate Falun Gong in China. It is characterised by multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education, and a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor, and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death.
There have being reports of organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Several researchers—most notably Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas, former parliamentarian David Kilgour, and investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann—estimate that tens of thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience have been killed to supply a lucrative trade in human organs and cadavers.

===Persecution of Hindus===


For example, Hindus have been one of the targeted and persecuted minorities in Pakistan. Militancy and sectarianism has been rising in Pakistan since the 1990s, and the religious minorities have &quot;borne the brunt of the Islamist&#x27;s ferocity&quot; suffering &quot;greater persecution than in any earlier decade&quot;, states Farahnaz Ispahani—a Public Policy Scholar at the Wilson Center. This has led to attacks and forced conversion of Hindus, and other minorities such as Christians. According to Tetsuya Nakatani—a Japanese scholar of Cultural Anthropology specializing in South Asia refugee history, after the mass exodus of Hindu, Sikh and other non-Muslim refugees during the 1947 partition of British India, there were several waves of Hindu refugees arrival into India from its neighbors. The fearful and persecuted refugee movements were often after various religious riots between 1949 and 1971 that targeted non-Muslims within West Pakistan or East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The status of these persecuted Hindu refugees in India was in political limbo until the passage of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 by the Indian Government. Systemically in Pakistan, Hindus are persecuted under the government&#x27;s Blasphemy Law (with often consequence of death irrelevant of the legal claim&#x27;s accuracy), and as per the rhetoric of mainstream politicians interpreting vague constitutional law, have second-class rights in the nation regarding places of worship and facets of their religion.

Similar concerns about religious persecution of Hindu and other minorities in Bangladesh have also been expressed. A famous report by Dr. Abul Barkat, a famous Bangladeshi economist and research, projects that there will be no Hindus left in Bangladesh in 30 years. The USCIRF notes hundreds of cases of &quot;killings, attempted killings, death threats, assaults, rapes, kidnappings, and attacks on homes, businesses, and places of worship&quot; on religious minorities in 2017. Since the 1990s, Hindus have been a persecuted minority in Afghanistan, and a subject of &quot;intense hate&quot; with the rise of religious fundamentalism in Afghanistan. Their &quot;targeted persecution&quot; triggered an exodus and forced them to seek asylum. The persecuted Hindus have remained stateless and without citizenship rights in India, since it has historically lacked any refugee law or uniform policy for persecuted refugees, state Ashish Bose and Hafizullah Emadi, though the recent Citizen Amendment Act passed by India is a form of solace for those Hindus having entered India before 2015.

The Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army&#x27;s onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated &quot;the Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.&quot; Senator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, &quot;Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked &quot;H&quot;. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad&quot;. In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. Given that the Hindu population in East Pakistan was around 11 million in 1971, this suggests that up to 8 million, or more than 70% of the Hindu population had fled the country. The Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg covered the start of the war and wrote extensively on the suffering of the East Bengalis, including the Hindus both during and after the conflict. In a syndicated column &quot;The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored&quot;, he wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. &quot;Other reminders were the yellow &quot;H&quot;s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army&quot; (by &quot;Muslim army&quot;, meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).

Hindus constitute approximately 0.5% of the total population of the United States. Hindus in the US enjoy both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; legal equality. However, a series of attacks were made on people Indian origin by a street gang called the &quot;Dotbusters&quot; in New Jersey in 1987, the dot signifying the Bindi dot sticker worn on the forehead by Indian women. The lackadaisical attitude of the local police prompted the South Asian community to arrange small groups all across the state to fight back against the street gang. The perpetrators have been put to trial. On 2 January 2012, a Hindu worship center in New York City was firebombed. The Dotbusters were primarily based in New York and New Jersey and committed most of their crimes in Jersey City. A number of perpetrators have been brought to trial for these assaults. Although tougher anti-hate crime laws were passed by the New Jersey legislature in 1990, the attacks continued, with 58 cases of hate crimes against Indians in New Jersey reported in 1991.

Persecution of Hindus also contemporarily has been seen in the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir. In the Kashmir region, approximately 300 Kashmiri Pandits were killed between September 1989 to 1990 in various incidents. In early 1990, local Urdu newspapers &quot;Aftab&quot; and &quot;Al Safa&quot; called upon Kashmiris to wage jihad against India and ordered the expulsion of all Hindus choosing to remain in Kashmir. In the following days masked men ran in the streets with AK-47s, shooting to kill Hindus who would not leave. Notices were placed on the houses of all Hindus, telling them to leave within 24 hours or die. Since March 1990, estimates of between 300,000 and 500,000 pandits have migrated outside Kashmir due to persecution by Islamic fundamentalists in the largest case of ethnic cleansing since the partition of India. Many Kashmiri Pandits have been killed by Islamist militants in incidents such as the Wandhama massacre and the 2000 Amarnath pilgrimage massacre. The incidents of massacring and forced eviction have been termed ethnic cleansing by some observers.

In Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Vice President of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Following the sentence, the Hindus were attacked in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire. This trend has continued, sadly; Islamist groups in Bangladesh, nearing the 50th anniversary of the Bengali Hindu Genocide, set fire to and vandalized several Hindu temples along with 80 houses.

===Persecutions of Jews===


A major component of Jewish history, persecutions have been committed by Seleucids, ancient Greeks, ancient Romans, Christians (Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant), Muslims, Nazis, etc. Some of the most important events which constitute this history include the 1066 Granada massacre, the Rhineland massacres (by Catholics, but they were committed against papal orders, see also : Sicut Judaeis), the Alhambra Decree which was issued after the Reconquista and the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition, the publication of &quot;On the Jews and Their Lies&quot; by Martin Luther which furthered Protestant anti-Judaism and was later used to strengthen German antisemitism and justify pogroms and the Holocaust.

According to the FBI&#x27;s statistics, the majority of religiously motivated hate crimes which are committed in the United States are committed against Jews. In 2018, anti-Jewish hate crimes represented 57.8% of all religiously motivated hate crimes; followed by anti-Muslim hate crimes, which were the second most common, representing 14.5%.

===Persecution of Muslims===

Persecution of Muslims is the religious persecution that is inflicted upon followers of the Islamic faith. In the early days of Islam at Mecca, the new Muslims were often subjected to abuse and persecution by the pagan Meccans (often called Mushrikin: the unbelievers or polytheists). Muslims were persecuted by Meccans at the time of Muhammed.

Currently, Muslims face religious restrictions in 142 countries according to the PEW report on rising religious restrictions around the world. According to the US State Department&#x27;s 2019 freedom of religion report, the Central African Republic remains divided between the Christian anti-Balaka and the predominantly Muslim ex-Seleka militia forces with many Muslim communities displaced and not allowed to practice their religion freely. In Nigeria, &quot;conflicts between predominantly Muslim Fulani herdsmen and predominantly Christian farmers in the North Central states continued throughout 2019.&quot;
Shia-Sunni conflicts persist. Indonesia is approximately 87% Sunni Muslim, and &quot;Shia and Ahmadi Muslims reported feeling under constant threat.&quot; Anti-Shia rhetoric was common throughout 2019 in some online media outlets and on social media.&quot;

In Saudi Arabia, the government &quot;is based largely on sharia as interpreted by the Hanbali school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence. Freedom of religion is not provided under the law.&quot; In January and May 2019, police raided predominantly Shia villages in the al-Qatif Governorate... In April the government executed 37 citizens ... 33 of the 37 were from the country&#x27;s minority Shia community and had been convicted following what they stated were unfair trials for various alleged crimes, including protest-related offenses... Authorities detained ... three Shia Muslims who have written in the past on the discrimination faced by Shia Muslims, with no official charges filed; they remained in detention at year&#x27;s end... Instances of prejudice and discrimination against Shia Muslims continued to occur...&quot;

Islamophobia continues. In Finland, &quot;A report by the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) said hate crimes and intolerant speech in public discourse, principally against Muslims and asylum seekers (many of whom belong to religious minorities), had increased in recent years... A Finns Party politician publicly compared Muslim asylum seekers to an invasive species.&quot; There were several demonstrations by neo-Nazis and nativist groups in 2019. One neo-Nazi group, the NRM (the Nordic Resistance Movement), &quot;continued to post anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic statements online and demonstrated with the anti-immigrant group &quot;Soldiers of Odin&quot;.&quot;

The ongoing Rohingya genocide has resulted in over 25,000 deaths from 2016 to present. Over 700,000 refugees have been sent abroad since 2017. Gang rapes and other acts of sexual violence, mainly against Rohingya women and girls, have also been committed by the Rakhine Buddhists and the Burmese military&#x27;s soldiers, along with the arson of Rohingya homes and mosques, as well as many other human rights violations.

The Chinese government has persecuted the majority-Muslim Uyghur people and other ethnic and religious minorities in and around the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Since 2014, the Chinese government, under the direction of the CCP during the administration of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping, has pursued policies leading to more than one million Muslims (the majority of them Uyghurs) being held in secretive internment camps without any legal process in what has become the largest-scale and most systematic detention of ethnic and religious minorities since the Holocaust. The Chinese Government has subjected hundreds of thousands of members of Muslim minority groups living in Xinjiang to forced abortions, forced sterilizations, and the forced administration of contraceptives (including contraceptive implants), methods of birth control that had exempted ethnic minorities up until that point. Uyghurs and members of other minority groups have been made subject to a widespread forced labor apparatus. Uyghurs and other religious minorities detained within the Xinjiang internment camps have also been subjected to systematic rape and torture.

In China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has decreed that all members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) must be &quot;unyielding Marxist atheists&quot;. In Xinjiang province, the government enforced restrictions on Muslims. The U.S. government estimates that
===Persecution of Pagans and Heathens===

===Persecutions of Sikhs===

Sikhism is a Dharmic religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century CE. The Sikh religion developed and evolved during periods of religious persecution, gaining converts from Hinduism and Islam. Mughal emperors of India tortured and executed two of the Sikh gurus—Guru Arjan (1563–1605) and Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–1675)—after they refused to convert to Islam.

The persecution of Sikhs during the Islamic era triggered the founding of the &quot;Khalsa&quot; by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699, the Khalsa is an order which was founded for the purpose of protecting the freedom of conscience and religion of the Sikhs, with members expressing the qualities of a &quot;Sant-Sipāhī&quot;—a saint-soldier.

In February 1762, Afghan emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani perpetrated a massacre against the families and camp followers of the Sikh Army, killing between 10,000 and 30,000 people, in a massacre that is now known as Vadda Ghalughara. Following the massacre, he attacked Amritsar and desecrated the Golden Temple by throwing cow carcasses into its sacred lake and then filling it with rubble from demolished gurdwaras and temples.

According to Ashish Bose, a population research scholar, Sikhs and Hindus were well integrated in Afghanistan until the Soviet invasion when their economic condition worsened. Thereafter, they became the objects of &quot;intense hate&quot; as a result of the rise of religious fundamentalism in Afghanistan. Their &quot;targeted persecution&quot; triggered an exodus and forced them to seek asylum. Many of them started arriving in and after 1992 as refugees in India, with some seeking asylum in the United Kingdom and other western countries. Unlike the arrivals in the West, the persecuted Sikh refugees who arrived in India have remained stateless and lived as refugees because India has historically lacked any refugee law or uniform policy for persecuted refugees, state Ashish Bose and Hafizullah Emadi.

On 7 November 1947, thousands of Hindus and Sikhs were targeted in the Rajouri Massacre in the Jammu and Kashmir princely state. It is estimated 30,000+ Hindus and Sikhs were either killed, abducted or injured. In one instance, on 12 November 1947 alone between 3000 and 7000 were killed. A few weeks after on 25 November 1947, tribal forces began the 1947 Mirpur massacre of thousands more Hindus and Sikhs. An estimated 20,000+ died in the massacre.

In June 1984, during Operation Blue Star, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to attack the Golden Temple and eliminate any insurgents, as it had been occupied by Sikh separatists who were stockpiling weapons. Later operations by Indian paramilitary forces were initiated to clear the separatists from the countryside of Punjab state.

The 1984 anti-Sikhs riots were a series of pogroms directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. There were more than 8,000 deaths, including 3,000 in Delhi.

The violence in Delhi was triggered by the assassination of Indira Gandhi, India&#x27;s prime minister, on 31 October 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards in response to her actions authorising the military operation. After the assassination following Operation Blue Star, many Indian National Congress workers including Jagdish Tytler, Sajjan Kumar and Kamal Nath were accused of inciting and participating in riots targeting the Sikh population of the capital. The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In the aftermath of the riots, the Indian government reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties reported &quot;at least&quot; 1,000 displaced persons. The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in Delhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation, the main Indian investigating agency, is of the opinion that the acts of violence were organized with the support from the then Delhi police officials and the central government headed by Indira Gandhi&#x27;s son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as Prime Minister after his mother&#x27;s death and, when asked about the riots, said &quot;when a big tree falls (Mrs. Gandhi&#x27;s death), the earth shakes (occurrence of riots)&quot; thus trying to justify communal strife.

It has been alleged that at that time, the Indian National Congress&#x27;s government destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. The &quot;Asian Age&quot; front-page story called the government&#x27;s actions &quot;the Mother of all Cover-ups&quot; There are allegations that the violence was led and often perpetrated by Indian National Congress activists and sympathisers during the riots. The government, then led by the Congress, was widely criticised for doing very little at the time, possibly acting as a conspirator. The conspiracy theory is supported by the fact that voting lists were used to identify Sikh families. Despite the communal conflict and despite the record of the riots, the Indian National Congress claims that it is a secular political party.

The Chittisinghpura massacre, the murder of 35 villagers who were members of the Sikh faith, was committed on 20 March 2000, in the Chittisinghpora (Chittisinghpura) village of the Anantnag district, Jammu and Kashmir, India, on the eve of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s state visit to India. The identities of the perpetrators of the massacre remain unknown. The Indian government asserts that the massacre was conducted by the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Other accounts accuse the Indian Army and RSS of the massacre.

On 25 March 2020, ISIS-Haqqani network Gunmen and Suicide bombers attacked the Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib (a Sikh shrine) in Kabul, Afghanistan.

According to reports, about 200 worshipers were inside the building, 25 of them were killed and at least 8 others were wounded after an hour-long siege ended when all of the assailants were killed by responding security forces. At least one child was said to have been among the people who were killed, according to the ministry of interior&#x27;s statement.

===Persecution of Yazidis===
The Persecution of Yazidis has been ongoing since at least the 10th century. The Yazidi religion is regarded as devil worship by Islamists. Yazidis have been persecuted by Muslim Kurdish tribes since the 10th century, and they were also persecuted by the Ottoman Empire from the 17th century to the 20th century. After the 2014 Sinjar massacre of thousands of Yazidis by the Islamic State, Yazidis still face violence at the hands of the Turkish Armed Forces and its ally the Syrian National Army, as well as discrimination at the hands of the Kurdistan Regional Government. According to Yazidi tradition (based on oral traditions and folk songs), it is estimated that during the last 800 years, 74 genocides were committed against the Yazidis.

===Persecution of Zoroastrians===
The persecution of Zoroastrians is the religious persecution which has been inflicted upon adherents of the Zoroastrian faith. The persecution of Zoroastrians has occurred throughout their religion&#x27;s history. The discrimination and harassment began in the form of sparse violence and forced conversions. According to Zoroastrian records, Muslims destroyed fire temples. Zoroastrians who lived under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax which was called the jizya.
Zoroastrian places of worship were desecrated, fire temples were destroyed and mosques were built in their place. Many libraries were burned and much of the cultural heritage of the Zoroastrians was lost. Gradually, an increasing number of discriminatory laws were passed, these laws regulated the behavior of Zoroastrians and they also limited the Zoroastrians&#x27; ability to participate in society. Over time, the persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and it also became widespread, and as a result, the number of believers significantly decreased by force.

Most Zoroastrians were forced to convert to Islam due to the systematic abuse and discrimination which was inflicted upon them by followers of Islam. Once a Zoroastrian family was forced to convert to Islam, the children were sent to an Islamic school, where they were required to learn Arabic and study the teachings of Islam, as a result, some of these people lost their Zoroastrian faith. However, under the Samanids, who were Zoroastrian converts to Islam, the Persian language flourished. On some occasions, the Zoroastrian clergy assisted Muslims when they launched their attacks against people who they considered Zoroastrian heretics.

A Zoroastrian astrologer who was named Mulla Gushtasp predicted the fall of the Zand dynasty to the Qajar army in Kerman. Because of Gushtasp&#x27;s forecast, the Zoroastrians of Kerman were spared by the conquering army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Despite the aforementioned favorable incident, the Zoroastrians remained in agony during the Qajar dynasty and as a result, their population continued to decline. Even during the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, many Zoroastrians were killed and some of them were taken captive and deported to Azerbaijan. Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of their worst. During the Qajar dynasty, the religious persecution of the Zoroastrians was rampant. Due to their increasing contacts with influential Parsi philanthropists such as Maneckji Limji Hataria, many Zoroastrians left Iran and migrated to India. There, they formed the Iranis, India&#x27;s second largest Zoroastrian community.

==Persecution of philosophers==
Throughout the history of philosophy, philosophers have been imprisoned for various offenses by courts and tribunals, often as a result of their philosophical activities, and some of them have even been put to death. The most famous case in which a philosopher was put on trial is the case of Socrates, who was tried for, amongst other charges, corrupting the youth and impiety. Others include:
* Giordano Bruno – a pantheist philosopher who was burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition for his heretical religious views and/or his cosmological views;
* Tommaso Campanella – he was confined to a convent for his heretical views, chiefly, for his opposition to the authority of Aristotle, and later, he was imprisoned in a castle for 27 years, during which he wrote his most famous works, one of them is &quot;The City of the Sun&quot;;
* Baruch Spinoza – a Jewish philosopher who was put in cherem (similar to excommunication) by the Orthodox Jewish leadership of the Portuguese synagogue in Amsterdam for heresies when he was 23 years old. His views were controversial, among them, were his ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible, which formed the foundations of modern biblical criticism, and his belief that the nature of the God of Israel is pantheisticic. Prior to his excommunication, Spinoza was attacked on the steps of the Portuguese synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant who shouted &quot;Heretic!&quot;, and later his books were added to the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Index of Forbidden Books.

<text>Persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group. The most common forms are religious persecution, racism, and political persecution, though there is naturally some overlap between these terms. The inflicting of suffering, harassment, imprisonment, internment, fear or pain are all factors that may establish persecution, but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The threshold of severity has been a topic of much debate.

==International law==
As part of the Nuremberg Principles, crimes against humanity are part of international law. Principle VI of the Nuremberg Principles states that
Telford Taylor, who was Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials wrote &quot;[at] the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the tribunals rebuffed several efforts by the prosecution to bring such &#x27;domestic&#x27; atrocities within the scope of international law as &#x27;crimes against humanity&quot;. Several subsequent international treaties incorporate this principle, but some have dropped the restriction &quot;in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime&quot; that is in Nuremberg Principles.

The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is binding on 111 states, defines crimes against humanity in Article 7.1. The article criminalizes certain acts &quot;committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack&quot;. These include:

==Religious==

Religious persecution is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group due to their religious affiliation. Not only theorists of secularization (who presume a decline of religiosity in general) would willingly assume that religious persecution is a thing of the past. However, with the rise of fundamentalism and religiously related terrorism, this assumption has become even more controversial. Indeed, in many countries of the world today, religious persecution is a Human Rights problem.

===Atheists===

Atheists have experienced persecution throughout their history. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property.

===Baháʼís===

The persecution of Baháʼís refers to the religious persecution of Baháʼís in various countries, especially in Iran, which has the seventh largest Baháʼí population in the world, with just over 251,100 as of 2010. The Baháʼí Faith originated in Iran, and it represents the largest religious minority in that country.

===Buddhists===

The persecution of Buddhists has been a widespread phenomenon throughout the history of Buddhism, a phenomenon which is continuing today. As early as the 3rd century AD, Buddhists were persecuted by Kirder, the Zoroastrian high priest of the Sasanian Empire. 

Anti-Buddhist sentiment in Imperial China between the 5th and 10th century led to the &quot;Four Buddhist Persecutions in China&quot; of which the &quot;Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution&quot; of 845 was probably the most severe. However, Buddhism managed to survive in China, but it was greatly weakened. During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, the Kuomintang Muslim General Bai Chongxi led his troops on a campaign to destroy Buddhist temples and smash idols, they turned the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. During the Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai, the Muslim General Ma Bufang and his army wiped out many Tibetan Buddhists in the northeast and eastern Qinghai, and destroyed Tibetan Buddhist temples.

The Muslim invasion of the Indian subcontinent was the first great iconoclastic invasion of the Indian subcontinent. According to William Johnston, hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and shrines were destroyed, Buddhist texts were burnt by the Muslim armies, monks and nuns were killed on the Indo-Gangetic Plain during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Buddhist university of Nalanda was mistaken for a fort because of its walled campus. The Buddhist monks who had been slaughtered were mistaken for Brahmins according to Minhaj-i-Siraj. The walled town, the Odantapuri monastery, was also destroyed by his forces. Sumpa based his account on that of Śākyaśribhadra who was at Magadha in 1200, states that the Buddhist university complexes of Odantapuri and Vikramshila were also destroyed and the monks were massacred. Muslim forces attacked the north-western regions of the Indian subcontinent many times. Many places were destroyed and renamed. For example, Odantapuri&#x27;s monasteries were destroyed in 1197 by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji and the town was renamed. Likewise, Vikramashila was destroyed by the forces of Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji around 1200. The sacred Mahabodhi Temple was almost completely destroyed by the Muslim invaders. Many Buddhist monks fled to Nepal, Tibet, and South India to avoid the consequences of war. Tibetan pilgrim Chöjepal (1179-1264), who arrived in India in 1234, had to flee advancing Muslim troops multiple times, as they were sacking Buddhist sites.

In Japan, the haibutsu kishaku during the Meiji Restoration (starting in 1868) was an event which was triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (or shinbutsu bunri). This policy caused great destruction to Buddhism in Japan, the destruction of Buddhist temples, images and texts took place on a large scale all over the country and Buddhist monks were forced to return to secular life.

During the 2012 Ramu violence in Bangladesh, a 25,000-strong Muslim mob set fire to at least five Buddhist temples and dozens of homes throughout the town and throughout the surrounding villages after they saw a picture of an allegedly desecrated Quran, which they claimed had been posted on Facebook by Uttam Barua, a local Buddhist man.

===Christians===

The persecution of Christians is religious persecution that Christians may be subjected to as a consequence of professing their faith, both historically and in the modern era. Early Christians were persecuted for their faith at the hands of both Jews from whose religion Christianity arose and the Roman Empire which controlled much of the land across which early Christianity was distributed. Early in the fourth century, the religion was legalized by the Edict of Milan, and it eventually became the State church of the Roman Empire.

Christian missionaries, as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of persecution, many times to the point of being martyred for their faith.

There is also a history of individual Christian denominations suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of heresy, particularly during the 16th century Protestant Reformation as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy.

In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, and by atheistic states such as the USSR and North Korea. During the Second World War members of many Christian churches were persecuted in Germany for resisting the Nazi ideology.

In more recent times the Christian missionary organization Open Doors (UK) estimates 100 million Christians face persecution, particularly in Muslim-dominated countries such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. According to the International Society for Human Rights, up to 80% of all acts of persecution are directed against people of the Christian faith.

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)====
The Missouri extermination order forced Mormons to move to Illinois. This was after Sidney Rigdon gave his July 4th Oration which meant to state that Mormons would defend their lives and property. This speech was taken critically by the state government. Missouri state militia troops slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the Haun&#x27;s Mill massacre. Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of over a hundred due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses. The founder of the church, Joseph Smith, was killed in Carthage, Illinois by a mob of about 200 men, almost all of whom were members of the Illinois state militia including some members of the militia who were assigned to guard him. The Mormons suffered through tarring and feathering, their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the &quot;Mormon problem&quot; in the Utah War which resulted in a group of Mormons led by John D. Lee massacring settlers at the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

====Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses====

Throughout the history of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, their beliefs, doctrines and practices have engendered controversy and opposition from local governments, communities, and mainstream Christian groups.

===Copts===
The persecution of Copts is a historical and ongoing issue in Egypt against Coptic Orthodox Christianity and its followers. It is also a prominent example of the poor status of Christians in the Middle East despite the religion being native to the region. Copts are the Christ followers in Egypt, usually Oriental Orthodox, who currently make up around 10% of the population of Egypt — the largest religious minority of that country. Copts have cited instances of persecution throughout their history and Human Rights Watch has noted &quot;growing religious intolerance&quot; and sectarian violence against Coptic Christians in recent years, as well as a failure by the Egyptian government to effectively investigate properly and prosecute those responsible.

The Muslim conquest of Egypt took place in AD 639, during the Byzantine empire. Despite the political upheaval, Egypt remained a mainly Christian, but Copts lost their majority status after the 14th century, as a result of the intermittent persecution and the destruction of the Christian churches there, accompanied by heavy taxes for those who refused to convert. From the Muslim conquest of Egypt onwards, the Coptic Christians were persecuted by different Muslims regimes, such as the Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk Sultanate, and Ottoman Empire; the persecution of Coptic Christians included closing and demolishing churches and forced conversion to Islam.

Since 2011 hundreds of Egyptian Copts have been killed in sectarian clashes, and many homes, Churches and businesses have been destroyed. In just one province (Minya), 77 cases of sectarian attacks on Copts between 2011 and 2016 have been documented by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. The abduction and disappearance of Coptic Christian women and girls also remains a serious ongoing problem.

===Dogons===

For almost 1000 years, the Dogon people, an ancient tribe of Mali had faced religious and ethnic persecution—through jihads by dominant Muslim communities. These jihadic expeditions were to forced the Dogon to abandon their traditional religious beliefs for Islam. Such jihads caused the Dogon to abandon their original villages and moved up to the cliffs of Bandiagara for better defense and to escape persecution—often building their dwellings in little nooks and crannies. 
In the early era of French colonialism in Mali, the French authorities appointed Muslim relatives of El Hadj Umar Tall as chiefs of the Bandiagara—despite the fact that the area has been a Dogon area for centuries.

In 1864, Tidiani Tall, nephew and successor of the 19th century Senegambian jihadist and Muslim leader—El Hadj Umar Tall, chose Bandiagara as the capital of the Toucouleur Empire thereby exacerbating the inter-religious and inter-ethnic conflict. In recent years, the Dogon accused the Fulanis of supporting and sheltering Islamic terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda in Dogon country, leading to the creation of the Dogon militia Dan Na Ambassagou in 2016—whose aim is to defend the Dogon from systematic attacks. That resulted in the Ogossagou massacre of Fulanis in March 2019, and a Fula retaliation with the Sobane Da massacre in June of that year. In the wake of the Ogossagou massacre, the President of Mali, Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and his government ordered the dissolution of Dan Na Ambassagou—whom they hold partly responsible for the attacks. The Dogon militia group denied any involvement in the massacre and rejected calls to disband.

===Druze===

Historically the relationship between the Druze and Muslims has been characterized by intense persecution. The Druze faith is often classified as a branch of Isma&#x27;ili. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, most Druze do not identify as Muslims, and they do not accept the five pillars of Islam. The Druze have frequently experienced persecution by different Muslim regimes such as the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk, Sunni Ottoman Empire, and Egypt Eyalet. The persecution of the Druze included massacres, demolishing Druze prayer houses and holy places and forced conversion to Islam. Those were no ordinary killings in the Druze&#x27;s narrative, they were meant to eradicate the whole community according to the Druze narrative. Most recently, the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, saw persecution of the Druze at the hands of Islamic extremists.

Ibn Taymiyya a prominent Muslim scholar muhaddith, dismissed the Druze as non-Muslims, and his fatwa cited that Druzes: &quot;Are not at the level of ′Ahl al-Kitāb (People of the Book) nor mushrikin (polytheists). Rather, they are from the most deviant kuffār (Infidel) ... Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized ... they are to be killed whenever they are found and cursed as they described ... It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others&quot;, which in that setting would have legitimized violence against them as apostates. Ottomans have often relied on Ibn Taymiyya religious ruling to justify their persecution of Druze.

===Falun Gong===

Falun Gong was introduced to the general public by Li Hongzhi in Changchun, China, in 1992. For the next few years, Falun Gong was the fastest growing &quot;qigong&quot; practice in Chinese history and, by 1999, there were millions of practitioners. Following the seven years of widespread popularity, on July 20, 1999, the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China began a nationwide persecution campaign against Falun Gong practitioners, except in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. In late 1999, legislation was created to outlaw &quot;heterodox religions&quot; and retroactively applied to Falun Gong. Amnesty International states that the persecution is &quot;politically motivated&quot; with &quot;legislation being used retroactively to convict people on driven charges, and new regulations introduced to further restrict fundamental freedoms&quot;.

===Hindus===

Persecution of Hindus refers to the religious persecution inflicted upon Hindus that may undergo as a consequence of professing their faith, both historically and in the current era. Hindus have been brutally persecuted during the historical Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent and during Portuguese rule of Goa.

Even in modern times, Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh have suffered persecution. Most recently, thousands of Hindus from Sindh province in Pakistan have been fleeing to India voicing fear for their safety. After the Partition of India in 1947, there were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan (excluding Bangladesh) in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 1.58% of the Pakistani population. Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan&#x27;s population.
The Bangladesh Liberation War (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army&#x27;s onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine dated 2 August 1971, stated &quot;The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred.&quot; Senator Edward Kennedy wrote in a report that was part of United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations testimony dated 1 November 1971, &quot;Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, mass rape and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked &quot;H&quot;. All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from Islamabad&quot;. In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as UNESCO and World Health Organization the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. In a syndicated column &quot;The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored&quot;, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Sydney Schanberg wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. &quot;Other reminders were the yellow &quot;H&quot;s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army&quot; (by &quot;Muslim army&quot;, meaning the Pakistan Army, which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), (Newsday, 29 April 1994).
In Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Vice President of the Jamaat-e-Islami to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Following the sentence, activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire. The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, the rape of Hindu women, and the desecration and destruction of, according to community leaders, more than 50 Hindu temples; 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts. While the government has held the Jamaat-e-Islami responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the Jamaat-e-Islami leadership has denied any involvement. The minority leaders have protested the attacks and appealed for justice. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh has directed the law enforcement to start &quot;suo motu&quot; investigation into the attacks. US Ambassador to Bangladesh express concern about attack of Jamaat on Bengali Hindu community.

===Jews===
The persecution of Jews is a recurring phenomenon throughout Jewish history. It has occurred on numerous occasions in widely different geographic locations. It may include pogroms, looting and the demolition of private and public Jewish property (e.g., Kristallnacht), unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, torture, killing, or even mass execution (in World War II alone, approximately six million people were deliberately killed because they were Jewish). They have been expelled from their hometowns/countries, hoping to find safe havens in other polities. In recent times anti-Semitism has often been manifested as Anti-Zionism, where Anti-Zionism is a prejudice against the Jewish movement for self-determination and the right of the Jewish people to a homeland in the State of Israel. Anti-Zionism can include threats to destroy the State of Israel (or otherwise eliminate its Jewish character), unfounded and inaccurate characterizations of Israel&#x27;s power in the world, and language or actions that hold Israel to a different standard than other countries.

===Muslims===

The persecution of Muslims has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the history of Islam. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, or execution. It may also refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims.

Persecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves to be Muslims and include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or it can include Muslims who are considered non-Muslims by fellow Muslims. The Ahmadiyya regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and &quot;heretics&quot;. In 1984, the Government of Pakistan, under General Zia-ul-Haq, passed Ordinance XX, which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as Muslims. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, Mirza Tahir Ahmad migrated to London.

===Pagans ===
Persecution of Pagans refers to the historical and ongoing acts of religious intolerance, violence, and oppression against followers of pagan or polytheistic religions. This persecution has been carried out by various religious and political groups, including Christians, Muslims, and governments throughout history. 
The rise of Christianity as a state religion in the Late Roman Empire led to the persecution of Pagans, who were seen as a threat to the new faith and persecution of pagans have continued in Post-Roman Europe, Arabia, and North Africa. The destruction and conversion of pagan temples into churches, mosques, or other structures were common practices during the Christianization of the Roman Empire and later the Spread of Islam in Middle East and North Africa. This was done to eradicate paganism and assert the dominance of Christianity and Islam. During the Age of Discovery, Many Europeans consider aspects of Native American, African Tribes, Polynesian, and  Aboriginal Australian religion as pagans, which attributed to their genocide and forced conversions. Some notable examples are the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, Christianisation of the Germanic peoples, Islamization of the Sudan region, Persecution of pagans under Theodosius I, Persecution of pagans under Constantius II, Scramble for Africa, Colonization of Australia, and  Colonization of the Americas. Modern Pagans, who practice various forms of paganism, are a religious minority in every country where they exist. They have been subject to religious discrimination and/or religious persecution. The largest modern Pagan communities are in North America and the United Kingdom, and the issue of discrimination receives most attention in those locations. Although the persecution of Pagans has decreased in recent centuries, it still exists in some parts of the world. The community of Pagans and Wiccans continues to face Christian persecution, particularly in the United States, where they are frequently subjected to negative stereotypes and misconceptions, such as those perpetuated during the Satanic Panic.

===Philosophers===

Philosophers throughout the history of philosophy have been held in courts and tribunals for various offenses, often as a result of their philosophical activity, and some have even been put to death. The most famous example of a philosopher being put on trial is the case of Socrates, who was tried for, amongst other charges, corrupting the youth and impiety. Others include:

* Giordano Bruno - pantheist philosopher who was burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition for his heretical religious views, his cosmological views, or both;
* Tommaso Campanella - confined to a convent for his heretical views, namely, an opposition to the authority of Aristotle, and later imprisoned in a castle for 27 years during which he wrote his most famous works, including &quot;The City of the Sun&quot;;
* Baruch Spinoza - Jewish philosopher who, at age 23, was put in cherem (similar to excommunication) by Jewish religious authorities for heresies such as his controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible, which formed the foundations of modern biblical criticism, and the pantheistic nature of the Divine. Prior to that, he had been attacked on the steps of the community synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting &quot;Heretic!&quot;, and later his books were added to the Catholic Church&#x27;s Index of Forbidden Books.

===Serers===

The persecution of the Serer people of Senegal, Gambia and Mauritania is multifaceted, and it includes both religious and ethnic elements. Religious and ethnic persecution of the Serer people dates back to the 11th century when King War Jabi usurped the throne of Tekrur (part of present-day Senegal) in 1030, and by 1035, introduced Sharia law and forced his subjects to submit to Islam. With the assistance of his son (Leb), their Almoravid allies and other African ethnic groups who have embraced Islam, the Muslim coalition army launched jihads against the Serer people of Tekrur who refused to abandon Serer religion in favour of Islam. The number of Serer deaths are unknown, but it triggered the exodus of the Serers of Tekrur to the south following their defeat, where they were granted asylum by the lamanes. Persecution of the Serer people continued from the medieval era to the 19th century, resulting in the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune. From the 20th to the 21st centuries, persecution of the Serers is less obvious, nevertheless, they are the object of scorn and prejudice.

===Sikhs===
The 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the 1984 Sikh Massacre was a series of pogroms directed against Sikhs in India, by anti-Sikh mobs, in response to the assassination of Indira Gandhi, on 31 October 1984, by two of her Sikh bodyguards in response to her actions authorising the military operation Operation Blue Star. There were more than 8,000 deaths, including 3,000 in Delhi. In June 1984, during Operation Blue Star, Indira Gandhi ordered the Indian Army to attack the Golden Temple and eliminate any insurgents, as it had been occupied by Sikh separatists who were stockpiling weapons. Later operations by Indian paramilitary forces were initiated to clear the separatists from the countryside of Punjab state.
The Indian government reported 2,700 deaths in the ensuing chaos. In the aftermath of the riots, the Indian government reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the People&#x27;s Union for Civil Liberties reported &quot;at least&quot; 1,000 displaced persons. The most affected regions were the Sikh neighbourhoods in Delhi. The Central Bureau of Investigation, the main Indian investigating agency, is of the opinion that the acts of violence were organized with the support from the then Delhi police officials and the central government headed by Indira Gandhi&#x27;s son, Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv Gandhi was sworn in as Prime Minister after his mother&#x27;s death and, when asked about the riots, said &quot;when a big tree falls, the earth shakes&quot; thus trying to justify the communal strife.
There are allegations that the government destroyed evidence and shielded the guilty. The &quot;Asian Age&quot; front-page story called the government actions &quot;the Mother of all Cover-ups&quot; There are allegations that the violence was led and often perpetrated by Indian National Congress activists and sympathisers during the riots. The chief weapon used by the mobs, kerosene, was supplied by a group of Indian National Congress Party leaders who owned filling stations.

===Yazidis===

The Persecution of Yazidis has been ongoing since at least the 10th century. The Yazidi religion is regarded as devil worship by Islamists. Yazidis have been persecuted by Muslim Kurdish tribes since the 10th century, and by the Ottoman Empire from the 17th to the 20th centuries. After the 2014 Sinjar massacre of thousands of Yazidis by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Yazidis still face violence from the Turkish Armed Forces and its ally the Syrian National Army, as well as discrimination from the Kurdistan Regional Government. According to Yazidi tradition (based on oral traditions and folk songs), estimated that 74 genocides against the Yazidis have been carried out in the past 800 years.

===Zoroastrians===

Persecution of Zoroastrians is the religious persecution inflicted upon the followers of the Zoroastrian faith. The persecution of Zoroastrians occurred throughout the religion&#x27;s history. The discrimination and harassment began in the form of sparse violence and forced conversions. Muslims are recorded to have destroyed fire temples. Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called jizya.
Zoroastrian places of worship were desecrated, fire temples were destroyed and mosques were built in their place. Many libraries were burned and much of their cultural heritage was lost. Gradually an increasing number of laws were passed which regulated Zoroastrian behavior and limited their ability to participate in society. Over time, the persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased by force significantly.

Most were forced to convert due to the systematic abuse and discrimination inflicted upon them by followers of Islam. Once a Zoroastrian family was forced to convert to Islam, the children were sent to an Islamic school to learn Arabic and study the teachings of Islam, as a result some of these people lost their Zoroastrian faith. However, under the Samanids, who were Zoroastrian converts to Islam, the Persian language flourished. On occasion, the Zoroastrian clergy assisted Muslims in attacks against those whom they deemed Zoroastrian heretics.

A Zoroastrian astrologer named Mulla Gushtasp predicted the fall of the Zand dynasty to the Qajar army in Kerman. Because of Gushtasp&#x27;s forecast, the Zoroastrians of Kerman were spared by the conquering army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Despite the aforementioned favorable incident, the Zoroastrians during the Qajar dynasty remained in agony and their population continued to decline. Even during the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, many Zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to Azerbaijan. Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of their worst. During the Qajar dynasty, religious persecution of the Zoroastrians was rampant. Due to the increasing contacts with influential Parsi philanthropists such as Maneckji Limji Hataria, many Zoroastrians left Iran for India. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.

==Ethnic==

Ethnic persecution refers to perceived persecution based on ethnicity. Its meaning is parallel to that of racism, (based on race). The Rwandan genocide remains an atrocity that the indigenous Hutu and Tutsi peoples still believe is unforgivable. The Japanese occupation of China caused the death of millions of people, mostly peasants who were murdered after the Doolittle Raid in early-World War II.

===African Americans===

African Americans have faced persecution in the forms of slavery, legal discrimination, and racial violence.

===Assyrians===

Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of Yazdegerd I, Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time, they promoted Nestorian Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose Zoroastrianism continued during the reign of Yazdegerd II.

During the eras of Mongol rule under Genghis Khan and Timur, there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran.

More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the Massacres of Badr Khan, the Massacres of Diyarbakır (1895), the Adana massacre, the Assyrian genocide, the Simele massacre, and the al-Anfal campaign.

===Hazara people===

The Hazara people of central Afghanistan have been persecuted by Afghan rulers at various times in the history. Since the tragedy of 9/11, Sunni Muslim terrorists have been attacking the Hazara community in southwestern Pakistani town of Quetta, home to some 500,000 Hazara who fled persecution in neighbouring Afghanistan. Some 2,400 men, women and children have been killed or wounded with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claiming responsibility for most of the attacks against the community. Consequently, many thousands have fled the country seeking asylum in Australia.

===Roma===
Antiziganism is hostility, prejudice, discrimination or racism directed against the Romani people as an ethnic group, or people who are perceived as being of Romani heritage.

The &quot;Porajmos&quot; was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a genocide, during World War II by the government of Nazi Germany and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of Adolf Hitler, a supplementary decree to the Nuremberg Laws was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as &quot;enemies of the race-based state&quot;, the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews. Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time. Ian Hancock puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million.

===Rohingyas===
The UN human rights chief slammed Myanmar&#x27;s apparent &quot;systematic attack&quot; on the Rohingya minority, warning that &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; seemed to be underway.
Ethnic Rohingya Muslims who fled from security forces in Myanmar&#x27;s Rakhine State have described killings, shelling, and arson in their villages that have all the hallmarks of a campaign of “ethnic cleansing,” Human Rights Watch said.
“Rohingya refugees have harrowing accounts of fleeing Burmese army attacks and watching their villages be destroyed,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. “Lawful operations against armed groups do not involve burning the local population out of their homes.” 

===Sri Lankan Tamils===

Widespread attacks on Sri Lankan Tamils came in the form of island wide ethnic riots, including The 1958 anti-Tamil pogrom and the Black July riots. Further persecution through murders, targeted rape and kidnapping occurred. Whilst previously, the majority of Tamils demanded instead for a separate state, by 1983 armed struggles against Sinhalese extremists began to rise, culminating in the formation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

===Uyghurs===
Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in modern-day Xinjiang (called East Turkestan by independence activists) declared two short-lived independent East Turkestan Republics in the 20th century. In late 1949, the region and the rest of China came under the control of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Uyghur activist groups have said that anger towards the Chinese government has been fueled by years of state-sponsored oppression and discrimination. In 2017, the China began a large-scale crackdown on the Xinjiang region, which it justifies as a counterterrorism campaign following sporadic terrorist attacks in Xinjiang. Scholars estimate that the Chinese government detained over one million Uyghurs in internment camps (also called re-education camps) in order to indoctrinate them away from religion and Sinicize them (assimilate them into Chinese culture). Critics of the policy have described it as the Sinicization of Xinjiang and they have also called it an ethnocide or a cultural genocide, while some governments, activists, independent NGOs, human rights organizations, academics, government officials, and the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile have called it a genocide.

==Based on genetics==

===People with albinism===

Persecution on the basis of albinism is frequently based on the belief that albinos are inferior to persons with higher concentration of melanin in their skin. As a result, albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistic people dug up and desecrated. Such people have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring &quot;bad&quot; luck in some areas. Haiti also has a long history of treating albinistic people as accursed, with the highest incidence under the influence of François &quot;Papa Doc&quot; Duvalier.

==People with autism==

People with autism spectrum disorders have commonly been victims of persecution, both throughout history and in the present era. In Cameroon children with autism are commonly accused of witchcraft and singled out for torture and even death.

Additionally, it is speculated that many of the disabled children murdered during Action T4 in Nazi Germany may have been autistic, making autistic people among the first victims of The Holocaust.

==LGBT==
A number of countries, especially those countries in the Western world, have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against sexual minorities, including laws against anti-gay hate crimes and workplace discrimination. Some countries have also legalized same-sex marriages or civil unions in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as those which are granted to opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the United Nations passed its first resolution which recognizes LGBT rights and, in 2015, same-sex marriages were legalized in all states of the United States.

<text>George Joseph Herriman III (August 22, 1880 – April 25, 1944) was an American cartoonist best known for the comic strip &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; (1913–1944). More influential than popular, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; had an appreciative audience among those in the arts. Gilbert Seldes&#x27; article &quot;The Krazy Kat Who Walks by Himself&quot; was the earliest example of a critic from the high arts giving serious attention to a comic strip. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; placed the strip first on its list of the greatest comics of the 20th century. Herriman&#x27;s work has been a primary influence on cartoonists such as Elzie C. Segar, Will Eisner, Charles M. Schulz, Robert Crumb, Art Spiegelman, Bill Watterson, and Chris Ware.

Herriman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to mixed-race Creole parents, and grew up in Los Angeles. After he graduated from high school in 1897, he worked in the newspaper industry as an illustrator and engraver. He moved on to cartooning and comic strips—a medium then in its infancy—and drew a variety of strips until he introduced his most famous character, Krazy Kat, in his strip &quot;The Dingbat Family&quot; in 1910. A &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; daily strip began in 1913, and from 1916 the strip also appeared on Sundays. It was noted for its poetic, dialect-heavy dialogue; its fantastic, shifting backgrounds; and its bold, experimental page layouts.

In the strip&#x27;s main motif and dynamic, Ignatz Mouse pelted Krazy with bricks, which the naïve, androgynous Kat interpreted as symbols of love. As the strip progressed, a love triangle developed between Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp. Pupp made it his mission to prevent Ignatz from throwing bricks at Krazy, or to jail him for having done so, but his efforts were perpetually impeded because Krazy wished to be struck by Ignatz&#x27;s bricks.

Herriman lived most of his life in Los Angeles, but made frequent trips to the Navajo deserts in the Southwestern United States. He was drawn to the landscapes of Monument Valley and the Enchanted Mesa, and made Coconino County the location of his &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strips. His artwork made much use of Navajo and Mexican themes and motifs against shifting desert backgrounds. He was a prolific cartoonist who produced a large number of strips and illustrated Don Marquis&#x27;s books of poetry about &quot;Archy and Mehitabel&quot;, an alley cat and a cockroach. Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst was a proponent of Herriman and gave him a lifetime contract with King Features Syndicate, which guaranteed Herriman a comfortable living and an outlet for his work despite its lack of popularity.

==Biography==

===1880–1900: Early life===

George Joseph Herriman was born at 348 Villere Street in New Orleans on August 22, 1880. He was born into a mixed-race family and came from a line of French-speaking Louisiana Creole mulattoes who were considered free people of color, and were reportedly active in the early abolitionist movement. His paternal great-grandfather, Stephen Herriman, was a white New Yorker who had children with Justine Olivier, a free woman of color, and owned a tailor shop on Royal Street in New Orleans. His paternal grandmother was born in Havana, Cuba. His parents were (1850–1923), born in New Orleans, and Clara Morel Herriman (1857–1911), born in Iberville. The family attended St. Augustine Catholic Church in New Orleans&#x27; Tremé neighborhood.

When he was ten, Herriman and his family moved to Los Angeles, where he grew up south of downtown near Main Street and Washington Boulevard. His father worked there as a tailor. Herriman attended the Catholic boys&#x27; school St. Vincent&#x27;s College (now Loyola High School). Soon after graduating in 1897, he sold a sketch of the Hotel Petrolia in Santa Paula to the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot;. This landed him a $2-per-week job there as an assistant in the engraving department, where he occasionally did drawings for advertisements and political cartoons.

===1900–1905: Early career in New York===

When he was 20, Herriman clandestinely boarded a freight train bound for New York City, hoping his chances as an artist would be better there. He was unsuccessful at first, and survived by working as a barker and billboard painter at Coney Island, until one of the leading humor magazines of the day, &quot;Judge&quot;, accepted some of his cartoons. Between June 15 and October 26, 1901, eleven of his cartoons appeared in that magazine&#x27;s pages, in the heavily crosshatched style of the day. He often used sequential images in his cartoons, as in the emerging comic strip medium. On September 29 that year, his first real comic strips were published, one in the Pulitzer chain of newspapers on a non-contractual, one-shot basis and another on a continuing basis in the Philadelphia North American Syndicate&#x27;s first comic strip supplement. His first color comic strips appeared in the T. C. McClure Syndicate beginning October 20.

His success with these syndicated strips convinced Herriman to give up on magazine submissions. For the Pulitzer papers on February 16, 1902, he began his first strip that had a continuing character, &quot;Musical Mose&quot;. The strip featured an African-American musician who impersonated other ethnicities, only to suffer the consequences when discovered by his audience. &quot;Professor Otto and his Auto&quot;, about a terrifyingly dangerous driver, followed in March, and &quot;Acrobatic Archie&quot;, a &quot;kid strip&quot; with a child protagonist, first appeared in April. With his future as a cartoonist seemingly assured, Herriman traveled back to Los Angeles to marry his childhood sweetheart and returned with her to New York.

In the November 1902 issue of the literary magazine &quot;The Bookman&quot;, Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, in an article in that issue titled &quot;The American Comic and Caricature Art&quot;, wrote, &quot;Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman. Were his drawings not so well known one would think he had mistaken his vocation.&quot; Herriman&#x27;s work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as &quot;Two Jolly Jackies&quot; about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903. He began drawing the cowboy strip &quot;Lariat Pete&quot; in September for the McClure syndicate after &quot;Two Jolly Jackies&quot; was ended.

In June, Herriman was employed by the &quot;New York World&quot;. There, he illustrated Roy McCardell&#x27;s commentaries on local events, beginning June 28 and running to the year&#x27;s end. Herriman still produced syndicate work, such as &quot;Major Ozone&#x27;s Fresh Air Crusade&quot; for the World Color Printing Company beginning January 2, 1904. Another of Herriman&#x27;s obsessive characters, the Major traveled the world in an unsuccessful search for the purest air and spouted poetic dialogue. &quot;Major Ozone&quot; was so popular that it soon was given the supplement&#x27;s front page. The same month, Herriman moved from the &quot;World&quot; to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, where he was given a larger quantity and variety of work, including cartoon reporting on sports and politics. In February and March, he had a short-lived continuing character comic strip about domestic life called &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. That spring, he began illustrating a series of articles written by Walter Murphy called &quot;Bubblespikers&quot;.

Rudolph Block hired Herriman for the Hearst papers with &quot;a salary commensurate with his talents&quot;, starting April 22 at the &quot;New York American&quot;, which ran no daily comic strips at the time. Herriman drew sports cartoons in an office alongside Frederick Burr Opper, James Swinnerton, and Tad Dorgan, who was popularly known as &quot;Tad&quot; and was considered a star at another Hearst paper, the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;. Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends. In 1924, Tad called Herriman &quot;one of the best sporting artists in the world&quot; and regretted that Herriman no longer did that kind of work. Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905, when he left the paper, possibly because of the new sports editor&#x27;s unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists. He returned to Los Angeles in the latter half of 1905.

===1905–1910: Return to California===

In California, Herriman continued to mail in work to the World Color Printing Company. He revived &quot;Major Ozone&quot; and produced &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Girl—Likewise Bud Smith&quot;, which he combined from two earlier strips, and a two-tiered children&#x27;s strip, &quot;Rosy Posy—Mama&#x27;s Girl&quot;. He began to work with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on January 8, 1906, before returning to Hearst that summer. Accompanying a front-page illustration in Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, Herriman was announced as &quot;the &quot;Examiner&quot;″s cartoonist&quot; on August 21. His artwork began to appear on nearly every page, resulting in greatly increased sales for the newspaper. In October, he stopped working for World Color.

Following the success of Bud Fisher&#x27;s daily strip &quot;A. Mutt&quot;, which debuted in late 1907, Herriman began a similarly sports-themed daily strip starting December 10 called &quot;Mr. Proones the Plunger&quot;. The strip was not as successful as Fisher&#x27;s, and it ceased to appear after December 26.

&quot;Mary&#x27;s Home from College&quot;, a precursor to the popular &quot;girl strips&quot; such as Cliff Sterrett&#x27;s &quot;Polly and Her Pals&quot; and John Held Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Merely Margie&quot;, ran from February 19, 1909 until January 4, 1910. His next comic strip, &quot;Baron Mooch&quot;, starring the titular freeloader, debuted in the &quot;Examiner&quot; on October 12, 1909. Herriman began two more strips in November 1909 with the World Color Printing Company—&quot;Alexander the Cat&quot; and &quot;Daniel and Pansy&quot;, which both appeared in color. &quot;Daniel and Pansy&quot; was Herriman&#x27;s first strip to feature an all-animal cast. This was followed in the &quot;Examiner&quot; on December 23 by &quot;Gooseberry Sprig&quot;, about an aristocratic, cigar-smoking duck who had previously and popularly appeared in Herriman&#x27;s sports cartoons. The bird-populated fantasy was a precursor to &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and many of its characters reappeared in the later strip.

===1910–1922: New York again, and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;===

In 1910, the sports editor of the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; called Herriman back to New York to cover for Tad Dorgan who was in San Francisco covering the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; between Jack Johnson and Jim Jeffries. Six days after arriving in New York, Herriman began &quot;The Dingbat Family&quot;, starring E. Pluribus Dingbat and his family. Herriman used typed lettering on the strip on July 26, 1910, but quickly went back to hand-lettering. On August 10, 1910, Herriman retitled the strip &quot;The Family Upstairs&quot;. The original title returned after the strip of November 15, 1911, when the Dingbats&#x27; building was demolished to make room for a department store and they and their upstairs nemeses parted paths.

Critics do not regard the strip highly, but it provided the vehicle for a fruitful situation: in the July 26 episode, a mouse threw a brick at the family cat—called &quot;Kat&quot;—which hit the cat on the head. The antics of this mouse and &quot;Kat&quot; continued to appear in the bottom portion of &quot;The Dingbat Family&quot;. Herriman said he did this &quot;to fill up the waste space&quot;. About a month after its first appearance, the &quot;Kat&quot; crept up on the sleeping mouse and kissed it loudly. The mouse awoke saying, &quot;I dreamed an angel kissed me&quot;, while the &quot;Kat&quot; crept away and said, &quot;Sweet thing&quot;.

The gender of &quot;Kat&quot; was unclear from the start. Herriman experimented with a decision about the character&#x27;s gender, but it remained ambiguous and he would refer to &quot;Kat&quot; as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; as he saw fit. Herriman incorporated unusual details into the mini-strip&#x27;s backgrounds such as cacti, pagodas, fanciful vegetation, or anything else that struck his fancy; this became a signature of the later &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strip. The cast grew and soon included the mainstay character Bull Pupp and characters from the &quot;Gooseberry Sprigg&quot; strip. The strip&#x27;s characters, relations and situations grew organically during its lifetime, encouraged by Herriman&#x27;s colleagues.

The cat-and-mouse substrip was gaining in popularity; instead of filling up space in the bottom of &quot;The Dingbat Family&quot;″s panels, it began to occupy a tier of panels of its own. In July 1912, while Herriman had the Dingbats on vacation, Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse took over the strip, which was retitled &quot;Krazy Kat and I. Mouse&quot; for the duration. On October 28, 1913, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; debuted as an independent strip on the daily comics page.

Only Hearst&#x27;s personal support allowed the strip to continue, as the reception from the readers showed zero interest or enthusiasm according to comics historian Bill Blackbeard. But it was liked by famous artists and writers such as Willem de Kooning, Picasso and Edwin Denby, and later by E. E. Cummings, Jack Kerouac and Umberto Eco.

During the first few years of publication, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;″s humor changed from slapstick to a more vaudevillian kind. The shifting backgrounds became increasingly bizarre, presaging things to come. The strip expanded to a full-page black-and-white Sunday strip on April 23, 1916. Herriman made full use of his imagination and used the whole page in the strip&#x27;s layout. The strips were unlike anything else on the comics page; spontaneous, formally daring, yet impeccably composed.

Herriman visited Monument Valley in Arizona and similar places in New Mexico and southern Utah, and incorporated the distinct forms of the desert landscape into his strips. The Enchanted Mesa of New Mexico first appeared in &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; in the summer of 1916. Herriman may have visited after reading an article by Theodore Roosevelt in 1913, but he may have gone earlier—the desert Coconino County, Arizona, that became the backdrop to &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was first mentioned in a 1911 &quot;The Dingbat Family&quot; strip, though the real Coconino County was located further southwest than Herriman&#x27;s fanciful version.

&quot;The Dingbat Family&quot; finished in 1916 and was replaced by &quot;Baron Bean&quot;″s debut the next day. The strip&#x27;s title character, The Baron, was an impoverished English nobleman, a tramp inspired by Charles Dickens and Charlie Chaplin. He and his valet Grimes would plot ways to get by. Herriman later introduced the main characters&#x27; wives, and after a run as a domestic strip, with occasional appearances of characters from Krazy Kat&#x27;s world, it ended in January 1919. It was replaced the next day by &quot;Now Listen Mabel&quot;, which was about a young man courting a young woman; he would be caught in a compromising situation, which he would try to explain away with &quot;Now listen Mabel ...&quot; The strip lasted until that December.

&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; gained an appreciative audience in the world of the arts. The character debuted in film in 1916. The first animated films starring a cat were produced by Hearst&#x27;s International Film Service, though without Herriman&#x27;s direct involvement. In 1922, Adolph Bolm choreographed a jazz-pantomime &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; ballet written by John Alden Carpenter. It was first performed in New York in 1922 by Ballet Intime, and Herriman illustrated the libretto and designed the costumes and scenario. While it was not a great success, the critics Deems Taylor, Stark Young and Henrietta Straus wrote favorably about it. The strip itself was the subject of an article by literary critic Gilbert Seldes called &quot;Golla, Golla the Comic Strip&#x27;s Art&quot;, which appeared in the May 1922 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Seldes expanded this article as part of his book on the popular arts, &quot;The Seven Lively Arts&quot; (1924), in which Seldes argued against conservative tendencies that excluded artists in the popular arts, such as Herriman and Chaplin, from being considered alongside traditional artists. &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was the subject of a chapter entitled &quot;The Krazy Kat That Walks by Himself&quot;, which is the most famous piece of writing about the strip and the earliest example of a critic from the world of high art giving legitimacy to the comic strip medium. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in the April 1923 issue.

===1922–1944: California again, later career and death===

Hearst, an admirer of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, had given Herriman a lifetime contract with his company King Features Syndicate, which gave Herriman the security to live anywhere he wanted. In 1922, he moved back to Hollywood, into a two-story Spanish-style home at 1617 North Sierra Bonita, from where he made frequent visits to the Arizona desert. Herriman developed ties with members of the film industry; he knew Hal Roach Studio members Tom McNamara and &quot;Beanie&quot; Walker from their newspaper days. Walker, Herriman&#x27;s best friend, was the head writer on the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts. In the early 1920s, Herriman occasionally drew his strips at the Roach Studio. He met celebrities, including Will Rogers and Frank Capra, and presented them with hand-colored drawings. He loved Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s films, and reviewed &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; in the magazine &quot;Motion Picture Classics&quot; in October 1925.

Autumn 1922 saw the first daily installment of &quot;Stumble Inn&quot;, the first non-&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strip Herriman had drawn since 1919. A verbose strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters. The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.

From August 1925 until September 1929, King Features required that Herriman design the &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; Sundays so that they could be run either as a full Sunday page or as two four-panel dailies. Herriman lamented intrusion on his page designs, and the artwork of the period took on a rushed look. He was made to focus on the strip&#x27;s characterization, and during this period, the Krazy—Ignatz—Offisa Pupp love triangle for which the strip is remembered became fully developed. Pupp pined for Krazy, Krazy loved Ignatz, and Ignatz hated Krazy and pelted the annoying &quot;Kat&quot; with a brick, and Pupp imprisoned Ignatz.

Throughout the late 1920s, Herriman made frequent trips to Kayenta, Arizona, in Navajo country about from Monument Valley. He also made winter trips to Mexico. The desert, Navajo artwork, and Mexican pottery and architecture became more prominent in Herriman&#x27;s strips, and he sometimes used Spanish vocabulary in the dialogue. Herriman did little work on these excursions, and it is likely that he drew his strips in hurried bursts when in Hollywood.

&quot;Stumble Inn&quot; finished in late 1925, and it was replaced with the domestic strip &quot;Us Husbands&quot; (with &quot;Mistakes Will Happen&quot; as a &quot;topper&quot; strip), which ran until the end of that year. In 1928, Herriman took over the strip &quot;Embarrassing Moments&quot;, which had begun in 1922 and had been drawn by several cartoonists. The strip eventually became &quot;Bernie Burns&quot;, in which embarrassing moments would happen to the title character. The strip appeared in few papers, and after it ended in 1932, Herriman worked only on &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, although he provided illustrations for Don Marquis&#x27; popular &quot;Archy and Mehitabel&quot;, a series of books of poetry about a cat and a cockroach.

In 1930, Herriman sold his first Hollywood home to a friend and moved his family to 2217 Maravilla Drive, a Spanish-style mansion atop a hill. It was adorned with paintings of Southwest and Native themes, and had a Mexican-style garden paved with flagstones and decorated with painted pots and tropical plants. Herriman later bought the lot across the street and turned it into a public park.

The 1930s were a period of tragedy for Herriman. On September 29, 1931, his wife Mabel died after an automobile accident, and in 1939, his youngest daughter Bobbie died unexpectedly at 31.

After his wife&#x27;s death, Herriman never remarried and lived in Los Angeles with his cats and dogs. He developed a close relationship with cartoonist James Swinnerton&#x27;s first wife Louise, with whom he frequently exchanged letters. Herriman underwent a kidney operation in spring 1938, and during his ten-week convalescence King Features reran old &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strips.
&quot;Krazy Kat&quot;″s popularity fell considerably over the years, and by the 1930s it was running in only thirty-five newspapers, while its contemporaries such as &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; were reportedly running in up to a thousand. By some accounts, Herriman&#x27;s salary from Hearst&#x27;s King Features Syndicate was $750 a week, and, realizing that this was far more than the revenue the strip could be generating, Herriman once offered to take a pay cut, which Hearst refused; however, according to Michael Tisserand&#x27;s biography on Herriman from 2016, there exists no evidence of the story that Herriman ever suggested to take a pay cut, or that his salary was $750 a week.

From 1935, &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; appeared in color, of which Herriman made bold use. He reduced the amount of hatchwork and used larger, more open panels.

Herriman died in his sleep in his home near Hollywood on April 25, 1944, after a long illness. An incompletely inked penciling of a week&#x27;s worth of daily strips was found on his drawing board. On his death certificate, the cause of death was listed as &quot;non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver&quot;, and despite his mixed-race heritage, he was listed as &quot;caucasian&quot;. The &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; ran a front-page obituary. His funeral at Little Church of Flowers at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was attended by few. Cartoonist Harry Hershfield spoke at the funeral, saying, &quot;If ever there was a saint on earth, it was George Herriman&quot;. According to his request, his body was cremated and his remains were scattered over Monument Valley.

On June 25, 1944, two months after Herriman&#x27;s death, the last of his completed &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strips, a full-page Sunday, was printed. At the time, Hearst usually engaged new cartoonists when the artists of popular strips quit or died, but he made an exception for Herriman, as he felt that no one could take his place.

==Personal life==

Herriman was described as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed. The &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;″s obituary described him as a devoted husband and father, of slight build, mild-mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities. He was generous to his friends, and sold his first Hollywood house, which he had bought for $50,000, to a friend for $40,000. Though a private person, he was said to be an entertaining host to his friends. He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes, which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think. His favorite game was poker, which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists.

Herriman had a great love of animals, and had a large number of dogs and cats; he had five dogs and thirteen cats in 1934. He usually kept to a vegetarian diet, except when it made him feel too weak, and he refused to ride horses. He so admired Henry Ford&#x27;s pacifist stance that he would only buy Ford automobiles. He purchased a new model annually.

Herriman married his childhood sweetheart Mabel Lillian Bridge in Los Angeles on July 7, 1902. They had two daughters: Mabel (1903-1962), nicknamed &quot;Toodles&quot; (later &quot;Toots&quot;) and Barbara (1908-1939), nicknamed &quot;Bobbie&quot;, who had epilepsy and died unexpectedly in 1939 at the age of 31.

==Race and identity==

Herriman was born to mixed-race parents, and his birth certificate lists Herriman as &quot;colored&quot;. In the post–&quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; U.S., in which &quot;separate but equal&quot; racial segregation was enshrined, people of mixed race had to choose to identify themselves as either black or white. Herriman seems to have identified himself as white. According to comics academic Jeet Heer, his early work is &quot;replete with black caricatures&quot;, such as &quot;Musical Mose&quot;, in which the lead character, an African-American musician, wishes his &quot;color would fade&quot;. Racial ambivalence crept into &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, such as on two occasions where Krazy&#x27;s black fur was dyed white. Ignatz falls in love with the whitened Krazy, only to return to hatred and brick-throwing when the truth is revealed. Similarly, in an oft-repeated joke, Ignatz would accidentally become covered with coal dust and would be spurned by the normally love-struck Krazy. In one such episode, a brick thrown by the blackened Ignatz hits Krazy, who declares, &quot;A lil Eetiopium Mice, black like a month from midnights. Fuwi!&quot; Once Ignatz reverts to his white self, Krazy loves him again.

Herriman&#x27;s ethnic heritage was unknown to his colleagues. Fellow cartoonist Tad Dorgan nicknamed him &quot;the Greek&quot;, a label which stuck and was taken up by his biographers and the press, who called him the son of a Greek baker. At other times, he was identified as French, Irish, and Turkish. He told a friend that he was Creole, and speculated that he may have &quot;Negro blood&quot; in him, as he had &quot;kinky hair&quot;. The friend said that Herriman wore a hat to hide his hair, which may have been an attempt to pass as white. Herriman said that he dreamed of being reborn a Navajo. On his death certificate, he was listed as &quot;Caucasian&quot;, and his daughter Mabel had his father&#x27;s birthplace listed as Paris and his mother&#x27;s as Alsace-Lorraine.

Sociologist Arthur Asa Berger made Herriman&#x27;s mixed-race heritage known in 1971. While researching for Herriman&#x27;s entry for the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot;, Berger discovered the cartoonist&#x27;s race was listed as &quot;colored&quot; on his birth certificate obtained from the New Orleans Board of Health. The 1880 census for New Orleans listed his parents as &quot;mulatto&quot;. On reading this, African-American poet Ishmael Reed dedicated his 1972 novel &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot; to &quot;George Herriman, Afro-American, who created Krazy Kat&quot;. Herriman came to be identified as Black or Creole in comics literature, including his first book-length biography, &quot;Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman&quot; (1986), while the &quot;Greek&quot; label stuck with some biographers, and was used by Bill Blackbeard in his introductions to the &quot;Krazy and Ignatz&quot; volumes in the early 2000s. Later research at the New Orleans Public Library by cartoonist Brian Nelson showed that Herriman&#x27;s maternal grandmother was born in Havana, Cuba, that all his relatives were listed as &quot;mulatto&quot; on the 1890 census, and that Herriman may also have had Spanish or Native American ancestry.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was popular with intellectuals, artists and critics, and in the 1920s Herriman&#x27;s modernist touches received praise. In 1921, composer John Alden Carpenter, who had long been an admirer of Herriman&#x27;s work, approached him to collaborate on a &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; ballet. President Woodrow Wilson refused to miss any installment of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and would take it into cabinet meetings.

Writer E. B. White praised Herriman&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;Archy and Mehitabel&quot;. Cartoonist Edward Sorel wrote that &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;″s lack of popularity later in its run was largely due to Hearst&#x27;s editorial policies, in that the &quot;lowbrow&quot; readership at whom he aimed his papers was unlikely to appreciate Herriman&#x27;s style of work, though Hearst personally championed the strip. Following Herriman&#x27;s death, the strip was discontinued, unlike most popular strips which were continued by other cartoonists after their creators&#x27; deaths. His stature was such that decades after his death, his work was displayed in art galleries.

Critics found Herriman&#x27;s work difficult to classify and contextualize; Seldes, , and writers Adam Gopnik and Robert Warshow were among critics who tempered their enthusiasm for the strip with qualifications about its perceived naïveté and its &quot;lowbrow&quot; origins on the comic strip page.

The strip has had a lasting influence on a large number of cartoonists. &quot;Mutts&quot; creator Patrick McDonnell calls &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; one of his foremost influences, and is co-author of &quot;Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman&quot; (1986). Will Eisner discovered Herriman&#x27;s comics when he was selling newspapers in the 1930s and called &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; &quot;the big strong influence&quot; on his own work. Art Spiegelman called Herriman one of his &quot;conscious influences&quot;. Herriman&#x27;s widespread influence on American , particularly his shape-shifting, psychedelic backgrounds, lack of respect for convention and his irreverence, is evident in the work of Robert Crumb, Denis Kitchen, and Bobby London. Journalist Paul Krassner called Crumb &quot;the illegitimate offspring of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;&quot;. Cartoonist Chris Ware was so taken with Herriman&#x27;s work he made a pilgrimage to Monument Valley to see the desert landscapes that inspired much of Herriman&#x27;s art.

&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was a primary influence on other cartoonists such as Charles M. Schulz of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, Bill Watterson of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;, and the Italian Massimo Mattioli. Walt Kelly paid homage to Herriman in some of his &quot;Pogo&quot; strips. Dr. Seuss expressed fondness for &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and children&#x27;s literature scholar Philip Nel has detected Herriman&#x27;s influence in Seuss&#x27;s works, especially in his zig-zagging, Coconino County-like backgrounds. Multimedia artist Öyvind Fahlström appropriated &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; in a series of works from 1963 to 1965. Jay Cantor published a postmodern novel in 1987 called &quot;Krazy Kat: A Novel in Five Panels&quot;, in which the retired Krazy and Ignatz contemplate a comeback in a post-atomic world.

Since 1997, the Small Press Expo has held the annual Ignatz Awards in honor of Herriman&#x27;s mouse from &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;. It recognizes talent in independent comics publishing. &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was ranked first on &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;″s list of the greatest comics of the twentieth century. The Society of Illustrators inducted Herriman into its Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Work==

===Style===

Within the seeming strictures of the strip—the recurring characters, the Krazy–Ignatz–Offisa Pupp love triangle—Herriman improvised freely with the story, the shifting backgrounds, and the sex of the &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;″s title character. Among the multicultural influences Herriman mixed in his work were those of the Navajo and Mexican. He made creative use of language with a poetical sense, employing multilingual puns in a fanciful mix of dialects from different ethnic backgrounds. Herriman used metafictional techniques associated with postmodernism; his characters were self-aware, he frequently drew attention to himself and his drawings as drawings in his strips, and he emphasized the subjectivity of language and experience.

Herriman drew with what cartoonist Edward Sorel called a &quot;liberated, spontaneous-looking style  ...  a cartoon counterpart of expressionism&quot;. It was organic, and his pen strokes had a dynamic, thick-and-thin range which Sorel describes as instantly recognizable and difficult to imitate. The &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; Sunday pages showed Herriman experimenting most freely—each had a unique panel layout and logo, and the jumbled panels could be circles, irregular shapes, or borderless. In his last few years, Herriman&#x27;s arthritis led to an ever-scratchier style of art; he used a knife to scratch out whites from inked surfaces, giving the artwork the look of a woodcut.

===Collections===

&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; has been collected in a variety of formats over the years, though Herriman&#x27;s other strips have been less frequently reprinted. &quot;George Herriman&#x27;s Krazy Kat&quot; (1946) was the first &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; collection; it featured an introduction by poet . Comics historian Bill Blackbeard began compiling a complete collection of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; Sundays beginning in 1988, but the publisher Eclipse Comics went bankrupt in 1992, before the series was complete. Blackbeard&#x27;s thirteen-volume &quot;Krazy and Ignatz&quot; series was published by Fantagraphics Books beginning in 2002, and was designed by Chris Ware. In 2010, Sunday Press Books released &quot;Krazy Kat: A Celebration of Sundays&quot;, which reprinted a selection of &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; Sundays and some of Herriman&#x27;s pre-&quot;Krazy Kat&quot; work in a format, which approximated the original printed size of the strips. In 2012, IDW began issuing a three-volume &quot;Baron Bean&quot; reprinting, and Fantagraphics will release &quot;George Herriman&#x27;s Stumble Inn&quot;. Fantagraphics has also announced plans to collect the complete &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; dailies at an unspecified time.

<text>Marjolein Bastin (née uit den Bogaard) (born 1943) is a Dutch nature artist, writer, children&#x27;s author and illustrator. She is the creator of the character &quot;Vera the Mouse&quot;. 

==Biography==
Bastin was born in Loenen (aan de Vecht) and studied at the Academy of Arts in Arnhem, where she met her husband and manager Gaston Bastin. Her father was educator and photographer John Henri uit den Bogaard (1911-1993). They have a daughter, Sanna (born in 1973), and a son, Mischa (born in 1974). Sanna runs the &quot;Marjolein Bastin Kadowinkel&quot; (The Marjolein Bastin Giftshop) while Mischa is a lawyer in Kansas City, USA. Marjolein and Gaston divide their time between country homes in the Netherlands and Missouri, and a tropical retreat in the Cayman Islands. 
From 1960 to 1965, Bastin worked for different advertising agencies and publishers. Shortly after completing her studies at the Academy of Arts, she was asked to illustrate a one-page feature for the popular Dutch women&#x27;s weekly Libelle. A Hallmark Cards designer discovered Bastin&#x27;s artwork while on a trip to the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Stationery, greeting cards, home décor items and gifts in Hallmark&#x27;s &quot;Nature&#x27;s Sketchbook by Marjolein Bastin&quot; line are among the company&#x27;s best-selling offerings. Many of her drawings are available as cross-stitch patterns, through Lanarte. Heye Puzzles offer Bastin&#x27;s work as jigsaw puzzles.

In &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in 2003 she is quoted as saying, &quot;I love the familiar and ordinary&quot; and, &quot;[t]he world that lies before us every day is just as beautiful as what&#x27;s exotic and rare. Nature makes us all rich.&quot;

In &quot;Country Living&quot; in 2004 her garden was described as combining both formal manicured lines (e.g. topiary) along with &quot;wild and woolly habitats&quot; to encourage visits from a variety of different animals.

<text>Walter Marvin Knott (December 11, 1889 – December 3, 1981) was an American farmer and businessman who founded the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm amusement park in Buena Park, California, introduced and mass-marketed the boysenberry, and founded the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm food brand.

== Early life ==
Knott was born on December 11, 1889, in San Bernardino, California. His parents were Rev. Elgin Charles Knott, a Southern Methodist minister originally from Tennessee, and Margaret Virginia Daugherty Knott. Knott&#x27;s father was a preacher at a church in Santa Ana, California when he was born.

When Elgin died of tuberculosis in 1896, Margaret moved Walter and his brother to Pomona, California. Walter Knott had aspirations of being a farmer from a very young age, and ended his formal schooling at age 16 (which was legal in California at the time) in order to start working.

== Career ==

=== Early efforts ===
Knott was adept at growing produce, and would rent vacant lots around Pomona to grow produce to contribute to his family&#x27;s income. At the time he married Cordelia Hornaday in 1911, Knott was working for a cement contractor.

In 1913, Knott homesteaded on 160 acres in the Mojave Desert near Newberry Springs and made his first effort at farming, which was unsuccessful. Knott tried farming again in 1917 near Shandon, California—growing produce to feed the employees of a cattle ranch and selling the excess supply for his own profit. This enterprise proved to be more successful, as Knott and Cordelia made enough money to pay off all his debts and had become a major supplier of produce for the area.

=== Arrival in Buena Park ===

In 1920, Knott went into a partnership with one of his cousins, berry grower Jim Preston, to farm 20 acres of land in Buena Park, California. In 1923, Knott set up a small berry stand on the property, facing Grand Avenue (now Beach Boulevard) to sell their produce to locals and tourists on their way to the beach. At the end of their original lease in 1927, Parsons decided to go off on his own and Knott purchased the Buena Park farm from his landlord, William H. Coughran.

The next year, in addition to a new house for his family, Knott built an 80-foot-long stucco building on the farm to house a new berry market, a nursery, and a tea room for Cordelia to sell hamburgers, sandwiches, and pies (Cordelia cooked the food in the Knott family kitchen). When the Great Depression began in 1929, Knott started buying parcels around the farm as the price of land dropped.

In 1934, Knott introduced the hybrid boysenberry, named after its creator, Rudolph Boysen. The previous year, Knott had secured cuttings from Boysen&#x27;s dilapidated berry plant—which was a cross between a blackberry, red raspberry and loganberry—and planted and cultivated it at his own farm. The plant produced huge berries, and Knott integrated the boysenberry into all of his products as well as Cordelia&#x27;s tea room menu.

The same year, Cordelia had an idea to serve fried chicken dinners at her tea room. The chicken was a huge hit and the tea room was expanded into a full restaurant over the next six years. Lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long.

=== Building an amusement park ===

To entertain the waiting chicken restaurant crowds, Knott built several roadside attractions, exhibits and shops, culminating in the building of a western ghost town on the property in 1940. Knott had an interest in American history, particularly the Old West, and purchased buildings from many old ghost towns around the west (California, Arizona, Nevada and other states). The buildings were dismantled, trucked down to Buena Park, and reassembled on the farm. Knott gradually added to the ghost town over the next few years—including a saloon show, melodrama theater, and a full-scale railroad.

Other attractions came in later years: a San Francisco cable car, a pan-for-gold experience, a stagecoach ride, the Calico Mine Train dark ride, the Timber Mountain Log Ride log flume ride, and a Mexican-themed area. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged gate admission for the first time, and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm officially became an amusement park.

Even after Disneyland Park opened in 1955 only eight miles away in Anaheim, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm continued to thrive. Walt Disney and Walter Knott had a cordial relationship. Knott and Cordelia attended the opening of Disneyland in July of 1955 and Walt Disney visited Knott&#x27;s on several occasions both before and after Disneyland opened. The Knotts and the Disneys even dined at a local Chinese restaurant not far from Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. They were both members of the original planning council for Children&#x27;s Hospital of Orange County.

=== Semi-retirement ===
Walter Knott remained active in the operation of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm until Cordelia&#x27;s death in 1974, at which point he left day-to-day park operations to his children and focused on political causes.

== Death and legacy ==
On December 3, 1981, just eight days shy of his 92nd birthday, Walter Knott died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Buena Park, California. Knott is buried at Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton, California.

Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm continues to operate year-round today. The Knott family remained owners of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm until 1997, when the park was sold to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (now Six Flags Entertainment Corporation) for $300 million.

The J.M. Smucker Co. owns the &quot;Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm&quot; brand of jams, jellies, and snack foods—which Sumcker purchased from ConAgra Foods in 2008. Smucker discontinued selling Knott&#x27;s branded products in 2024.

== Personal life ==

Walter Knott married his high school sweetheart, Cordelia Hornaday, on June 3, 1911. They had four children: Virginia, Russell, Rachel, and Marion.

After leaving his business operations to his children following the death of his wife on April 12, 1974, Knott focused his attention on conservative politics. Knott was active in a variety of conservative causes, including founding the California Free Enterprise Assistance and endowing various private schools and colleges. He campaigned for Republican politicians like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Knott was also a member of the John Birch Society and sponsored its Orange County chapter.

Through his time as a struggling farmer and businessman during the Great Depression, Knott became a firm believer in rugged individualism—that anyone could be successful through hard work, and any form of government intervention was wrong. Critics say this &#x27;Old West&#x27; theme of his amusement park was a romantic and one-sided reflection of his beliefs.

Because of his interest in American pioneer history, Knott purchased and restored the real silver mining ghost town of Calico, California in 1951. As a child, Knott spent a lot of time in Calico living with his uncle. During World War I, he helped to build a silver mill in Calico. In 1966, he deeded Calico to San Bernardino County, California.

Knott appeared on the December 23, 1954, episode of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, hosted by Groucho Marx.

<text>Republica are an English alternative rock band formed in 1994. They reached the height of their popularity from 1996 to 1999. The band went on hiatus in 2001 and reunited in 2008.

The Republica sound was described by the band as &quot;technopop punk rock&quot;. The current line-up consists of Saffron (vocals), Tim Dorney (keyboards) and Johnny Male (guitar).

==History==

===1994–1997: Beginnings, debut album and international success===
Former Flowered Up keyboard player Tim Dorney and Andy Todd founded Republica. Singer Saffron was an actress at one point, performing for two years in London&#x27;s &quot;Starlight Express&quot;. She also appeared in the video for the Chesney Hawkes&#x27; hit &quot;The One and Only&quot; and in the video for N-Joi&#x27;s single &quot;Mindflux&quot;. She was also lead vocalist on N-Joi&#x27;s hit &quot;Anthem&quot; in 1990.

Republica released the first single &quot;Out of This World&quot; in 1994, followed by the single &quot;Bloke&quot; in March 1995. In April 1996, their single &quot;Ready to Go&quot; became their first to chart on the UK Singles Chart, when it reached Number 43. Their debut album &quot;Republica&quot; was released in the United States in July 1996 and reached No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart after being released there in 1997. The band added Johnny Male, formerly of early 1990s One Little Indian act Soul Family Sensation, as an official member on guitar, with &quot;Ready to Go&quot; remixed as more a rock-sounding dance track. This version became their signature single and reached No. 13. The fourth single, &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;, reached No. 7.

The group attracted positive press coverage. Emerging after a wave of female-fronted rock bands (such as Elastica, Lush, Sleeper, Echobelly and Kenickie), they had, like Curve and Garbage, a notably more aggressive and electronic sound. In 1997, they contributed a cover of &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; to the Gary Numan tribute album &quot;Random&quot;. That same year, Saffron performed vocals for the Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;Fuel My Fire&quot; from their album &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot;.

===1998–2001: &quot;Speed Ballads&quot; and dissolution===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Speed Ballads&quot;, was released in 1998 and reached No. 37 in UK Albums Chart. Its lead single, &quot;From Rush Hour With Love&quot;, peaked at No. 20 in UK Singles Chart. The band suffered when their label, Deconstruction Records, folded shortly after the release of &quot;Speed Ballads&quot;. Deconstruction&#x27;s back catalogue was swallowed up by BMG and &quot;Speed Ballads&quot; was never released in the United States. In 2001, Republica went on hiatus. On their official site it was posted the message &quot;Republica are not recording at this time&quot;.

===2002–2009: Hiatus===
In 2002 BMG released the compilation &quot;Ready to Go: The Best Of&quot; against the band&#x27;s wishes. After the band went on hiatus, Saffron worked with the Cure, appearing on the single &quot;Just Say Yes&quot; from their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album. She also collaborated with Junkie XL for his 2003 album &quot;Radio JXL: A Broadcast from the Computer Hell Cabin&quot;. In September 2008, Republica reunited at Windsor at a Contra Mundum concert. They played &quot;Ready to Go&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot; and a cover of &quot;You Got the Love&quot;.

===2010–2020: Reunion, sporadic performances and new material===
In early 2010, Republica performed a string of gigs. They also issued a remixed version of &quot;Ready to Go&quot; entitled &quot;Ready to Go 2010&quot;. In June 2010 the remix was released and reached No. 1 on the Upfront Club chart. The track has been produced by Andy Gray and Alan Moulder. In October 2010, the band performed a comeback gig at O2 Academy Islington followed by several dates in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in 2011. They performed at GuilFest in July 2012.

The band released a new EP, &quot;Christiana Obey&quot;, and also recorded a session for Brentwood radio station Phoenix FM in April 2013. A joint 20th anniversary tour with the band Space took place in the spring of 2014. In October and early November 2014, Republica toured the UK in support of the Boomtown Rats &quot;Ratlife&quot; tour and took the opportunity to premiere some new material. Friday 29 May 2015 saw the public debut of more new material when Republica performed at the &quot;Under The Bridge&quot; venue in Chelsea, London, with support from Tenek and Kenelis. A deluxe edition of &quot;Republica&quot; was released on 28 February 2020 on Cherry Red Records.

===2021–present: &quot;Damaged Gods&quot;===
The band released a new single, &quot;New York&quot; in November 2023, from their upcoming studio album &quot;Damaged Gods&quot; scheduled to be released in the spring of 2025, their first in 27 years, on Armalyte Industries. The second single off the album, &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, was released 28 June 2024.

In June 2024, Saffron announced that Steve Hewitt, former drummer of Placebo and Six by Seven, had joined Republica as the band&#x27;s live drummer.

<doc id="175946" wikidata="Q178517" url="?curid=175946" title="David Gilmour">
<text>David Jon Gilmour ( ; born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter who is a member of the rock band Pink Floyd. He joined in 1967, shortly before the departure of the founder member Syd Barrett. By the early 1980s, Pink Floyd had become one of the highest-selling and most acclaimed acts in music history. Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, Pink Floyd continued under Gilmour&#x27;s leadership and released the studio albums &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; (1987), &quot;The Division Bell&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Endless River&quot; (2014).

Gilmour has released five solo studio albums: &quot;David Gilmour&quot; (1978), &quot;About Face&quot; (1984), &quot;On an Island&quot; (2006), &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot; (2015) and &quot;Luck and Strange&quot; (2024). He has achieved three number-one solo albums on the UK Albums Chart, and six with Pink Floyd. He produced two albums by the Dream Academy, and is credited for bringing the singer-songwriter Kate Bush to public attention, paying for her early recordings and helping her find a record contract.

As a member of Pink Floyd, Gilmour was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2003, Gilmour was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He received the award for Outstanding Contribution at the 2008 Q Awards. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named him the 28th-greatest guitarist.

Gilmour has taken part in projects related to issues including animal rights, environmentalism, homelessness, poverty, and human rights. He has married twice and is the father of eight children. His wife, the novelist Polly Samson, has contributed lyrics to many of his songs.

==Early life and education==
David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England. He has three siblings: Peter, Mark and Catharine. His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (née Wilson), was a trained teacher who later worked as a film editor for the BBC. At the time of Gilmour&#x27;s birth, the family lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire; after several relocations they moved to nearby Grantchester.

Gilmour&#x27;s parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; before his enthusiasm was stirred the following year by Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, and later &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. Gilmour borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterwards, he started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger. At age 11, Gilmour began attending Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy. While there, however, he met two classmates who would later become the future members of Pink Floyd: Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, both of whom attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys also on the same road.

In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology, but despite not finishing the course, he eventually learned to speak fluent French. Barrett was also a student at the college, and the two spent their lunchtimes together practising guitar. Later that year, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild. They recorded a one-sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in Denmark Street, west London, but only 50 copies of each were made.

At age 19, Gilmour hitchhiked to Saint-Tropez, France. Barrett and his friends also drove there and met up with him before they were arrested for busking. Gilmour and Barrett later travelled to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre. During this time, he worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for the fashion designer Ossie Clark.

Gilmour travelled to France again in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment. Also while in France, Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Two Weeks in September&quot;, starring Brigitte Bardot. When he returned with Bullitt to England later that year, they could not afford petrol and had to push their bus off the ferry onto the landing.

==Career==

=== Pink Floyd ===
In 1967, Pink Floyd, composed of Gilmour&#x27;s Cambridge schoolmates Barrett and Waters with Nick Mason and Richard Wright, released their debut studio album, &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. That May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new equipment. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and was shocked to find that Barrett did not seem to recognise him after beginning to suffer mental health problems.
In December 1967, after Gilmour had returned to England, Mason invited him to join Pink Floyd to cover for the increasingly erratic Barrett. Gilmour accepted; they initially intended to continue with Barrett as a non-performing songwriter. One of the band&#x27;s business partners, Peter Jenner, said the plan was to have Gilmour &quot;cover for Barrett&#x27;s eccentricities&quot;.

By March 1968, working with Barrett had become too difficult and he agreed to leave the band. Mason later said that &quot;After Syd, Dave was the difference between light and dark. He was absolutely into form and shape and he introduced that into the wilder numbers we&#x27;d created. We became far less difficult to enjoy, I think.&quot; In 1970, Gilmour attended the Isle of Wight Festival and assisted in the live mix of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s performance.
In the 1970s, Gilmour received a copy of a demo tape by the teenage songwriter Kate Bush from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of both families. Impressed, Gilmour paid for Bush, then 16, to record three professional demo tracks to present to record labels. The tape was produced by Gilmour&#x27;s friend Andrew Powell, who went on to produce Bush&#x27;s first two studio albums, and the sound engineer Geoff Emerick. Gilmour arranged for EMI executive Terry Slater to hear the tape, and he signed her. Gilmour is credited as the executive producer on two tracks on Bush&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; (1978), including her second single &quot;The Man with the Child in His Eyes&quot;. He performed backing vocals on &quot;Pull Out the Pin&quot; on her fourth studio album, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; (1982), and played guitar on &quot;Love and Anger&quot; and &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Tail&quot; on her sixth, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; (1989). In 1975, Gilmour played on Roy Harper&#x27;s album &quot;HQ&quot; (1975).

=== First solo works ===
By the late 1970s, Gilmour had begun to think that his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd. In 1978, he released his first solo album, &quot;David Gilmour&quot;, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting. Music written during the finishing stages of the album, but too late to be used, became &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; on the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Wall&quot; (1979).

The relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the &quot;Wall&quot; film and the album &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983). This negative atmosphere led Gilmour to produce his second solo studio album, &quot;About Face&quot;, in 1984., which he used to express his feelings about a range of topics, from his relationship with Waters to the murder of John Lennon. Gilmour toured Europe and the US, supported by the Television Personalities, who were dropped after the singer, Dan Treacy, revealed Barrett&#x27;s address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists and produced the Dream Academy, including their US top-ten hit &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot; (1986).
Gilmour co-wrote five songs on Roy Harper&#x27;s album &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (1980), including &quot;Short and Sweet&quot;, which was first recorded for Gilmour&#x27;s first solo album. In April 1984, Harper made a surprise guest appearance at Gilmour&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon gig to sing &quot;Short and Sweet&quot;. This was included in Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Live 1984&quot; concert film. Harper also provided backing vocals on Gilmour&#x27;s second solo studio album &quot;About Face&quot; (1984).

In 1985, Gilmour played on Bryan Ferry&#x27;s sixth solo album, &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;, and on the song &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough&quot; for the US release of the Ridley Scott film &quot;Legend&quot; (1985). The music video for &quot;Is Your Love Strong Enough&quot; incorporated Ferry and Gilmour into footage from the film. In July that year, Gilmour played with Ferry at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London. He contributed to Pete Townshend&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;White City: A Novel&quot;, including the single &quot;Give Blood&quot;, and the 1985 Grace Jones album &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;. Gilmour also played guitar on Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1984 hit single &quot;No More Lonely Nights&quot;, on the title track of Supertramp&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Brother Where You Bound&quot; and on three tracks of the 1986 album &quot;Persona&quot; by the classical guitarist Liona Boyd.

=== Leading Pink Floyd ===
In 1985, Waters declared that Pink Floyd were &quot;a spent force creatively&quot; and attempted to dissolve the band. Gilmour and Mason announced that they intended to continue without him. Waters resigned in 1987, leaving Gilmour as the band leader. In 1986, Gilmour purchased the houseboat &quot;Astoria&quot;, moored it on the River Thames near Hampton Court, London, and converted it into a recording studio. He produced the Pink Floyd studio album &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; in 1987, with contributions from Mason and Wright. Gilmour believed Pink Floyd had become too driven by lyrics under Waters&#x27; leadership, and attempted to &quot;restore the balance&quot; of music and lyrics&quot;.&quot; In March 1987, Gilmour played guitar for Kate Bush&#x27;s performance of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; at the Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball.

Pink Floyd released their second album under Gilmour&#x27;s leadership, &quot;The Division Bell,&quot; in 1994. In December 1999, Gilmour played guitar, alongside Mick Green, Ian Paice, Pete Wingfield, and Chris Hall, for Paul McCartney, at a concert at the Cavern Club, in Liverpool, England. This resulted in the concert film &quot;Live at the Cavern Club&quot;, directed by Geoff Wonfor.

=== 2000s: Pink Floyd reunion and &quot;On an Island&quot; ===
In 2001 and 2002, Gilmour performed six acoustic solo concerts in London and Paris, along with a small band and choir, which was documented on the &quot;In Concert&quot; release. On 24 September 2004, he performed a three-song set at the Strat Pack concert at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena, marking the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster.

On 2 July 2005, Pink Floyd reunited with Waters to perform at Live 8. The performance caused a sales increase of Pink Floyd&#x27;s compilation album &quot;&quot; (2001). Gilmour donated his profits to charities that reflect the goals of Live 8, saying: &quot;Though the main objective has been to raise consciousness and put pressure on the G8 leaders, I will not profit from the concert. This is money that should be used to save lives.&quot; He called upon all Live 8 artists to donate their extra revenue to Live 8 fundraising. After the concert, Pink Floyd turned down an offer to tour the US for £150 million.
In 2006, Gilmour said that Pink Floyd would likely never tour or write material again: &quot;I think enough is enough. I am 60 years old. I don&#x27;t have the will to work as much any more. Pink Floyd was an important part in my life, I have had a wonderful time, but it&#x27;s over. For me it&#x27;s much less complicated to work alone.&quot;

On 6 March, Gilmour&#x27;s 60th birthday, he released his third solo album, &quot;On an Island&quot;. It featured guest musicians including Wright and lyrics by Gilmour&#x27;s wife, the writer Polly Samson. It debuted at number 1 on the UK Albums Chart and became Gilmour&#x27;s first solo album to enter the top ten in the US, reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. On 21 September 2011 &quot;On an Island&quot; was certified gold in Canada, with sales of more than 50,000 copies.

Gilmour toured Europe, US and Canada in May 2006, with a band including Wright and the Pink Floyd collaborators Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, and Jon Carin. A DVD, &quot;Remember That Night – Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, was released on 17 September 2007. For the final show, Gilmour performed with the 38-piece string section of the Polish Baltic Philharmonic orchestra. It was released as &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot; (2008).

In December 2006, Gilmour released a tribute to Barrett, who died that year, in the form of his own version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s first single, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;. Recorded live at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, it featured versions of the song performed by Wright and David Bowie. It reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. In early 2007, Gilmour reconvened his touring band and spent a week recording in a barn in his farm. Some of the recordings were released on his later solo albums.

On 25 May 2009, Gilmour participated in a concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London, with the Malian musicians Amadou &amp; Mariam. The concert was part of the Hidden Gigs campaign against hidden homelessness, organised by the charity Crisis. On 4 July, Gilmour joined his friend Jeff Beck onstage at the Royal Albert Hall, London. Gilmour and Beck traded solos on &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and closed the show with &quot;Hi Ho Silver Lining&quot;. In August 2009, Gilmour released an online single, &quot;Chicago – Change the World&quot;, to promote awareness for Gary McKinnon, who was accused of computer hacking. A retitled cover of the Graham Nash song &quot;Chicago&quot;, it featured MicKinon, Chrissie Hynde and Bob Geldof. It was produced by the longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Chris Thomas.

=== 2010s: Reunion with Waters and &quot;Rattle that Lock&quot;===
On 11 July 2010, Gilmour performed for the charity Hoping Foundation with Waters in Oxfordshire, England. According to onlookers, it seemed that Gilmour and Waters had ended their feud, laughing and joking with their partners. On 12 May 2011, Gilmour made a surprise performing appearance during &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; with Waters at the O2, London and, with Nick Mason, played with the rest of the band on &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; at the conclusion of the show.

That October, Gilmour released an album with the electronic duo the Orb, &quot;Metallic Spheres&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Gilmour &quot;sweeps in and out on guitar, dropping little shiver-inducing melodic runs like it&#x27;s no big deal. Though his playing here meanders by design, Gilmour sounds neither lazy nor indulgent, more like a virtuoso who doesn&#x27;t want to actually seem like he&#x27;s sleepwalking through his performance.&quot;

Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the &quot;Division Bell &quot;sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album, &quot;The Endless River&quot;, released on 7 November 2014.&quot;&quot; Gilmour said it would be Pink Floyd&#x27;s last album: &quot;I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It&#x27;s a shame, but this is the end.&quot; There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright. In August 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were &quot;done&quot; and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong.

In September 2015, Gilmour released his fourth solo album, &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot;. On 14 November, he was the subject of a BBC Two documentary, &quot;David Gilmour: Wider Horizons.&quot; On 13 September 2017, Gilmour&#x27;s live album and film &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot;, which documents the two shows he performed on 7 and 8 July 2016 at the Amphitheatre of Pompeii, were shown at selected cinemas. The album was released on 29 September 2017 and reached number three on the UK Albums Chart. To celebrate the event, Mayor Ferdinando Uliano made Gilmour an honorary citizen of Pompeii.

Waters and Gilmour continued to quarrel, arguing over subjects including album reissues and the use of the Pink Floyd website and social media channels. Mason, who remains close to both, said in 2018 that Waters did not respect Gilmour, as that Waters &quot;feels that writing is everything, and that guitar playing and the singing are something that, I won&#x27;t say anyone can do, but that everything should be judged on the writing rather than the playing&quot;.

=== 2020s: &quot;Hey, Hey, Rise Up!&quot; and &quot;Luck and Strange&quot; ===

From April 2020, Gilmour appeared in a series of livestreams with his family, performing songs by Barrett and Leonard Cohen. In July, he released &quot;Yes, I Have Ghosts&quot;, his first single since 2015. Its lyrics were written by Polly Samson and features his daughter Romany making her recording debut on backing vocals and harp.

In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that Gilmour and Waters had &quot;hit yet another low point in their relationship&quot;. In early 2023, Gilmour&#x27;s wife, Polly Samson, wrote on Twitter that Waters was antisemitic and &quot;a lying, thieving, hypocritical, tax-avoiding, lip-synching, misogynistic, sick-with-envy megalomaniac&quot;. Gilmour responded to the tweet on Twitter: &quot;Every word demonstrably true.&quot; In April 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song &quot;Hey, Hey, Rise Up!&quot; in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It samples a performance of the 1914 Ukrainian anthem &quot;Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow&quot; performed by the Ukrainian musician Andriy Khlyvnyuk. Gilmour said the song was a &quot;one-off for Pink Floyd&quot;.

In 2024, Gilmour contributed guitar to a new version of Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero&quot; in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. On 6 September, he released his fifth solo album, &quot;Luck and Strange.&quot; It was recorded over five months in Brighton and London with the producer Charlie Andrew. Gilmour said Andrew challenged him musically as he &quot;has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine&quot;. Samson wrote the majority of the lyrics, which she said reflected themes of mortality and ageing. The album features keyboards recorded by Wright in 2007, lyrics from Gilmour&#x27;s son Charlie, and harp and vocals from his daughter Romany. Gilmour felt &quot;Luck and Strange&quot; was his best work since &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. It became Gilmour&#x27;s third album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart.

Gilmour contributed guitar to a cover of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; by the American metal band Body Count, released in September 2024. He began a tour for &quot;Luck and Strange&quot; in September 2024, with performances in London, Rome, Los Angeles and New York. He replaced some musicians in his touring band, saying he wanted to use more creative musicians and avoid &quot;sticking quite so slavishly to the original records&quot;. He plans to record another album with the same musicians soon after completing the tour.

== Musical style ==
Gilmour credits guitarists such as Pete Seeger, Lead Belly, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, John Fahey, Roy Buchanan, and Hank Marvin of the Shadows as influences. Gilmour said, &quot;I copied – don&#x27;t be afraid to copy – and eventually something that I suppose that I would call my own appeared.&quot;

 Gilmour&#x27;s lead guitar style is characterised by blues-influenced phrasing, expressive note bends, and sustain. In 2006, Gilmour said, &quot;[My] fingers make a distinctive sound... [they] aren&#x27;t very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable.&quot; The Pink Floyd technician Phil Taylor said, &quot;It really is just his fingers, his vibrato, his choice of notes and how he sets his effects ... In reality, no matter how well you duplicate the equipment, you will never be able to duplicate the personality.&quot;

The author Mike Cormack wrote that Gilmour&#x27;s playing from &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; onwards &quot;defines the sound of Pink Floyd&quot;. He cited Gilmour&#x27;s third solo in &quot;Dogs&quot; as &quot;perhaps the finest in his entire career, a masterpiece of phrasing, spacing, tone and articulation&quot;, and said the second solo in &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was &quot;an utter master at work, leaving space, repeating and building on licks to give a sense of structure, not overplaying, building to a shrieking climax, and then fading out while leaving the listener wanting more&quot;.

Gilmour also plays bass, keyboards, banjo, lap steel, mandolin, harmonica, drums, and saxophone. Gilmour said he played bass on some Pink Floyd tracks, such as the fretless bass on &quot;Hey You&quot;, as he could do it more quickly than Waters; he said that Waters would thank him for &quot;winning him bass-playing polls&quot;.

=== Influence ===
According to &quot;MusicRadar&quot;, Gilmour is &quot;a household name among the classic rock crowd, and for a lot of younger guitar fans he&#x27;s the only 1970s guitarist that matters. For many he&#x27;s the missing link between Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.&quot; The &quot;MusicRader&quot; writer Billy Saefong wrote that Gilmour &quot;isn&#x27;t as flashy as Jimi Hendrix or Jimmy Page on the stage, but his guitar work outshines most for emotion.&quot;

In 1996, Gilmour was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Pink Floyd. He has been ranked one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. In January 2007, &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers voted Gilmour&#x27;s solos for &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; among the top 100 greatest guitar solos. He was voted the 36th-greatest rock singer by Planet Rock listeners in 2009. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Gilmour the 14th-greatest guitarist of all time in 2011 and the 28th-greatest guitarist in 2023.

Gilmour was cited by the Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery as one of his three main influences. John Mitchell, the guitarist of bands including It Bites and Arena, also cited Gilmour as an influence. In 2013, Gary Kemp, the guitarist and songwriter of Spandau Ballet and a member of Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets, argued that Gilmour&#x27;s work on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; &quot;must make him the best guitar player in recent history&quot;.

=== Guitars ===
For Gilmour&#x27;s 21st birthday, in March 1967, his parents gave him his first Fender guitar, a white Telecaster with a white pickguard and a rosewood fretboard. He used this guitar when he joined Pink Floyd in 1968, with one of Barrett&#x27;s Telecasters as a spare.

==== The Black Strat ====

Gilmour used the Black Strat, a Fender Stratocaster, in most Pink Floyd concerts and for every Pink Floyd studio album recorded between 1970 and 1983. Gilmour bought it at Manny&#x27;s Music in New York City in 1970, after Pink Floyd&#x27;s US tour was cancelled due to the theft of their equipment in New Orleans. It originally had a rosewood fretboard and a white pickguard and underwent a number of modifications, finishing with a black pickguard and maple neck. It was auctioned for charity in 2019 for $3.9 million, making it one of the most expensive guitars ever sold at auction.

==== Fender Black Strat Signature Stratocaster ====
In November 2006, Fender Custom Shop announced two reproductions of Gilmour&#x27;s Black Strat for release on 22 September 2008. Phil Taylor, Gilmour&#x27;s guitar technician, supervised this release and has written a book on the history of this guitar. The release date was chosen to coincide with the release of Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Live in Gdańsk&quot; album. Both guitars are based on extensive measurements of the original instrument, each featuring varying degrees of wear. The most expensive is the David Gilmour Relic Stratocaster which features the closest copy of wear on the original guitar. A pristine copy of the guitar is also made, the David Gilmour NOS Stratocaster.

==== The 0001 Strat ====
The 0001 Strat is a Fender Stratocaster with a white body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and a gold anodised pickguard and gold-plated hardware. Seymour Duncan said it was a &quot;partscaster&quot;, as he assembled it from two different guitars. The model was used as a spare and for slide guitar in subsequent years. In 2019, the 0001 Strat was sold at auction for $1,815,000, setting a new world auction record for a Stratocaster. Gilmour also owns an early 1954 Stratocaster, believed to predate Fender&#x27;s commercial release of the model.

==== Other electric guitars ====
Along with the Fender models, Gilmour has also used a Gibson Les Paul goldtop model with P-90 pick-ups during recording sessions for &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;. Gilmour also plays a Gretsch Duo-Jet, a Gretsch White Falcon, and a &quot;White Penguin&quot;. He played a Bill Lewis 24-fret guitar during the &quot;Meddle&quot; and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; recording sessions, and a Steinberger GL model which was his main guitar during &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; recording sessions.

==== Acoustic ====
Gilmour has used acoustic guitars including a Gibson Chet Atkins classical model, and a Gibson J-200 Celebrity, acquired from John Illsley of Dire Straits. Gilmour used several Ovation models including a Custom Legend 1619-4, and a Custom Legend 1613-4 nylon string guitar, both during the &quot;Wall&quot; recording sessions. Martin models used include a D-35, purchased in New York in 1971, and a D12-28 12-string.

==== Steel guitar ====
Gilmour used a pair of Jedson steel guitars and a Fender 1000 pedal steel frequently in the early 1970s. Originally purchased from a pawn shop while Gilmour was in Seattle in 1970, the Jedson was used during recording of &quot;One of These Days&quot; from &quot;Meddle&quot; and &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; from &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Gilmour also owns a Fender Deluxe lap steel, which he used during &quot;The Division Bell&quot; tour in 1994. Gilmour also owns a Champ lap steel model. Along with the Fender steel models Gilmour has also used: a Gibson EH150, and two Jedson models: one red (1977-tuned D-G-D-G-B-E for &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Parts 6–9&quot;, 1987–2006: Tuned E-B-E-G-B-E for &quot;High Hopes&quot;) and one blonde. He also uses a ZB steel model. Gilmour played pedal steel guitar on the album &quot;Blue Pine Trees&quot; by Unicorn.

==== Signature pick-ups ====
In 2004 EMG, Inc. released the DG20 Signature guitar pick-up kit for the Fender Stratocaster. The set included three active pick-ups, an EXG Guitar Expander for increased treble and bass frequencies, and a SPC presence control to enhance earthiness and mid-range. The system came pre-wired on a custom 11-hole white pearl pickguard with white knobs.

==Awards and honours==

Gilmour was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours, &quot;for services to music&quot;. The award was presented to him at Buckingham Palace, on 7 November that year.

On 22 May 2008, he won the 2008 Ivor Novello Lifetime Contribution Award, recognising his excellence in music writing. Later that year, he was recognised for his outstanding contribution to music by the Q Awards. He dedicated his award to the Pink Floyd keyboardist, Richard Wright, who died in September 2008. On 11 November 2009, Gilmour received an honorary doctorate from Anglia Ruskin University.

==Charity work==
Gilmour has supported charities including Oxfam, the European Union Mental Health and Illness Association, Greenpeace, Amnesty International, the Lung Foundation, Nordoff-Robbins music therapy, Teenage Cancer Trust, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In May 2003, Gilmour sold his house in Little Venice to the ninth Earl Spencer and donated the proceeds worth £3.6 million to Crisis to help fund a housing project for the homeless. He has been named a vice-president of the organisation. He donated £25,000 to the Save the Rhino foundation in exchange for Douglas Adams&#x27;s name suggestion for the album that became &quot;The Division Bell&quot;.

On 20 June 2019, Gilmour auctioned 120 of his guitars for charity, at Christie&#x27;s in New York, including his Black Strat, his #0001 and early 1954 Stratocasters, and his 1955 Les Paul. The Black Strat sold for $3,975,000, making it the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction. The auction raised $21,490,750, with the proceeds going to the environmentalist charity ClientEarth.

==Personal life==
Gilmour&#x27;s first marriage was to Virginia &quot;Ginger&quot; Hasenbein, an American-born model and artist on 7 July 1975. The couple had four children: Alice (born 1976), Clare (born 1979), Sara (born 1983) and Matthew (born 1986), all of whom originally attended a Waldorf school, but Gilmour called their education there &quot;horrific&quot;.

Since 1994, Gilmour has been married to the writer Polly Samson, an English novelist and journalist, who has written lyrics for many of his songs, including Pink Floyd albums. His best man was Pink Floyd album artwork designer Storm Thorgerson, with whom he had been friends since their teenage years. Gilmour and Samson have four children: Gilmour&#x27;s adopted son Charlie (born 1989 to Samson and Heathcote Williams), Joe (born 1995), Gabriel (born 1997) and Romany (born 2002). Charlie&#x27;s voice appears on the telephone to Steve O&#x27;Rourke at the end of &quot;High Hopes&quot; from &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. Gabriel performed piano on the song &quot;In Any Tongue&quot; on Gilmour&#x27;s fourth solo studio album, &quot;Rattle That Lock&quot; (2015), making his recording debut. In 2011, Charlie was jailed for 16 months for violent disorder during a London protest against tuition fees. Romany sang and played harp on the song &quot;Between Two Points&quot; and sang on the bonus track &quot;Yes, I Have Ghosts&quot; on Gilmour’s fifth studio album, &quot;Luck and Strange&quot; (2024). She also sang backing vocals throughout the album.

An atheist who describes himself as left-wing, Gilmour said that his parents were &quot;Proper &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; readers... Some of their friends went on the Aldermaston Marches. Mine never did to my knowledge, but they were both committed to voting for the Labour Party.&quot; He described himself as a socialist, &quot;even if I can&#x27;t quite stick with party politics&quot;. In August 2014, Gilmour was one of 200 public figures to sign a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the UK in the Scottish independence referendum. In May 2017, Gilmour endorsed the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: &quot;I&#x27;m voting Labour because I believe in social equality.&quot;

Gilmour is an experienced pilot and aviation enthusiast. Under the aegis of his company, Intrepid Aviation, he amassed a collection of historical aircraft. He later sold the company, which he had started as a hobby, feeling that it was becoming too commercial for him to enjoy; he said he retained an old biplane which he flew sometimes. Gilmour&#x27;s net worth is £115 million, according to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List 2018.

Gilmour owns a home near the village of Wisborough Green, Sussex. In 2015, Gilmour and Samson purchased Medina House, a derelict bathhouse in Brighton and Hove, and had it redeveloped. Gilmour also spends time at his recording studio houseboat Astoria near Hampton Court.

<doc id="175959" wikidata="Q387400" url="?curid=175959" title="Mains electricity">
<text>Mains electricity, utility power, grid power, domestic power, wall power, household current, or, in some parts of Canada, hydro, is a general-purpose alternating-current (AC) electric power supply. It is the form of electrical power that is delivered to homes and businesses through the electrical grid in many parts of the world. People use this electricity to power everyday items (such as domestic appliances, televisions and lamps) by plugging them into a wall outlet.

The voltage and frequency of electric power differs between regions. In much of the world, a voltage (nominally) of 230 volts and frequency of 50 Hz is used. In North America, the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz. Other combinations exist, for example, 230 V at 60 Hz. Travellers&#x27; portable appliances may be inoperative or damaged by foreign electrical supplies. Non-interchangeable plugs and sockets in different regions provide some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible voltage and frequency requirements.

== Terminology ==
In the US, mains electric power is referred to by several names including &quot;utility power&quot;, &quot;household power&quot;, &quot;household electricity&quot;, &quot;house current&quot;, &quot;powerline&quot;, &quot;domestic power&quot;, &quot;wall power&quot;, &quot;line power&quot;, &quot;wall current&quot;, &quot;AC power&quot;, &quot;city power&quot;, &quot;street power&quot;, and &quot;120 (one twenty)&quot;.

In the UK, mains electric power is generally referred to as &quot;the mains&quot;. More than half of power in Canada is hydroelectricity, and mains electricity is often referred to as &quot;hydro&quot; in some regions of the country. This is also reflected in names of current and historical electricity utilities such as Hydro-Québec, BC Hydro, Manitoba Hydro, Hydro One (Ontario), and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro.

== Power systems ==
Worldwide, many different mains power systems are found for the operation of household and light commercial electrical appliances and lighting. The different systems are primarily characterized by:
* Voltage
* Frequency
* Plugs and sockets (receptacles or outlets)
* Earthing system (grounding)
* Protection against overcurrent damage (e.g., due to short circuit), electric shock, and fire hazards
* Parameter tolerances.

All these parameters vary among regions. The voltages are generally in the range 100–240 V (always expressed as root-mean-square voltage). The two commonly used frequencies are 50 Hz and 60 Hz. Single-phase or three-phase power is most commonly used today, although two-phase systems were used early in the 20th century. Foreign enclaves, such as large industrial plants or overseas military bases, may have a different standard voltage or frequency from the surrounding areas. Some city areas may use standards different from that of the surrounding countryside (e.g. in Libya). Regions in an effective state of anarchy may have no central electrical authority, with electric power provided by incompatible private sources.

Many other combinations of voltage and utility frequency were formerly used, with frequencies between 25 Hz and 133 Hz and voltages from 100 V to 250 V. Direct current (DC) has been displaced by alternating current (AC) in public power systems, but DC was used especially in some city areas to the end of the 20th century. The modern combinations of 230 V/50 Hz and 120 V/60 Hz, listed in IEC 60038, did not apply in the first few decades of the 20th century and are still not universal. Industrial plants with three-phase power will have different, higher voltages installed for large equipment (and different sockets and plugs), but the common voltages listed here would still be found for lighting and portable equipment.

== Common uses of electricity ==
Electricity is used for lighting, heating, cooling, electric motors and electronic equipment. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) has published:

U.S. residential sector electricity consumption by major end uses in 2021

:1 Includes televisions, set-top boxes, home theatre systems, DVD players, and video game consoles.
:2 Includes desktop and laptop computers, monitors, and networking equipment.
:3 Does not include water heating.
:4 Includes small electric devices, heating elements, exterior lights, outdoor grills, pool and spa heaters, backup electricity generators, and motors not listed above. Does not include electric vehicle charging.

Electronic appliances such as computers or televisions sets typically use an AC to DC converter or AC adapter to power the device. This is often capable of operation with a wide range of voltage and with both common power frequencies. Other AC applications usually have much more restricted input ranges.

== Building wiring ==
Portable appliances use single-phase electric power, with two or three wired contacts at each outlet. Two wires (neutral and live/active/hot) carry current to operate the device. A third wire, not always present, connects conductive parts of the appliance case to earth ground. This protects users from electric shock if live internal parts accidentally contact the case.

In northern and central Europe, residential electrical supply is commonly 400 V three-phase electric power, which gives 230 V between any single phase and neutral; house wiring may be a mix of three-phase and single-phase circuits, but three-phase residential use is rare in the UK. High-power appliances such as kitchen stoves, water heaters and household power heavy tools like log splitters may be supplied from the 400 V three-phase power supply.

Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and socket combinations are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power.

Circuit breakers and fuses are used to detect short circuits between the line and neutral or ground wires or the drawing of more current than the wires are rated to handle (overload protection) to prevent overheating and possible fire. These protective devices are usually mounted in a central panel—most commonly a distribution board or consumer unit—in a building, but some wiring systems also provide a protection device at the socket or within the plug. Residual-current devices, also known as ground-fault circuit interrupters and appliance leakage current interrupters, are used to detect &quot;ground faults&quot;—flow of current in other than the neutral and line wires (like the ground wire or a person). When a ground fault is detected, the device quickly cuts off the circuit.

== Voltage levels ==
Most of the world population (Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and much of South America) use a supply that is within 6% of 230 V. In the United Kingdom the nominal supply voltage is 230 V +10%/−6% to accommodate the fact that most transformers are in fact still set to 240 V. The 230 V standard has become widespread so that 230 V equipment can be used in most parts of the world with the aid of an adapter or a change to the equipment&#x27;s plug to the standard for the specific country.

The United States and Canada use a supply voltage of 120 volts ± 6%. Japan, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, North America, Central America and some parts of northern South America use a voltage between 100 V and 127 V. However, most of the households in Japan equip split-phase electric power like the United States, which can supply 200 V by using reversed phase at the same time. Brazil is unusual in having both 127 V and 220 V systems at 60 Hz and also permitting interchangeable plugs and sockets. Saudi Arabia and Mexico have mixed voltage systems; in residential and light commercial buildings both countries use 127 volts, with 220 volts at 60 Hz in commercial and industrial applications. The Saudi government approved plans in August 2010 to transition the country to a totally 230/400-volt 60 Hz system.

=== Measuring voltage ===
A distinction should be made between the voltage at the point of supply (nominal voltage at the point of interconnection between the electrical utility and the user) and the voltage rating of the equipment (utilization or load voltage). Typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage; for example, a nominal 208 V supply system will be connected to motors with &quot;200 V&quot; on their nameplates. This allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply. Voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages. Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature. Voltages are expressed as root mean square (RMS) voltage. Voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation. Momentary heavy loads, or switching operations in the power distribution network, may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band and storms and other unusual conditions may cause even larger transient variations. In general, power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator.

=== Choice of voltage ===
The choice of supply voltage is due more to historical reasons than optimization of the electric power distribution system—once a voltage is in use and equipment using this voltage is widespread, changing voltage is a drastic and expensive measure. A 230 V distribution system will use less conductor material than a 120 V system to deliver a given amount of power because the current, and consequently the resistive loss, is lower. While large heating appliances can use smaller conductors at 230 V for the same output rating, few household appliances use anything like the full capacity of the outlet to which they are connected. Minimum wire size for hand-held or portable equipment is usually restricted by the mechanical strength of the conductors.

Many areas, such as the US, which use (nominally) 120 V, make use of three-wire, split-phase 240 V systems to supply large appliances. In this system a 240 V supply has a centre-tapped neutral to give two 120 V supplies which can also supply 240 V to loads connected between the two line wires. Three-phase systems can be connected to give various combinations of voltage, suitable for use by different classes of equipment. Where both single-phase and three-phase loads are served by an electrical system, the system may be labelled with both voltages such as 120/208 or 230/400 V, to show the line-to-neutral voltage and the line-to-line voltage. Large loads are connected for the higher voltage. Other three-phase voltages, up to 830 volts, are occasionally used for special-purpose systems such as oil well pumps. Large industrial motors (say, more than 250 hp or 150 kW) may operate on medium voltage. On 60 Hz systems a standard for medium voltage equipment is 2,400/4,160 V whereas 3,300 V is the common standard for 50 Hz systems.

=== Standardization ===
Until 1987, mains voltage in large parts of Europe, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, was while the UK used . Standard ISO IEC 60038:1983 defined the new standard European voltage to be . From 1987 onwards, a step-wise shift towards was implemented. From 2009 on, the voltage is permitted to be . No change in voltage was required by either the Central European or the UK system, as both 220 V and 240 V fall within the lower 230 V tolerance bands (230 V ±6%). Usually the voltage of 230 V ±3% is maintained. Some areas of the UK still have 250 volts for legacy reasons, but these also fall within the 10% tolerance band of 230 volts. In practice, this allowed countries to have supplied the same voltage (220 or 240 V), at least until existing supply transformers are replaced. Equipment (with the exception of filament bulbs) used in these countries is designed to accept any voltage within the specified range.

In 2000, Australia converted to 230 V as the nominal standard with a tolerance of +10%/−6%, this superseding the old 240 V standard, AS 2926-1987. The tolerance was increased in 2022 to ± 10% with the release of AS IEC 60038:2022. The utilization voltage available at an appliance may be below this range, due to voltage drops within the customer installation. As in the UK, 240 V is within the allowable limits and &quot;240 volt&quot; is a synonym for mains in Australian and British English.

In the United States and Canada, national standards specify that the nominal voltage at the source should be 120 V and allow a range of 114 V to 126 V (RMS) (−5% to +5%). Historically, 110 V, 115 V and 117 V have been used at different times and places in North America. Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 V; however, 120 V is the nominal voltage.

In Japan, the electrical power supply to households is at 100 and 200 V. Eastern and northern parts of Honshū (including Tokyo) and Hokkaidō have a frequency of 50 Hz, whereas western Honshū (including Nagoya, Osaka, and Hiroshima), Shikoku, Kyūshū and Okinawa operate at 60 Hz. The boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) substations which interconnect the power between the two grid systems; these are Shin Shinano, Sakuma Dam, Minami-Fukumitsu, and the Higashi-Shimizu Frequency Converter. To accommodate the difference, frequency-sensitive appliances marketed in Japan can often be switched between the two frequencies.

== History ==


The world&#x27;s first public electricity supply was a water wheel driven system constructed in the small English town of Godalming in 1881. It was an alternating current (AC) system using a Siemens alternator supplying power for both street lights and consumers at two voltages, 250 V for arc lamps, and 40 V for incandescent lamps.

The world&#x27;s first large scale central plant—Thomas Edison&#x27;s steam powered station at Holborn Viaduct in London—started operation in January 1882, providing direct current (DC) at 110 V. The Holborn Viaduct station was used as a proof of concept for the construction of the much larger Pearl Street Station in New York, the world&#x27;s first permanent commercial central power plant. The Pearl Street Station also provided DC at 110 V, considered to be a &quot;safe&quot; voltage for consumers, beginning 4 September 1882.

AC systems started appearing in the US in the mid-1880s, using higher distribution voltage stepped down via transformers to the same 110 V customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883, Edison patented a three–wire distribution system to allow DC generation plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110 V lamps in series more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220 V between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form during the war of the currents, allowing lamps to be run at around 110 V and major appliances to be connected to 220 V. Nominal voltages gradually crept upward to 112 V and 115 V, or even 117 V. After World War II the standard voltage in the U.S. became 117 V, but many areas lagged behind even into the 1960s. In 1954, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) published C84.1 &quot;American National Standard for Electric Power Systems and Equipment – Voltage Ratings (60 Hertz)&quot;. This standard established 120 volt nominal system and two ranges for service voltage and utilization voltage variations. Today, virtually all American homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240 V at 60 Hz. Both voltages are available on the three wires (two &quot;hot&quot; legs of opposite phase and one &quot;neutral&quot; leg).

In 1899, the Berliner Elektrizitäts-Werke (BEW), a Berlin electrical utility, decided to greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220 V nominal distribution, taking advantage of the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps. The company was able to offset the cost of converting the customer&#x27;s equipment by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost. This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220 V system became common. North American practice remained with voltages near 110 V for lamps.

In the first decade after the introduction of alternating current in the US (from the early 1880s to about 1893) a variety of different frequencies were used, with each electric provider setting their own, so that no single one prevailed. The most common frequency was  Hz. The rotation speed of induction generators and motors, the efficiency of transformers, and flickering of carbon arc lamps all played a role in frequency setting. Around 1893 the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States and AEG in Germany decided to standardize their generation equipment on 60 Hz and 50 Hz respectively, eventually leading to most of the world being supplied at one of these two frequencies. Today most 60 Hz systems deliver nominal 120/240 V, and most 50 Hz nominally 230 V. The significant exceptions are in Brazil, which has a synchronized 60 Hz grid with both 127 V and 220 V as standard voltages in different regions, and Japan, which has two frequencies: 50 Hz for East Japan and 60 Hz for West Japan.

== Voltage regulation ==
To maintain the voltage at the customer&#x27;s service within the acceptable range, electrical distribution utilities use regulating equipment at electrical substations or along the distribution line. At a substation, the step-down transformer will have an automatic on-load tap changer, allowing the ratio between transmission voltage and distribution voltage to be adjusted in steps. For long (several kilometres) rural distribution circuits, automatic voltage regulators may be mounted on poles of the distribution line. These are autotransformers, again, with on-load tap changers to adjust the ratio depending on the observed voltage changes. At each customer&#x27;s service, the step-down transformer has up to five taps to allow some range of adjustment, usually ±5% of the nominal voltage. Since these taps are not automatically controlled, they are used only to adjust the long-term average voltage at the service and not to regulate the voltage seen by the utility customer.

== Power quality ==
The stability of the voltage and frequency supplied to customers varies among countries and regions. &quot;Power quality&quot; is a term describing the degree of deviation from the nominal supply voltage and frequency. Short-term surges and drop-outs affect sensitive electronic equipment such as computers and flat-panel displays. Longer-term power outages, brownouts and blackouts and low reliability of supply generally increase costs to customers, who may have to invest in uninterruptible power supply or stand-by generator sets to provide power when the utility supply is unavailable or unusable. Erratic power supply may be a severe economic handicap to businesses and public services which rely on electrical machinery, illumination, climate control and computers. Even the best quality power system may have breakdowns or require servicing. As such, companies, governments and other organizations sometimes have backup generators at sensitive facilities, to ensure that power will be available even in the event of a power outage or black out.

Power quality can also be affected by distortions of the current or voltage waveform in the form of harmonics of the fundamental (supply) frequency, or non-harmonic (inter)modulation distortion such as that caused by electromagnetic interference. In contrast, harmonic distortion is usually caused by conditions of the load or generator. In multi-phase power, phase shift distortions caused by imbalanced loads can occur.

<text>In guns, particularly firearms, but not artillery, where a different definition may apply, caliber (or calibre; sometimes abbreviated as &quot;cal&quot;) is the specified nominal internal diameter of the gun barrel bore – regardless of how or where the bore is measured and whether the finished bore matches that specification. It is measured in inches or in millimeters. In the United States it is expressed in hundredths of an inch; in the United Kingdom in thousandths; and elsewhere in millimeters. For example, a US &quot;45 caliber&quot; firearm has a barrel diameter of roughly 0.45 inches (11.43mm). Barrel diameters can also be expressed using metric dimensions. For example, a &quot;9 mm pistol&quot; has a barrel diameter of about 9 millimeters. Since metric and US customary units do not convert evenly at this scale, metric conversions of caliber measured in decimal inches are typically approximations of the precise specifications in non-metric units, and vice versa.

In a rifled barrel, the distance is measured between opposing lands or between opposing grooves; groove measurements are common in cartridge designations originating in the United States, while land measurements are more common elsewhere in the world. Measurements &quot;across the grooves&quot; are used for maximum precision because rifling and the specific caliber so measured is the result of final machining process which cuts grooves into the rough bore, leaving the &quot;lands&quot; behind.

Good performance requires a concentric, straight bore that accurately centers the projectile within the barrel, in preference to a &quot;tight&quot; fit which can be achieved even with off-center, crooked bores that cause excessive friction, fouling and an out-of-balance, wobbling projectile in flight.

Calibers fall into four general categories by size:

* miniature-bore historically refers to calibers with a diameter of or smaller
* small-bore refers to calibers with a diameter of or smaller
* medium-bore refers to calibers with a diameter of to 
* large-bore refers to calibers with a diameter of or larger

There is much variance in the use of the term &quot;small-bore&quot;, which over the years has changed considerably, with anything under considered &quot;small-bore&quot; prior to the mid-19th century.

==Cartridge naming conventions==
While modern firearms are generally referred to by the name of the cartridge the gun is chambered for, they are still categorized together based on bore diameter. For example, a firearm might be described as a &quot;30 caliber rifle&quot;, which could accommodate any of a wide range of cartridges using a roughly projectile; or as a &quot;22 rimfire&quot;, referring to any rimfire firearms firing cartridges with a 22 caliber projectile. However, there can be significant differences in nominal bullet and bore dimensions, and all cartridges so &quot;categorized&quot; are not automatically identical in actual caliber.

For example, 303 British firearms and projectiles are often &quot;categorized&quot; as &quot;.30-caliber&quot; alongside several dozen U.S. &quot;30-caliber&quot; cartridges despite using bullets of diameter while all U.S. &quot;30-caliber&quot; centerfire rifle cartridges use a common, standard bullet outside diameter. Using bullets larger than design specifications causes excessive pressures, while undersize bullets cause low pressures, insufficient muzzle velocities and fouling that will eventually lead to excessive pressures.

Makers of early cartridge arms had to invent methods of naming cartridges since no established convention existed then. One of the early established cartridge arms was the Spencer repeating rifle, which Union forces used in the American Civil War. It was named based on the chamber dimensions, rather than the bore diameter, with the earliest cartridge called the &quot;No. 56 cartridge&quot;, indicating a chamber diameter of .56 in; the bore diameter varied considerably, from .52 to .54 in. Later various derivatives were created using the same basic cartridge, but with smaller-diameter bullets; these were named by the cartridge diameter at the base and mouth. The original No. 56 became the .56-56, and the smaller versions, .56-52, .56-50, and .56-46. The 56–52, the most common of the new calibers, used a 50-cal bullet.

Other black powder-era cartridges used naming schemes that appeared similar, but measured entirely different characteristics; 45-70, 44-40, and 32-20 were designated by bullet diameter to hundredths of an inch and standard black powder charge in grains. Optionally, the bullet weight in grains was designated, such as 45-70-405. This scheme was far more popular and was carried over after the advent of early smokeless powder cartridges such as the 30-30 Winchester and 22 Long. Later developments used terms to indicate relative power, such as .44 Special and .44 Magnum. Variations on these methods persist today, with new cartridges such as the 204 Ruger and 17 HMR (Hornady Magnum Rimfire).

Metric diameters for small arms refer to cartridge dimensions and are expressed with an &quot;×&quot; between the bore diameter and the length of the cartridge case; for example, the 6.5×55mm Swedish cartridge has a bore diameter of 6.5 mm and a case length of 55 mm.

The means of measuring a rifled bore varies, and may refer to the diameter of the lands or the grooves of the rifling. For example, the 257 Roberts and 250 Savage both use a .257 inch projectile; both 250 Savage and 257 Roberts rifle bores have a .250 inch land diameter and .257 inch groove diameter. The .308 Winchester is measured across the grooves and uses a .308-in diameter (7.82-mm) bullet; the military-specification version is known as 7.62 × 51 mm NATO, so called because the bore diameter measured between the lands is 7.62 mm, and the cartridge has a case 51 mm long.

==Rifle caliber and cartridge conversions==
Converting a rifle to fire a different cartridge in the same bore diameter, often involves merely re-chambering the barrel to the new cartridge dimensions, if the rim diameter of the new cartridge matches that of the old cartridge. Converting a rifle to fire a different cartridge in a different caliber and bore as what it initially was, means that the barrel of the rifle will also need to be changed. Because many competitive precision rifle shooters often shoot thousands of rounds per year both for practice and competitions, and they more often reach the end of their barrel life, whereby the rifling is worn down to a point where a rifle loses some of its accuracy, the choice to make a caliber or cartridge change is often done at the same time as when a new rifle barrel is fitted to the rifle by a gunsmith. There are a few important factors to consider when converting a rifle to a different caliber or cartridge. The action of the rifle should be long enough to contain the new cartridge, the magazine should also be able to hold the new cartridge, the bolt face should be the correct diameter and the extractor the correct size to hold the head of the new cartridge. The most common of these caliber conversions on rifles, are usually done to change from a parent cartridge to a new cartridge based on it, like when converting a rifle to a 6.5 mm Creedmoor from a 308 Winchester on which it is based.

==Metric and US customary==

The following table lists some of the commonly used calibers where both metric and US customary units are used as equivalents. Due to variations in naming conventions, and the whims of the cartridge manufacturers, bullet diameters can vary widely from the diameter implied by the name. For example, a difference of 0.045 in (1.15 mm) occurs between the smallest and largest of the several cartridges designated as &quot;.38 caliber&quot;. 
==Shotguns==
Shotguns are classed according to gauge, a related expression. The gauge of a shotgun refers to how many lead spheres, each with a diameter equal to that of the bore, that amounts to one pound (454 g (1.0 lb)) in weight. In the case of a 12-gauge (18.5 mm) shotgun, it would take 12 spheres the size of the shotgun&#x27;s bore to equal a pound. A numerically larger gauge indicates a smaller barrel: a 20-gauge (15.6 mm) shotgun requires more spheres to equal a pound; therefore, its barrel is smaller than the 12-gauge. This metric is used in Russia as &quot;caliber number&quot;: e.g., &quot;shotgun of the 12 caliber.&quot; The 16th caliber is known as &quot;lordly&quot; (). While shotgun bores can be expressed in calibers (the .410 bore shotgun is measured as in diameter, unlike with rifles the actual bore diameter of a smoothbore shotgun varies significantly down the length of the barrel, with the use of chokes and back-boring.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;gauge&quot; is referred to as &quot;bore&quot; and in the United States &quot;bore&quot; is referred to as &quot;gauge&quot;, e.g. a &quot;12-bore shotgun or 12-gauge shotgun&quot; has a bore or gauge that can accommodate a lead sphere weighing 1/12th of a pound.

==As a measurement of length==

The term caliber is used as a measure of length of artillery barrels from muzzle to breech, expressed as a multiple of the bore diameter. For example, a 4-inch gun of 50 calibers would have a barrel 4 in × 50 = 200 in long (written as 4&quot; L/50 or 4&quot;/50). A 16-inch gun of 50 calibers (16&quot; L/50) has a barrel length of 50 × 16 = .

Both 14-in and 16-in navy guns were common in World War II. The British Royal Navy insisted on 50-cal guns on ships as it would allow shells to travel at an initial velocity of up to 1,800 mph (2,897 km/h) to a distance of 26 mi (42 km).

==Pounds as a measure of cannon bore==
Smoothbore cannon and carronade bores are designated by the weight in imperial pounds of spherical solid iron shot of diameter to fit the bore. Standard sizes are 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, and 42 pounds, with some non-standard weights using the same scheme. See Carronade#Ordnance.

From about the mid-17th until the mid-19th century, the measurement of the bore of large gunpowder weapons was usually expressed as the weight of its iron shot in pounds. Iron shot was used as the standard reference because iron was the most common material used for artillery ammunition during that period, and solid spherical shot the most common form encountered. Artillery was classified thereby into standard categories, with the 3-pounder, 4-pounder, 6-pounder, 8-pounder, 9-pounder, 12-pounder, 18-pounder, 24-pounder, and 32-pounder being the most common sizes encountered, although larger, smaller and intermediate sizes existed.

In practice, though, significant variation occurred in the actual mass of the projectile for a given nominal shot weight. The country of manufacture is a significant consideration when determining bore diameters. For example, the French livre, until 1812, had a mass of , whilst the contemporary English (avoirdupois) pound massed of approximately . Thus, a French 32-pounder at the Battle of Trafalgar threw a shot with more mass than an English 32-pounder.

Complicating matters further, muzzle-loaded weapons require a significant gap between the sides of the tube bore and the surface of the shot. This is necessary so the projectile may be inserted from the mouth to the base of the tube and seated securely adjacent the propellant charge with relative ease. The gap, called windage, increases the size of the bore with respect to the diameter of the shot somewhere between 10% and 20% depending upon the year the tube was cast and the foundry responsible.

The relationship between bore diameter and projectile weight was severed following the widespread adoption of rifled weapons during the latter part of the 19th century. Guns continued to be classed by projectile weight into the mid-20th century, particularly in British service with guns, such as the 2-pounder, 6-pounder, and 17-pounder anti-tank weapons. However, this value no longer definitively related to bore diameter, since projectiles were no longer simple spheres—and in any case were more often hollow shells filled with explosives rather than solid iron shot.

<doc id="175966" wikidata="Q875637" url="?curid=175966" title="College of William &amp; Mary">
<text>The College of William &amp; Mary (abbreviated as W&amp;M) is a public research university in Williamsburg, Virginia, United States. Founded in 1693 under a royal charter issued by King William III and Queen Mary II, it is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and the ninth-oldest in the English-speaking world. William &amp; Mary is classified as an R1 (Research 1: Very High Spending and Doctorate Production) research university. In his 1985 book &quot;Public Ivies: A Guide to America&#x27;s Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities&quot;, Richard Moll included William &amp; Mary as one of the original eight &quot;Public Ivies&quot;. The university is among the original nine colonial colleges.

The college educated American Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. It also educated other key figures pivotal to the development of the United States, including the first President of the Continental Congress Peyton Randolph, the first U.S. Attorney General Edmund Randolph, the fourth U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, Speaker of the House of Representatives Henry Clay, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Winfield Scott, sixteen members of the Continental Congress, and four signers of the Declaration of Independence. Its connections with many Founding Fathers of the United States earned it the nickname &quot;the Alma Mater of the Nation&quot;. George Washington received his surveyor&#x27;s license from the college in 1749, and later became the college&#x27;s first American chancellor in 1788. That position was long held by the bishops of London and archbishops of Canterbury, though in modern times has been held by U.S. Supreme Court justices, Cabinet secretaries, and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Benjamin Franklin received William &amp; Mary&#x27;s first honorary degree in 1756.

William &amp; Mary is notable for its many firsts in American higher education. In 1736, W&amp;M became the first school of higher education in the future United States to install a student honor code of conduct. The F.H.C. Society, founded in 1750, was the first collegiate fraternity in the United States, and W&amp;M students founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society in 1776, the first Greek-letter fraternity. It is the only American university issued a coat of arms by the College of Arms in London. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the first universities in the United States. The William &amp; Mary Law School is the oldest law school in the United States, and the Wren Building, attributed to and named for the famed English architect Sir Christopher Wren, is the oldest academic building still standing in the United States.

==History==
===Colonial era (1693–1776)===
A school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Colony of Virginia. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter to &quot;make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences ... to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.&quot; Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the college is the second-oldest in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 at Henrico but were thwarted by the Indian massacre of 1622, a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company&#x27;s charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a crown colony), events related to the English Civil War, and Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. In 1695, before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher Wren Building, in what was then called Middle Plantation. It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country&#x27;s nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution. The charter named James Blair as the college&#x27;s first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until he died in 1743). William &amp; Mary was founded as an Anglican institution; students were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles.

In 1693, the college was given a seat in the House of Burgesses, and it was determined tobacco taxes and export duties on furs and animal skins would support the college. The college acquired a parcel for the new school, from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.

Williamsburg was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by the Crown and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the college served as a law center, and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The college has been called &quot;the Alma Mater of a Nation&quot; because of its close ties to America&#x27;s founding fathers and figures pivotal to the development and expansion of the United States. George Washington, who received his surveyor&#x27;s license through the college despite never attending, was the college&#x27;s first American chancellor. William &amp; Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a royal charter, the first Greek-letter society (Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776), the first collegiate society in the country (F.H.C. Society, founded in 1750), the first student honor code and the first collegiate law school in America.

===Revolution and transition===
During the American Revolution, Virginia established a freedom of religion, notably with the 1786 passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Right Reverend James Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped the College of William &amp; Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779, the college established graduate schools in law and medicine, making it one of the institutions that claimed to be the first university in the United States. As its president, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the college which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.

The College of William &amp; Mary is home to the nation&#x27;s first collegiate secret society, the F.H.C. Society, popularly known as the Flat Hat Club, founded on November 11, 1750. On December 5, 1776, students John Heath and William Short (class of 1779) founded Phi Beta Kappa as a secret literary and philosophical society. Other secret societies known to exist at the college currently include: The 7 Society, 13 Club, Alpha Club, Bishop James Madison Society, The Society, The Spades, W Society, and Wren Society.

Thomas R. Dew, professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, and then president of William &amp; Mary from 1836 until he died in 1846, was an influential academic defender of slavery.

In 1842, alumni of the college formed the Society of the Alumni which is now the sixth oldest alum organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire destroyed the College Building. The Alumni House is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President&#x27;s House, the Brafferton, and Prince George House.

===Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century===

At the outset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), enlistments in the Confederate States Army depleted the student body. On May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the conflict. General Charles A. Whittier reported that &quot;thirty-two out of thirty-five professors and instructors abandoned the college work and joined the army in the field&quot;. The College Building was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The Battle of Williamsburg was fought nearby during the Peninsula Campaign on May 5, 1862, and the city was captured by the Union army the next day. The Brafferton building of the college was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building, purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover.

Following the restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute. The college&#x27;s 16th president, Benjamin Stoddert Ewell, finally reopened the school in 1869 using his funds, but the college closed again in 1882 due to insufficient funding. In 1888, William &amp; Mary resumed operations under an amended charter when the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a teacher-training institution. Lyon Gardiner Tyler (son of US President and alumnus John Tyler) became the 17th president of the college following Ewell&#x27;s retirement. Tyler and his successor J. A. C. Chandler expanded the college. In 1896, Minnie Braithwaite Jenkins was the first woman to attempt to take classes at William &amp; Mary, although her petition was denied. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the college grounds, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, it was one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women. Enrollment increased from 104 in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.
W. A. R. Goodwin, rector at Bruton Parish Church and professor of biblical literature and religious education at the college, pursued benefactors who could support the restoration of Williamsburg. Goodwin considered Williamsburg &quot;as the original training and testing ground&quot; of the United States. Goodwin persuaded John D. Rockefeller Jr. to initiate the restoration of Williamsburg in 1926, leading to the establishment of Colonial Williamsburg. Goodwin had initially only pursued Rockefeller to help fund the construction of Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall, but had convinced Rockefeller to participate in a broader restoration effort when he visited William &amp; Mary for the hall&#x27;s dedication. While the college&#x27;s administration was less supportive of the restoration efforts than many others in Williamsburg–before the Colonial Williamsburg project, the William &amp; Mary campus was Williamsburg&#x27;s primary tourist attraction–the college&#x27;s cooperation was secured. Restoration paid for by Rockefeller&#x27;s program extended to the college, with the Wren Building restored in 1928–1931, President&#x27;s House in 1931, and Brafferton in 1931–1932.

===1930–present===

In 1930, William &amp; Mary established a branch in Norfolk, Virginia called The Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary; it eventually became the independent state-supported institution known as Old Dominion University.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt received an honorary degree from the college on October 20, 1934. In 1935, the Sunken Garden was constructed just west of the Wren Building. The sunken design is from a similar landscape feature at Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

In 1945, the editor-in-chief of &quot;The Flat Hat&quot;, Marilyn Kaemmerle, wrote an editorial, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Job Half-Done...&quot; that supported the end of racial segregation, anti-miscegenation laws and white supremacy; the university administration removed her from the newspaper and nearly expelled her. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in response, over one-thousand William &amp; Mary students held &quot;a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson.&quot; She was allowed to graduate, but future editors had to discuss &quot;controversial writings&quot; with faculty before printing. The college Board of Visitors apologized to her in the 1980s.

The college admitted Hulon Willis into a graduate program in 1951 because the program was unavailable at Virginia State. However, the college did not open all programs to African-American students until around 1970.

In 1960, The Colleges of William &amp; Mary, a short-lived five-campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William &amp; Mary, the Richmond Professional Institute, the Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary, Christopher Newport College, and Richard Bland College. It was dissolved in 1962, with only Richard Bland College remaining officially associated with the College of William &amp; Mary at the present day.

In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed Highland, the historic Albemarle County, Virginia estate of alumnus and U.S. President James Monroe, to the college. The college restored this historic presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it publicly.

Jefferson Hall, a student dormitory, was destroyed by fire on January 20, 1983, without casualties. The building, including the destroyed west wing, was rebuilt and reopened.

On July 25, 2012, Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), in nearby Norfolk, Virginia, made a joint announcement with William &amp; Mary that the two schools were considering merging, with the prospect that EVMS would become the William &amp; Mary School of Medicine. Any such merger would have to be confirmed by the two schools and then confirmed by the Virginia General Assembly and Governor. Both universities subsequently agreed upon a pilot relationship, supported by a $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, to examine this possible union in reality.

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, William &amp; Mary has retained its historic ties to the United Kingdom and that state&#x27;s royal family. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visited William &amp; Mary as part of her tour of the United States, becoming the first member of the royal family to visit the college. In 1957, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited the college to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown. Queen Elizabeth gave a speech from the balcony of the Wren Building that drew over 20,000 people, the largest crowd ever seen in the city. In 1981, Charles, Prince of Wales, visited to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown. In 1988, the United States Congress selected William &amp; Mary to send a delegation to the United Kingdom for the 300th anniversary of the ascension of King William III and Queen Mary II. Prince Charles would return to the college in 1993 for the 300th anniversary of William &amp; Mary. William &amp; Mary sent a delegation to meet with Queen Elizabeth II that same year. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher would be made the Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary that same year. In 2007, Elizabeth II and Prince Philip would visit the college for a second time to recognize the 400th anniversary of the landing at Jamestown. In 2022, a beacon was lit in front of the Wren Building to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

==Campus==

The college is on a campus in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 2011, Travel+Leisure named William &amp; Mary one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

The Sir Christopher Wren Building is the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark. The building, colloquially referred to as the &quot;Wren Building&quot;, was named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect Sir Christopher Wren. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which mathematics professor Hugh Jones stated the 1699 design was &quot;first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren&quot; and then was adapted &quot;by the Gentlemen there&quot; in Virginia; little is known about how it looked since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today&#x27;s Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The college&#x27;s alum association has suggested Wren&#x27;s connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.

Two other buildings around the Wren Building compose an area known as &quot;Ancient&quot; or &quot;Historic Campus&quot;: the Brafferton (built within 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost&#x27;s offices) and the President&#x27;s House (built within 1732). In addition to the Ancient Campus, which dates to the 18th century, the college also consists of &quot;Old Campus&quot; and &quot;New Campus&quot;. &quot;Old Campus&quot;, adjacent to Ancient Campus, surrounds the Sunken Garden.

Adjoining &quot;Old Campus&quot; to the north and west is &quot;New Campus&quot;. It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as &quot;Old Campus&quot;, fit into the vernacular of modern architecture. Beginning with the college&#x27;s tercentenary in 1993, the college has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of &quot;Old Campus&quot;, while incorporating energy-efficient technologies. Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been LEED certified. Additionally, as the buildings of &quot;New Campus&quot; are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements to unify the appearance of the entire college campus. &quot;New Campus&quot; is dominated by William and Mary Hall, Earl Gregg Swem Library, and formerly Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall. It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, the majority of the college&#x27;s athletic fields, and the Muscarelle Museum of Art. The newest addition to &quot;New Campus&quot; is Alan B. Miller Hall, the headquarters of the college&#x27;s Mason School of Business.

The recent wave of construction at William &amp; Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, not far from Kaplan Hall (formerly William and Mary Hall). The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments share John E. Boswell Hall (formerly &quot;Morton Hall&quot;) on &quot;New Campus&quot;. These departments have been piecemeal separated and relocated to buildings recently renovated within the &quot;Old Campus&quot;, such as Chancellors&#x27; Hall.

The vast majority of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s consists of woodlands and Lake Matoaka, an artificial lake created by colonists in the early 18th century.

Following the George Floyd protests and associated movements, as well as student and faculty pressure in 2020 and 2021, several buildings, halls, and other entities were renamed. Maury Hall (named for Confederate sailor Matthew Fontaine Maury) on the Virginia Institute of Marine Science campus and Trinkle Hall (named for Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle) of Campus Center were renamed in September 2020 to York River Hall and Unity Hall respectively. In April 2021, three buildings were renamed at following a vote by the Board of Visitors: Morton Hall (named for professor Richard Lee Morton) to John E. Boswell Hall (for LGBT advocate and alum John Boswell), Taliaferro Hall (named for Confederate General William Taliaferro) to Hulon L. Willis Sr. Hall (Hulon Willis Sr. was the first Black student at the college), and Tyler Hall (named for President John Tyler and his son) to its original name of Chancellors&#x27; Hall (the hall had been renamed in 1988).

==Organization and administration==
The Board of Visitors is a corporation established by the General Assembly of Virginia to govern and supervise the operation of the College of William &amp; Mary and of Richard Bland College. The corporation is composed of 17 members appointed by the Governor of Virginia, based upon the recommendations made by the Society of the Alumni, to a maximum of two successive four-year terms. The Board elects a Rector, Vice-Rector, and Secretary, and the Board meets four times annually. The Board appoints a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the college&#x27;s property and finances.

The Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary is largely ceremonial. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Bishop of London, who served as the college&#x27;s advocate to the Crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington was appointed as the first American chancellor; later, United States President John Tyler held the post. The college has recently had several distinguished chancellors: former Chief Justice of the United States Warren E. Burger (1986–1993), former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1993–2000), former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor (2005–2012). Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, himself an alumnus of the college, succeeded O&#x27;Connor in February 2012.

The Board of Visitors delegates to a president the operating responsibility and accountability for the college&#x27;s administrative, fiscal, and academic performance, as well as representing the college on public occasions such as conferral of degrees. W. Taylor Reveley III, 27th President of the college, served from 2008 to 2018. In February 2018, The Board of Visitors unanimously elected Katherine A. Rowe as Reveley&#x27;s successor. Rowe is the first female president to serve the college since its founding.

Faculty members are organized into separate faculties of the Faculty of Arts and Science as well as those for the respective schools of Business, Education, Law, and Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Each faculty is presided over by a dean, who reports to the provost, and governs itself through separate by-laws approved by the Board of Visitors. The faculty is also represented by a faculty assembly advising the president and provost.

The Royal Hospital School, an independent boarding school in the United Kingdom, is a sister institution.

==Academics==

The College of William &amp; Mary is a medium-sized, highly residential, public research university. The focal point of the university is its four-year, full-time undergraduate program which constitutes most of the institution&#x27;s enrollment. The college has a strong undergraduate arts &amp; sciences focus, with many graduate programs in diverse fields ranging from American colonial history to marine science. The university offers multiple academic programs through its center in the District of Columbia: an undergraduate joint degree program in engineering with Columbia University, as well as a liberal arts joint degree program with the University of St Andrews in Scotland.

The graduate programs are dominant in STEM fields and the university has a high level of research activity. For the 2016–17 academic year, 1,591 undergraduate, 652 masters, and 293 doctoral degrees were conferred. William &amp; Mary is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
William &amp; Mary contains several schools, academic departments, and interdisciplinary research institutes, including:

*Arts and Sciences
*Batten School of Coastal &amp; Marine Sciences at VIMS
*Raymond A. Mason School of Business
*William &amp; Mary Law School
*William &amp; Mary School of Computing, Data Sciences &amp; Physics
*William &amp; Mary School of Education

William &amp; Mary offers exchange programs with 15 foreign schools, drawing more than 12% of its undergraduates into these programs. It also receives U.S. State Department grants to expand its foreign exchange programs further.

===Admissions and tuition===
William &amp; Mary enrolled 7,063 undergraduate and 2,755 postgraduate students in Fall 2024. In 2018, women made up 57.6% of the undergraduate and 50.7% of the graduate student bodies.

Admission to W&amp;M is considered &quot;most selective&quot; according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For the undergraduate class entering fall 2024, William &amp; Mary received 17,789 applications and accepted 6,063, or 34.0%. Of accepted applications, 1,614 enrolled, a yield rate of 26.6%. Of all matriculating students, the average high school GPA is 4.4. The interquartile range for total SAT scores was 1400–1530, while the range for ACT scores was 32–34. 

Undergraduate tuition for 2024–2025 was $18,709 for Virginia residents and $43,442 for out-of-state students. W&amp;M granted over $20.9 million in need-based scholarships in 2014–2015 to 1,734 undergraduates (27.5% of the undergraduate student body); 37% of the student body received loans, and average student indebtedness was $26,017. Research of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s student budy published in 2016 and 2017 showed students hailed overwhelmingly from wealthy family backgrounds, even as compared to other elite public institutions. The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.

===Rankings===


In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, W&amp;M ranks as tied for the 23rd-best public university in the United States, tied for 54th-best national university in the U.S., and tied for 1049th-best university in the world. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; also rated William &amp; Mary&#x27;s undergraduate teaching as 4th best (tied with Princeton University) among 73 national universities and 13th best for Undergraduate Research/Creative Projects in its 2021 rankings. In 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked William &amp; Mary #43 among research universities. In 2025, &quot;College Raptor&quot; ranked William &amp; Mary&#x27;s median SAT score #2 of public colleges and universities in the United States. William &amp; Mary is ranked 3rd for four year graduation rates among public colleges and universities.

For 2019 &quot;Kiplinger&quot; ranked William &amp; Mary 6th out of 174 best-value public colleges and universities in the U.S. 

In the 2024-25 &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; ranking by &quot;Forbes&quot;, W&amp;M was ranked the 17th best public college and 55th out of the 500 best private and public colleges and universities in the U.S. W&amp;M ranked 3rd for race and class interaction in &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;″s 2018 rankings. The college was ranked as the public college with the smartest students in the nation according to &quot;Business Insider&quot; 2014 survey.

In 2022, Georgetown University&#x27;s Center on Education and the Workforce ranked William &amp; Mary&#x27;s undergraduate business program #21 in value among national universities.

===Publications===
The Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture publishes the &quot;William and Mary Quarterly&quot;, a scholarly journal focusing on colonial history, particularly in North America and the Atlantic World, from the Age of Discovery onward.

In addition to the &quot;Quarterly&quot;, W&amp;M, by its mission to provide undergraduates with a thorough grounding in research, W&amp;M also hosts several student journals. The &quot;Monitor&quot;, the undergraduate journal of International Studies, is published semi-annually. The Lyon Gardiner Tyler Department of History publishes an annual undergraduate history journal, the &quot;James Blair Historical Review&quot;.

Non-academic publications include &quot;The William &amp; Mary Review&quot; – William &amp; Mary&#x27;s official literary magazine – &quot;Winged Nation&quot; – a student literary arts magazine, &quot;Acropolis&quot; – the art and art history magazine, &quot;The Flat Hat&quot; – the student newspaper, &quot;The Botetourt Squat&quot; – the student satirical newspaper, &quot;The Colonial Echo&quot; – William &amp; Mary&#x27;s yearbook, &quot;The DoG Street Journal&quot; – a daily online newspaper, and &quot;Rocket Magazine&quot; – William &amp; Mary&#x27;s fashion, art, and photography publication.

==Student life==
The college enjoys a temperate climate. In addition to the college&#x27;s extensive student recreation facilities (which include a large gym, a rock-climbing wall, and many exercise rooms) and programs (facilitating involvement in outdoor recreation, as well as club and intramural sports), the largely wooded campus has its own lake and outdoor amphitheater. The Virginia Beach oceanfront is away, and Washington, D.C. is a drive to the north. Also, the beaches of the Delmarva Peninsula are just a few hours away via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.

The college&#x27;s Alma Mater Productions (AMP) hosts concerts, comedians, and speakers on campus and in the 8,600-person capacity Kaplan Arena, as well as putting on many smaller activity-based events. Students produce several publications on campus, including the official student newspaper &quot;The Flat Hat&quot;, arts and fashion magazine &quot;Rocket Magazine&quot;, and the satirical newspaper &quot;The Botetourt Squat&quot;. The school&#x27;s television station, WMTV, produces content in the categories of cuisine, comedy, travel, and sports. &quot;Everyday Gourmet&quot;, the former flagship production of the station, was featured in &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2009. WCWM, the college&#x27;s student-run public radio station, transmits 24 hours a day on 90.9 FM locally and online and features student-curated and created content; they also put on an annual concert, WCWM Fest, featuring local and touring musicians.

The college also hosts several prominent student-run culture- and identity-based organizations. These include the Black Student Organization, Catholic Campus Ministry, Hillel (the college&#x27;s official Jewish student group), Asian American Student Initiative, Latin American Student Union, Lambda Alliance and Rainbow Coalition, and the Middle Eastern Students Association, among many others.

The college&#x27;s International Relations Club (IRC) ranked eleventh of twenty-five participants in the 2020–2021 North American College Model U.N.

===Traditions===

William &amp; Mary has several traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as Santa Claus and reads a rendition of &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads &quot;Twas the Night Before Finals&quot;, and The Gentlemen of the College sing the song &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. Christmas is a grand celebration at the college; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus. This popular tradition started when German immigrant Charles Minnigerode, a humanities professor at the college in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor St. George Tucker, thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.

Incoming first-year students participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the college. During orientation week, first-year students also have the opportunity to serenade the college president at his home with the Alma Mater song. The Senior Walk is similar in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building during their &quot;departure&quot; from college. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.

W&amp;M also takes pride in its connections to its colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the Julian Calendar) that the Reverend James Blair, first president of the college, received the charter from the Court of William III and Mary II at Kensington Palace in 1693. Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President John Tyler, Henry Kissinger, Margaret Thatcher, and Robert Gates.

Another underground tradition at W&amp;M is known as the &quot;Triathlon&quot;. As reported by &quot;The Flat Hat&quot;, the tradition - normally performed before graduation - involves completing three activities: jumping the walls of the Governor&#x27;s Palace in Colonial Williamsburg, streaking through the Sunken Garden, and finally swimming in the Crim Dell. The tradition has been referred to as an underground one and is not sanctioned by the college but is still widely practiced.

===Student Assembly===
The Student Assembly is the student government organization serving undergraduates and graduates. It allocates a student organization budget and funds services, advocates for student rights, and is the formal student representation to the City of Williamsburg and William &amp; Mary administration. It consists of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. The president and vice president are elected jointly by the student body to lead the Executive Branch, and each class elects one class president and four senators who serve in the Senate (the Legislative Branch). The five graduate schools appoint one to two senators. The Cabinet consists of 10 departments managed by secretaries and undersecretaries.

===Honor system===

William &amp; Mary&#x27;s honor system was established by alumnus Thomas Jefferson in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation&#x27;s first. During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the Wren Building pledging:
The basis of W&amp;M&#x27;s Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alum and law professor Henry St. George Tucker Sr. While teaching law at the University of Virginia, Tucker proposed students attach a pledge to all exams confirming on their honor they did not receive any assistance. Tucker&#x27;s honor pledge was the early basis of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. At W&amp;M, the Honor System stands as one of the college&#x27;s most important traditions; it remains student-administered through the Honor Council with the advice of the faculty and administration of the college. The college&#x27;s Honor System is codified such that students found guilty of cheating, stealing, or lying are subject to sanctions ranging from a verbal warning to expulsion.

W&amp;M considers the observance of public laws of equal importance to the observance of its particular regulations. William &amp; Mary&#x27;s Board of Visitors delegates authority for discipline to its president. The President oversees a hierarchy of disciplinary authorities to enforce local laws as it pertains to William &amp; Mary&#x27;s interest as well as its internal regulatory system.

===Fraternities and sororities===
William &amp; Mary has a long history of fraternities and sororities dating back to 1750 and the founding of the F.H.C. Society, the first collegiate fraternity established in what now is the United States. Phi Beta Kappa, the first &quot;Greek-letter&quot; fraternity, was founded at the college in 1776.

Today, various Greek-letter organizations play an important role in the college community and other social organizations such as theatre and club sports groups. Overall, about one-third of undergraduate students are active members of one or another of 16 national fraternities and 13 sororities. William &amp; Mary is also home to several unusual fraternal or similar organizations, including the Nu Kappa Epsilon music sorority and its male counterpart, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia; the Alpha Phi Omega co-ed service fraternity; gender-inclusive Phi Sigma Pi and other honor fraternities.

=== Secret societies ===

Several student secret societies exist at the college, including the F.H.C Society or Flat Hat Club, the Seven Society, the 13 Club, the Bishop James Madison Society, and the Wren Society.

=== The Queens&#x27; Guard ===

The Queens&#x27; Guard was established on February 8, 1961, as a special unit of the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps and was affiliated with the Pershing Rifles. The Guard was described by former President Davis Young Paschall as &quot;a unit organized, outfitted with special uniforms, and trained in appropriate drills and ceremonies as will represent the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia on such occasions and in such events as may be approved by the President.&quot; The uniform of the Guard loosely resembles that of the Scots Guards of the United Kingdom. The baldric is a pleated Stuart tartan in honor of Queen Mary II and Queen Anne. Following a hazing citation in fall 2019 by the college&#x27;s Community Values &amp; Restorative Practices organization, the Queens&#x27; Guard was suspended until at least spring 2022.

===Music===

William &amp; Mary has eleven collegiate a cappella groups: The Christopher Wren Singers (1987, co-ed); The Gentlemen of the College (1990, all-male); The Stairwells (1990, all-male); Intonations (1990, all-female); Reveille (1992, all-female); The Accidentals (1992, all-female); DoubleTake (1993, co-ed); The Cleftomaniacs (1999, co-ed); Passing Notes (2002, all-female); The Tribetones (2015, all-female); and the Crim Dell Criers (2019, co-ed). Sinfonicron Light Opera Company, founded in 1965, is William &amp; Mary&#x27;s student-run light opera company, producing musicals (traditionally those by Gilbert &amp; Sullivan) in the early spring of each academic year. Music societies at the college include local chapters of the music honor societies Delta Omicron (co-ed) and Phi Mu Alpha (all-male) as well as Nu Kappa Epsilon (all-female). Nu Kappa Epsilon, founded in 1994 at William &amp; Mary, is &quot;dedicated to promoting the growth and development of musical activities at the college as well as in the Williamsburg community&quot;.

Large musical ensembles include a symphony orchestra, wind symphony, and four choral ensembles: The William &amp; Mary Choir, The Botetourt Chamber Singers, The Barksdale Treble Chorus (formerly the William &amp; Mary Women&#x27;s Chorus), and Ebony Expressions Gospel Choir. The Botetourt Chamber Singers (1974, co-ed) are the student chamber choir. There are several musical ensembles at the college, from Early Music Ensemble to Jazz. Prior to 1996 the college had a marching band, which has since changed into the William &amp; Mary Pep Band.

William &amp; Mary&#x27;s radio station, WCWM, has been on the air since 1959.

===Comedy groups===
William &amp; Mary has multiple campus comedy groups. I.T. (&quot;Improvisational Theatre&quot;) was founded in 1986 and is the oldest group on campus. The sketch comedy ensemble 7th Grade Sketch Comedy has been in existence since 1997. In 2012, Sandbox Improv was formed. Dad Jeans Improv, established in 2016, specializes in long-form improvisation and technical elements.

==Athletics==
Formerly known as the &quot;Indians&quot;, William &amp; Mary&#x27;s athletic teams are now known as the &quot;Tribe&quot;. The college fields NCAA Division I teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. Also, there are women&#x27;s field hockey, lacrosse, and volleyball squads, as well as men&#x27;s baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five Colonial Athletic Association titles, leading the conference with over 80 titles. That same year, several teams competed in the NCAA Championships, with the football team appearing in the Division I-AA national semifinals. The men&#x27;s cross country team finished 8th and 5th in Division I NCAA Men&#x27;s Cross Country Championship in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William &amp; Mary men&#x27;s basketball team is one of four original Division I schools that have never been to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment offensive to the American Indian community. The college&#x27;s appeal regarding using the institution&#x27;s athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The &quot;Tribe&quot; nickname was found to be neither hostile nor abusive but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community, and common cause. The college stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007. However, they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.

In 2018, athletic director Samantha Huge introduced a new brand kit for the department, officially retiring and de-emphasizing the script &quot;Tribe&quot; logo.

The &quot;Tribe 2025&quot; plan, a comprehensive plan for the athletics department to raise national prominence, undergo significant facilities upgrades, and achieve higher levels of student involvement and spirit, was presented in 2019. In 2020, William &amp; Mary announced that due to financial concerns, they would be discontinuing seven varsity sports: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gymnastics, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field and volleyball. This decision prompted a petition entitled &quot;save the Tribe 7&quot; which received significant support. On October 19, the university reinstated women&#x27;s gymnastics, women&#x27;s swimming, and volleyball after notice of an impending lawsuit on the grounds of Title IX violations. President Rowe later announced that the decision to cancel the four men&#x27;s programs would be put off until the 2021-2022 academic year.

==Notable people==

===Faculty===

Since the 17th century, many prominent academics have chosen to teach at William &amp; Mary. Distinguished faculty include the first professor of law in the United States, George Wythe (who taught Henry Clay, John Marshall, and Thomas Jefferson, among others); William Small (Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s cherished mentor); William and Thomas Dawson, who were also presidents of William &amp; Mary. Also, the founder and first president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – William Barton Rogers – taught chemistry at William &amp; Mary (which was also Professor Barton&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;). Several members of the socially elite and politically influential Tucker family, including Nathaniel Beverley, St. George, and Henry St. George Tucker Sr. (who penned the original honor code pledge for the University of Virginia that remains in use there today), taught at William &amp; Mary.

More recently, William &amp; Mary recruited the constitutional scholar William Van Alstyne from Duke Law School. Lawrence Wilkerson, current Harriman Visiting Professor of Government and Public Policy, was chief of staff for Colin Powell. Susan Wise Bauer is an author and founder of Peace Hill Press, who teaches writing and American literature at the college. James Axtell, who teaches history, was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as a Fellow in 2004. Iyabo Obasanjo, a previous senator of Nigeria and daughter of former President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, also serves as faculty in Kinesiology &amp; Health Sciences.

Professor Benjamin Bolger – the second-most credentialed person in modern history behind Michael Nicholson – taught at W&amp;M.

===Alumni===

Although a historically small college, the alumni of William &amp; Mary include influential and historically significant people. Among its alumni are four of the first ten presidents of the United States, four United States Supreme Court justices, dozens of U.S. senators, members of government, six Rhodes Scholars, and three Marshall Scholars.

<doc id="175973" wikidata="Q215969" url="?curid=175973" title="Overclocking">
<text>In computing, overclocking is the practice of increasing the clock rate of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly, operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component&#x27;s operational stability at accelerated speeds. Semiconductor devices operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat. An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking or over-specification voids any warranty, but some manufacturers allow overclocking as long as it is done (relatively) safely.

== Overview ==

The purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory (RAM) or system buses (generally on the motherboard), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer&#x27;s control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signaling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds.

While most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally, for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum &quot;stable&quot; speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed, the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context, the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as data corruption (incorrectly calculated results, or worse &quot;writing to storage&quot; incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and word processing appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system. There might also be a chance for damage to the hardware itself).

At this point, an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point, there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user&#x27;s ability to cool the part, and the device&#x27;s own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves destructive failure. Overzealous use of voltage or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device&#x27;s performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright destroy it.

The speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; benchmarks for different purposes are published.

===Underclocking===
Conversely, the primary goal of underclocking is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow quieter operation, and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency.

Underclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a &quot;standard-voltage&quot; part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a &quot;standard voltage&quot; processor in a &quot;low voltage&quot; application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder&#x27;s time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when troubleshooting.

===Enthusiast culture===

Overclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by enthusiasts than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly &quot;before&quot; employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated.

Overclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.

Some hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and &quot;Hot-Rodding&quot; their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model&#x27;s stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing system requirements and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already depreciated, and would have needed to be replaced in any case.

===Components===

Technically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, processors (a.k.a. CPU), video cards, motherboard chipsets, and RAM. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the CPU multiplier) to attain their final speed.

Computer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the CPU multiplier if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the bus clock. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a system clock) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed.

Most OEM systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM&#x27;s motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them.

Any given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, voltages; the user&#x27;s ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.

==Considerations==
There are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new clock rate. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive voltage can permanently damage a component.

In a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware.

=== Cooling ===

All electronic circuits produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in digital circuits and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and thermal design power (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a &quot;wall&quot;. To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in MOSFET device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to &quot;decrease&quot; the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal.

Stock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful fans, larger heat sinks, heat pipes and water cooling. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of copper, which has high thermal conductivity, but is expensive. Aluminium is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. Heat pipes can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.

Water cooling carries waste heat to a radiator. Thermoelectric cooling devices which actually refrigerate using the Peltier effect can help with high thermal design power (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an electric current through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a water cooling system.

Other cooling methods are forced convection and phase transition cooling which is used in refrigerators and can be adapted for computer use. Liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and dry ice are used as coolants in extreme cases, such as record-setting attempts or one-off experiments rather than cooling an everyday system. In June 2006, IBM and Georgia Institute of Technology jointly announced a new record in silicon-based chip clock rate (the rate a transistor can be switched at, not the CPU clock rate) above 500 GHz, which was done by cooling the chip to using liquid helium. Set in November 2012, the CPU Frequency World Record is 9008.82 MHz as of December 2022. These extreme methods are generally impractical in the long term, as they require refilling reservoirs of vaporizing coolant, and condensation can form on chilled components. Moreover, silicon-based junction gate field-effect transistors (JFET) will degrade below temperatures of roughly and eventually cease to function or &quot;freeze out&quot; at since the silicon ceases to be semiconducting, so using extremely cold coolants may cause devices to fail. Blowtorch is used to temporarily raise temperature to issues of over-cooling when not desirable.

Submersion cooling, used by the Cray-2 supercomputer, involves sinking a part of computer system directly into a chilled liquid that is thermally conductive but has low electrical conductivity. The advantage of this technique is that no condensation can form on components. A good submersion liquid is Fluorinert made by 3M, which is expensive. Another option is mineral oil, but impurities such as those in water might cause it to conduct electricity.

Amateur overclocking enthusiasts have used a mixture of dry ice and a solvent with a low freezing point, such as acetone or isopropyl alcohol. This cooling bath, often used in laboratories, achieves a temperature of . However, this practice is discouraged due to its safety risks; the solvents are flammable and volatile, and dry ice can cause frostbite (through contact with exposed skin) and suffocation (due to the large volume of carbon dioxide generated when it sublimes).

=== Stability and functional correctness ===

As an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer&#x27;s recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is silent data corruption by undetected errors. Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, device drivers, or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.

A large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.

In general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor. Achieving good fault coverage requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected.

A particular &quot;stress test&quot; can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect flags; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected.

To further complicate matters, in process technologies such as silicon on insulator (SOI), devices display hysteresis—a circuit&#x27;s performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same. Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.

In overclocking circles, &quot;stress tests&quot; or &quot;torture tests&quot; are used to check for correct operation of a component. These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math-intensive applications for testing general CPUs). Popular stress tests include Prime95, Superpi, OCCT, AIDA64, Linpack (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest GUIs), SiSoftware Sandra, BOINC, Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and Memtest86. The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will manifest themselves during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, then the component is deemed &quot;stable&quot;. Since fault coverage is important in stability testing, the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as &quot;prime 12 hours stable&quot;.

===Factors allowing overclocking===
Overclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer. If manufacturing yield is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons. In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold. Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.

Notably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often. In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer. Pentium architect Bob Colwell calls overclocking an &quot;uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation&quot;.

=== Measuring effects of overclocking ===

Benchmarks are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of &quot;sport&quot; in which users compete for the highest scores. As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark. Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable.

Using only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory bandwidth, without taking into consideration how higher clock rates in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand databases and scientific computing, memory bandwidth is typically not a bottleneck, so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as 3DMark, attempt to replicate game conditions.

== Manufacturer and vendor overclocking ==

Overclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.

It is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as CPU multiplier locking to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a consumer protection benefit, but are often criticized by buyers.

Many motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by BIOS settings.

== CPU multiplier locking ==

CPU multiplier locking is the process of permanently setting a CPU&#x27;s clock multiplier. AMD CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all Intel CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, All Ryzen desktop chips (except 3D variants) and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the s of &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; and &quot;K-Series.&quot; Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD&#x27;s Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition.

Users usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for underclocking in order to maintain the front side bus speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip&#x27;s clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges (jumper-like points) on the top of the CPU with conductive paint or pencil lead. Other CPU models may require different procedures.

Increasing front-side bus or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.

Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;pin mod&quot; method which claims to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs does not work. All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz. 10th gen however, could reach 103 MHz on the BCLK.

== Advantages ==
* Higher performance in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output.
* System optimization: Some systems have &quot;bottlenecks&quot;, where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many motherboards with AMD Athlon 64 processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 MHz. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a CPU multiplier, for instance 1.8 GHz is most likely 9×200 MHz) by a fixed integer such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333 MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5–10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings.
* It can be cheaper to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component.
* Extending the practical service life of old or obsolete equipment.
* If done via methods what allow to change clock rate &quot;on the fly&quot;, it gains versatility. So, for example - overclock computer where lots of computing power is needed right now, and put it back to normal clock rate once task is done or computers starts getting too hot - then, wait to cool back, and overclock again, etc.

==Disadvantages==

=== General ===
* Higher clock rates and voltages increase power consumption, also increasing electricity cost and heat production. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it&#x27;s in.
* Fan noise: High-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50 dB or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 dB. Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20 dB at approximately 1 metre or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling.
* An overclocked computer may become unreliable. For example: Microsoft Windows may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re-installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a &quot;file copy error&quot; during Windows Setup. Because installing an operating system is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted.
* The lifespan of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat.
* Warranties may be voided by overclocking.

=== Risks of overclocking ===

* Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes thermal power to increase quadratically. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed.
* Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as phase-change cooling or liquid nitrogen will cause water condensation, which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation.

=== Limitations ===

Overclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the critical path for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an Internet connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card&#x27;s performance is the &quot;bottleneck&quot; of the game.

=== Adaptive Management in Overclocking ===

Similar to dynamic adjustments critical in network management for handling data flow and preventing bottlenecks, overclocking computer hardware requires ongoing monitoring and adaptations to maintain system stability and performance. In high-performance network systems, researchers like Åkerblom et al. (2023) have developed adaptive methods such as Thompson Sampling to optimize system responses under varying conditions, analogous to technologies used in overclocking like real-time voltage adjustments and adaptive cooling systems. These technologies are crucial in managing the additional heat and power demands imposed by overclocked components, ensuring that the hardware operates within safe temperature and voltage limits to prevent damage and prolong the lifespan of the components[1].
== Graphics cards ==
Graphics cards can also be overclocked. There are utilities to achieve this, such as EVGA&#x27;s Precision, RivaTuner, AMD Overdrive (on AMD cards only), MSI Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the PEG Link Mode on Asus motherboards. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, clock rate, and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum clock rate of that specific card is now deducted.

Some overclockers apply a potentiometer to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking).

== Flashing ==

=== Alternatives ===

Flashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a video card, without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software).

Flashing refers to using the firmware of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes standalone software to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. NiBiTor (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, ) have two voltage and clock rate settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with &quot;three&quot; voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to &quot;serious&quot; overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this clock rate, reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).

Some cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce 6600GT (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a &#x27;Temperature&#x27; tab.

Unlocking refers to enabling extra pipelines or pixel shaders. The 6800LE, the 6800GS and 6800 (AGP models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking. While these models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 GPU core as a 6800GT or Ultra, but pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become permanently unusable.

<doc id="175974" wikidata="Q1325245" url="?curid=175974" title="Octatonic scale">
<text>An octatonic scale is any eight-note musical scale. However, the term most often refers to the ancohemitonic symmetric scale composed of alternating whole and half steps, as shown at right. In classical theory (in contrast to jazz theory), this symmetrical scale is commonly called the &quot;octatonic scale&quot; (or the octatonic collection), although there are a total of 43 enharmonically inequivalent, transpositionally inequivalent eight-note sets.

The earliest systematic treatment of the octatonic scale was in Edmond de Polignac&#x27;s unpublished treatise &quot;Étude sur les successions alternantes de tons et demi-tons (Et sur la gamme dite majeure-mineure)&quot; (&quot;Study of the Succession of Alternating Whole Tones and Semitones (and of the so-called Major-Minor Scale)&quot;) from c. 1879, which preceded Vito Frazzi&#x27;s &quot;Scale alternate per pianoforte&quot; of 1930 by 50 years.

==Nomenclature==
In Saint Petersburg at the turn of the 20th century, this scale had become so familiar in the circle of composers around Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov that it was referred to as the &quot;Korsakovian scale&quot; (Корсаковская гамма). As early as 1911, the Russian theorist Boleslav Yavorsky described this collection of pitches as the &quot;diminished mode&quot; (уменьшённый лад), because of the stable way the diminished fifth functions in it. In more recent Russian theory, the term &quot;octatonic&quot; is not used. Instead, this scale is placed among other symmetrical modes (total 11) under its historical name &quot;Rimsky-Korsakov scale&quot;, or &quot;Rimsky-Korsakov mode&quot;.)

In jazz theory, it is called the &quot;diminished scale&quot; or &quot;symmetric diminished scale&quot; because it can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking diminished seventh chords, just as the augmented scale can be conceived as a combination of two interlocking augmented triads. The two modes are sometimes referred to as the &quot;half-step/whole step diminished scale&quot; and the &quot;whole step/half-step diminished scale&quot;.

Because it was associated in the early 20th century with the Dutch composer Willem Pijper, in the Netherlands it is called the &quot;Pijper scale&quot;.

==Construction==
The twelve tones of the chromatic scale are covered by three disjoint diminished seventh chords. The notes from two such seventh-chords combination form an octatonic collection. Because there are three ways to select two from three, there are three octatonic scales in the twelve-tone system.

Each octatonic scale has exactly two modes: the first begins its ascent with a whole step, while the second begins its ascent with a half step (semitone). These modes are sometimes referred to as the &quot;whole step/half-step diminished scale&quot; and the &quot;half-step/whole step diminished scale&quot;, respectively.

Each of the three distinct scales can form differently named scales with the same sequence of tones by starting at a different point in the scale. With alternative starting points listed below in square brackets, and return to tonic in parentheses, the three are, ascending by semitones:

* C D [E] F [G] A [A] B (C)
* D E [F] G [G] A [B] C (D)
* E F [G] A [A] B [C] D (E)

It may also be represented as semitones, either starting with a whole tone (as above): , or starting with a semitone: , or labeled as set class 8‑28.

With one more scale tone than described by the western diatonic scale, it is not possible to perfectly notate music of the octatonic scale using any conventional key signature without the use of accidentals. Across all conventional key signatures, at least two of the octatonic notes must share similar horizontal alignment on the staves, although the precise combination of accidentals and naturals varies. There are usually several equally succinct combinations of key signature and accidentals, and different composers have chosen to notate their music differently, sometimes ignoring the niceties of notation conventions designed to facilitate diatonic tonality.

==Properties==

===Symmetry===
The three octatonic collections are transpositionally and inversionally symmetric—that is, they are related by a variety of transposition and inversion operations:

They are each closed under transpositions by 3, 6, or 9 semitones. A transposition by 1, 4, 7, or 10 semitones will transform the E scale into the D scale, the C scale into the D scale, and the D scale into the E scale. Conversely, transpositions by 2, 5, 8, or 11 semitones acts in the reverse way; the E scale goes to the D scale, D to C and C to E. Thus, the set of transpositions acts on the set of diminished collections as the integers modulo 3. If the transposition is congruent to 0 mod 3 the pitch collection is unchanged and the transpositions by 1 semitone or by 2 semitones are inverse to one another.

The E and C collections can be swapped by inversions around E, F, A or C (the tones common to both scales). Similarly, the C and D collections can be swapped by inversions around E, G, B/A, D/C and the D and E collections by inversions around D, F, A, or B. All other transformations do not change the classes (e.g. reflecting the E collection around E gives the E collection once again). This unfortunately means that the inversions do not act as a simple cyclic group on the set of diminished scales.

===Subsets===

Among the collection&#x27;s remarkable features is that it is the only collection that can be disassembled into four transpositionally related pitch pairs in six different ways, each of which features a different interval class. For example:
*semitone: (C, C), (D, E) (F, G), (A, B)
*whole step: (C, D), (E, F), (G, A), (B, C)
*minor third: (C, E), (F, A), (C, E), (G, B)
*major third: (C, E), (F, B), (E, G), (A, C)
*perfect fourth: (C, F), (B, E), (G, C), (E, A)
*tritone: (C, F), (E, A), (C, G), (E, B)

Another remarkable feature of the diminished scale is that it contains the first four notes of four different minor scales separated by minor thirds. For example: C, D, E, F and (enharmonically) F, G, A, B. Also E, F, G, A, and A, B, C, D.

The scale &quot;allows familiar harmonic and linear configurations such as triads and modal tetrachords to be juxtaposed unusually but within a rational framework&quot; though the relation of the diatonic scale to the melodic and harmonic surface is thus generally oblique.

==History==

===Early examples===
Joseph Schillinger suggests that the scale was formulated already by Persian traditional music in the 7th century AD, where it was called &quot;Zar ef Kend&quot;, meaning &quot;string of pearls&quot;, the idea being that the two different sizes of intervals were like two different sizes of pearls.

Octatonic scales first occurred in Western music as byproducts of a series of minor-third transpositions. While Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov claimed he was conscious of the octatonic collection &quot;as a cohesive frame of reference&quot; in his autobiography &quot;My Musical Life&quot;, instances can be found in music of previous centuries. Eytan Agmon locates one in Domenico Scarlatti&#x27;s Sonata K. 319. In the following passage, according to Richard Taruskin, &quot;its descending whole-step/half-step bass progression is complete and continuous&quot;.

Taruskin also cites the following bars from J. S. Bach&#x27;s English Suite No. 3 as octatonic:

Honoré Langlé&#x27;s 1797 harmony treatise contains a sequential progression with a descending octatonic bass, supporting harmonies that use all and only the notes of an octatonic scale.

===19th century===
In 1800, Beethoven composed his Piano Sonata No. 11 in B, Op. 22. The slow movement of this work contains a passage of what was, for its time, highly dissonant harmony. In a lecture (2005), pianist András Schiff describes the harmony of this passage as &quot;really extraordinary&quot;. The chord progressions at the beginning of the second and third bars of this passage are octatonic:
Octatonic scales can be found in Chopin&#x27;s Mazurka, Op. 50, No. 3 and in several Liszt piano works: the closing measures of the third &quot;Étude de Concert&quot;, &quot;Un Sospiro,&quot; for example, where (mm. 66–70) the bass contains a complete falling octatonic scale from D-flat to D-flat, in the opening piano cadenzas of Totentanz, in the lower notes between the alternating hands, and in the First Mephisto Waltz, in which a short cadenza (m. 525) makes use of it by harmonizing it with a B-flat Diminished Seventh chord. Later in the 19th century, the notes in the chords of the coronation bells from the opening scene of Modest Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, which consist of &quot;two dominant seventh chords with roots a tritone apart&quot; according to Taruskin, are entirely derived from an octatonic scale.
Taruskin continues: &quot;Thanks to the reinforcement the lesson has received in some equally famous pieces like &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, the progression is often thought of as being peculiarly Russian.&quot;

Tchaikovsky was also influenced by the harmonic and coloristic potential of octatonicism. As Mark DeVoto points out, the cascading arpeggios played on the celesta in the &quot;Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; from &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; ballet are made up of dominant seventh chords a minor third apart. &quot;Hagens Watch&quot;, one of the darkest and most sinister scenes in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; features chromatic harmonies using eleven of the twelve chromatic notes, within which the eight notes of the octatonic scale may be found in bars 9–10 below:
===Late 19th and 20th century===

The scale is also found in the music of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. Melodic phrases that move by alternating tones and semitones frequently appear in the works of both these composers. Allen Forte identifies a five-note segment in the cor anglais melody heard near the start of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nuages&quot; from his orchestral suite &quot;Nocturnes&quot; as octatonic. Mark DeVoto describes &quot;Nuages&quot; as &quot;arguably [Debussy&#x27;s] boldest single leap into the musical unknown. &#x27;Nuages&#x27; defines a kind of tonality never heard before, based on the centricity of a diminished tonic triad (B-D-F natural).&quot; According to Stephen Walsh, the cor anglais theme &quot;hangs in the texture like some motionless object, always the same and always at the same pitch&quot;. There is a particularly striking and effective use of the octatonic scale in the opening bars of Liszt&#x27;s late piece &quot;Bagatelle sans tonalité&quot; from 1885.

The scale was extensively used by Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s student Igor Stravinsky, particularly in his Russian-period works such as &quot;Petrushka&quot; (1911), &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (1913), up to the &quot;Symphonies of Wind Instruments&quot; (1920). Passages using this scale are unmistakable as early as the &quot;Scherzo fantastique&quot;, &quot;Fireworks&quot; (both from 1908), and &quot;The Firebird&quot; (1910). It also appears in later works by Stravinsky, such as the &quot;Symphony of Psalms&quot; (1930), the &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; (1945), most of the neoclassical works from the Octet (1923) to &quot;Agon&quot; (1957), and even in some of the later serial compositions such as the &quot;Canticum Sacrum&quot; (1955) and &quot;Threni&quot; (1958). In fact, &quot;few if any composers have been known to employ relations available to the collection as extensively or in as varied a manner as Stravinsky&quot;.

The second movement of Stravinsky&#x27;s Octet for wind instruments opens with what Stephen Walsh calls &quot;a broad melody completely in the octatonic scale&quot;. Jonathan Cross describes a highly rhythmic passage in the first movement of the &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; as &quot;gloriously octatonic, not an unfamiliar situation in jazz, where this mode is known as the &#x27;diminished scale&#x27;, but Stravinsky of course knew it from Rimsky. The &#x27;rumba&#x27; passage... alternates chords of E-flat7 and C7, over and over, distantly recalling the coronation scene from Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. In celebrating America, the émigré looked back once again to Russia.&quot; Van den Toorn catalogues many other octatonic moments in Stravinsky&#x27;s music.

The scale also may be found in music of Alexander Scriabin and Béla Bartók. In Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Bagatelles&quot;, Fourth Quartet, &quot;Cantata Profana&quot;, and &quot;Improvisations&quot;, the octatonic is used with the diatonic, whole tone, and other &quot;abstract pitch formations&quot; all &quot;entwined... in a very complex mixture&quot;. &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot; Nos. 99, 101, and 109 are octatonic pieces, as is No. 33 of the &quot;44 Duos for Two Violins&quot;. &quot;In each piece, changes of motive and phrase correspond to changes from one of the three octatonic scales to another, and one can easily select a single central and referential form of 8–28 in the context of each complete piece.&quot; However, even his larger pieces also feature &quot;sections that are intelligible as &#x27;octatonic music.

Olivier Messiaen made frequent use of the octatonic scale throughout his career as a composer, and indeed in his seven modes of limited transposition, the octatonic scale is Mode 2. Peter Hill writes in detail about &quot;La Colombe&quot; (The Dove), the first of a set of &quot;Preludes&quot; for piano that Messiaen completed in 1929, at the age of 20. Hill speaks of a characteristic &quot;merging of tonality (E major) with the octatonic mode&quot; in this short piece.

Other twentieth-century composers who used octatonic collections include Samuel Barber, Ernest Bloch, Benjamin Britten, Julian Cochran, George Crumb, Irving Fine, Ross Lee Finney, Alberto Ginastera, John Harbison, Jacques Hétu, Aram Khachaturian, Witold Lutosławski, Darius Milhaud, Henri Dutilleux, Robert Morris, Carl Orff, Jean Papineau-Couture, Krzysztof Penderecki, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, Alexander Scriabin, Dmitri Shostakovich, Toru Takemitsu, Joan Tower, Robert Xavier Rodriguez, John Williams and Frank Zappa. Other composers include Willem Pijper, who may have inferred the collection from Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, which he greatly admired, and composed at least one piece—his Piano Sonatina No. 2—entirely in the octatonic system.

In the 1920s, Heinrich Schenker criticized the use of the octatonic scale, specifically Stravinsky&#x27;s Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, for the oblique relation between the diatonic scale and the harmonic and melodic surface.

===Jazz===
Both the half-whole diminished and its partner mode, the whole-half diminished (with a tone rather than a semitone beginning the pattern) are commonly used in jazz improvisation, frequently under different names. The whole-half diminished scale is commonly used in conjunction with diminished harmony (e.g., the Edim7 chord) while the half-whole scale is used in dominant harmony (e.g., with an F9 chord).

Examples of octatonic jazz include Jaco Pastorius&#x27; composition &quot;Opus Pocus&quot; from the album &quot;Pastorius&quot; and Herbie Hancock&#x27;s piano solo on &quot;Freedom Jazz Dance&quot; from the album &quot;Miles Smiles&quot; (1967).

=== Rock and pop ===
Jonny Greenwood of the English rock group Radiohead uses the octatonic scale extensively, such as in the song &quot;Just&quot; and his soundtrack for the film &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot;. He said &quot;It&#x27;s a slightly more grownup version of the pentatonic scales that we&#x27;re all taught to do with xylophones and glockenspiels when you&#x27;re a kid. It&#x27;s not a major scale or a minor scale; it&#x27;s something else. But all the notes work together and make a certain color that is its own thing.&quot;

The scale is used in progressive heavy metal music such as that by Dream Theater and Opeth, both of which strive for a dissonant and tonally ambiguous sound in their music. Examples include the instrumental break in Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Octavarium&quot; and Opeth&#x27;s &quot;Deliverance&quot;. Earlier examples of the scale&#x27;s use in progressive rock include King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot; and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s &quot;The Barbarian&quot;.

Progressive keyboardist Derek Sherinian is also closely associated with the octatonic scale, which can be found in most of his works, both solo and as part of a band. Examples include Planet X&#x27;s &quot;Desert Girl&quot; and Sons of Apollo&#x27;s &quot;King of Delusion&quot;. The dissonances associated with the scale when used in conjunction with conventional tonality form an integral part of his signature sound which has influenced hundreds of keyboardists of the 21st century.

==Harmonic implications==

===Petrushka chord===

The Petrushka chord is a recurring polytonal device used in Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Petrushka&quot; and in later music. In the Petrushka chord, two major triads, C major and F major – a tritone apart – clash, &quot;horribly with each other&quot;, when sounded together and create a dissonant chord. The six-note chord is contained within an octatonic scale.

=== French sixth and Mystic chord ===
While used functionally as a pre-dominant chord in the classical period, late romantic composers saw the French sixth used as a dissonant and unstable chord. The chord can be built from the first, fourth, sixth and eighth degrees of the half-step/whole-step octatonic scale, and is transpositionally invariant about a tritone, a property somewhat contributing to its popularity. The octatonic collection contains two distinct French sixth chords a minor third apart, and since they share no notes, the scale can be thought of as the union of those two chords. For example, two French sixths based on G and E contain all the notes of an octatonic scale between them.

The octatonic scale is used very frequently for melodic material above a French sixth chord throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly in Russia, in the music of Rimsky-Korsakov, Mussorgsky, Scriabin and Stravinsky, but also outside Russia in the works of Debussy and Ravel. Examples include Rimsky&#x27;s &quot;Scheherezade&quot;, Scriabin&#x27;s &quot;Five Preludes, Op. 74&quot;, Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nuages&quot; and Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Scarbo&quot;. All works are full of non-functional French sixths, and the octatonic scale is almost always the mode of choice.

By adding a major sixth above the root, from within the scale, and a major second, from outside the scale, the new chord is the Mystic chord found in some of Scriabin&#x27;s late works. While no longer transpositionally invariant, Scriabin teases the tritone symmetry of the French sixth in his music by alternating transpositions of the Mystic chord a tritone apart, implying the notes of an octatonic scale.

===Bitonality===
In Béla Bartók&#x27;s piano piece, &quot;Diminished Fifth&quot; from &quot;Mikrokosmos&quot;, octatonic collections form the basis of the pitch content. In mm. 1–11, all eight pitch classes from the E diminished scale appear. In mm. 1–4, the pitch classes A, B, C, and D appear in the right hand, and the pitch classes E, F, G, and A are in the left hand. The collection in the right hand outlines the first four notes of an A minor scale, and the collection in the left hand outlines the first four notes of an E minor scale. In mm. 5–11, the left and right hand switch—the A minor tetrachord appears in the left hand, and the E minor tetrachord appears in the right hand.

From this, one can see that Bartók has partitioned the octatonic collection into two (symmetrical) four-note segments of the natural minor scales a tritone apart. Paul Wilson argues against viewing this as bitonality since &quot;the larger octatonic collection embraces and supports both supposed tonalities&quot;.

Bartók also utilizes the two other octatonic collections so that all three possible octatonic collections are found throughout this piece (D, D, and E). In mm. 12–18, all eight pitch classes from the D octatonic collection are present. The E octatonic collection from mm. 1–11 is related to this D octatonic collection by the transposition operations, T, T4, T7, T10. In mm. 26–29, all eight pitch classes from the D octatonic collection appear. This collection is related to the E octatonic collection from mm. 1–11 by the following transposition operations: T2, T5, T8, T11.

Other relevant features of the piece include the groups of three notes taken from the whole-half diminished scale in mm. 12–18. In these measures, the right hand features D, E, and G, the tetrachord without the 3rd (F). The left hand has the same tetrachord transposed down a tritone (G, A, C). In mm. 16, both hands transpose down three semitones to B, C, E and E, G, A respectively. Later on, in mm. 20, the right hand moves on to A− and the left back to E−. After repeating the structure of mm. 12–19 in mm. 29–34 the piece ends with the treble part returning to A− and the bass part returning to E.

===Alpha chord===
The alpha chord (α chord) collection is, &quot;a vertically organized statement of the octatonic scale as two diminished seventh chords&quot;, such as: C–E–G–B–C–E–F–A.

One of the most important subsets of the alpha collection, the alpha chord (Forte number: 4-17, pitch class prime form (0347)), such as E–G–C–E; using the theorist Ernő Lendvai&#x27;s terminology, the C alpha chord may be considered a mistuned major chord or major/minor in first inversion (in this case, C major/minor). The number of semitones in the interval array of the alpha chord corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence.

===Beta chord===

The beta chord (β chord) is a five-note chord, formed from the first five notes of the alpha chord (integers: 0,3,6,9,11; notes: C, E, G, B, C). The beta chord can also occur in its reduced form, that is, limited to the characteristic tones (C, E, G, C and C, G, C). Forte number: 5-31B.

The beta chord may be created from a diminished seventh chord by adding a diminished octave. It may be created from a major chord by adding the sharpened root (solfege: in C, di is C: C, E, G, C), or from a diminished triad by adding the root&#x27;s major 7th (called a diminished major 7th, or C#Maj7. The diminished octave is inverted creates a minor ninth, creating a C(9) chord, a sound commonly heard in the V chord during an authentic cadence in a minor key.

===Gamma chord===
The gamma chord (γ chord) is 0,3,6,8,11 (Forte number 5-32A) It is the beta chord with one interval diminished: C, E, G, A, C. It may be considered a major-minor minor seventh chord on A: A, C, C, E, G. See also: Elektra chord. This is also commonly known as the Hendrix chord, or in jazz music as a Dominant 79 chord; the notes in this case creating an A79.

===Hungarian major and Romanian major===

The Hungarian major scale and Romanian major scale are both heptatonic subsets of the octatonic scale with one scale degree removed. The Hungarian major scale has the 2 degree removed, while the Romanian major scale has the 3 degree removed.

<text>In jazz, the altered scale, altered dominant scale, or super-Locrian scale (Locrian 4 scale) is a seven-note scale that is a dominant scale where all non-essential tones have been altered. This means that it comprises the three irreducibly essential tones that define a dominant seventh chord, which are root, major third, and minor seventh and that all other chord tones have been altered. These are:
* the fifth is altered to a 5 and a 5
* the ninth is altered to a 9 and a 9
*the eleventh is altered to a 11 (equivalent to a 5)
*the thirteenth is altered to a 13 (equivalent to a 5)

The altered forms of some of the non-essential tones coincide (augmented eleventh with diminished fifth and augmented fifth with minor thirteenth) meaning those scale degrees are enharmonically identical and have multiple potential spellings. The natural forms of the non-essential tones are absent in the scale, thus it lacks a major ninth, a perfect eleventh, a perfect fifth, and a major thirteenth. 

This is written below in musical notation with the essential chord tones coloured black and the non-essential altered chord tones coloured red.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4 c4^\markup { C altered scale }
 \override NoteHead.color = #red des dis
 \override NoteHead.color = #black e
 \override NoteHead.color = #red ges gis
 \override NoteHead.color = #black bes c
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The altered scale is made by the sequence: 

:Half, Whole, Half, Whole, Whole, Whole, Whole 

The abbreviation &quot;alt&quot; (for &quot;altered&quot;) used in chord symbols enhances readability by reducing the number of characters otherwise needed to define the chord and avoids the confusion of multiple equivalent complex names. For example, &quot;C7alt&quot; supplants &quot;C759911&quot;, &quot;C7−5+5−9+9&quot;, &quot;Caug7−9+9+11&quot;, etc.

This scale has existed for a long time as the 7th mode of the ascending melodic minor scale.

==Enharmonic spellings and alternate names==

The C altered scale is also enharmonically equivalent to the C Locrian mode with F changed to F. For this reason, the altered scale is sometimes called the Locrian 4 scale.

It is also enharmonically the seventh mode of the ascending melodic minor scale. The altered scale is also known as the Pomeroy scale after Herb Pomeroy, the Ravel scale after Maurice Ravel, and the diminished whole tone scale due to its resemblance to the lower part of the diminished scale and the upper part of the whole tone scale.

The super-Locrian scale (enharmonically identical to the altered scale) is obtained by flattening the fourth note of the diatonic Locrian mode. For example, flattening the fourth note of the C Locrian scale gives us the C altered scale:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 c4^\markup { C super-Locrian scale } des es fes ges aes bes c2 }
&lt;/score&gt;

The altered scale can also be achieved by raising the tonic of a major scale by a half step. For instance, raising the tonic of the C major scale by a half step (here spelled as an augmented unison) produces the scale C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C:

:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; { 
 \clef treble \time 7/4
 cis4 d e f g a b cis2 }

&lt;/score&gt;

The altered scale can also be the major scale with all of the notes except the tonic being flattened. For example, taking the C major scale and flattening all of the notes except the tonic produces the C altered scale (see above).

== Common usage ==
Because it contains the essential notes of a dominant seventh chord, it can be used to create melodies over the dominant chord in a jazz context. The added dissonance of the altered notes creates extra tension on the dominant.

<text>According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children (and then five children, starting with the seventh season finale). It originally ran on ABC from October 3, 2001, to June 2, 2009.

== Synopsis ==
Jim is a happy-go-lucky suburban father. Much like his real-life counterpart, Jim&#x27;s character is a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of twin boys Gordon and Jonathan.

Jim often finds himself in difficult situations, because his slacker sensibilities cause him to search for alternative ways to get things done with less effort. Jim is very cheap, selfish, rude and arrogant. While Cheryl&#x27;s brother Andy is Jim&#x27;s best friend/brother-in-law and her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women, especially if Cheryl or Dana find out. He doesn&#x27;t like people interrupting him when he talks, so he speaks over them to shut them up. Jim often makes an example of Andy, who for most of the series does not have a steady girlfriend. Dana and Jim argue constantly, but Dana flirts with Jim when she&#x27;s drunk, discovering after one such event that she respects Jim as a loving father despite his flaws.

== Episodes ==

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main and recurring cast ===



* Jim Belushi as James &quot;Jim&quot; (seasons 1–8): the titular role of the series. Jim is a suburban family man, successful construction business owner (Ground Up Design), and blues garage band frontman. In his stubborn ways, Jim gets himself into various predicaments, which compel him to solve in creative ways, all while battling his own conscience. Despite his best efforts, Jim ultimately admits his wrong-doings to Cheryl and others involved. Shenanigans aside, Jim is happily married to his loving wife, Cheryl. Jim and Cheryl&#x27;s three children (Ruby, Gracie and Kyle) complement the family dynamic through the series&#x27; run. At the end of season 7, Cheryl gives birth to identical twin sons, Johnathan and Gordon. Jim is an avid Chicago sports enthusiast. In numerous episodes, Jim is seen watching Chicago Bears football games in his living room. In season 4&#x27;s &quot;Poking the Bear&quot; episode, Jim shows his disdain for other football teams when his potential client takes him to a Green Bay Packers game. He enjoys playing harmonica and fronting his garage band. In various episodes, he and his band practice in the garage, except when Cheryl takes over the garage with a yoga class in season 2&#x27;s &quot;The Closet&quot; episode, forcing Jim and the band to practice in the attic.
* Courtney Thorne-Smith as Cheryl (seasons 1–8): Jim&#x27;s wife, as well as Dana and Andy&#x27;s older sister. Last names were never revealed for Jim and Cheryl, only middle names, (Orenthal and Mable). 
* Kimberly Williams-Paisley as Dana Gibson (seasons 1–7; special guest season 8): Cheryl&#x27;s younger sister. Dana is a vice president for a marketing company and prides herself at being good at her job. She often sides with her sister, Cheryl, during family quarrels.
* Larry Joe Campbell as Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; (seasons 1–8): Cheryl&#x27;s younger brother. Andy is a Stanford University graduate and works for Jim as an architect at their construction company, Ground Up Design. He often sides with Jim during family squabbles. He is a sci-fi enthusiast who collects video games, Nerf guns, DVD movies, board games, and comic books (as seen in season 6&#x27;s &quot;Separate Ways&quot;). Andy considers himself to be a &quot;ladies’ man&quot;, but his pick-up lines don&#x27;t bring many long-term relationships.
* Taylor Atelian as Ruby (seasons 1–8): Jim and Cheryl&#x27;s first child. Like her mother, Cheryl, Ruby is a leader amongst her siblings.
* Billi Bruno as Gracie (seasons 1–8): Jim and Cheryl&#x27;s second child. Gracie often sides with Ruby during sibling rivalries against Kyle.
* Conner Rayburn as Kyle (seasons 4–8): Jim and Cheryl&#x27;s third child. Kyle is not particularly interested in sports and finds it difficult to connect with his father on the topic.
* Mitch Rouse as Dr. Ryan &quot;Doc&quot; Gibson (recurring seasons 4–6; guest season 8): Cheryl&#x27;s doctor in season 4&#x27;s &quot;Poking the Bear&quot; episode. Ryan later becomes Dana&#x27;s boyfriend, the two eventually marry, and have a child together.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;According to Jim&quot; was created by Tracy Newman and Jonathan Stark. The sitcom was produced by ABC&#x27;s in-house production company and Newman/Stark, Suzanne Bukinik Entertainment and Brad Grey Television. Filming occurred at the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles. It was originally announced in May 2001 under the title &quot;The Dad&quot;, with the pilot being shot sometime in mid-2001. In July 2001, the show&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;The Dad&quot; to &quot;According to Jim&quot;.

Belushi, besides playing Jim, directed 30 episodes and is credited as executive producer.

Belushi&#x27;s fictional character Jim&#x27;s band in the series is the real-life House of Blues band The Sacred Hearts, for which Jim Belushi often sings lead.

==== Influences ====
Belushi says he set the show&#x27;s trademark tone back in the show&#x27;s 2001 pilot.

&quot;The original script called for Jim to go to the wife and apologize,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I said to the writers, &#x27;Why do we have to do a show where the guy is going to apologize at the end of every episode? Was he really wrong? He&#x27;s contrite, sure. But isn&#x27;t he just being a man?&#x27;&quot;

In an interview, Jim Belushi explained that the show many times directly reflected his actual life. Quite a few episodes were experiences taken directly from Belushi&#x27;s home. Most of the episodes were taken from experiences inside the writers&#x27; homes, too. He adds:

==== Family names ====
Last names were never really addressed for the entire run of the show. None of the main characters did get a last name until Season 4 when Kimberly Williams-Paisley&#x27;s character Dana married Dr. Ryan Gibson (played by Mitch Rouse). She became Dana Gibson with their marriage. Only guest characters had first and last names in most cases.

=== Music ===
The &quot;According to Jim&quot; soundtrack was recorded at Ultratone Studies in Studio City, California and released by Hollywood Records on November 1, 2005.

==== Track listing ====
All songs are performed by Jim Belushi and The Sacred Hearts.
== Release ==
=== Broadcast ===
The show first aired following the surprise hit comedy &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; and quickly developed an audience of its own. For its second season ABC placed it on its revitalized Tuesday line-up, which also included John Ritter&#x27;s &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, Bonnie Hunt&#x27;s &quot;Life with Bonnie&quot; and Sara Rue&#x27;s &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;. Week by week, the show attracted more and more viewers, becoming ABC&#x27;s second most watched sitcom. The show performed so well that the network made a risky move: putting &quot;Jim&quot; opposite the NBC juggernaut &quot;Frasier&quot;. Although &quot;Jim&quot; did not beat the competition, it performed well enough to secure itself that spot on the 2003 fall schedule.

On May 15, 2007, ABC announced that &quot;According to Jim&quot; would not be renewed for another season. ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson said, &quot;We are talking to the studio to see if there&#x27;s something financially, a deal that would make sense for us.&quot; But on June 27, 2007, ABC renewed the show for a seventh season with 18 episodes.

&quot;According to Jim&quot; returned to ABC&#x27;s schedule on Tuesday, January 1, 2008, with two episodes at 9 pm and 9:30 pm. After that, the series moved to its regular time slot at 8 pm. Despite the writer&#x27;s strike, ABC announced that the show would produce all 18 episodes ordered for this season.

On February 27, 2008, it was reported that ABC was close to renewing &quot;According to Jim&quot; for an eighth season. On May 13, 2008, ABC officially renewed the series and Season 8 began airing on December 2, 2008. Kimberly Williams-Paisley left the show&#x27;s regular cast at the beginning of Season 8 and was not in the Season 8 opening credits, to devote her time to motherhood. She made a guest appearance only in the season finale.

In December 2008, co-star Larry Joe Campbell said that the sets had been destroyed, indicating that the series was canceled, but that a series finale had been recorded. After the first six episodes of Season 8 all aired in December, &quot;According to Jim&quot; returned to ABC&#x27;s schedule on April 14, 2009, for the final 12 episodes.
The series finale of &quot;According to Jim&quot; aired on June 2, 2009, on ABC, and was titled &quot;Heaven Opposed to Hell.&quot;

=== Home media ===
Lionsgate Home Entertainment (under license from ABC Studios) has released the first five seasons on DVD in Region 1.

== Reception ==
The pilot was screened to critics in the month leading up to its premiere, and received a mixed response. In his September 9, 2001 review of the pilot, &quot;SFGate&quot;&#x27;s John Carmen labelled the show a &quot;formulaic comedy&quot;, and said the only distinguishable part of the pilot was when Jim&#x27;s four year old daughter Gracie loudly proclaimed &quot;I have a vagina&quot; during a kitchen scene. In her September 28, 2001 review of the pilot, Laura Fries of &quot;Variety&quot; said that the show &quot;works better when it stays within the family unit, where Belushi is key&quot;, adding that he &quot;reps the definition of a lovable lug&quot;. On October 2, 2001, Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;among the season&#x27;s worst new shows&quot;, and criticized it as &quot;[grabbing] every stereotype in its reach&quot;. Regarding Belushi&#x27;s character, she also said &quot;somehow Jim Belushi has made a career out of playing lovable lunks, even though no one finds his lunky characters lovable.&quot;

=== Ratings ===
The sitcom debuted in October 2001 on ABC with an average of 10 million viewers for its first year. The audience grew in the second year to over 10.3 million. The ratings remained consistent for Seasons 3 and 4 as well. Starting with Season 5, the ratings began to decline. The series was often scheduled against the hugely successful &quot;American Idol&quot;. By Season 6, &quot;According to Jim&quot; was down to 6.7 million viewers.

Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of &quot;According to Jim&quot; on ABC.

&quot;Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
&quot;According to Jim&quot; was nominated for 20 awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards (all for cinematography).

<doc id="175982" wikidata="Q61019" url="?curid=175982" title="Heinrich Kramer">
<text>Heinrich Kramer ( 1430 – 1505, aged 74-75), also known under the Latinized name Henricus Institor, was a German churchman and inquisitor. With his widely distributed book &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (1487), which describes witchcraft and endorses detailed processes for the extermination of witches, he was instrumental in establishing the period of witch trials in the early modern period. Professor Malcolm Gaskill has described Kramer as a &quot;superstitious psychopath.&quot;

== Life ==
Born in Schlettstadt, now Sélestat, Alsace, he joined the Dominican Order at an early age and while still a young man was appointed Prior of the Dominican house of his native town.

At some date before 1474 he was appointed Inquisitor for the Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless activity received recognition at Rome and he was the right-hand man of the Archbishop of Salzburg.

The papal bull &quot;Summis desiderantes&quot; which Pope Innocent VIII published in 1484 acknowledges the existence of witches and explicitly empowers the inquisition to prosecute witches and sorcerers. The bull aimed to reaffirm the jurisdiction of Kramer, who was denied authority as an inquisitor in Germany. 

One year later, he went to Innsbruck as the head of an inquisitorial commission with the stated intention of &quot;bringing witches to justice&quot;. Despite being granted episcopal jurisdiction to conduct trials by Georg Golser, bishop of Brixen, the latter eventually acquired a distaste for Kramer&#x27;s alleged scandals.

This most likely referred to the whole interrogation of Helena Scheuberin in Innsbruck and six other citizens accused of witchcraft. Helena herself, married to a prosperous burgher named Sebastian, was described as an &quot;aggressive, independent woman who was not afraid to speak her mind&quot;. Right after Kramer had arrived in the city, she had passed him in the street, spat and cursed him publicly: &quot;Fie on you, you bad monk, may the falling evil take you&quot;. Later, it was discovered she was not attending Kramer&#x27;s sermons and encouraged others to do likewise, all of which were brought against her as charges for the crime of witchcraft. Helena even disrupted one of his sermons &quot;by loudly proclaiming that she believed Institor to be an evil man in league with the devil&quot;.

During her trial, as Kramer focused heavily on the sexuality of Scheuberin, he was accused by the bishop of having &quot;presumed much that had not been proved&quot;. Kramer remained in Innsbruck to continue the investigation, collect evidence, and interrogate suspected witches. Golser and Kramer exchanged letters encouraging Kramer to quit the investigation, ending with a final letter in 1486 in which Golser ordered Kramer to leave his diocese, the trials in Innsbruck finally being suspended. Kramer finally relented and returned to Cologne.

In response to the Bishop&#x27;s criticism, Kramer began to write a treatise on witchcraft that later became the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (commonly translated as &quot;The Hammer of Witches&quot;). The bull &quot;Summis desiderantes&quot;, which gave him the authority of prosecuting and investigating cases of sorcery, was included in the forefront of the book, first published in 1487. 

Kramer failed in his attempt to obtain endorsement for this work from the top theologians of the Inquisition at the Faculty of Cologne, and they condemned the book as recommending unethical and illegal procedures, as well as being inconsistent to what they perceived as the orthodox Catholic doctrines of demonology.

In the overall evaluation, his works were praised and his prestige was growing. He was asked by the Nuremberg council to provide expert consultation on the procedure of witch trial in 1491. In 1495 he was summoned by the Master General of the Order, Joaquin de Torres, O.P. to Venice and gave very popular public lectures and disputations. They were worthy of the presence and patronage of the Patriarch of Venice. He also wrote treatises &quot;Several Discourses and Various Sermons upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist&quot; (Nuremberg, 1496); &quot;A Tract Confuting the Errors of Master Antonio degli Roselli&quot; (Venice, 1499); followed by &quot;The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church Against the Picards and Waldenses&quot; which were quoted by many authors. He was appointed as papal nuncio and his assignment as inquisitor was changed to Bohemia and Moravia by Pope Alexander VI in 1500.

Summers observes that 17th-century &quot;Dominican chroniclers, such as Quétif and Échard, number Kramer and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their Order&quot;.

He passed his last days intensely writing and preaching until his death in Kroměříž in Moravia, in 1505.

<doc id="175983" wikidata="Q5045780" url="?curid=175983" title="Carpetbag steak">
<text>Carpetbag steak or carpetbagger steak is a traditional working class dish from Mumbles, a historic oyster fishing village in Swansea, South Wales, UK. Over the years it has become a luxury dish, popular in the 1950s and 1960s in Australia and New Zealand.

It consists of an end cut of steak, such as scotch fillet or eye fillet. A pocket is cut in the meat via a small entry cut and then expanded internally, into which oysters are stuffed, and the opening closed with toothpicks or thread. As the dish is grilled, the flavour of the fresh oysters permeates the steak and blends with the juice of the tender meat.

The combination of beef and oysters is traditional and formed part of the everyday diet of oyster fisherman in Swansea in the mid 1800s. The earliest specific reference in the United States was a newspaper in 1891, which may indicate a connection with carpetbaggers or to gluttony. The earliest specific Australian reference is a printed recipe from between 1899 and 1907. Another recipe from 1909 includes cayenne pepper as an ingredient, which may indicate an American origin. The more recent Australian versions typically use Worcestershire sauce, as does the local version of Oysters Kilpatrick.

It is sometimes served standing up like a miniature mountain. A strip of bacon may be wrapped around the serving and surrounded by peeled and browned baby potato halves. In one style, the steak is marinated in a sauce of thyme, pepper, tarragon, lemon, sugar and tamarind and served with a glass of dessert wine.

<text>Wellesley College is a private women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Founded in 1870 by Henry and Pauline Durant as a female seminary, it is a member of the Seven Sisters Colleges, an unofficial grouping of current and former women&#x27;s colleges in the northeastern United States.

Wellesley contains 60 departmental and interdepartmental majors spanning the liberal arts, as well as over 150 student clubs and organizations. Wellesley athletes compete in the NCAA Division III New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference. Its 500-acre (200 ha) campus was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and houses the Davis Museum and a botanic garden.

==History==
Wellesley was founded by Pauline and Henry Fowle Durant, believers in educational opportunity for women, who intended that the college should prepare women for &quot;great conflicts, for vast reforms in social life&quot;. Its charter was signed on March 17, 1870, by Massachusetts Governor William Claflin. The original name of the college was the Wellesley Female Seminary; its renaming to Wellesley College was approved by the Massachusetts legislature on March 7, 1873. Wellesley first opened its doors to students on September 8, 1875. At the time of its founding, Wellesley College&#x27;s campus was actually situated in Needham; however, in 1880 residents of West Needham voted to secede and in 1881 the area was chartered as a new town, Wellesley.

Wellesley College was a leading center for women&#x27;s study in the sciences. Between 1875 and 1921, Wellesley employed more female scientists than any other U.S. institution of high education. After MIT, it was the second college in the United States to initiate laboratory science instruction for undergraduates. In early 1896, Sarah Frances Whiting, the first professor of physics and astronomy, was among the first U.S. scientists to conduct experiments in X-rays.

The first president of Wellesley was Ada Howard. There have been thirteen more presidents in its history: Alice Freeman Palmer, Helen Almira Shafer, Julia Irvine, Caroline Hazard, Ellen Fitz Pendleton, Mildred H. McAfee, Margaret Clapp, Ruth M. Adams, Barbara W. Newell, Nannerl O. Keohane (later the president of Duke University from 1993 to 2004), Diana Chapman Walsh, H. Kim Bottomly, and current president Paula Johnson.

The original architecture of the college consisted of one very large building, College Hall, which was approximately in length and five stories in height. It was completed in 1875. The architect was Hammatt Billings. College Hall was both an academic building and a residential building. On March 17, 1914, it was destroyed by fire, the precise cause of which was never officially established. The fire was first noticed by students who lived on the fourth floor near the zoology laboratory. It has been suggested that an electrical or chemical accident in this laboratory—specifically, an electrical incubator used in the breeding of beetles—triggered the fire.

A group of residence halls known as the Tower Court complex is located on top of the hill where the old College Hall once stood.

After the loss of the Central College Hall in 1914, the college adopted a master plan in 1921 and expanded into several new buildings. The campus hosted a Naval Reserve Officer Training program during the Second World War, and the College President Mildred McAfee took a leave of absence to lead the Women&#x27;s Reserve of the U.S. Navy. She received the Distinguished Service Medal in 1945. Wellesley College began to significantly revise its curriculum after the war and through the late 1960s; in 1968, the college began its exchange programs between other colleges in the area such as MIT. In 2013 the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.

The school has admitted transgender, non-binary, and genderqueer students since adopting an inclusive admissions policy in 2015.

==Campus==

The campus overlooks Lake Waban and includes evergreen, deciduous woodlands and open meadows. Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., Boston&#x27;s preeminent landscape architect at the beginning of the 20th century, described Wellesley&#x27;s landscape as &quot;not merely beautiful, but with a marked individual character not represented so far as I know on the ground of any other college in the country&quot;. He also wrote: &quot;I must admit that the exceedingly intricate and complex topography and the peculiarly scattered arrangement of most of the buildings somewhat baffled me&quot;. The campus is adjacent to the privately owned Hunnewell Estates Historic District, the gardens of which can be viewed from the lake&#x27;s edge on campus.

The original master plan for Wellesley&#x27;s campus landscape was developed by Olmsted, Arthur Shurcliff, and Ralph Adams Cram in 1921. This landscape-based concept represented a break from the architecturally-defined courtyard and quadrangle campus arrangement that was typical of American campuses at the time. The site&#x27;s glaciated topography, a series of meadows, and native plant communities shaped the original layout of the campus, resulting in a campus architecture that is integrated into its landscape.

The campus offers multiple housing options, including Tower Court, which was built after College Hall burnt down, the Quad (Quint, including Munger), the &quot;New Dorms&quot;, referring to the east-side dormitories erected in the 1950s, and multiple &quot;Branch Halls&quot;, including both a Spanish and French-speaking house. In total, Wellesley offers 17 different residence halls for students to live in.

The most recent master plan for Wellesley College was completed in 1998 by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. According to the designers, this plan was intended to restore and recapture the original landscape character of the campus that had been partially lost as the campus evolved through the 20th century. In 2011, Wellesley was listed by &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot; magazine as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.

Wellesley is home to Green Hall, completed in 1931, the only building bearing the name of famed miser Hetty Green; the building was funded by her children. Part of the building is the Galen L. Stone Tower, housing a 32-bell carillon, which is routinely played between classes by members of the Guild of Carillonneurs.

Houghton Chapel was dedicated in 1899 in the center of the college campus. The architectural firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge designed Houghton of gray stone in the classic Latin cross floor plan. The exterior walls are pierced by stained glass windows. Window designers include Tiffany; John La Farge; Reynolds, Francis &amp; Rohnstock; and Jeffrey Gibson. The chapel can seat up to 750 people. Houghton is used by the college for a variety of religious and secular functions, like lectures and music concerts, and is also available for rental. The lower-level houses the Multifaith Center.

In 1905 Andrew Carnegie donated $125,000 to build what is now known as Clapp Library, on the condition that the college match the amount for an endowment. The money was raised by 1907 and construction began June 5, 1909. In 1915 Carnegie gave another $95,446 towards an addition. This renovation added a recreational reading room, offices, archives, a reserve reading room, added space for rare books and additional stacks. The building underwent renovations from 1956 to 1959, that doubled its size. From 1973 to 1975 a major addition was added to the right-hand side of the building. In 1974 the building was renamed for Margaret Antoinette Clapp, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and member of the 1930 class who served as the eighth college president from 1949 to 1966.

The Davis Museum, opened in 1993, was the first building in North America designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Rafael Moneo, whose notion of the museum as a &quot;treasury&quot; or &quot;treasure chamber&quot; informs its design. The Davis is at the heart of the arts on the Wellesley campus adjacent to the academic quad and is connected by an enclosed bridge to the Jewett Arts Center, designed by Paul Rudolph. The collections span from ancient art from around the world to contemporary art exhibitions, and admission is free to the general public.

==Administration==

The current president of Wellesley College is Paula Johnson. Johnson previously founded the Connors Center for Women&#x27;s Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. She was the Grace A. Young Family Professor of Medicine in the Field of Women&#x27;s Health at Harvard Medical School, as well as professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Johnson succeeded H. Kim Bottomly to become Wellesley&#x27;s 14th President in July 2016.

Wellesley&#x27;s fund-raising campaign in 2005 set a record for liberal arts colleges with a total of $472.3 million, 18.1% more than the goal of $400 million. According to data compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education, Wellesley&#x27;s campaign total is the largest of any liberal arts college. In late 2015, the college launched another campaign, with a goal of $500 million. Many notable alumnae including Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Diane Sawyer, Susan Wagner, and Cokie Roberts collaborated on the campaign video and launch festivities. As of Fall 2017, over $446 million has been raised.

==Wellesley Centers for Women==
The Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW) is one of the largest gender-focused social science research-and-action organizations in the United States. Located on and nearby the Wellesley College campus, WCW was established when the Center for Research on Women (founded 1974) and the Stone Center for Development Services and Studies at Wellesley College (founded 1981) merged into a single organization in 1995. It is home to several prominent American feminist scholars, including Jean Kilbourne and Peggy McIntosh. The current executive director of the Wellesley Centers for Women is Layli Maparyan. Since 1974, the Wellesley Centers for Women has produced over 200 scholarly articles and over 100 books.

The Wellesley Centers for Women has five key areas of research: education, economic security, mental health, youth and adolescent development, and gender-based violence. WCW is also home to long-standing and highly successful action programs that engage in curriculum development and training, professional development, evaluation, field building, and theory building. Those programs include the National SEED Project, the National Institute on Out-of-School Time, Open Circle, the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute, and &quot;Women&#x27;s Review of Books.&quot;

==Academics==
Wellesley&#x27;s average class size is between 17 and 20 students, with a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. 60 departmental and interdepartmental majors are offered, and students have the option to propose their own major.

Wellesley offers support to nontraditional aged students through the Elisabeth Kaiser Davis Degree Program, open to students over the age of 24. The program allows women who, for various reasons, were unable to start or complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree at a younger age to attend Wellesley.

Wellesley offers dual degree programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Olin College of Engineering, enabling students to receive a Bachelor of Science at those schools in addition to a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley. Wellesley also has a joint five-year BA/MA program with Brandeis University&#x27;s International Business School, which allows qualified Wellesley students to receive a Masters of Arts degree from the school, as well as a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley.

Wellesley College offers research collaborations and cross-registration programs with other Boston-area institutions, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Babson College, Olin College, and Brandeis University.

Its most popular majors, based on 2023 graduates, were:
*Economics (94)
*Computer Sciences (67)
*Psychology (53)
*Political Science (45)
*Biological Sciences (37)
*Neuroscience (35)
*Mathematics (27)
*English (27)

===Admissions===

The 2020 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes admission to Wellesley as &quot;most selective&quot;. For the Class of 2023 (enrolling fall 2019), the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 680–750 for evidence-based reading and 680–780 for math, while the middle 50% range for the ACT composite score was 31–34 for enrolled first-year students. For the incoming class of 2028, Wellesley received a record number of applications, totaling over 8,900 applications, and 13% of applicants were offered admission. During the 2023-2024 admissions cycle (enrolling Fall 2024), the college was test-optional and did not publish standardized testing statistics for the class of 2027 as of July 2024. The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.

==== Transgender applicants ====
The college&#x27;s admissions policy was updated in 2015 to allow trans women and non-binary people assigned female at birth to be considered for admittance. The first Wellesley transgender students enrolled in Fall 2017.

==== Nontraditional age applicants ====
Wellesley began its program for non-traditional students in 1971 when the Continuing Education Program was launched. This program was renamed in 1991 for Elisabeth Kaiser Davis, a member of the Class of 1932. Wellesley allows applicants older than 24 who had begun but have not completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree to apply to the Elizabeth Kaiser Davis Degree Program. Davis Scholars are fully integrated into the Wellesley community; they take the same classes as traditional students and can choose to live on campus. According to the Wellesley web site, Davis Scholars&#x27; &quot;diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives enrich the lives of the whole student body.&quot;

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
For the 2024–2025 school year, Wellesley&#x27;s annual tuition was $92,060 per year, the first tuition cost for a Boston-area school (along with Boston University) to exceed $90,000 annually. In 2020–2021, the average annual aid offer was over $56,000. The maximum loan level for other students on aid is $12,825 total for four years.

===Rankings===
In its 2025 rankings of national liberal arts colleges in the U.S., &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Wellesley seventh overall, first for women&#x27;s colleges, 8th for &quot;best value&quot;, tied at 23rd for &quot;best undergraduate teaching&quot;, and 17th for &quot;top performers on social mobility&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Wellesley 13th among 218 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

In addition, &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; 2024-25 &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; ranked the institution 23rd among the top 500 U.S. colleges, service academies and universities. Wellesley College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==Student life==
Approximately 98% of students live on campus. Some cooperative housing is available, including a sustainable living co-op, a feminist co-op, and a French language house located slightly off-campus. Wellesley offers housing for Davis Scholars as well, though not for their children or spouses, which is a point of frequent debate on campus.

For more than 50 years, Wellesley has offered a cross-registration program with MIT. Students can participate in research at MIT through the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). In recent years, cross-registration opportunities have expanded to include nearby Babson College, Brandeis University, and Olin College of Engineering. To facilitate cross-registration, the Wellesley College Senate bus connects Wellesley to the Harvard University and MIT campuses in Cambridge, Massachusetts; additionally, the college also operates a shuttle to the Babson College and Olin College campuses. It is also a member of a number of exchange programs with other small colleges, including opportunities for students to study a year at Amherst, Connecticut College, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wesleyan, and Wheaton.

===Organizations===
The college has approximately 180 student organizations, ranging from cultural and political organizations to community service, publications, campus radio, and club sports.

WZLY is the college&#x27;s campus radio station. It is entirely student-run and plays on 91.5 FM in the town of Wellesley and some surrounding areas. Founded in 1942, it holds claim to be the oldest still-running women&#x27;s college radio station in the country.

Publications on campus include &quot;Counterpoint&quot;, the monthly journal of campus life; &quot;The Wellesley News&quot;, the campus newspaper; &quot;International Relations Council Journal,&quot; the internationally oriented campus publication; &quot;The Wellesley Review&quot;, the literary magazine; and &quot;W.Collective&quot;, the fashion and lifestyle magazine.

There are also several social organizations on campus, called &quot;societies,&quot; which each have a unique academic focus. In order to join, students must attend &quot;teas&quot; where they can learn more about the focus of each society. Societies that are active on campus include the Shakespeare Society (theater), Society Zeta Alpha (literature), Tau Zeta Epsilon (arts and music), and Agora Society (politics).

===Athletics===

Wellesley fields 13 varsity sports teams – basketball, crew, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball. Wellesley does not have a mascot in the traditional sense – its sports teams are referred to both individually and collectively as &quot;the Blue&quot; (the school colors are royal blue and white). Wellesley is a member of the NCAA NCAA Division III and the Eastern Conference Athletic Conference (ECAC) and competes primarily as a member of the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC).

The Wellesley College Crew Team, affectionately known as &quot;Blue Crew&quot;, was founded in 1970 and was the first women&#x27;s intercollegiate rowing team in the country. In 2016, Blue Crew won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team for the first time in Wellesley history, with its first Varsity 8+ boat placing first and second Varsity 8+ boat placing second. This historic win marked the first time a team from Wellesley College won a national championship and the first time a women&#x27;s college won the NCAA Rowing Championships. In 2022, Blue Crew won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team for a second time, with both its first Varsity 8+ and second Varsity 8+ boats placing second. In 2023, Blue Crew again won the NCAA Division III Rowing Championship as a team, with its first Varsity 8+ boat placing first and second Varsity 8+ boat placing second.

Wellesley also fields club teams in archery, alpine &amp; Nordic skiing, equestrian, ice hockey, rugby, sailing, squash, Ultimate Frisbee, and water polo. Squash was originally a varsity sport but was downgraded to a club sport status in 2017.

From 1943 to 1946, Judy Atterbury won multiple national intercollegiate women&#x27;s tennis championships in both singles (1943, 1946) and doubles (1943, 1944). Nadine Netter won the Eastern Women&#x27;s College Tournament in 1962, and was the Eastern Intercollegiate Champion and New England Intercollegiate women&#x27;s Tennis Championship winner in 1965.

====Crew====
In both 2016 and 2023, Wellesley College&#x27;s first Varsity 8+ boat became a national champion in its event at the NCAA Rowing Championships. Wellesley College Crew Team&#x27;s head coach, Tessa Spillane, was voted the NCAA Division III Rowing Coach of the Year in 2010–11, 2015–16, and 2021–22. Additionally, Wellesley College Crew Team&#x27;s coaching staff received the 2015–16 and 2021–22 CRCA NCAA Division III National Coaching Staff of the Year awards.

===Traditions===

Hoop rolling is an annual tradition at the college that dates to 1895. Each upperclasswoman has a wooden hoop, often passed down to her from her &quot;big sister&quot;. Before graduation, the seniors, wearing their graduation robes, run a short race while rolling their hoops. In the early 20th century, the winner was said to be the first in her class to marry; in the 1980s, the winner was said to become the class&#x27;s first CEO; and since the 1990 Commencement speech by then-First Lady Barbara Bush, the winner has been said to be the first to achieve success, however she defines it.

The Wellesley campus sits just before the halfway mark on the Boston Marathon course, and students come out to cheer runners in what has become known as the &quot;Scream Tunnel&quot;. Student have been cheering on runners since the first running of the marathon. In 1966 the school heard word that a woman was running in the race and turned out in numbers in cheer her on. Once women were officially allowed to register for the 1972 race, the campus cheer tradition became more popular.

==Notable alumnae and faculty==

===Notable alumnae===

<doc id="175987" wikidata="Q60959" url="?curid=175987" title="Jacob Sprenger">
<text>Jacob Sprenger (also James, 1436/1438 – 6 December 1495) was a Dominican inquisitor and theologian principally known for his association with a well-known guide for witch-hunters from 1486, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. He was born in Rheinfelden, Further Austria, taught at the University of Cologne, and died in 1495 in Strasbourg.

==The Dominican Order==
===Novice===
Sprenger was admitted as a novice in the Dominican house of Rheinfelden in 1452 and became a zealous reformer. He founded an association of the Confraternity of the Holy Rosary in Strasbourg in 1474. 

===Theologian===
He became a Master of Theology and then in 1480 Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Cologne and was a popular lecturer.

===Inquisitor===
In 1481 he was appointed as an Inquisitor for the Provinces of Mainz, Trier and Cologne, a post that demanded constant traveling through an extensive district.

==Associated authorship of &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;==
Sprenger was named along with Heinrich Kramer in the 1484 papal bull &quot;Summis desiderantes&quot; of Pope Innocent VIII and reprinted in the infamous &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. All editions after 1519 named Sprenger as Heinrich Kramer&#x27;s co-author.

It has been claimed that Sprenger cannot be linked to any witch trial, that his personal relationship to Kramer was acrimonious, and that Sprenger used his powerful position whenever he could to make Kramer&#x27;s life and work as difficult as possible. Some scholars now believe that he became associated with the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; largely as a result of Kramer&#x27;s wish to lend his book as much official authority as possible.

===Friedrich Spee in Cologne===
In a 1631 work most concerned with innocence, and opposed to the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, Friedrich Spee attributes authorship of the book to &quot;Jacob Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer.&quot; Though Spee was Jesuit (not Dominican) and his work was written more than a century after &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, both Spee and Sprenger were professors of theology in Cologne and both travelled extensively in many of the same areas. Some of Spee&#x27;s fellow professors in Cologne were appalled by Spee&#x27;s book and thought it should be listed on the papal Index of Forbidden Books. This would suggest that, whether or not Sprenger initially endorsed or opposed the work of Heinrich Kramer, the book carrying Sprenger&#x27;s name did eventually find a degree of influence among the Catholic theologians in Cologne. 

===Salem Witch Trials===
The Harvard President and Puritan Increase Mather cited &quot;Sprenger&quot; as a reference to the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; in an influential pro-witch-hunting work published in 1684, as well as another work published in 1692, the same year as the Salem Witch Trials: &quot;Witches have often (as Sprenger observes) desired that they might stand or fall by this trial by hot iron, and sometimes come off well.&quot;

<text>Pirate radio is a radio station that broadcasts without a valid license, whether an invalid license or no license at all. In some cases, radio stations are considered legal where the signal is transmitted, but illegal where the signals are received—especially when the signals cross a national boundary.

In other cases, a broadcast may be considered &quot;pirate&quot; due to the nature of its content, its transmission format (especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations), or the transmit power (wattage) of the station, even if the transmission is not technically illegal (such as an amateur radio transmission). Pirate radio is sometimes called bootleg radio (a term especially associated with two-way radio), clandestine radio (associated with heavily politically motivated operations) or free radio.

==History==
Radio &quot;piracy&quot; began with the advent of regulation of the airwaves at the dawn of the age of radio. Initially, radio, or wireless as it was more commonly called at the time, was an open field of hobbyists and early inventors and experimenters. 
The degree of state control varied by country. For example, in the UK, Marconi&#x27;s work was supported by the post office, but in an era of weak regulation, a music hall magician Nevil Maskelyne deliberately hijacked a demonstration.

The United States Navy began using radio for time signals and weather reports on the east coast of the United States in the 1890s. Before the advent of vacuum tube technology, early radio enthusiasts used (electronically) noisy spark-gap transmitters. The Navy soon began complaining to a sympathetic press that amateurs were disrupting naval transmissions. The May 25, 1907, edition of &quot;Electrical World&#x27;,&#x27; in an article called &quot;Wireless and Lawless,&quot; reported authorities were unable to prevent an amateur from interfering with the operation of a government station at the Washington, D.C. Navy Yard using legal means.

In the run-up to the London Radiotelegraph Convention in 1912, and amid concerns about the safety of marine radio following the sinking of the on April 15 of that year, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; of April 17, 1912, headlined President William Howard Taft&#x27;s initiative to regulate the public airwaves in an article titled &quot;President Moves to Stop Mob Rule of Wireless.&quot;

=== Europe===
In Europe, Denmark had the first known radio station in the world to broadcast commercial radio from a vessel in international waters without permission from the authorities in the country to which it broadcast (Denmark in this case). The station was named Radio Mercur and began transmission on August 2, 1958. In the Danish newspapers it was soon called a &quot;pirate radio&quot;. In the Netherlands in 1964, &quot;Radio Noordzee&quot; and &quot;TV Noordzee&quot; began broadcasting from the REM Island and Radio Veronica acquired a new ship, a converted fishing trawler named &quot;MV Norderney&quot;.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the 1960s in the UK, the term referred to not only a perceived unauthorized use of the state-run spectrum by the unlicensed broadcasters but also the risk-taking nature of offshore radio stations that actually operated on anchored ships or marine platforms. The term had been used previously in Britain and the US to describe unlicensed land-based broadcasters and even border blasters. For example, a 1940 British comedy about an unauthorized TV broadcaster, &quot;Band Waggon&quot;, uses the phrase &quot;pirate station&quot; several times. A good example of this kind of activity was Radio Luxembourg located in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The English language evening broadcasts from Radio Luxembourg were beamed by Luxembourg-licensed transmitters. The audience in the United Kingdom originally listened to their radio sets by permission of a wireless license issued by the British General Post Office (GPO). However, under terms of that wireless license, it was an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act to listen to &quot;unauthorised&quot; broadcasts, which possibly included those transmitted by Radio Luxembourg. Therefore, as far as the British authorities were concerned, Radio Luxembourg was a &quot;pirate radio station&quot; and British listeners to the station were breaking the law (although as the term &#x27;unauthorised&#x27; was never properly defined it was somewhat of a legal ). This did not stop British newspapers from printing programme schedules for the station, or a British weekly magazine aimed at teenage girls, &quot;Fab 208&quot;, from promoting the DJs and their lifestyle. (Radio Luxembourg&#x27;s wavelength was 208 metres (1439, then 1440 kHz)).

Radio Luxembourg was later joined by other well-known pirate stations received in the UK in violation of UK licensing, including Radio Caroline and Radio Atlanta (subsequently Radio Carolines North and South respectively, following their merger and the original ship&#x27;s relocation), Radio London, and Laser 558, all of which broadcast from vessels anchored outside of territorial limits and were therefore legitimate. Radio Jackie, for instance, although transmitting illegally was registered for VAT and even had its address and telephone number in local telephone directories.

By the 1970s, pirate radio in the UK had mostly moved to land-based broadcasting, transmitting from tower blocks in towns and cities.

===United States===
In the US, the 1912 &quot;Act to Regulate Radio Communication&quot; assigned amateurs and experimenters their own frequency spectrum, and introduced licensing and call-signs. A federal agency, the Federal Radio Commission, was formed in 1927 and succeeded in 1934 by the Federal Communications Commission. These agencies would enforce rules on call-signs, assigned frequencies, licensing, and acceptable content for broadcast.

The Radio Act of 1912 gave the president legal permission to shut down radio stations &quot;in time of war&quot;. During the first two and a half years of World War I, before US entry, President Wilson tasked the US Navy with monitoring US radio stations, nominally to &quot;ensure neutrality.&quot; The US was divided into two civilian radio &quot;districts&quot; with corresponding call-signs, beginning with &quot;K&quot; in the west and &quot;W&quot; in the east. The Navy was assigned call-signs beginning with &quot;N&quot;. The Navy used this authority to shut down amateur radio in the western part of the US. When Wilson declared war on Germany on April 6, 1917, he also issued an executive order closing most radio stations not needed by the US government. The Navy took it a step further and declared it was illegal to listen to radio or possess a receiver or transmitter in the US, but there were doubts they had the authority to issue such an order even in war time. The ban on radio was lifted in the US in late 1919.

In 1924, New York City station WHN was accused by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) of being an &quot;outlaw station&quot; for violating trade licenses which permitted only AT&amp;T stations to sell airtime on their transmitters. As a result of the AT&amp;T interpretation, a landmark case was heard in court, which even prompted comments from Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover when he took a public stand in the station&#x27;s defense. Although AT&amp;T won its case, the furor created was such that those restrictive provisions of the transmitter license were never enforced.
In 1926, WJAZ in Chicago changed its frequency to one previously reserved for Canadian stations without getting permission to make the change, and was charged by the federal government with &quot;wave piracy&quot;. The resulting legal battle found that the Radio Act of 1912 did not allow the US government to require stations to operate on specific frequencies, and the result was the passage of the Radio Act of 1927 to strengthen the government&#x27;s regulatory authority.

While Mexico issued radio station XERF with a license to broadcast, the power of its 250 kW transmitter was far greater than the maximum of 50 kW authorized for commercial use by the government of the United States of America. Consequently, XERF and many other radio stations in Mexico, which sold their broadcasting time to sponsors of English-language commercial and religious programs, were labelled as &quot;border blasters&quot;, but not &quot;pirate radio stations&quot;, even though the content of many of their programs could not have been aired by a US-regulated broadcaster. Predecessors to XERF, for instance, had originally broadcast in Kansas, advocating &quot;goat-gland surgery&quot; for improved masculinity, but moved to Mexico to evade US laws about advertising medical treatments, particularly unproven ones.

==Free radio==

Another variation on the term &quot;pirate radio&quot; came about during the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; in San Francisco during the 1960s. &quot;Free radio&quot; usually referred to secret and unlicensed land-based transmissions. These were also tagged as being pirate radio transmissions. Free Radio was used only to refer to radio transmissions that were beyond government control, as was offshore radio in the UK and Europe.

The term &quot;free radio&quot; was adopted by the Free Radio Association of listeners who defended the rights of the offshore radio stations broadcasting from ships and marine structures off the coastline of the United Kingdom.

Félix Guattari points out:

==Propaganda broadcasting==
Propaganda broadcasting may be authorized by the government at the transmitting site, but may be considered unwanted or illegal by the government of the intended reception area. Propaganda broadcasting conducted by national governments against the interests of other national governments has created radio jamming stations transmitting noises on the same frequency to prevent reception of the incoming signal. While the United States transmitted its programs towards the Soviet Union, which attempted to jam them, in 1970 the government of the United Kingdom decided to employ a jamming transmitter to drown out the incoming transmissions from the commercial station Radio North Sea International, which was based aboard the motor vessel (MV) Mebo II anchored off southeast England in the North Sea. Other examples of this type of unusual broadcasting include the USCGC &quot;Courier&quot; (WAGR-410), a United States Coast Guard cutter which both originated and relayed broadcasts of the &quot;Voice of America&quot; from an anchorage at the Greek island of Rhodes to Soviet bloc countries. Balloons have been flown above Key West, Florida, to support the TV transmissions of TV Martí, which are directed at Cuba (the Cuban government jams the signals). Military broadcasting aircraft have been flown over Vietnam, Iraq, and many other nations by the United States Air Force.

==Piracy in amateur and two-way radio==

Illegal use of licensed radio spectrum (also known as &quot;bootlegging&quot; in CB circles) is fairly common and takes several forms.

*Unlicensed operation—Particularly associated with amateur radio and licensed personal communication services such as GMRS, this refers to use of radio equipment on a section of spectrum for which the equipment is designed but on which the user is not licensed to operate (most such operators are informally known as &quot;bubble pack pirates&quot; from the sealed plastic retail packaging common to such walkie-talkies). While piracy on the US GMRS band, for example, is widespread (some estimates have the number of total GMRS users outstripping the number of licensed users by several orders of magnitude), such use is generally disciplined only in cases where the pirate&#x27;s activity interferes with a licensee. A notable case is that of former United States amateur operator Jack Gerritsen operating under the revoked call sign KG6IRO who was successfully prosecuted by the FCC for unlicensed operation and malicious interference. A subcategory of this is free banding, the use of allocations nearby a legal allocation, most typically the 27 MHz Citizen&#x27;s Band using modified or purpose-built gear.
*Inadvertent interference—Common when personal communications gear is brought into countries where it is not certified to operate. Such interference results from clashing frequency allocations, and occasionally requires wholesale reallocation of an existing band due to an insurmountable interference problem; for example, the 2004 approval in Canada of the unlicensed use of the United States General Mobile Radio Service frequencies due to interference from users of FRS/GMRS radios from the United States, where Industry Canada had to transfer a number of licensed users on the GMRS frequencies to unoccupied channels to accommodate the expanded service.
*Deliberate or malicious interference—refers to the use of two-way radio to harass or jam other users of a channel. Such behaviour is widely prosecuted, especially when it interferes with mission-critical services such as aviation radio or marine VHF radio.
*Illegal equipment—This refers to the use of illegally modified equipment or equipment not certified for a particular band. Such equipment includes illegal linear amplifiers for CB radio, antenna or circuit modifications on walkie-talkies, the use of &quot;export&quot; radios for free banding, or the use of amateur radios on unlicensed bands that amateur gear is not certified for. The use of marine VHF radio gear for inland mobile radio operations is common in some countries, with enforcement difficult since marine VHF is generally the province of maritime authorities.

Pirate radio is also a central plot point of the video game &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; and its sequel &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;.
The video game &quot;&quot; features the character Regulus, the captain of the pirate radio station &quot;APPLe.&quot;

<text>John Gower (; c. 1330 – October 1408) was an English poet, a contemporary of William Langland and the Pearl Poet, and a personal friend of Geoffrey Chaucer. He is remembered primarily for three major works—the &quot;Mirour de l&#x27;Omme&quot;, &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot;, and &quot;Confessio Amantis—&quot;three long poems written in French, Latin, and English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.

==Life==

Few details are known of Gower&#x27;s early life. He was probably born into a family which held properties in Kent and Suffolk. Stanley and Smith use a linguistic argument to conclude that &quot;Gower’s formative years were spent partly in Kent and partly in Suffolk&quot;. Southern and Nicolas conclude that the Gower family of Kent and Suffolk cannot be related to the Yorkshire Gowers because their coats of arms are drastically different. Macaulay and other critics have observed that he must have spent considerable time reading the Bible, Ovid, &quot;Secretum Secretorum&quot;, Petrus Riga, &quot;Speculum Speculationum&quot;, Valerius Maximus, John of Salisbury, and others.

He once met Richard II. In the prologue of the first recension of the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, he tells how the king, chancing to meet him on the Thames (probably circa 1385), invited him aboard the royal barge, and that their conversation then resulted in a commission for the work that would become the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;. Later in life his allegiance switched to the future Henry IV, to whom later editions of the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; were dedicated. Much of this is based on circumstantial rather than documentary evidence, and the history of revisions of the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, including the different dedications, is yet to be fully understood.

The source of Gower&#x27;s income remains a mystery. He may have practised law in or around London. George Campbell Macaulay lists several real estate transactions to which Gower was a party. Macaulay&#x27;s Introduction to the French Works suggests that Gower may have been a dealer in wool. This is based on remarks from Mirour d l&#x27;Omme line 25360ff. From 1365 he received ten pounds&#x27; rent for the manor of Wygebergh in Essex. From 1382 until death he received forty pounds per annum from selling Feltwell in Norfolk and Moulton in Suffolk. In 1399 Henry IV granted him a pension, in the form of an annual allowance of two pipes (= 1 tun = 240 gallons) of Gascony wine. Carlson estimates the value of the two pipes as 3 to 4 pounds wholesale or 8 pounds retail.
Gower&#x27;s friendship with Chaucer is also well documented. When Chaucer was sent as a diplomat to Italy in 1378, Gower was one of the men to whom he gave power of attorney over his affairs in England. The two poets also paid one another compliments in their verse: Chaucer dedicated his &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; in part to &quot;moral Gower&quot;, and Gower reciprocated by placing a speech in praise of Chaucer in the mouth of Venus at the end of the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; (first recension VIII.2950-70). The Introduction to the Man of Law&#x27;s Tale (lines 77–89) contains an apparent reference to Gower&#x27;s tales of Canacee and Tyro Appolonius. Tyrwhitt (1822) believed that this offended Gower and led to the removal of Venus’ praise of Chaucer. Twentieth-century sources have more innocent reasons for the deletion.

At some point during the middle 1370s, he took up residence in rooms provided by the Priory of St Mary Overie (now Southwark Cathedral). In 1398, while living here, he married, probably for the second time: his wife was Agnes Groundolf, who survived him. In his last years, and possibly as early as 1400, he became blind.

After his death in 1408, Gower was interred in an ostentatious tomb in the Priory church (now Southwark Cathedral), where it remains today.

Macaulay provides much information and speculation about Gower. Some of his conclusions are inferences drawn from the trilingual writings of Gower. Where possible he draws upon legal records and other biographers.

==Works==

Gower&#x27;s verse is by turns religious, political, historical, and moral—though he has been narrowly defined as &quot;moral Gower&quot; ever since Chaucer graced him with the epithet. His primary mode is allegory, although he shies away from sustained abstractions in favour of the plain style of the raconteur.

His earliest works were probably ballades in Anglo-Norman French, some of which may have later been included in his work the &quot;Cinkante Ballades&quot;. The first work which has survived is in the same language, however: it is the &quot;Speculum Meditantis&quot;, also known by the French title &quot;Mirour de l&#x27;Omme&quot;, a poem of just under 30,000 lines, containing a dense exposition of religion and morality. According to Yeager &quot;Gower&#x27;s first intent to write a poem for the instructional betterment of king and court, at a moment when he had reason to believe advice about social reform might influence changes predictably to take place in an expanded jurisdiction, when the French and English peoples were consolidated under a single crown.&quot;

Gower&#x27;s second major work, the &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot;, was written in Latin. 
The first book has an allegorical account of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt which begins as an allegory, becomes quite specific and ends with an allusion to William Walworth’s suppression of the rebels. Gower takes the side of the aristocracy but the actions of Richard II are described by &quot;the captain in vain endeavoured to direct the ship’s course&quot;.Subsequent books decry the sins of various classes of the social order: priests, friars, knights, peasants, merchants, lawyers. The last two books give advice to King Richard II and express the poet&#x27;s love for England. As Gower admits, much of &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; was borrowed from other authors. Macaulay refers to this as &quot;schoolboy plagiarism&quot; Peter classifies &quot;Mirour&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot; as &quot;complaint literature&quot; in the vein of Langland.

His third work is the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, a 30,000-line poem in octosyllabic English couplets, which makes use of the structure of a Christian confession (presented allegorically as a confession of sins against Love) as a narrative frame within which a multitude of individual tales are told. Like his previous works, the theme is very much morality, even where the stories themselves have a tendency to describe rather immoral behaviour. One scholar asserts that &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot; &quot;almost exclusively&quot; made Gower&#x27;s &quot;poetic reputation.&quot;

Fisher views the three major works as &quot;one continuous work&quot; with &quot;In Praise of Peace&quot; as a capstone. There is &quot;movement from the courtly tone of the &quot;Cinkante Balades&quot; to the moral and philosophical tone of the &quot;Traitie&quot;.&quot; Leland (ca 1540) states &quot;that the three works were intended to present a systematic discourse upon the nature of man and society&quot;: They provide as organized and unified a view as we have of the social ideals on England upon the eve of the Renaissance. This view may be subsumed under the three broad headings: individual VIRTUE, legal JUSTICE, and the administrative responsibility of the KING. The works progress from the description of the origins of sin and the nature of the vices and virtues at the beginning of the &quot;Mirour de l&#x27;omme&quot;, through consideration of social law and order in the discussion of the three estates in the &quot;Mirour&quot; and &quot;Vox Clamatis&quot;, to a final synthesis of royal responsibiity of Empedoclean love in the &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;.

In later years Gower published a number of minor works in all three languages: 
* the &quot;Cinkante Ballades&quot;, a series of French ballades on romantic subjects. Yeager (2011) argues that these sonnets were composed throughout Gower&#x27;s lifetime.
* the English poem &quot;In Praise of Peace&quot; &quot;is a political poem in which Gower, as a loyal subject of Henry IV, approves his coronation, admires him as the saviour of England, dilates on the evil of war and the blessing of peace, and finally begs him to display clemency and seek domestic peace&quot; Fisher argued that it was &quot;Gower&#x27;s last important poem. It sums up the final twenty years of both his literary career and his literary achievement.&quot;
* short Latin works on various subjects with several poems addressed to the new Henry IV. According to Yeager (2005) &quot;his final metered thoughts were in Latin, the language that Gower, like most of his contemporaries, associated with timeless authority.&quot;

Critics have speculated on which late work triggered the royal wine allowance mentioned in the Life section. Candidates are &quot;Cronica tripertita&quot;, &quot;In Praise of Peace&quot;, &quot;O Recolende&quot; or an illustrated presentation copy of Confessio with dedication to Henry IV. According to Meyer-Lee &quot;no known evidence relates the collar or grant [of wine] to his literary activity.&quot;

==Prediction of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt==
When Wickert was attempting to date &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; Books Two to Seven, she found two passages which predict the revolt. One is &quot;Mirour&quot; which uses the metaphor of the stinging nettle to predict the impending catastrophe. The second is the final couplet of &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot; Book Five Chapter 10. This predicts trouble in a short time. Gower&#x27;s warnings and call for reform were ignored both before and after the events of 1381.

==Chaucer influence==
Chaucer used octosyllabic lines in &quot;The House of Fame&quot; but eschewed iambic rhythm. He &quot;left it to Gower to invent the iambic tetrameter, and to later centuries of poets to solve the problems of its potential monotony; he himself merely polished the traditional Middle English short line.&quot;

Fisher concludes that they were living near each other in the period 1376 to 1386. They influenced each other in several ways:
# They imported Italian models and learned &quot;to count beats in such a way as to produce a regular number of syllables.&quot; This led via &quot;Mirour&quot; to the iambic tetrameter of &quot;Confessio&quot; and Chaucer&#x27;s pentameter.
# After 1376 both poets turned from love poetry to more serious topics. For Gower this was the &quot;moralistic social complaint in the &quot;Mirour d l&#x27;omme&quot; and &quot;Vox Clamatis&quot;, while Chaucer wrestled more painfully in the &quot;House of Fame&quot; and &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot; with the relation between the style and substance of courtly poetry and social satire.&quot;
# Gower &quot;took the risk of composing in English only after Chaucer had achieved success and fame with &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;.&quot;
# Most of the individuals in the General Prologue are members of classes criticized in &quot;Mirour&quot; and &quot;Vox Clamantis&quot;. Chaucer has omitted the higher ranks of the secular and clerical hierarchies. The language and the introduction of satire are the invention of Chaucer.
# Gower is criticized in the Introduction to The Man of Law&#x27;s Tale. Some commentators have interpreted these remarks to indicate a breach between the two poets. Fisher interprets them and along with the details of the Tale as a friendly competition between two poets.

==Manuscripts==
Sebastian Sobecki&#x27;s discovery of the early provenance of the trilingual Trentham manuscript reveals Gower as a poet who was not afraid to give Henry IV stern political advice. Sobecki also claims to have identified Gower&#x27;s autograph hand in two manuscripts.

==Critical reception==
Gower&#x27;s poetry has had a mixed critical reception. In the 16th century, he was generally regarded alongside Chaucer as the father of English poetry. In the 18th and 19th centuries, however, his reputation declined, largely on account of a perceived didacticism and dullness, along with the perception that Gower was a servile follower of the Lancastrian regime. Thus the American poet and critic James Russell Lowell claimed Gower &quot;positively raised tediousness to the precision of science&quot;. After publication of Macaulay&#x27;s edition (1901) of the complete works, he has received more recognition, notably by C. S. Lewis (1936), Wickert (1953), Fisher (1964), Yeager (1990) and Peck (2006). However, he has not obtained the same following or critical acceptance as Geoffrey Chaucer.

<text>Gray goo (also spelled as grey goo) is a hypothetical global catastrophic scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating machines consume all biomass (and perhaps also everything else) on Earth while building many more of themselves, a scenario that has been called &quot;ecophagy&quot; . The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.

Self-replicating machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician John von Neumann, and are sometimes referred to as von Neumann machines or clanking replicators.
The term &quot;gray goo&quot; was coined by nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;. In 2004, he stated &quot;I wish I had never used the term &#x27;gray goo&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; mentions &quot;gray goo&quot; as a thought experiment in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, &quot;Omni&quot;, in November 1986.

==Definition==
The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer K. Eric Drexler in &quot;Engines of Creation&quot; (1986). In Chapter 4, &quot;Engines Of Abundance&quot;, Drexler illustrates both exponential growth and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing &quot;dry&quot; nanomachines that can function only if given special raw materials:
According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine &quot;Omni&quot;, which also popularized the term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; in the same issue. Drexler says arms control is a far greater issue than gray goo &quot;nanobugs&quot;.

Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;:
Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials. Drexler used the term &quot;gray goo&quot; not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between &quot;superiority&quot; in terms of human values and &quot;superiority&quot; in terms of competitive success:

Bill Joy, one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, titled &quot;Why The Future Doesn&#x27;t Need Us&quot;. In direct response to Joy&#x27;s concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the ecophagy scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer Robert Freitas.

==Risks and precautions==
Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal &quot;Nanotechnology&quot;, he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies &quot;Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation&quot; describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized gray goo, were such a thing possible.

King Charles III (then Prince of Wales) called upon the British Royal Society to investigate the &quot;enormous environmental and social risks&quot; of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on gray goo. The Royal Society&#x27;s report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators.

More recent analysis in the paper titled &quot;Safe Exponential Manufacturing&quot; from the Institute of Physics (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of gray goo is far less likely than originally thought. However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified. Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his gray goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses.

In &quot;Safe Exponential Manufacturing&quot;, which was published in a 2004 issue of &quot;Nanotechnology&quot;, it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed. The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the gray goo scenario.

==Ethics and chaos==

Gray goo is a useful construct for considering low-probability, high-impact outcomes from emerging technologies. Thus, it is a useful tool in the ethics of technology. Daniel A. Vallero applied it as a worst-case scenario thought experiment for technologists contemplating possible risks from advancing a technology. This requires that a decision tree or event tree include even extremely low probability events if such events may have an extremely negative and irreversible consequence, i.e. application of the precautionary principle. Dianne Irving admonishes that &quot;any error in science will have a rippling effect&quot;. Vallero adapted this reference to chaos theory to emerging technologies, wherein slight permutations of initial conditions can lead to unforeseen and profoundly negative downstream effects, for which the technologist and the new technology&#x27;s proponents must be held accountable.

== In popular culture ==

* Grey goo is the basis for &quot;Benderama&quot;, an episode of the animated science fiction sitcom &quot;Futurama&quot;. In this episode, Bender creates smaller copies of himself to accomplish mundane tasks, which quickly spirals out of control as those copies begin replicating themselves, eventually reaching a stage where the copies are small enough to manipulate matter at the subatomic level. 
* The Horizon videogame series is set in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of a Gray goo scenario, where a self-replicating swarm of &#x27;insectoid robots&#x27; end up devouring the Earth&#x27;s biosphere rendering all life on the planet extinct. Humanity is reduced to living in scattered, primitive tribes after the species was revived via an automated terraforming system over the course of centuries.
* The plot of the novel Prey, by Michael Crichton, centers around the concept of nanobots. The protagonist attempts to stop them from evolving as they self-replicate and infect others.
* The video game series Tasty Planet revolves around a bathroom cleaner nanotechnology beginning to self replicate and consume the planet.
* The 1985 science fiction novel, Blood Music, features biological computers created from lymphocyte cells. Smuggled out of a lab, the cells multiply and evolve rapidly eventually aggregating most of the biosphere of North America.

<text>Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar (1465 – c. June 12, 1524) was a Spanish conquistador and the first governor of Cuba. In 1511 he led the successful conquest and colonization of Cuba. As the first governor of the island, he established several municipalities that remain important to this day and positioned Cuba as a center of trade and a staging point for expeditions of conquest elsewhere. From Cuba, he chartered important expeditions that led to the Spanish discovery and conquest of the Aztec Empire.

==Early life==

Little is known about the early life of Velázquez. He was born in Cuéllar around 1465, in the Segovia region of Spain. For a time he was a member of the Spanish military and served in Naples. Afterward, he returned to Spain and lived in Seville. In September 1493, Velázquez was one of 1,500 men who sailed with Columbus on his second voyage to the New World. Velázquez never returned to Spain.

Velázquez settled on the island of Hispaniola and survived the early hardships which killed many colonists or drove them back home. In time he demonstrated an aptitude for dealing with the political factions on the island. He was well regarded by Bartholomew Columbus, the younger brother of Christopher and the administrator of the island from 1493 to 1500. When Bartholomew left the island for any length of time, he would make Velázquez acting governor of Hispaniola.

There is no record of Velázquez during Francisco de Bobadilla&#x27;s brief tenure as governor of the island but when Nicolás de Ovando was appointed to the post in 1501, Velázquez quickly became one of the governor&#x27;s trusted lieutenants. In 1503, when a Taíno revolt broke out in the western provinces of the island, Velázquez was ordered to Jaragua where he quashed the rebellion.

After the revolt, Ovando determined that five new towns should be built in the rebellious territory. Velázquez was sent to the western end of the island to establish Salvatierra de la Zabana and perhaps other towns. Velázquez resided in Salvatierra de la Zabana and all five of the new settlements were placed under his administration. By 1511, Velázquez was one of the wealthiest men on Hispaniola. He held encomiendas at Verapaz, Salvatierra de la Zabana, and Santiago de Caballeros, where he was a partner with an unidentified encomendero in mining enterprises.

==Conquest of Cuba==
When Diego Columbus became governor in 1509, he was instructed by King Ferdinand to explore, conquer, and colonize the neighboring island of Cuba in hopes of obtaining new sources of gold and Native labor. Miguel de Pasamonte, the king&#x27;s treasurer in the Caribbean, was influential in seeing that Columbus selected Velázquez to lead the expedition. Velázquez was to finance the project himself and though Columbus assured him that the Crown would reimburse him later, no money was ever forthcoming. He assembled a small fleet of four ships and three hundred men among whom were several relatives, debt-ridden encomenderos, and a few who would later become notable, including Hernán Cortés and Pedro de Alvarado.

Velázquez sailed for Cuba in January 1511 and landed at a small harbor in the native province of Mayci. The Spaniards were opposed by a Taíno force led by Hatuey, formerly a chief from Hispaniola who fled to Cuba and helped the local Natives organize resistance to the incursion. The Taínos were outmatched by the Spanish weaponry and after two months of intermittent fighting, they were defeated. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, who did not arrive on the island until later, Hatuey was captured and burned alive at the stake.

The first Spanish settlement, Baracoa, was established on the northeast corner of the island by August 1511. It consisted of a fort surrounded by thatched huts and served as the initial base of operations for the Spanish occupation of Cuba. Later that year, Velázquez was joined by Pánfilo de Narváez who brought thirty Spanish archers and Native auxiliaries from Jamaica. Velázquez was glad for the reinforcements and made Narvaez second in command. More than a year was spent consolidating control of the present-day Oriente province.

In early 1513 Velázquez married Maria de Cuéllar in the new town of Baracoa. She was the daughter of the royal treasurer, Cristóbal de Cuéllar, and a former lady-in-waiting for Maria de Toledo, the wife of Diego Columbus. Maria died less than a week after their wedding.

After a slow start, the conquest of Cuba accelerated dramatically in 1513 when Velázquez organized three expeditions to proceed west, explore the island, and establish a Spanish presence. Narvaez led a force through the interior of the country while Velázquez and a lieutenant proceeded along the south and north coasts respectively. Near the south coast, Narvaez soon met with a force of 2,500 Taínos led by their chief, Caguax. The Spanish struck first before they could be attacked by the Natives defending their land, defeating Caguex, and killing some one hundred Taínos. This was the last significant resistance faced by the Spanish and after that, they proceeded relatively unchallenged in their colonization and search for gold.

In October 1513, Velázquez received letters from the king that expanded his powers in Cuba. Velázquez was authorized to assign Indians to encomiendas and establish additional towns as warranted by his discoveries. In particular, he was encouraged to create settlements on the southern coast that would support trade with the growing Spanish presence in Panama. By 1514, the island was largely pacified and significant gold deposits were discovered at several sites on the island, setting off a brief gold rush that lasted until about 1520. At its peak, officials complained that the search for Cuban gold was depleting manpower in Hispaniola.

In addition to Baracoa, Velázquez used his authority to establish six more Cuban towns by 1515. Most of the new settlements were sited on the coast near gold deposits and significant populations of Indian laborers. Bayamo was founded in 1513, followed in 1514 by Trinidad, Sancti Spiritus, and Havana. Havana, destined to become the premier city of Cuba, was originally founded on the south coast. Camagüey was established in 1515. Velázquez added Santiago de Cuba in July 1515 and made it his residence and the new capital of the island.

Velázquez used the assignment of encomiendas to reward relatives and associates and thus ensure an island aristocracy that was loyal to him. By 1522 significant encomiendas were held by his relatives Juan de Grijalva and Manuel de Rojas; his close associates Panfilo de Narvaez, Bachiller de Alonso Parada, and Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa; and fourteen others. In total, these encomenderos controlled almost 3,000 Indian laborers.

The new colonizers did not wish to be under the personal authority of Diego Columbus, so Velázquez convoked a general &quot;cabildo&quot; (a local government council) which was duly authorized to deal directly with Spain, and therefore removed Velázquez and the colonizers from under the authority of Columbus, their nominal superior. It was a precedent that would come back to haunt him with the Mexican adventures.

==Conquest of Mexico==
In 1514, Velázquez wrote to the king concerning rumors of unknown lands to the north and west of Cuba. Initially, these rumors were merely the subject of idle speculation and the king instructed Velázquez to remain focused on the governance of Cuba and especially the production of gold. However, as the demand for labor grew, slaving expeditions explored the region in search of natives to work the Cuban ranches and gold mines. Interest in exploration and conquest intensified in 1516 when a slave ship returned carrying 20,000 pesos of gold seized from the natives living on the Guanajes, a series of small islands off the coast of Central America. 

Velázquez quickly commissioned Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to lead an expedition which sailed in February 1517, with instructions to explore certain neighboring islands. They soon came upon the shore of what they initially believed to be a large island, thus marking the Spanish discovery of the Yucatán Peninsula. Initial encounters with the Mayans living along the coast turned into armed conflict; 25 Spaniards were killed and many more wounded, including Córdoba himself. On his return to Cuba, Córdoba reported to Velázquez that the Mayans exhibited a sophistication not seen before in the region, including buildings of stone and mortar, clothing of woven cloth, and ornamentation of gold and silver.

Velázquez organized another expedition, hoping to trade with the Mayans for their gold, &quot;for there must have been much there.&quot; He put his nephew, Juan de Grijalva, in command of four ships that departed Cuba in January 1518. Grijalva sailed along the Yucatan and then headed northwards following the Mexican coastline, exploring and trading with the natives as the opportunity arose. When Grijalva returned in October he brought back a profit of 20,000 crowns, but Velázquez was angry with his nephew and felt the returns did not justify the time and effort.

Even before Grijalva returned, Velázquez was preparing for another, larger expedition to the Yucatan. He sent a representative to Spain requesting authority to trade with or conquer the new lands and was granted the title of &quot;adelantado&quot; of the Yucatan and any other lands he might discover. Velázquez was unsure of who should lead this latest effort and after some hesitancy selected Hernán Cortés. Relations between them had been turbulent. Cortés served as the governor&#x27;s private secretary during the initial conquest but was later involved in a plot to overthrow him. The attempted coup nearly cost Cortés his life but Velázquez pardoned him and awarded Cortés with one of the first encomiendas in Cuba.

Cortés readily accepted the commission and quickly began to organize a fleet and recruit volunteers. The governor soon regretted his choice when friends and allies warned him that his former secretary could not be trusted to remain loyal. In response, Velázquez named Vasco Porcallo to replace Cortés but when messages were sent ordering him to relinquish command, Cortés refused and even managed to recruit one of the messengers to his cause. Despite further requests and demands, Cortés refused to turn over his command. In February 1519, he left Havana for Mexico with ten ships and about 500 fighting men, effectively declaring himself free of Velázquez&#x27;s authority.

In August 1519, Velázquez received word that Cortés had sent a ship to Spain carrying Aztec treasure and a request to be recognized as the rightful leader of the new territory. Velázquez hurriedly sent an emissary to Spain, contesting Cortés and reasserting his authority. The Crown agreed to hear the dispute but postponed a decision for two years, perhaps waiting to see how the struggle was resolved in the field.

Velázquez was determined to remove Cortés by force if necessary. In early 1520, he organized an armada of about 1,000 fighting men and 18 ships equipped with both light and heavy artillery. Pánfilo de Narváez was selected to lead the force with instructions to arrest Cortés and assume the government of the new territory on behalf of Velázquez. Instead, Narváez was easily defeated and Cortés persuaded most of the force to switch sides and join his invasion of the Aztec empire. The failed adventure was a disaster for Velázquez; he lost a substantial fortune invested in the fleet and left Cuba seriously depopulated and vulnerable to a Native uprising.

==Later life==
Velázquez spent the remaining few years of his life defending his governorship in Cuba and continuing his dispute with Cortes. Diego Colón perhaps sensed that Velázquez was politically vulnerable; he sent Alonso Zuazo to Cuba in January 1521, to replace the governor and conduct his &quot;residencia&quot;. However, Colon himself was in political difficulties and under investigation by the Crown. Finally, by July 1523, Colon was recalled to Spain and Velázquez was fully restored to office.

In 1522, Carlos I formally recognized Cortes as governor of New Spain, thus ending Velázquez&#x27;s claims to the newly conquered territory. In 1523, Cortés made Cristóbal de Olid the leader of an expedition to conquer Honduras. While resupplying in Havana, Olid conspired with Velázquez and they agreed that Olid would renounce Cortes and capture Honduras on behalf of Velázquez. When Cortes heard of this plot, he wrote a letter of protest to the king and then dispatched his agents to Honduras where they eventually killed Olid.

Velázquez&#x27;s health began to fail in the summer of 1523; a year later, he died on June 11 or 12, 1524. At his request, he was buried under the altar steps of the new cathedral in Santiago. His close associate, Gonzalo de Guzman, was the principal heir of his estate and would later serve two terms as governor. Even before he died, plans were underway to replace Velázquez. In May 1524, Carlos II named Juan Altamirano to conduct a &quot;residencia&quot; and become the new governor of Cuba.

At the time of his death at the age of 59, Velázquez was &quot;the richest Spaniard in the Americas,&quot; despite financial losses on the expedition of Francisco Hernández de Córdoba and of Hernán Cortés. He completed the successful conquest and colonization of Cuba, founded towns that remain important today, made Cuba economically prosperous, and positioned it as a center of trade and a staging point for expeditions of conquest elsewhere.

<text>Charles Braun Ludlam (April 12, 1943 – May 28, 1987) was an American actor, director, and playwright.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Ludlam was born in Floral Park, New York, the son of Marjorie (née Braun) and Joseph William Ludlam. He was raised in Greenlawn, New York, and attended Harborfields High School. He was openly gay, and performed in plays with the Township Theater Group, a community theatre in Huntington, and worked backstage at the Red Barn Theater, a summer stock theatre in Northport. During his senior year of high school, Ludlam directed, produced, and performed plays with a group of friends, students from Huntington, Northport, Greenlawn, and Centerport. Their &quot;Students Repertory Theatre&quot;, housed in the loft studio beneath the Posey School of Dance on Main Street in Northport, seated an audience of 25, and was sold out for every performance. Their repertoire included Kan Kikuchi&#x27;s &quot;Madman on the Roof&quot;; &quot;&quot;; a readers&#x27; theatre adaptation of Edgar Lee Masters&#x27; &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;; and plays by August Strindberg and Eugene O&#x27;Neill.

He received a degree in dramatic literature from Hofstra University in 1964. At Hofstra, Ludlam met Black-Eyed Susan, whom he cast in one of his college productions. The two became close friends, and Black-Eyed Susan performed in more of Ludlam&#x27;s plays over the following decades than any other actor, except Ludlam himself.

=== Career ===
Ludlam joined John Vaccaro&#x27;s Play-House of the Ridiculous, and after a falling out, founded his own Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1967. His first plays were rudimentary exercises; starting with &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, he began writing more structured plays, which were often pastiches of gothic novels; works by Federico Garcia Lorca, Shakespeare, and Richard Wagner; and popular culture and old movies. These works were humorous but had serious undertones. After seeing one of Ludlam&#x27;s plays, theater critic Brendan Gill famously remarked, &quot;This isn&#x27;t farce. This isn&#x27;t absurd. This is absolutely ridiculous!&quot;. Ludlam commented on his own work: I would say that my work falls into the classical tradition of comedy. Over the years there have been certain traditional approaches to comedy. As a modern artist you have to advance the tradition. I want to work within the tradition so that I don&#x27;t waste my time trying to establish new conventions. You can be very original within the established conventions.

Ludlam&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&quot; was produced at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, where Vaccaro&#x27;s company was in residence, in March 1970. Ludlam performed in this production as Khanazar von Bluebeard. Black-Eyed-Susan, Lola Pashalinski, and Mario Montez also performed in this production. In 1976 he appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s New York film &quot;Underground and Emigrants&quot;.

He taught and/or staged productions at New York University, Connecticut College, Yale University, and Carnegie Mellon University. He won fellowships from the Guggenheim, Rockefeller, and Ford Foundations, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. He won six Obie Awards over the course of his career, including a Sustained Excellence Obie Award two weeks before his death in 1987, and won the Rosamund Gilder Award for distinguished achievement in the theater in 1986.

Ludlam often appeared in his plays, and was particularly noted for his female roles. He wrote one of the first plays to address, though indirectly, the AIDS epidemic. His most well-known play is &quot;The Mystery of Irma Vep&quot;, in which two actors play seven roles in a pastiche of gothic horror novels. The original production featured Ludlam and his partner Everett Quinton. Rights to perform the play include a stipulation that the actors must be of the same sex, in order to ensure cross-dressing in the production. In 1991, &quot;Irma Vep&quot; was the most produced play in the United States; and in 2003, it became the longest-running production ever staged in Brazil.

=== Death and legacy ===
Ludlam was diagnosed with AIDS in March 1987. He attempted to fight the disease with his lifelong interest in healthy eating and a macrobiotic diet, but died a month after his AIDS diagnosis, of PCP pneumonia, at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital. His front page obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; was the newspaper&#x27;s first page 1 obituary to specifically name AIDS as a cause of death (with Ludlam&#x27;s parents&#x27; consent), instead of the AIDS-related illnesses such as pneumonia commonly cited at the time.

The block in front of his Sheridan Square theater was renamed &quot;Charles Ludlam Lane&quot; in his honor.

In 2009, Ludlam was inducted posthumously into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

After his death, Walter Ego, the dummy from Ludlam&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;The Ventriloquist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (designed and built by actor and puppet-maker Alan Semok), was donated to the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, where it remains on exhibit.

In his 1987 obituary of Ludlam in &quot;Christopher Street&quot;, Andrew Holleran wrote, It would be pointless to subject Ludlam to a dissertation—he was too funny—and yet no one was more grounded in theater&#x27;s ancient roots than he; like a child running through the contents of his bedroom closet, putting on fake noses, mustaches, pulling out toy airplanes, little plastic gladiators, goldfish bowls, Cleopatra wigs, he always gave the impression of having assembled the particular play from a magic storeroom in which he kept, like some obsessed bag lady, every prop and character that two thousand years of Western History had washed up on the shores of a childhood on Long Island.…Drag is a profound joke—the fundamental homosexual joke, no doubt: the Woman at Bay, Wounded but Triumphant, lascivious or frigid, repressed or mad, rings all the notes, high and low.…Charles Ludlam
was the greatest drag I&#x27;ve ever seen. It ceased to be drag, in fact, or acting: it was art.

<text>The Nine Network (stylised 9Network, commonly known as Channel Nine or simply Nine) is an Australian commercial free-to-air television network. It is owned by parent company Nine Entertainment and is one of five main free-to-air television networks in Australia.

From 2017 to 2021, the network&#x27;s slogan was &quot;We Are the One&quot;. Since 2021, the network has changed its slogan back to the iconic Golden Era slogan &quot;Still the One&quot;.

As of 2024, the Nine Network is the second-rated television network in Australia, behind the Seven Network, and ahead of the ABC TV, Network 10 and SBS.

==History==
===Origins===
The Nine Network&#x27;s first broadcasting station was launched in Sydney, New South Wales, as TCN-9 on 16 September 1956 by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; owner Frank Packer.

John Godson introduced the station and former advertising executive Bruce Gyngell presented the first programme, &quot;This Is Television&quot; (so becoming the first person to appear on Australian television). Later that year, GTV-9 in Melbourne commenced transmissions to broadcast the 1956 Summer Olympics, later forming the National Television Network alongside QTQ-9 in Brisbane in 1959 and NWS-9 in Adelaide, the basis of the current Nine Network, in 1959. Before its formation, TCN-9 was then affiliated with HSV-7 (because alongside the Seven Network, they were both Australia&#x27;s first television stations, having opened in 1956), and GTV-9&#x27;s sister affiliate was ATN-7.

The network, by 1967, had begun calling itself the National Nine Network, and became simply the Nine Network Australia in 1987. Kerry Packer inherited the company after his father&#x27;s death in 1974. Before the official conversion to colour on 1 March 1975, it was the first Australian television station to regularly screen programmes in colour with the first program to use it premiering in 1971, the very year NTD-8 in Darwin commenced.

The New South Wales Rugby Football League grand final of 1967 became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live nationally. The Nine Network paid $5,000 () to attain the broadcasting rights.

Nine Network station STW-9 Perth, which opened in 1965, became owned-and-operated station when Alan Bond purchased the network for one billion dollars in 1987, a deal that became effective after government approvals in 1988. However, in 1989, Bond Media sold the station to Sunraysia Television for A$95 million, due to the federal cross-media ownership laws which restricted the level of national reach for media owners. Nine, which then also included Channel 9 in Brisbane, fell back into the hands of Kerry Packer after Alan Bond&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1992.

In 2011, GTV 9 Melbourne moved from 22 Bendigo Street, Richmond, to 717 Bourke Street, Docklands. 22 Bendigo Street started out as the Wertheim Piano Factory, then became the Heinz Soup Factory, then GTV9. The building in Bendigo Street still stands, now as luxury apartments.

=== The &quot;Golden Era&quot; (1977–2006) ===
Nine began using the slogan &quot;Let Us Be The One&quot; (based on The Carpenters&#x27; song &quot;Let Me Be the One&quot; and modelled on the ABC campaign used at the time in the United States) in 1977 and became the number-one free-to-air network in Australia; its &quot;National Nine News&quot; became the most-watched news service. In 1978, Nine switched its slogan to &quot;Still the One&quot; (modelled on the campaign used by ABC in the United States and using the Orleans song &quot;Still the One&quot;), which lasted until a decline in ratings in January 2006. During the 1980s, Nine&#x27;s ratings peaked. From 1999 to 2001, the network began losing ground to the Seven network in news and entertainment, but received a boost after the coverage of the 11 September attacks in 2001. By 1991, the network was re-branded to its current branding. The death of CEO Kerry Packer in 2005 triggered more problems for the network. Digital terrestrial television was introduced on 1 January 2001.

=== Nine loses to Seven (2006–2008) ===
Nine stayed strong throughout 2003–04, winning 77 out of 80 ratings weeks across those two years (with Network Ten claiming the other three weeks), but was hit hard when Seven introduced a new line-up in 2005, though Nine finished ahead of Seven that year. Meanwhile, &quot;National Nine News&quot; was overtaken by &quot;Seven News&quot; for the first time ever, while &quot;Today&quot; was beaten by Seven&#x27;s fledgling &quot;Sunrise&quot; program. In 2006, Nine continued on its downward trend, losing most news weeks to &quot;Seven News&quot; and just winning the year thanks to its coverage of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. To try to revitalise the network in its 50th anniversary, Nine adopted a new, but critically received, logo that removed the nine dots, which had been part of the network&#x27;s identity since 1969. In May 2007, Nine partially re-introduced the Nine dots, which resulted in the square logo changing into a three-dimensional (3-D) cube that rotates, with the dots visible on every second side of the cube.

After a period of declining ratings, David Gyngell returned to the job of chief executive officer in October 2007, succeeding Eddie McGuire.

In 2007, despite several hits, Seven won the whole year by a significant margin. The Seven Network had won 38 weeks, whereas the Nine Network only won two.

The Network expanded into Northern NSW with the acquisition of NBN Television in May 2007. However, NBN was retained as an independent Nine affiliate following the acquisition. Deborah Wright, who had been working in various roles for the station, was promoted to CEO.

===Expanding digital services (2008–2014)===
In 2008, as part of a major relaunch, the network dropped the blue box, and reinstated its nine dots in its logo, with a CGI look. After losing viewers to &quot;Seven News&quot;, Nine relaunched its news service as &quot;Nine News&quot;, which managed to win more weeks over Seven in the first half of 2008. Nine also launched a break-out hit, &quot;Underbelly&quot;, which attracted over 2.5 million viewers in its first season. Nine tried to attract younger demographics, so while Seven went on to win the ratings year in total people, Nine was rated the number one network in the key 18–49 and 25–54 demographics.

In March 2008, the Nine Network launched and debuted a high-definition channel called Nine HD on channel 90 until 2010.

In 2009, Nine started relatively strongly due to the top-rating Australian drama &quot;&quot; and the Twenty20 Cricket series until Nine lost the rights in 2018 but could not hold its audience after Network Ten&#x27;s &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot; became a hit. Nine became inconsistent with scheduling and removal of programmes. Nine also launched a number of reality shows, including &quot;Ladette to Lady&quot;, &quot;Wipeout Australia&quot;, &quot;HomeMADE&quot;, &quot;Australia&#x27;s Perfect Couple&quot;, and &quot;The Apprentice Australia&quot;, in the hope of achieving the same success other networks had with the genre. All the new formats underperformed in the ratings and did not help the network establish any stable local content. Nine also expanded its news strand with the reintroduction of a late-night bulletin (for its owned-and-operated stations), an extended morning bulletin and weekend editions of &quot;Today&quot;. The flagship 6:00 pm state bulletins continued to fall in the ratings, though its Melbourne bulletin remained competitive, being the only market to win any weeks against &quot;Seven News&quot;.

In August 2009, Nine launched and debuted its own digital multi-channel called GO! on Channel 99, primarily aimed at a younger demographic. The shares from GO! contributed to Nine&#x27;s weekly shares and allowed it to enjoy several weeks of weekly ratings wins. In September, the network took on a new slogan, &quot;Welcome Home&quot;, and revamped its graphic package. With the resurgence of &quot;Nine News&quot;, growth of &quot;Today&quot;, stabilisation of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and a new programme line-up consisting of &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, &quot;Underbelly&quot; and &quot;Sea Patrol&quot;, Nine enjoyed more ratings success.

In 2010, Nine obtained the rights to exclusive coverage of the Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks. GO! won the year in digital shares only. On 26 September 2010, Nine launched and debuted their third digital channel GEM (an acronym of General Entertainment and Movies) on Channel 90. In 2011, the Nine Network announced a new &quot;Home of Comedy&quot; line-up with comedy shows such as &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and other American sitcoms, along with the launch of a live comedy show &quot;Ben Elton Live From Planet Earth&quot;, which was cancelled after only three episodes due to low ratings. Nine also brought back &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; with Eddie McGuire as host, although the series was cancelled after airing four episodes. The Nine Network had success in the ratings in the second half of 2011 with &quot;The Block&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot;. The highly anticipated return of a revamped ninth season of &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; proved a huge success for the network, generating 2.3 million viewers and dominating the week as top program. The return of new episodes of the popular sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; was also a huge success for the network, scoring high figures consistently week after week and dominating the evening as top program. Despite this, the Nine Network finished in second place in the ratings again in 2011 on 19.6%, behind the Seven Network (23.1%) and ahead of the Network Ten (15.9%), ABC TV (12.2%) and SBS (4.6%).

On 24 November 2011, the Nine Network announced the line-up for 2012, with a focus on reality programs, including an Australian version of &quot;The Voice&quot;, the return of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;Excess Baggage&quot;, and &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot;. The Nine Network also aired coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. A new morning show, &quot;Mornings&quot;, replaced the departure of Kerri-Anne Kennerley&#x27;s self-titled show, after nine years on air. The program, now called &quot;Today Extra&quot;, is hosted by Sylvia Jeffreys and David Campbell.

On 26 March 2012, the Nine Network launched and debuted Extra, a new channel aimed at delivering home shopping, brand funded, religious, community, educational and multi-cultural programming content created by advertisers. Its timeshift channel, Extra 2, launched on 28 March 2013 on channel 95 and channel 85 in NBN areas as a five-hour timeshift. As a result, the quality of sister channel 9Gem was cut.

On 15 April 2012, the Nine Network new rebrand visual identity for Channel Nine logo with the enhanced colour palette, which uses lighter shades of blue and more white gradients, including color from the brand identity, this was part identity since 2003 Nine Network logo.

It was reported on 31 May 2012 that the Australian telecommunications company Telstra and WIN Television Network CEO, Bruce Gordon, are considering making a takeover bid for Nine Entertainment. The network currently is trying to fight off administration as it deals with a debt exceeding A$3.3 billion.

It was reported on 3 June 2013 that the Nine Network would immediately purchase Adelaide affiliate NWS-9 from the WIN Corporation as part of a deal to secure international cricket television rights. On 3 July 2013, it was reported that Nine would exercise an option to also buy STW-9 from WIN Corporation. Both purchases have resulted in these stations being, once again, O&amp;O stations of the network for the first time since the 1980s.

On 8 November 2013, FIXPlay was merged into Jump-in, later renamed to 9Jumpin in May 2014, integrating catch-up TV with interactive social media.

As of 10 December 2013, Nine no longer broadcasts on analogue TV and is now only available through digital TV or digital set-top box.

On 27 January 2014, the Nine Network have stopped using the Supertext logo and have switched to their own Closed Captioning logo.
=== A new era in television (2014–2019) ===
Nine relaunched 9HD, in November 2015, an HD simulcast of their primary channel, on channel 90 and launched new lifestyle channel 9Life on channel 94. In addition to the relaunch of 9HD, GEM (renamed 9Gem) was reduced to standard definition and moved to channel 92 and GO! (renamed 9Go!) was moved to channel 93. On 16 December 2015, Nine also changed its on-air theme for a continuous design across all of its channels with the Nine News/9news.com.au branding to remain unchanged. This included a new look for program listings, program advertisements and promos. Additionally in November 2015, Hugh Marks replaced David Gyngell as CEO.

On 27 January 2016, Nine&#x27;s online catch-up video on-demand service 9Jumpin was retired and replaced by 9Now. 9Now offers a range of content larger than 9Jumpin and also offers a live streaming service for Nine&#x27;s multicast channels. Live streaming for Nine was launched on the same day, with streaming for 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life launched on 19 May 2016. Following the launch of 9Now, the WIN Corporation, owner of Nine affiliate WIN Television, filed a lawsuit against Nine Entertainment Co., claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement. The case was later dismissed on 28 April 2016 with Justice Hammerschlag of the NSW Supreme Court stating that, &quot;I have concluded that live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the PSA (program supply agreement), and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it.&quot;

Following their victory in the 9Now court case, Nine Entertainment Co. announced on 29 April 2016 that it had signed a $500 million five year affiliation deal with Southern Cross Austereo, the then-primary regional affiliate of Network 10. On 1 July 2016, WIN Television lost its Nine affiliate status to Southern Cross, which had Nine&#x27;s metropolitan branding introduced across its now Nine-branded television assets. Nine later secured an affiliate deal with Mildura Digital Television, a joint venture between WIN and Prime Media Group, on 28 June 2016 to supply Nine content to the Mildura and Sunraysia area due to WIN switching affiliation to Network Ten. Nine finalised supply deals with WIN for South Australia and Griffith on 29 June 2016 after long negotiations, with a deal for Tasmanian joint venture TDT secured the following day after long negotiations. A supply deal for Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television was not secured before the 1 July 2016 deadline, but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016 with programming resuming that night. Also after 10 years as an independent affiliate, NBN was finally folded in to the Nine Network with the NBN logo being retired on air after 54 years. However, despite being a Nine O&amp;O, NBN News remains as an independent news bulletin, despite adopting the full Nine News on air look.

In June 2018, it was announced that Nine would enter into a joint venture with Australian News Channel (ANC) to create &quot;Your Money&quot;, a business news channel that replaced the Sky News Business Channel on Foxtel channel 601 and also available free-to-air through Nine on channel 95, replacing Extra. However, it closed on 17 May 2019 due to lack of advertising and poor ratings.

===Return to the top (2019–)===
After 12 years, the Nine Network won the 2019 ratings year for the first time since 2006. The Seven Network had won every ratings year between 2007 and 2018 inclusive, however, due to lower than expected ratings, and a launch of new programs not performing as hoped, this allowed Nine to regain lost ground during the most competitive times of the ratings period (most notably, Nine&#x27;s &quot;Married At First Sight&quot; performed above expectations, and consistently beat &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot; which saw its lowest figures on record) which resulted in Nine&#x27;s first win in the first quarter since 2009.

Nine&#x27;s yearly share for 2019 concluded at 29.4%, a 2.1% increase from 2018 (27.3%) compared to Seven&#x27;s 29.0%, a 1.7% decline from 2018 (30.7%)

In 2020, despite drastic and last minute changes to most network&#x27;s programming schedules in light of the COVID-19 pandemic the Nine Network has managed to retain the number one lead by a considerable margin.

On 5 April 2020, Nine launched 9Rush as a joint venture with Discovery Inc., which features action and adventure-themed reality series targeting a young adult male audience.
On 1 October 2020, the Nine Network re-launched Extra, after 2 years being discontinued, thanks to &quot;Your Money&quot;.
On 21 November 2020, Nine moved their Sydney studios from Willoughby to North Sydney. This comes after real estate developer Mirvac bought the Willoughby studios in February 2020, and plans to transform the studios into 460 new homes.

In March 2021, it was reported that the network had suffered a suspected ransomware attack using MedusaLocker during live broadcast. The hack disrupted its programming in Sydney and Darwin. Australia&#x27;s parliament and Taylors Wines was also subject to a cyberattack around the same time, although it is unclear if the incidents are connected.

On 12 March 2021, Nine announced that it would return to WIN Television as its regional affiliate in most markets beginning on 1 July 2021, in a deal that will last at least seven years. SCA subsequently announced that it would return to Network 10, effectively reversing their 2016 realignment. Under the agreement, WIN will pay half of its regional advertising revenue to Nine Entertainment Co., and provide advertising time for Nine&#x27;s properties on its radio and television outlets. WIN will also provide advertising sales services for Nine&#x27;s O&amp;O stations NBN and NTD (with the former succeeding a similar agreement it had with SCA). Nine CEO Hugh Marks explained that &quot;while our relationship with Southern Cross has been strong over the last five years, the opportunities presented by the WIN Network to both extend the reach of Nine&#x27;s premium content into more regional markets under one agreement, and to work cooperatively with them on a national and local news operation, mean this is the right time for us to return to WIN.&quot;

On 4 September 2024 the 2012 Nine Network 3D logo has been disappeared from the Today Show using original 2008 Nine Network 2D logo.

==Nine Network programming==

===International programs===
Current US programs that air on Nine and its digital multichannels are sourced from Nine&#x27;s deals with Roadshow Entertainment / Warner Bros. International Television Distribution and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc, Sony Pictures Television International / Sony Pictures Animation, NBCUniversal Global Distribution and Illumination Entertainment / DreamWorks and DreamWorks Animation, CBS Studios, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Disney Platform Distribution / Pixar Animation Studios / Lucasfilm / 20th Television and 20th Century Studios / Regency Enterprises, United International Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Television International.

The network&#x27;s flagship overseas program was the popular sitcoms &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; and &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. Other American programs on Nine include medical drama &quot;Chicago Med&quot;, documentary series &quot;The First 48&quot; and crime dramas &quot;Law &amp; Order True Crime&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot;. British programs on Nine include the UK game shows &quot;Pointless&quot; and &quot;Tipping Point. &quot;Sony Pictures daytime soap operas on 9Gem include &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;The Young and The Restless&quot;. &quot;Extra&quot; aired on Nine up until its 26th season; it also aired the television adaptation of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; for much of its run. From 2008 until 2021 and 2013 respectively, Nine also broadcast the American daytime talk shows &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;.

In 2015, the network cut ties with Warner Bros. Television, which caused the local broadcast TV rights to such series as &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Gotham&quot;, &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot; to be shopped around to other networks.

On 11 March 2015, Nine created a new acquired programming deal with Nickelodeon, granting the network programming rights until 2023.

On 2 April 2017, Nine created a new acquired programming deal with NBCUniversal, granting the network programming rights.

On 22 February 2020, DreamWorks Animation films became exclusive to the Nine Network after 8 years in which Network 10 and Seven Network owned the telecast rights to them. This was owed to NBCUniversal having recently reunited with DreamWorks after a separation of 15 years and because of Network 10 having recently become a subsidiary of Paramount Australia &amp; New Zealand and therefore having access to programming from Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.

==News and popular affairs==
=== History ===

The Nine Network&#x27;s news service is &quot;Nine News&quot; (previously &quot;National Nine News&quot;). For many decades, it was the top-rating news service nationally, but was over taken in the mid-2000s by rival network Seven. Nine regained its news dominance (nationally) at the conclusion of the 2013 ratings year.

Nine produces several news bulletins and programmes, including &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Today Extra&quot;, &quot;Weekend Today&quot;, &quot;Nine News: Early Edition&quot;, &quot;Nine Morning News&quot;, &quot;Nine Afternoon News&quot;, &quot;Nine News: First at Five&quot;, local nightly editions of &quot;Nine News&quot; as well as regional news bulletins for Northern New South Wales and the Gold Coast under the name &quot;NBN News&quot; and since March 2020, national late night bulletins titled &quot;Nine News Late&quot;

The news service also produces &quot;A Current Affair&quot; which programs every weekday and Saturday, &quot;Under Investigation&quot;, an investigative current affairs show which programs every Monday, and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which programs every Sunday night. Until mid-2018 during weekday overnights and Sunday mornings, Nine rebroadcast American television network ABC&#x27;s news and current affairs programme &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.
From 2008, major expansion saw &quot;Today&quot; broadcast on Saturday and Sunday, the weekday version running from 05:30 until 09:00 weekdays, the launch of the &quot;Nine Early News&quot;, the axing of the &quot;Sunday&quot; program, &quot;National Nine News&quot; becoming &quot;Nine News&quot; after poor ratings, losing to &quot;Seven News&quot;, &quot;Nine Late News&quot; was launched then renamed as &quot;Nightline&quot; and the 11am bulletin being renamed as &quot;Nine&#x27;s Morning News&quot;, running from 11:00 until 12:00 weekdays (now a half-hour news bulletin from 2015 onwards).

Meanwhile, several additions have been made to &quot;Nine News&quot; teams around the country, as well as the acquisition of more reporters by &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and also state-based &quot;Today&quot; reporters (plus a &quot;Weekend Today&quot; weather presenter).

In 2014, Nine News website moved from its ninemsn website (now known as nine.com.au) to a brand-only website become 9news.com.au, which are still in use to this day.

Nine has posted journalists overseas to cover major European stories following the closure of its European bureau in late 2008, with the last European correspondent, James Talia, being redesignated to his former role as a senior Melbourne &quot;Nine News&quot; journalist. Reporters including Simon Bouda, Allison Langdon, Chloe Bugelly, Eddie Blake, Tim Arvier, and Brett McLeod have all been on projects for &quot;Nine News&quot; bulletins in Greece, the UK, France, South Africa, Thailand, and the Czech Republic.

Starting in the 1980&#x27;s, the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; theme music (adapted from the film &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;) has been the official Nine News theme. First adopted in the Sydney and Melbourne stations and later in Perth and Adelaide, it is now played nationwide in all 7 O&amp;O stations in their respective newscasts. Until 2021, &quot;NBN News&quot; used its own theme music, from 8 November 2021, it started using the Nine News theme music. The theme is also used by Nine&#x27;s radio division Nine Radio.

==Sport==
Channel Nine broadcasts all sporting events under the Wide World of Sports brand. The flagship sports of the brand are cricket until Nine lost the rights in 2018, Australian Open Tennis, National Rugby League (NRL), and formerly Australian Football League (AFL), until Nine lost the rights in 2006, and Super League while it existed. NRL games are broadcast in prime time on Nine in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Queensland on Friday nights; however, prime time NRL is shown at same time on multi-channel 9Gem in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania.

Nine&#x27;s other popular recurring sporting events include the State of Origin series, Gillette Twenty20 until Nine lost the rights in 2018, Gillette Series Cricket until Nine lost the rights in 2018, and Test cricket until Nine lost the rights in 2018, and formerly the Australian Swimming Championships until Nine lost the rights in 2009. As well as this, the Nine Network also had broadcast rights for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, and, in joint partnership with subscription television provider Foxtel, had broadcast rights for the 2010 Winter Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. 

On 26 May 2010, Nine became the first free-to-air television channel in Australia to broadcast in 3D. The broadcast was the 2010 State of Origin series.

In 2017 Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports became the home of netball in Australia. The network broadcasts two live matches every Saturday Night of the new Suncorp Super Netball league. They also televise every Australia national netball team match including Constellation Cup and Netball Quad Series matches. All netball is live on 9Gem.

In 2018, Nine acquired the rights to the Australian Open from 2020 through until 2024. In 2022, Nine extended its rights to the Australian Open until 2029.

In February 2023, Nine regained the rights to the Olympics from the 2024 Summer Olympics through to the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane.

On 20 February 2024, it was announced Nine had obtained the rights to broadcast the Melbourne Cup and Melbourne Cup carnival from 2024 through to 2029.

==Availability==
The Nine Network is simulcast in standard and high-definition digital. Nine&#x27;s core programming is fibre-fed out of GTV Melbourne to its sister stations and affiliates, with TCN Sydney providing national news and current affairs programming. The current affairs programming was originally done at GTV before moving to TCN in 2012. The receiving stations and affiliates then insert their own localised news and advertising which is then broadcast in metropolitan areas and Northern NSW via owned-and-operated stations, including TCN Sydney, GTV Melbourne, QTQ Brisbane, NWS Adelaide, STW Perth, NTD Darwin and NBN Northern New South Wales. Nine Network programming is also carried into the rest of regional Australia by affiliate networks: WIN Television, Southern Cross Television and Imparja Television. Nine is also broadcast via satellite and cable on Foxtel.

In 2013, the Nine Network switched their captioning provider from Red Bee Media to Ai-Media.

==Nine Network affiliates==
===9HD===

The Nine Network originally launched a high-definition simulcast of their main channel on channel 90 on 1 January 2001 alongside the introduction of digital terrestrial television in Australia. The simulcast was relaunched as a breakaway multichannel &quot;9HD&quot; on 17 March 2008 but was reverted to a simulcast on 3 August 2009 and was later replaced by GEM (now 9Gem) on 26 September 2010. 9HD was revived as a 1080i HD simulcast of Nine on 26 November 2015 on channel 90, bumping 9Gem to SD on channel 92.

===9Now===
9Now is a video-on-demand, catch-up TV service run by the Nine Network. The service became available on 27 January 2016, replacing Nine&#x27;s previous service 9Jumpin. 9Now also offers online live streaming for Channel 9, 9Gem, 9Go!, 9Life and 9Rush.

==Logo and corporate identity==
The Nine Network logo, which consists of a numeral &quot;9&quot; beside nine dots arranged in a 3x3 grid, is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia.

In 1997, the dots were changed to spheres. The spheres returned to dots as a new on-air identity package was created by Velvet mediendesign in 2001.

This logo was redesigned by Velvet Mediendesign on 1 January 2001, with the introduction of digital TV in Australia and new graphics.

On 1 September 2002, the dots were changed back to spheres from the 1997 logo as well as the numeral becoming 3D for their &quot;7 colours for 7 days&quot; presentation package.

On 30 January 2006, the network and its affiliates relaunched their logos to coincide with Nine&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

A numeral nine was reworked with a few rounded corners eliminated in process. This logo would use a blue square featuring the numeral altered, which saw the removal of the nine dots again. The graphics package used during that time was designed by Bruce Dunlop Associates.

Later on 15 January 2007, the blue square became solid, and in May they partially relaunched the nine dots, which are visible on every second surface of the box. This logo continued to be used in Perth and Adelaide stations until March 2010, when they reinstated the nine-dots logo.

On 14 January 2008, Nine completely reinstated the nine dots logo, but with a different design. The slogan used with this logo was &quot;we♥TV&quot;, which had also been used in December 2007 with the previous logo. This time, the dots are now a bit bigger, like the 1969 logo and the numeral 9 from the previous 2006 logo would continue.

This logo would first be used in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Darwin markets but the logo would not be used in both Perth and Adelaide markets, until March 2010, due to being owned by WIN Corporation at the same time.

As a part of a major relaunch, the entire logo became 3D on the same day as part of a short-lived rebrand. The nine dots are represented by translucent 3D discs during that year. The music used throughout the network&#x27;s ID&#x27;s and promotions was &quot;Smile&quot;&#x27; by The Supernaturals, released in 1997. This logo would only be used in 4 metropolitan markets.

On 1 February 2009, the dots are once again 2D as part of a short-lived rebrand, which lasted until 26 September.

On 27 September, the dots are changed to spheres from the 1997 logo yet again when the network&#x27;s original slogan &quot;Welcome Home&quot; was launched. It also began to re-use the iconic &quot;Still The One&quot; theme tune from 1992 in one of the ID&#x27;s. The dots is smaller, like the previous 2001 logo and in March 2010, the dots were reinstated in both Perth and Adelaide markets.

On 4 September 2024 the Nine Network 3D logo has been officially removed and changed back to the original 2D 2008 logo during the Today Show Australia.

<doc id="176026" wikidata="Q333145" url="?curid=176026" title="George Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie">
<text>George Kenneth Hotson Younger, 4th Viscount Younger of Leckie, Baron Younger of Prestwick, (22 September 1931 – 26 January 2003), was a British Conservative Party politician and banker. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Ayr from 1964 to 1992. During the premiership of Margaret Thatcher, Younger served as Secretary of State for Scotland from 1979 to 1986, and as Secretary of State for Defence from 1986 to 1989.

==Early life and career==
Younger&#x27;s forebear, George Younger (baptised 1722), was the founder of George Younger and Son of Alloa, the family&#x27;s brewing business (not to be confused with Younger&#x27;s of Edinburgh). Younger&#x27;s great-grandfather, George Younger, was created Viscount Younger of Leckie in 1923. Younger was the eldest of the three sons of Edward Younger, 3rd Viscount Younger of Leckie.

He was born in Stirling in 1931 and educated at Cargilfield Preparatory School, Winchester College, and New College, Oxford, where he obtained a Master&#x27;s degree. Joining the British Army, he served in the Korean War with the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders. On 7 August 1954, he married Diana Tuck, daughter of a Royal Navy captain. They had four children, including James Younger, who succeeded his father to the Viscountcy.

==Political career==
He first stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, in North Lanarkshire in the 1959 general election. Subsequently, he was initially selected to stand for the Kinross and West Perthshire seat in a by-election in late 1963, but agreed to stand aside to allow the new Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home the chance to enter the House of Commons. He was viewed as a one-nation conservative.

Following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather the 1st Viscount, Younger became Member of Parliament for Ayr in 1964 and served as Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Secretary of State for Scotland for seven years. He subsequently succeeded Michael Heseltine as Secretary of State for Defence in 1986 when Heseltine resigned from the cabinet over a dispute about helicopters known as the Westland affair. In the 1987 general election, as part of a considerable swing away from the Conservatives in Scotland, he retained his seat after three recounts, by a majority of just 182 votes (having been almost 8,000 votes in 1983). Incidentally, it was held by his successor Phil Gallie by an even smaller majority of 85 votes in 1992.

==After parliament==
Younger quit the cabinet in 1989, and joined the Royal Bank of Scotland, becoming its chairman in 1992. He was created a life peer as Baron Younger of Prestwick, of Ayr in the District of Kyle and Carrick, on 7 July 1992, five years before succeeding to the viscountcy. As such, he continued to sit in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999 which expelled most of the hereditary peers. In 1995, the Queen appointed him a knight of the Order of the Thistle. Younger became Chancellor of Edinburgh&#x27;s Napier University in 1993, and was Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2001 and 2002.

Younger died from cancer at his home in Gargunnock on 26 January 2003, at the age of 71.

<doc id="176027" wikidata="Q1207038" url="?curid=176027" title="National treatment">
<text>National treatment is a principle in international law. Utilized in many treaty regimes involving trade and intellectual property, it requires equal treatment of foreigners and locals. Under national treatment, a state that grants particular rights, benefits or privileges to its own citizens must also grant those advantages to the citizens of other states while they are in that country. In the context of international agreements, a state must provide equal treatment to citizens of the other states participating in the agreement. Imported and locally produced goods should be treated equally — at least after the foreign goods have entered the market.

While this is generally viewed as a desirable principle, in custom it conversely means that a state can deprive foreigners of anything of which it deprives its own citizens. An opposing principle calls for an international minimum standard of justice (a sort of basic due process) that would provide a base floor for the protection of rights and of access to judicial process. The conflict between national treatment and minimum standards has mainly played out between industrialized and developing nations, in the context of expropriations. Many developing nations, having the power to take control over the property of their own citizens, wished to exercise it over the property of aliens as well.

Though support for national treatment was expressed in several controversial (and legally non-binding) United Nations General Assembly resolutions, the issue of expropriations is almost universally handled through treaties with other states and contracts with private entities, rather than through reliance upon international custom.

National treatment only applies once a product, service or item of intellectual property has entered the market. Therefore, charging customs duty on an import is not a violation of national treatment even if locally-produced products are not charged an equivalent tax.

==GATT/WTO==

National treatment is an integral part of many World Trade Organization agreements. Together with the most favoured nation principle, national treatment is one of the cornerstones of WTO trade law. It is found in all 3 of the main WTO agreements (GATT, GATS and TRIPS).

National treatment is a basic principle of GATT/WTO that prohibits discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods with respect to internal taxation or other government regulation. The principle of national treatment is formulated in Article 3 of the GATT 1947 (and incorporated by reference in GATT 1994); Article 17 of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); and in Article 3 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The aim of this trade rule is to prevent internal taxes or other regulations from being used as a substitute for tariff protection.

A good summary is found in Japan-Alcohol which states; &quot;[a] national treatment obligation is a general prohibition on the use of internal taxes and other internal regulatory measures so as to afford protection to domestic production&quot;.

<doc id="176030" wikidata="Q654216" url="?curid=176030" title="Ayr">
<text>Ayr ( ; ; , meaning &quot;confluence of the River Àir&quot;), is a town situated on the southwest coast of Scotland. A former royal burgh, today it is the administrative centre of South Ayrshire Council, and the historic county town of Ayrshire. With a population of 46,982, Ayr is the 15th largest settlement in Scotland and second largest town in Ayrshire by population. The town is contiguous with the smaller town of Prestwick to the north. Ayr submitted unsuccessful bids for city status in 2000 and 2002, and as part of the wider South Ayrshire area in 2022. 

Ayr was established as a Royal Burgh in 1205 and is the county town of Ayrshire. It served as Ayrshire&#x27;s central marketplace and harbour throughout the medieval period and was a port during the early modern period. On the southern bank of the River Ayr sit the ramparts of a citadel constructed by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s men during the mid-17th century. Towards the south of the town is the birthplace of Scottish poet Robert Burns in the suburb of Alloway. Ayr has been a popular tourist resort since the expansion of the railway in 1840 owing to the town&#x27;s fine beach and its links to golfing and Robert Burns.

Ayr is one of the largest retail centres in the south of Scotland and in 2014 was recognised by the Royal Society for Public Health as the second healthiest town centre in the United Kingdom. Ayr has hosted the Scottish Grand National horseracing steeplechase annually since 1965 and the Scottish International Airshow annually since 2014. The town also accommodates the headquarters of the &quot;Ayr Advertiser&quot; and &quot;Ayrshire Post&quot; newspapers.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Ayr&quot; can be traced back to a pre-Celtic word meaning &quot;watercourse&quot; or &quot;strong river&quot;. This name was used before the establishment of the Julian calendar in reference to the River Ayr. The town was formerly known as &quot;Inverair&quot; or &quot;Inverayr&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the river Ayr&quot;; this was later abbreviated to &quot;Air&quot;, now spelled &quot;Ayr&quot;. The full name remains in the Scottish Gaelic name for Ayr – &quot;Inbhir Àir&quot;.

==History==
===Establishment and early settlement===

The areas surrounding modern day Ayr were known to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers more than 5,000 years ago. There is also a Neolithic standing stone at the end of Stonefield Park in Doonfoot, which is believed to have been upended as a place of sun worship by Stone Age people. In 1197, King William the Lion ordered that a new castle be built between the River Ayr and the River Doon. It is believed that the castle was a wooden structure built around Montgomerie Terrace. Ayr was later established as a royal burgh and market town on 21 May 1205 by King William the Lion. At its establishment, the burgh encompassed a single street (The Sandgate) and the Church of St John. By 1225 the town reached as far as Carrick Street and Mill Street along the south side of the River Ayr. The town grew quickly to become the main seaport, marketplace and administrative centre for Ayrshire.

The King gifted fishing rights to the burgh for the River Ayr and the River Doon in 1236. In the following year, a timber bridge was built across the River Ayr, linking the town to the north side of the River. Since 1261, annual fairs were held in the town. At this time the town had a recorded population of 1,500 and served as a major port on the west coast. The town was unsuccessfully attacked by Norwegian forces in 1263 and invaded and occupied by English forces from 1296 until 1312 as part of the Scottish Wars of Independence. In 1298 the original castle at Ayr was destroyed by Robert The Bruce&#x27;s forces. On 26 April 1315, a Parliament of Scotland was held in Ayr by Robert The Bruce at St. John&#x27;s Tower by the sea. As a Royal Burgh, Ayr was afforded various privileges relating to trade, tolls and fishing rights, which allowed the town to out-compete the neighbouring free burgh of Newton-on-Ayr which was established in the 14th century and situated on the north side of the River Ayr.

===Early modern period===

Ayr was continuously hit by a number of plagues from 1545 to 1647, resulting in the town&#x27;s port being quarantined and plague victims being removed from the town on pain of death. Mary, Queen of Scots visited the town in 1552 and 1563. Ayr remained a significant port throughout the 16th century, exporting goods such as fish, hide and wool and importing salt and wine.

Ayr played a pivotal role in the Plantation of Ulster throughout the 17th century, in which a significant number of British people settled in present-day Northern Ireland. The town provided the largest share of colonists from Great Britain, with many colonists from Ayr joining the Earl of Eglinton, Hugh Montgomery&#x27;s, plant in the Ards Peninsula (particularly around Newtownards), and others going on to settle around Belfast. In 1652, the town was used as a base and fortress for some of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s men. They established a large fortress along the mouth of the River Ayr and erected walls around the area just south of the River&#x27;s mouth – most of these walls remain present to this day. St John&#x27;s Tower, which sat around the centre of the fortress, was originally part of a large church yet this was knocked down during the construction of the fort with the tower being used for military practice; it is now protected by &quot;Friends Of Saint Johns Tower&quot; (FROST) residents in the &quot;Ayr Fort Area&quot; which sits atop the former site of the citadel.

The lands occupied by the fort were granted to the Earl of Eglinton, Alexander Montgomerie, in 1663, who established the separate Burgh of Regality named Montgomerieston around the fort, which was eventually absorbed into the Burgh of Ayr. The separate village of Alloway to the south-east of Ayr was also annexed by the town in 1691, despite numerous petitions against this to Edinburgh from residents of the village. Although the importation of French wine continued to be Ayr&#x27;s most important trade during the 17th century, the port was one of the first in Scotland to establish regular trade links with the English colonies in the Americas. This commenced during the 1640s when the English Civil War disrupted established colonial trading arrangements, and during the Cromwellian occupation there was free trade between Scotland and the English colonies. Following the 1660 Restoration of the monarchy, the Navigation Acts excluded Scottish ships from this trade apart from a few exceptional cases. Several English merchants had settled in Ayr during the Cromwellian occupation, and they collaborated with local merchants in circumventing the Navigation Acts by disguising Ayr ships as English vessels. Tobacco, sugar and indigo were imported, and salted fish, meat, clothing and indentured servants were exported.

Deposits of coal were found and mined in Newton during the 17th century, resulting in the town becoming a base for the industry, with coal being exported abroad from its harbour. At this time, Ayr&#x27;s population is estimated to have been at around 2,000. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, Ayr was widely regarded as a town in decline, with Daniel Defoe remarking in &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot; &quot;The capital of this country is Air, a sea-port, and as they tell us, was formerly a large city, had a good harbour, and a great trade: I must acknowledge to you, that tho&#x27; I believe it never was a city, yet it has certainly been a good town, and much bigger than it is now: At present like an old beauty, it shews the ruins of a good face; but is also apparently not only decay&#x27;d and declin&#x27;d, but decaying and declining every day, and from being the fifth town in Scotland, as the townsmen say, is now like a place so saken; the reason of its decay, is, the decay of its trade, so true is it, that commerce is the life of nations, of cities towns, harbours, and of the whole prosperity of a country: What the reason of the decay of trade here was, or when it first began to decay, is hard to determine; nor are the people free to tell, and, perhaps, do not know themselves. There is a good river here, and a handsome stone bridge of four arches.&quot;

===Treaty of Union===


The formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain through the Acts of Union 1707 was initially harmful to Ayr, due to the importance to its economy of the wine trade with France. The terms of the English Methuen Treaty of 1703, which favoured the importation of Portuguese and Spanish wines and was accompanied by punitive duties on French wines, were extended to Scotland. However, the Union provided Ayr with significant trading opportunities with Britain&#x27;s colonies around the world and resulted in improvements to the town&#x27;s infrastructure, with Ayr&#x27;s textile, wool, linen and shoemaking industries thriving as a result. A small lighthouse was constructed on the River Ayr in 1712, followed by a quay in 1713. Repairs to the town&#x27;s Harbour and High Tolbooth took place between 1724 and 1726, with funding provided by the Convention of Royal Burghs. Street lighting was installed around the town centre in 1747. A sugar refinery at the harbour was in operation during the 1770s.

The grounds of Alloway were sold in 1754 to help pay off Ayr burgh&#x27;s public debts, resulting in the establishment of the Belleisle and Rozelle estates to the south of the town, which are now public parks. Rozelle was acquired by Robert Hamilton, who named his estate after one of his plantations in Jamaica. In 1760, Wallacetown was formed to the east of Newton by the Wallaces of Craigie House. Ayr Racecourse was established in 1777. The &quot;New Brig&quot; of Ayr was constructed in 1785–88 and rebuilt in 1877 after severe flooding. In 1792 and 1817, Parliament passed acts to deepen and maintain Ayr&#x27;s Harbour. During this period Ayr&#x27;s population was estimated to be around 4,000.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Ayr Barracks (later known as Churchill Barracks) on the citadel site in 1795. Ayr Town Hall was designed by Thomas Hamilton and completed in 1832.

===Population growth===

In 1801, the parish of Ayr had a recorded population of just under 5,500, with the adjoining burgh of Newton to the north having a population of just under 1,700 people. By 1826 Ayr&#x27;s streets were lit by gas and by 1842 Ayr had a water supply, with sewers being dug soon after. Ayr was connected to Glasgow, and thus the rest of Great Britain, by rail in 1839, with the first service operating in August 1840 to a terminus on North Harbour Street. This led to a significant expansion in Ayr&#x27;s tourist industry due to its attractive, sandy beach and links to Robert Burns. In 1857 a line was built from Dalmellington to export iron from Waterside and a new station was built to replace the old station called &quot;Ayr Townhead Station&quot;. In 1877 a line was built between Newton and Mauchline for the export of coal. By 1851 Ayr&#x27;s population was 21,000 and by 1855 between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes of coal were being exported to Ireland from Ayr&#x27;s Harbour each year, with imports of hide and tallow coming into the harbour from South America and beef, butter, barley, yarn and linen being imported into the harbour from Ireland. In 1854, 84,330 tonnes of goods were exported from the town and 36,760 tonnes were imported into the town. Other prominent industries in Ayr at this time included fishing, tanning and shoemaking, with several sawmills, woollen mills and carpet weavers located in the town as well. Timber and tobacco were also traded between Ayr&#x27;s Harbour and North America.

The Burgh of Ayr Act 1873 resulted in Newton and Wallacetown being absorbed into the Burgh of Ayr. Newton&#x27;s more industrial character has left the town today divided into two distinct areas, with areas south of the River Ayr incorporating a mixture of affluent Victorian residential suburbs and modern suburban developments, in contrast to more deprived and industrial areas to the north of the river. When elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the burgh of Ayr was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so was excluded from the jurisdiction of Ayrshire County Council, although the county council chose to meet at County Buildings in the town. The Carnegie Library was opened in Ayr on 2 September 1893. By the turn of the century, Ayr&#x27;s population was around 31,000 people. The Burns Statue Square drill hall was completed in 1901 and the Wellington Square drill hall was probably completed shortly after that.

On 26 September 1901, a tram service was opened between Prestwick Cross in Prestwick and St Leonards in Ayr. This was expanded south the following year to Alloway, and east in 1913 to the Racecourse at Whitletts. The tram service was eventually shut due to expensive repair costs, with the last tram running on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1931.

===Modern history===

817 men from Ayr died during the First World War. A memorial was unveiled at Wellington Square in 1924 dedicated to those who died, with other memorials being put up at Alloway Village Hall and Whitletts Cross.

Ayr&#x27;s growing population following the war resulted in significant slum clearance and redevelopment around the town centre, with the development of new housing estates on the periphery of the town. The lands surrounding Woodfield House were acquired by the council in 1919 to build council housing on, with the first residents moving in 1921. Further local government reform in 1930 brought the burgh of Ayr within the area controlled by Ayrshire County Council, but classed as a large burgh, which allowed the town to continue to run many local services itself. The burgh boundaries were expanded in 1935 to include Alloway, Castlehill, Doonfoot and Whitletts. In the 1930s, council estates were also developed at Lochside and Heathfield. The mining villages of Dalmilling and Whitletts were also cleared and developed into sizeable council estates.

Following the Second World War, more council housing was developed in Ayr at Kincaidston, with the Wallacetown and Whitletts estates being expanded. Suburban housing was also developed at Alloway, Doonfoot and Holmston, and many disused industrial buildings throughout the town were redeveloped into flats.

In 2000, as part of the Millennium celebrations, Ayr submitted an unsuccessful bid for city status, losing to Inverness, and again submitted an unsuccessful bid two years later in 2002 as part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, losing to Stirling. In 2021, South Ayrshire Council announced a South Ayrshire wider bid, which would include Ayr. This bid was part of the granting of city status to towns to honour the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee in 2022. Again, the bid was unsuccessful, with the region losing to Dunfermline. 

In 2019, GUARD Archaeology team led by Iraia Arabaolaza uncovered a marching camp dating to the 1st century AD, used by Roman legions during the invasion of Roman General Agricola. According to Arabaolaza, the fire pits were split 30 meters apart into two parallel lines. The findings also included clay-domed ovens and 26 fire pits dated to between 77- 86 AD and 90 AD loaded with burn and charcoal contents. Archaeologists suggested that this site had been chosen as a strategic location for the Roman conquest of Ayrshire.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary representation===

Ayr was represented by a Conservative MP continuously for a period of 91 years – from 1906 (as part of the Ayr Burghs constituency) until 1997, followed by Labour from 1997 to 2015, and the Scottish National Party from 2015 to 2017. The town forms part of the Ayr constituency in the Scottish Parliament, which was the first Conservative constituency seat in the Parliament, but has been represented by Scottish National Party (SNP) MSP Siobhian Brown since the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In the UK Parliament, Ayr is situated within the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock constituency which was represented by Conservative MP Bill Grant from the 2017 general election, until he was unseated in the 2019 general election by Allan Dorans of the Scottish National Party.

Ayr forms part of the UK parliamentary constituency of Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock. This constituency includes Carrick and Coylton in South Ayrshire in addition to Doon Valley, Cumnock and New Cumnock in southern East Ayrshire. The seat was held by Conservative Bill Grant from 2017 until 2019 when Allan Dorans gained the seat for the Scottish National Party. The Central Ayrshire constituency runs north of the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock constituency. It takes in the towns of Irvine, Kilwinning, Prestwick, Troon and rural Kyle, running into Annbank. It also incorporates the Woodfield area of Newton-on-Ayr and is represented by SNP MP Philippa Whitford.

In previous elections Ayr was represented in Westminster as part of the Ayr parliamentary constituency, the boundaries of which included elements of Prestwick, Troon and rural South Ayrshire. The seat was abolished in 2005 to be replaced by the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock and Central Ayrshire constituencies which were subsequently represented by MP&#x27;s belonging to Labour, and later, the SNP. From the seat&#x27;s creation in 1950 until the 1997 general election Ayr was continually represented by MP&#x27;s from the Conservative Party. George Younger served as Member of Parliament for the constituency for most of this period – serving as MP for Ayr from 1964 to 1992. In 1997 the boundaries of the constituency were altered in a move which saw the Conservative areas of Alloway, Doonfoot and Masonhill alongside parts of Kincaidston and Forehill being transferred to the neighbouring Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency, benefiting the Labour Party. Prior to this Ayr formed part of the Ayr Burghs constituency which combined various towns along the Ayrshire coast such as Irvine, Troon, Prestwick, Ardrossan and Saltcoats: this seat was held by the Conservatives from 1906 until the constituency&#x27;s abolishment in 1950, making Ayr the longest seat to be held by the Conservatives in Scotland at over 100 years.

In the Scottish Parliament, the Ayr constituency was represented from 2000 to 2021 by Conservative MSP John Scott until he was defeated at the 2021 election by the SNP&#x27;s Siobhian Brown. It was the first constituency in the Scottish Parliament to elect a Conservative MSP. The constituency also includes the towns of Prestwick and Troon.

Ayr is also represented at Holyrood by the seven MSPs for the South Scotland electoral region.

===South Ayrshire Council===
Ayr is represented by 11 elected councillors on South Ayrshire Council, of which five belong to the Scottish Conservatives, four belong to the Scottish National Party and two belong to Scottish Labour. Below are a list of councillors elected to serve Ayr, sorted by ward:

=== Provost of the Royal Burgh of Ayr ===

As a former Royal Burgh, Ayr had a Provost as chief magistrate of the burgh council and the earliest recorded Provost is Nicholas de Fynvyk. The title of provost was retained by Kyle and Carrick District Council and South Ayrshire Council for their civic heads. The role of provost is now apolitical and carries a number of duties including chairing meetings of the council, acting as civic head representing South Ayrshire Council, promotion of South Ayrshire Council and networking with various organisations such as local businesses.

A chain and robes are worn by the provost while undertaking their ceremonial duties. The Provost&#x27;s chain was donated in June 1897 by James McLennan who was a Glasgow wine and spirit merchant who was born in Coylton and lived in Ayr. The official provost&#x27;s robes have been provided by the council since 11 June 1923. In addition, South Ayrshire Council erects lamp posts with the Royal Burgh coat of arms emblazoned on the diffusers outside the official resident of the provost – this has been undertaken since 1854.

Each newly elected provost enters their name into a Bible at the &quot;Kirkin &#x27;O The Council&quot; service at Ayr Auld Kirk after each council election. The Bible in which the names are entered was acquired by the Kirk during the Provostship of Hugh Miller (1841–1855). The names of the provosts entered into the Bible are as follows:

The current provost is Labour councillor Helen Moonie.

==Geography==

===Location===

Ayr is a coastal town which lies on the mouth of the River Ayr which flows into the larger Firth of Clyde estuary. From the coast, the Isle of Arran can be seen, and on a very clear day, the northern tip of Northern Ireland is also visible. Ayr is located within the region of Strathclyde, and forms part of the historic county of Ayrshire. Today, it is the largest town and administrative centre of South Ayrshire. Much of the land in and around Ayr is flat and low lying surface, used for rearing dairy cattle. Towards the south of Ayr, however, the land is higher than most areas in the county of Ayrshire, an example of this being the Brown Carrick Hill which is situated due south of Doonfoot. Ayr lies approximately southwest of Glasgow.

The urban area which encompasses Ayr is defined by the General Register Office for Scotland as the adjoining localities of Ayr and Prestwick − this is the 12th largest urban area in Scotland.

===Areas of Ayr===

===Climate===
The nearest official Met Office weather station to Ayr is Auchincruive, about to the north-east of Ayr town centre. The area experiences very cool summers and somewhat mild winters. The air is cooler during the summer due to its proximity to the sea as water has a major cooling effect on summer temperatures. 

During the winter months the reverse happens and the sea air has a major warming effect on the climate. The area rarely sees extremes, owing to the effects of sea air. Rainfall is generally plentiful throughout the year due to Atlantic weather systems sweeping in from the west. Compared with the rest of Scotland, the area rarely sees much mist and fog due to the land being relatively flat and low lying, and, with the wind blowing across the flatter land, this generally hinders fog from developing widely. This has made Glasgow Prestwick International Airport particularly well known as one of the less fog-prone airports in Scotland. Snowfall is rare in this part of Scotland because of the mild sea air.

==Demographics==

At the 2001 United Kingdom census, Ayr had a population of 46,431, a fall of −3.2% on 1991. Mid-2008 population estimates placed the total resident population at 46,070 making Ayr the 12th largest urban area in Scotland. The 2011 census found that Ayr&#x27;s population had grown by around 0.9% since the 2001 census – surpassing the total population growth of Ayr and Prestwick, which only grew by 0.63%, falling short of the national population growth of Scotland of +4.61%.

In 2001, nearly 0.36% (167) people in the town could speak Scottish Gaelic – this fell to 0.34% (161) in 2011. South Ayrshire Council provides no educational support for the language.



===Economy===


The north side of Ayr Harbour still operates as a commercial port, mainly exporting coal, and extensive railway sidings still lead down from the main railway line near Newton-on-Ayr station.

Ayr developed as the central retail hub in the south-west of Scotland after the opening of the town&#x27;s first department store, Hourstons, in 1896. In the 1970s the opening of stores such as Marks and Spencers and Ayr&#x27;s first shopping centre, the Kyle Centre (1988), encouraged an expansion in the local economy. Heathfield Retail park, an out-of-town retail park, opened in 1993 with shops such as Halfords and Homebase. Ayr Central Shopping Centre opened in March 2006, housing shops such as Debenhams and H&amp;M and under-parking for 500 cars. In December 2014 Threesixty Architecture received planning permission to refurbish the Kyle Centre by reinventing it as a centre of leisure through the creation of a new cinema complex among other new features. As of 2014 Royal Society for Public Health found Ayr&#x27;s High Street to be the second healthiest in the United Kingdom behind Shrewsbury, a measure which reflects the presence of health-promoting infrastructure such as health services, community spaces and libraries, although by 2018 it was no longer in the top ten. In 2016 research conducted by the Local Data Company suggested that Ayr had among the highest number of shops per head in the United Kingdom at one shop for every 270 people. In 2010, premium home furnishings company, The Designer Rooms, was established in the town and opened its first showroom within the town.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Ayr became a popular holiday resort. This was due to its fine sandy beach and the construction of the rail link to Glasgow which was completed in 1840.

To the north of Ayr is the adjoining town of Prestwick, which is known for its golf and aviation industries thanks to the presence of Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The airport is one of the main operational bases and focus city for budget airline Ryanair, with the airline having an aircraft maintenance hangar at the airport. The airport itself has become a Scottish hub for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft, with key companies operating from bases at the airport including GE Caledonian, Spirit AeroSystems, Collins Aerospace, Ryanair (Prestwick Aircraft Maintenance), BAE Systems, Woodward Aircraft Engine Systems and 
Chevron Technical Services. Prestwick Spaceport launched a bid in partnership with South Ayrshire Council to become a spaceport focusing on small satellite launches, microgravity experiments and crewed missions for human spaceflight. It received funding via the Ayrshire Growth Deal of £80 million, with an additional £18 million from the UK Government and £5 million from the Scottish Government. The spaceport will support carrying small satellites into orbit via horizontal launch, or “air launch”, using aircraft that fly out over the Atlantic Ocean.

Only north of Ayr is Troon, a golf and seaside resort which regularly hosts the Open Championship. Ayr has three golf courses in Bellisle, Seafield and Dalmilling, as well as a private course called St Cuthberts. The area is synonymous as a seaside resort, with the south of the town housing the Craig Tara and Haven (formerly Butlins) holiday parks. The suburban village of Alloway to the south of the town is also well established for its associations with the poet Robert Burns. Further south, the fishing village of Dunure takes in a ruined castle which was formerly owned by the Kennedy family.

In 1973, Ayr hosted the Royal National Mòd. Ayr has hosted the Scottish Grand National horse-racing steeplechase annually since 1966 and the Scottish International Airshow since 2014.

===Religion===
The 2022 Scottish Census found that 51% of the population of Ayr stated they had no religion. 28% stated they belonged to the Church of Scotland, 9% the Roman Catholic Church, 4% other Christian denominations and 2% other religions. 6% didn&#x27;t respond to this optional question.

Of the Christian denominations present in Ayr the Church of Scotland is largest with nine churches spread throughout the town. The Roman Catholic Church has two churches, St Paul&#x27;s, Belmont and the Cathedral Church of St Margaret the successor to The Good Shepherd Cathedral which has been demolished.

The Scottish Episcopal Church is represented by the very substantial Holy Trinity Church in Fullarton Street in the town centre. There is also a Free Church of Scotland, a Baptist Church and Evangelical church in John Street, a Latter-Day Saints Church at Orchard Avenue and the Southside Christian Fellowship in Ayr Town Hall.

===Education===

===Public services and transport===

The NHS Ayrshire and Arran Health Board serves South, East and North Ayrshire – a part of Ayrshire and Arran&#x27;s departmental headquarters is located in Ayr. Ayr is also the regional headquarters of the Scottish Ambulance Service for south-west Scotland that is located in Heathfield, next to the site of the old Heathfield Hospital. Ayr previously had four hospitals: Heathfield Hospital (originally a fever hospital, but latterly medical and ophthalmic), Seafield Children&#x27;s Hospital (a pediatric hospital), Ayr County Hospital (originally a voluntary hospital, and latterly confined to surgery) and Ailsa Hospital (a psychiatric hospital). University Hospital Ayr, completed in 1991, replaced all but Ailsa Hospital which is still open.

Currently, three hospitals lie adjacent to Ayr running along the A713 towards Hollybush in East Ayrshire, these are:
* University Hospital Ayr (general hospital with accident and emergency)
* Ailsa Hospital (mental health hospital)
* The Abbey Carrick Glen Hospital (private hospital)

Hollybush House on the outskirts of Ayr is used by a charity for the mental health welfare of ex-members of the UK Armed Forces. Ayr has two community centres; Heathfield Community Centre and Lochside Community Centre.

Ayr is served by several major roads:
* A77 – forming the Ayr bypass, part of the trunk route between Glasgow and Stranraer. The bypass was built in 1971.
* A79 – the former A77 before the bypass was opened, now the main road running through Ayr and linking Ayr with Prestwick and its airport.
* A70 – running east from Ayr to Cumnock, Lanark and Edinburgh.
* A713 – running southeast to Dalmellington and Castle Douglas.
* A719 – running northeast to Galston and southwest along the coast to Turnberry.

Eight local bus services operated by Stagecoach West Scotland serve Ayr and Prestwick. Express coaches to Glasgow Buchanan Street operate every 30–60 minutes. Ulsterbus operate bus services to Belfast via Stranraer Ferry service on Stena Line. The Ayr railway station has regular services to Glasgow Central station, Edinburgh Waverley, Stranraer, Girvan and Kilmarnock. All services are operated by ScotRail.

The railway station provides rail and sea connections via Stranraer for the connecting bus to Cairnryan for either the Stena Line ferry service to the Port of Belfast or the P&amp;O Ferries service to Larne Harbour connecting with Northern Ireland Railways via Carrickfergus and Jordanstown to Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Grand Central. There is also the connection via Troon on P&amp;O Ferries on a seasonal basis to Larne Harbour. The town is served by the Glasgow Prestwick International Airport just north from Ayr, which offers regional and domestic air services across Europe and the British Isles. Further destinations are available from Glasgow Airport, which is accessible by train to Paisley Gilmour Street for the connecting bus to the airport. In relation to Ayr, Glasgow Airport is away.

Although the town does not have any ferry services from its harbour, it is in close proximity to ferry services to Northern Ireland. Cairnryan, south of Ayr, has up to eight daily departures to Belfast and up to seven daily departures to Larne.

===Sport===
Ayr Racecourse is a well-known racecourse in Scotland and hosts both National Hunt and flat racing. It has the largest capacity in Scotland for horse racing. Notable events include the Scottish Grand National (April) and Ayr Gold Cup (September) as well as several night meetings. It was recently put up for sale by the owners and included the Western House Hotel as part of the potential sale.

Ayr has two senior football clubs. Ayr United play at Somerset Park in the Scottish Championship. They reached the final of the 2001–02 Scottish League Cup competition. The club was formed in 1910 with the merger of Ayr F.C. (who were formed in 1879 by the merger of Ayr Thistle and Ayr Academical football clubs) and Ayr Parkhouse F.C. Whitletts Victoria are based in the Whitletts area of Ayr and compete in the West of Scotland Football League.

The town has a strong history of ice hockey, but no longer hosts a professional ice hockey team. The most recent professional team were the Ayr Scottish Eagles who played in the British Superleague between 1996 and 2002 based at the Centrum arena. Ayr&#x27;s rugby union team, Ayr RFC, play at Millbrae and are reigning Scottish Cup Champions and Scottish Premiership Champions 2012/2013, and won the 2008/09 Scottish Hydro Premiership. Ayr RFC has twice competed in the British and Irish cup involving clubs from Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland. A rugby league team, Ayr Knights ARLFC, play at Auchincruive.

Ayr Curling Club play at the curling rink in Limekiln Road and Ayr&#x27;s cricket team plays in Cambusdoon. The town&#x27;s leisure centre, Citadel Leisure Centre opened in 1997 at the mouth of the River Ayr and at the seafront at the South Harbour area. Its facilities include a main hall measuring , accommodating various sports including 5-a-side football, basketball, volleyball, netball, indoor hockey, indoor cricket practice, badminton and short tennis. As well as individual sports, sporting events and competitions, the hall has hosted exhibitions, concerts, trade fairs, election counts and awards ceremonies. The Citadel Leisure Centre is home to South Ayrshire Volleyball Club as well as being the town&#x27;s only public swimming pool and diving pool. The Troon Tornadoes play their national league matches at the Citadel, despite not being an Ayr team. Additionally, Ayr has a Strathclyde league basketball team, Ayr Storm.

Speedway was staged at Dam Park in 1937, when two meetings, organised by Maurice and Roland Stobbart from Cumbria took place, featuring riders who raced in the north of England, at venues such as Workington and Hyde Road in Manchester. Ayr has a sandy beach with an esplanade. This is very popular with joggers and day-trippers.
Whitletts Activity Centre also serves the town of Ayr. It has an 11-a side outdoor soccer pitch and an indoor 5-a-side football pitch. Near Whitletts Activity Centre there is also a 5-a-side football complex called &quot;Pro Soccer&quot;.

===Culture and community===

Ayr is home to the Gaiety Theatre, built in 1902. The theatre was reconstructed following a fire in 1904, with its façade remodelled in 1935, and further reinstated after a fire in 1955. In 1995, an annexe was constructed, including a new café, box office, dressing rooms and studio space. After a faltering start, which saw several years as a cinema after WWI, the theatre was bought by Ben Popplewell, from Bradford, who already had a track record of success running the Pavilion theatre on Ayr seafront. For fifty years the Popplewell family ran the theatre – latterly as part of the Glasgow Pavilion business.

The radio station West FM was based in Ayr until mid-2017 and broadcasts on 96.7FM. West FM is the main broadcaster in the Ayrshire area. The &quot;Ayrshire Post&quot;, serving all parts of Ayrshire, and &quot;Ayr Advertiser&quot;, serving the towns of Ayr and Prestwick, newspapers are also based in Ayr. The Ayr Advertiser is Scotland&#x27;s oldest weekly newspaper. West FM&#x27;s move from Ayr marks the first time in 35 years that local radio has not been broadcast from Ayrshire.
Ayr is served by three libraries plus a mobile library. These are:
* Alloway Library (attached to Alloway Primary school)
