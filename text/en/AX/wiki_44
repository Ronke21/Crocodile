<text>Newmarket (2021 population: 87,942) is a town and regional seat of the Regional Municipality of York in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is part of Greater Toronto in the Golden Horseshoe region of Southern Ontario. The name stems from the fact that the settlement was a &quot;New Market&quot;, in contrast to York as the &quot;Old Market&quot;.

The town was formed as one of many farming communities in the area, but also developed an industrial centre on the Northern Railway of Canada&#x27;s mainline, which was built in 1853 through what would become the downtown area. It also became a thriving market town with the arrival of the Metropolitan Street Railway in 1899. Over time, the town developed into a primarily residential area, and the expansion of Ontario Highway 400 to the west and the construction of Ontario Highway 404 to the east increasingly turned it into a bedroom town since the 1980s. The province&#x27;s Official Plan includes growth in the business services and knowledge industries, as well as in the administrative, manufacturing and retail sectors.

Landmarks include Upper Canada Mall, Southlake Regional Health Centre, the Main Street Heritage Conservation District, and Wesley Brooks Conservation Area (locally called &quot;Fairy Lake Park&quot; or &quot;Fairy Lake&quot;).

== History ==
Newmarket&#x27;s location on the Holland River enabled travel between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe. A portage route, the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, ran one of its two routes up the Holland River through the Newmarket area, and over the Oak Ridges Moraine to the Rouge River and into Lake Ontario. A more widely used route ran up the western branch of the Holland River, over the moraine, and down the Humber River. In 1793, John Graves Simcoe travelled the trail northward along the main route to the west, and south to York (now Toronto) along the lesser used eastern route through Newmarket. Selecting the eastern route as the better of the two, Simcoe started construction of Yonge Street along the former trail in late 1795, starting in York in Toronto Bay, and ending at the newly named St. Albans (Holland Landing), north of Newmarket.

===Early settlement===
Quakers from the Thirteen Colonies moved to the area to avoid violence they were expected to take part in during the American Revolution. In June 1800, Timothy Rogers, a Quaker from Vermont, explored the area around the Holland River to find a suitable location for a new Quaker settlement. He, Samuel Lundy and their group of Religious Society of Friends received the grant of around the Holland River. In 1801, Rogers returned along with several Quaker families who had left their homes in Vermont and Pennsylvania, and settled here between 1801 and 1803.

Joseph Hill constructed a mill on the river, damming it to produce a mill pond today known as Fairy Lake. The settlement of &quot;Upper Yonge Street&quot; developed around the mill and the Holland River. Hill also built a tannery north of the mill, the first general store and house, and additional mills.

In 1802, Elisha Beman, who owned land in the area, established a mill, and then a distillery. Mordecai Millar also built mills, and Joseph Hill opened a tannery. During the War of 1812 a resident, William Roe, hid the settlement&#x27;s gold treasury from invading American troops. The war helped the settlement prosper, as the British army purchased goods and food and hired locals to build structures.

By 1814, the settlement had two frame and several log buildings used as residences. The settlement continued to grow through the early 19th century, along with the formation of Aurora and Holland Landing. A post office opened in 1826, and until 1890 the name was spelled &quot;New Market&quot;.

Newmarket is noted for its role in the Rebellions of 1837–1838, and was a centre of discontent against the manipulations of the governing Family Compact. Rebel leader William Lyon Mackenzie organized a series of meetings leading to the Rebellion; the first of which, on August 3, 1837, was delivered from the veranda of the North American Hotel in Newmarket. This speech contributed to the rebellion, as it was heard by about 600 farmers and others sympathetic to Mackenzie&#x27;s cause, who later that year armed themselves and marched down Yonge Street to take the capital. A number of leaders from this area were attainted for high treason, convicted and hanged.

By 1846, the population was about 600. Much of the settlement was built on the south side of the town, with farms surrounding it. There were six churches or chapels, a post office, five stores, three taverns, and tradesmen of various types. Industry included two grist-mills, two breweries, a distillery, one tannery, a foundry, a carding machine, and a cloth factory.

In June 1853, the first train pulled into Newmarket on the Toronto, Simcoe &amp; Lake Huron Union Railroad, the first railway in Upper Canada. It was later called the Northern Railway of Canada, and carried passengers, agricultural products and manufactured goods. The line eventually linked Toronto to Collingwood on Georgian Bay, a major shipbuilding centre. Today, this line is the &quot;Newmarket Subdivision&quot; of the Canadian National Railway system, running north out of Newmarket towards Bradford, and south towards Toronto.

===From village to town===

Newmarket was incorporated as a village in 1857 with a population of 700, with Donald Sutherland as the first reeve. In 1858, Robert Simpson co-opened &quot;Simpson &amp; Trent Groceries, Boots, Shoes and Dry Goods&quot; in downtown Newmarket, the first store in what would become the Simpsons department store chain. In 1880, Newmarket became a town with a population of 2,000. William Cane was elected as the first mayor. Some years later, his sash and door factory would become the first Canadian manufacturer of lead pencils, the Dixon Pencil Company.

In 1869, the population was 1,500 and a gazetteer described Newmarket as one of the most flourishing villages on the Northern Railway line. In addition to the train, stagecoaches were available to nearby communities. By the time of the 1871 census, the population was 1,760 and by 1881, it had increased to 2,006; an elementary school and a high school were already in operation by then.

The Toronto and York Radial Railway arrived in Newmarket in 1899. This service operated along Yonge Street south of Newmarket, but turned east to run through the downtown area along Main Street; it would later be extended north to Sutton. At the time, it brought significant numbers of day-trippers to Newmarket to shop at the market. Automobile traffic on Yonge Street, and the already existing mainline railway, had a significant effect on ridership, and the Radial was discontinued in the early 1930s.

North of Davis Drive in Newmarket, the East Holland River was straightened to prepare it for use as a commercial waterway to bypass the railway, whose prices were skyrocketing around the turn of the 20th century. Sir William Mulock, the local Member of Parliament, proposed a canal system running down the Holland River through Holland Landing and into Lake Simcoe. This would allow boats to connect from there to the Trent-Severn Waterway for eventual shipment south. The Newmarket Canal was almost complete by the summer of 1912, when it was cancelled by the incoming government of Robert Borden. Today, the locks are still visible and are known as the &quot;Ghost Canal&quot;. The turning basin in downtown Newmarket was filled in and now forms the parking lot of The Old Davis Tannery Mall, on the site of the former Hill tannery.

===Recent developments===
For much of the 20th century, Newmarket developed along the east-west Davis Drive axis, limited to the area between Yonge Street on the west and between Bayview and Leslie Street in the east, and running from just north of Davis on the north to the Fairy Lake area on the south. By the 1950s, Newmarket was experiencing a suburban building boom due to its proximity to Toronto. The population increased from 5,000 to 11,000 between 1950 and 1970.

The Regional Municipality of York was formed in 1971, increasing the size of Newmarket with land from the Township of East Gwillimbury, from the Township of King and from the Township of Whitchurch. 
 The construction of Upper Canada Mall at the corner of Yonge Street and Davis Drive in 1974 started pulling the focal point of the town westward from the historic Downtown area along Main Street.

By the early 1980s, the historic Downtown area suffered as most businesses had built up in the area around Upper Canada Mall, with additional strip malls developing directly across the Yonge Street/Davis Drive intersection to the south and southeast. A concerted effort to revitalize the historic Downtown area during the late 1980s was successful. More recently, a $2.3-million investment was made by the town in 2004 in streetscaping and infrastructure improvements to roads and sidewalks in the historic Downtown. The historic area of Downtown&#x27;s Main Street is once again a major focal point of the town.

The arrival of Highway 404 reversed the westward movement, pulling development eastward again, and surrounding the formerly separate hamlet of Bogarttown at the intersection of Mulock Drive and Leslie Street. Since then, Newmarket has grown considerably, filling out in all directions. The town limits now run from Bathurst Street in the west to Highway 404 in the east, and from just south of Green Lane to just north of St. John&#x27;s Sideroad, taking over the former hamlet of Armitage at Yonge Street south of Mulock Drive. The southern boundary of the town is contiguous with Aurora to the south.

Armitage was the first settlement of King township, named in honour of its first settler Amos Armitage. He had been recruited by Timothy Rogers, a Loyalist from Vermont, who in 1801 had travelled along Yonge Street and found the area appealing, and so applied for and received a grant for land totalling 40 farms, each of .

Other defunct communities once located within the modern boundaries of Newmarket include Garbut&#x27;s Hill, Paddytown, Petchville, Pleasantville, and White Rose.

== Geography ==
Newmarket&#x27;s geographical coordinates are 44.05°N, 79.46°W, and its elevation above sea level is 252 m. It has an area of 38.33 km2. The town is bounded on the south by Aurora, on the west by King, on the north by East Gwillimbury and on the east by Whitchurch–Stouffville.

The main river in Newmarket is the East Holland River (known locally simply as &quot;The Holland River&quot;), and all other streams in the town are tributaries thereto. These include Bogart Creek, a brook that weaves its way into the town from the Oak Ridges Moraine by way of Bogarttown, emptying into the Holland River in north-central Newmarket; Western creek, another brook rising just west of the town, and reaching the Holland River in the town&#x27;s north end; Tannery Creek, a stream that joins the Holland River in south Newmarket after flowing through Aurora; and a number of other small watercourses.

There are two reservoirs in Newmarket; Fairy Lake (which is managed by the Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority), a favourite recreational area in the centre of town, is a former mill pond on the East Holland River; and Bogart Pond, also a former mill pond, is fed and drained by Bogart Creek in Bogarttown. Furthermore, the water level in the reach of the East Holland north of Davis Drive is controlled from an unfinished Newmarket Canal lock, now used as a weir.

Newmarket also lies south of and above the Algonquin Shoreline, where elevations suddenly drop off from the gently rolling hills that characterize much of Newmarket to the much flatter, lower land down below in the Holland Marsh.

The land is characterized mainly by glacial deposits from the last ice age, known as &quot;Newmarket Till&quot;. The town is underlain mainly by sand and gravel, ground by the icesheets that covered the area until about 10,000 years ago. No outcrops are to be found anywhere in Newmarket, so deep are the glacial deposits.

===Planning ===
Newmarket is identified as one of the Golden Horseshoe&#x27;s 25 Urban Growth Centres in Ontario&#x27;s Places to Grow Growth Plan.

Four areas of Newmarket have been selected to absorb the majority of planned population growth and accommodate mixed usages on sites well served by transit. These are the Yonge-Davis intersection, Yonge Street (south of Green Lane), the Regional Healthcare Centre (Southlake Regional Health Centre) and Historic Downtown Centre (surrounding Main Street South). Further construction of big box retail stores in the Yonge Street corridor will not be permitted and the long-term objective of the town is redevelopment or the addition of new buildings to these areas through controlled intensification.

The southwest portion of the town is located in the Oak Ridges Moraine and is therefore subject to the Ontario Government&#x27;s Greenbelt Legislation.

=== Climate ===
Newmarket has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), with four distinct seasons featuring cold, somewhat snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is moderate and consistent in all seasons, although summers are a bit wetter than winter due to the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes.

==Arts and culture==
=== Main Street Heritage Conservation District ===

For over 100 years, the town&#x27;s downtown area, centred around Main Street, has acted as a hub of commerce and cultural activity. This area contains numerous early 19th century buildings worthy of preservation, and in October 2013, this area was recognized as a Provincial Heritage Conservation District. This status serves to protect and officially recognize many of the heritage sites and buildings along this historic thoroughfare and its many side streets.

Recent investments have been made to improve the aesthetics and function of the historic area. These include:
* In 2003, Newmarket completed approximately $3 million of streetscape and infrastructure improvements along Main Street South.
* In 2010, construction began on the Davis Drive Rapidway. The project was finished in 2015. The buildings comprising the Union Hotel, dating from 1881, at the intersection of Main Street and Davis Drive were moved as an alternative to being demolished. 
* In 2011, an urban park called &quot;Riverwalk Commons&quot; was created east of Main Street South, north of Water Street at a cost of $10 million.
* In 2011, extensive renovations were completed to the Newmarket Community Centre &amp; Lions Hall, located in the Riverwalk Commons.
* In 2016, extensive $10 million renovations were completed on Old Town Hall, off Main Street.

===Coat of arms===
Newmarket&#x27;s coat of arms is actually taken from the town&#x27;s old corporate seal. The town flag is a navy blue field with this same design in the middle. The beehive and bees are said to represent industry. There are nine bees, representing the town&#x27;s nine most prominent businesses at the time that Newmarket was incorporated as a Village. The latest form of the seal was introduced in 1938 with the arms somewhat altered from – but very similar in concept to – one that was earlier used. The arms&#x27; origin is something of a mystery, however. It is unknown what artist created the current version – or indeed the earlier version – and the town has no official record as to the purchase or redesign of the arms.

<doc id="180171" wikidata="Q1005432" url="?curid=180171" title="Third Great Awakening">
<text>The Third Great Awakening refers to a historical period proposed by William G. McLoughlin that was marked by religious activism in American history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century. It influenced pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism. It gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the Second Coming of Christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire Earth. It was affiliated with the Social Gospel movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene and Pentecostal movements, and also Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Thelema, and Christian Science. The era saw the adoption of a number of moral causes, such as the abolition of slavery and prohibition.

==Overview==
This article focuses on the awakening that took place during the 19th century in America and Korea. A similar awakening took place in Britain, identified by J. Edwin Orr as starting in 1859 with its influence continuing through to the end of the 19th century, impacting church growth, overseas mission, and social action. Significant names include Dwight L. Moody, Ira D. Sankey, William Booth and Catherine Booth (founders of The Salvation Army), Charles Spurgeon and James Caughey. Hudson Taylor began the China Inland Mission, and Thomas John Barnardo founded his famous orphanages.

The American Protestant mainline churches were growing rapidly in numbers, wealth and educational levels, throwing off their frontier beginnings and becoming centered in towns and cities. Intellectuals and writers such as Josiah Strong advocated a muscular Christianity with systematic outreach to the unchurched in America and around the globe. Others built colleges and universities to train the next generation. Each denomination supported active missionary societies and made the role of missionary one of high prestige.

The great majority of pietistic mainline Protestants (in the North) supported the Republican Party and urged it to endorse prohibition and social reforms. The awakening in numerous cities in 1858 was interrupted by the American Civil War. In the South, on the other hand, the Civil War stimulated revivals, especially the Confederate States Army revival in General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army. After the war, Moody made revivalism the centerpiece of his activities in Chicago and founded the Moody Bible Institute. The hymns of Ira Sankey were especially influential.

Across the nation, drys crusaded in the name of religion for the prohibition of alcohol. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union mobilized Protestant women for social crusades against liquor, pornography and prostitution, and sparked the demand for women&#x27;s suffrage. The Gilded Age plutocracy came under sharp attack from Social Gospel preachers and reformers in the Progressive Era. The historian Robert Fogel identifies numerous reforms, especially the battles involving child labor, compulsory elementary education, and the protection of women from exploitation in factories. With Jane Addams&#x27;s Hull House in Chicago as its center, the settlement house movement and the vocation of social work were deeply influenced by the Social Gospel.

In 1880, the Salvation Army denomination arrived in America. Although its theology was based on ideals expressed during the Second Great Awakening, its focus on poverty was of the Third. All the major denominations sponsored growing missionary activities, both inside the United States and around the world. Colleges associated with churches rapidly expanded in number, size and quality of curriculum. The promotion of &quot;muscular Christianity&quot; became popular among young men on campus and in urban YMCAs, as well as in such denominational youth groups such as the Epworth League for Methodists and the Walther League for Lutherans. Professional baseball player Billy Sunday converted as a young man in the 1880s, became an evangelist, and is widely considered America&#x27;s most influential evangelist of the first two decades in the 20th century. In 1891, basketball was invented at the International Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.

==New religions==
In 1879 Mary Baker Eddy founded the Church of Christ, Scientist, which gained a national following. The Society for Ethical Culture was established in New York in 1876 by Felix Adler and attracted a Reform Jewish clientele. Charles Taze Russell founded the Bible Student movement. In July 1879, Russell began publishing a monthly religious journal, &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;. He and his group of fellow students first identified themselves as The People&#x27;s Pulpit Association, then in 1910 as The International Bible Students Association. In 1931, after schisms within the Bible Students and gaining control of the legal entity Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Joseph Franklin Rutherford along with former members of the Bible Student movement would go on to adopt the name Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The New Thought movement, which began in the 1830s, expanded as Unity and Church of Divine Science were founded.

==Holiness and Pentecostal movements==
The goal of the Holiness movement in the Methodist church was to move beyond the one-time conversion experience that the revivals produced and reach entire sanctification. The Pentecostals went one step further, seeking what they called a &quot;baptism in the spirit&quot; or &quot;baptism of the Holy Ghost&quot; that enabled those with this special gift to heal the sick, perform miracles, prophesy, and speak in tongues.

The re-discovered Pentecostal movement can be traced to the Ocoee mountains of East Tennessee in the upper Tennessee River valley, when a group led by Methodist minister Richard Spurling met in 1886-1896 and called for holy living. At that time they experienced what is known as the baptism of the Holy Spirit, empowering Christians to live in holiness. Little is known of this movement because it happened in the mountains, compared to the Azusa Street Revival which happened in Los Angeles, California. However, the organization born from that group led by Spurling has grown to an international presence in over 200 countries around the world with a church membership of over 7 million Christians; it is known as the Church of God, with headquarters in Cleveland, Tennessee. The organization owns Lee University and Pentecostal Theological Seminary.

Charles Parham in Topeka, Kansas, who was a Methodist minister, resigned his ordination as a minister and began preaching about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. During a service on December 31, 1899, Parham laid hands on a woman named Agnes Ozman; she is supposed to have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and to have begun speaking in tongues and prophesying. This is the root of the better known &quot;Azusa Street Revival&quot; in Los Angeles, California (1906) led by William J. Seymour, an African American student of Parham&#x27;s.

==Impact on Korea==

Chun Beh Im compared the evangelistic method and results of the Third Great Awakening in America with the Korean revivals of 1884–1910. Many techniques of the Second and Third Great Awakenings were transposed from America to Korea, including the circuit-riding system of the Methodists, the Baptist farmer preachers, the campus revivals of the eastern seaboard, the camp meetings in the West, the new measures of Charles G. Finney, the Layman&#x27;s Prayer Revival, urban mass revivalism of Moody, and the Student Volunteer Movement. Im discovered four areas of influence from a comparison and analysis of the two countries&#x27; revivals: the establishment of tradition, the adoption of similar emphases, the incorporation of evangelistic methodologies, and the observation of the results of the revivals. The American revivals had a major influence on the Korean revivals, and the American revival tradition and enthusiasm toward missions helped Korean Christians develop their own religious experience and tradition. This tradition has influenced Korean churches even into the 21st century.

<text>Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Hawtin (born June 4, 1970) is a British-Canadian electronic musician and DJ. He became involved with Detroit techno&#x27;s second wave in the early 1990s, and has been a leading exponent of minimal techno since the mid-1990s. He became known for his recordings under the Plastikman and F.U.S.E. aliases. Under the latter, he released his debut album &quot;Dimension Intrusion&quot; (1993) as part of Warp&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence series.

In May 1990, Hawtin and John Acquaviva founded the Plus 8 record label, which they named after their turntable&#x27;s pitch adjust function. In 1998, Hawtin launched M-nus Records. From 2012-2015, Hawtin held the ENTER. Ibiza weekly party at Space in Ibiza. In 2016, Hawtin launched his own technology company called PLAYdifferently, and released the MODEL 1 mixer, co-designed with Andy Rigby-Jones.

==Biography==

Hawtin was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, England, and at the age of nine moved with his parents to LaSalle, Ontario, a suburb of Windsor, Ontario, where he was raised before spending time in Detroit, MI. His father worked as a robotics technician at General Motors and was a fan of electronic music, introducing his son to Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream at an early age. He has one brother, Matthew, who is a visual artist and ambient music DJ. Hawtin attended Sandwich Secondary High School in LaSalle.

He began to DJ in clubs at 17. He was mentored by Scott &quot;Go-Go&quot; Gordon at The Shelter in Detroit and his early style was a mix of house music and techno. With Canadian DJ John Acquaviva he formed the label Plus 8 in 1989 to release his own tracks under the name F.U.S.E. He dropped out of the University of Windsor, where he was studying film, and Plus 8 went on to release material by artists such as Speedy J and Kenny Larkin. Hawtin adopted his &#x27;Plastikman&#x27; incarnation in 1993, releasing the single &quot;Spastik&quot; and parent album &quot;Sheet One&quot;, going on to release a number of albums and touring a live show for the next decade.

==Career==

Hawtin was among pioneers of the Minimal techno movement that emerged in the early 1990s, where he represented a &quot;second wave&quot; of American producers, such as Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks, associated with Detroit techno. In 1996, he released a series of monthly 12-inch singles, entitled Concept 1, which, alongside the work of Robert Hood and other producers, explored minimal techno. His M-nus label also pursued this direction. In 1999, the &quot;Decks, EFX &amp; 909&quot; mix album, the first in a series of three, included 38 tracks molded via effects and drum machines.

In 2001, Hawtin performed at Life Fest in Windsor. He spent part of 2002 and 2003 living in New York City, before opening a label in Berlin, Germany, where he focused on his M-nus label, developing the careers of DJ-producers such as Magda, Gaiser, Marc Houle, Hearttrob and Troy Pierce.

In 2006, he collaborated with choreographer Enzo Cosimi on a composition called &quot;9.20&quot; for the Winter Olympics opening ceremony. He said, &quot;Enzo and I are very much interested in pushing boundaries, both as artists and for our audiences. Working together for the Opening Ceremonies of the Winter Games delivers the creative endeavor to not only entertain a huge audience, but to also introduce them to sights and sounds that they may have never experienced before.&quot;

In 2012, Hawtin worked with Loco Dice and Ean Golden in promoting Electronic Dance Music on a tour of North American universities entitled &quot;&quot;, which included music production seminars, lessons in the music business, and live music performances.

In July 2015, Hawtin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music Technology by the University of Huddersfield.

Hawtin composed and scored music for the XXth Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony and 1928 silent French film Brumes d’automne.

===Recordings===

Hawtin has recorded under the aliases Plastikman, F.U.S.E., Concept 1, Forcept 1, Circuit Breaker, Robotman, Chrome, Spark, Xenon, R.H.X., Jack Master, Richard Michaels and UP!. He recorded and performed, with other artists, under group names such as The Hard Brothers, Hard Trax (with his brother Matthew Hawtin), 0733, Cybersonik (with Daniel Bell and John Acquaviva), Final Exposure (with Joey Beltram and Mundo Muzique), Just For Fun (with Holger Wick), Narod Niki (with Akufen, Cabanne, Dandy Jack, Daniel Bell, Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Robert Henke and Thomas Franzmann), Two Guys In The Basement (with John Acquaviva), Spawn (with Fred Giannelli and Daniel Bell) and States Of Mind (with Acquaviva).

Hawtin and Pete Namlook collaborated to produce the From Within series of albums which blend minimal techno and ambient. He released a mix CD &quot;Sounds of the Third Season&quot; with Sven Väth. &quot;Slices&quot; magazine launched a series of biographies in 2007 called &quot;Pioneers of Electronic Music&quot;; their first issue was a 60-minute biographical documentary on Hawtin. The film follows his career from his early days crossing the border to Detroit to his current life in Berlin, and contains interviews with many colleagues and family members.

2011 saw the release of &quot;Arkives 1993 - 2010&quot;, a massive box set containing everything Hawtin has released under his Plastikman moniker, as well as a new mixed set and previously unreleased material. The collection includes CDs, vinyl, digital downloads and a DVD.

In November 2013, Hawtin performed as Plastikman at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City. The recording of this show was included in &quot;EX&quot; album, which was released digitally on June 10, 2014, followed with a CD release on July 15, 2014 .

On December 11, 2015, Hawtin released a fifteen-track LP titled &quot;From My Mind To Yours&quot; to commemorate the 25 year anniversary of his record label Plus 8. The album consists of all new tracks from his various aliases such as Plastikman, F.U.S.E., Robotman, R.H.X., and Circuit Breaker. In its first week, it reached the top 20 in the UK dance album charts.

Other Hawtin&#x27;s collaborations include an installation performance in the Grand Palais in Paris with Anish Kapoor in 2011, &quot;Not Abstract II exhibition&quot; at the Gagosian Gallery in New York with German artist Andreas Gursky, and an audiovisual installation at 180 The Strand in London under his F.U.S.E. alias alongside his brother Matthew Hawtin, among others.

==Entrepreneurship==

In 2014, Hawtin launched &quot;ENTER. SAKE&quot;, a sake brand in USA and Europe. The same year he was awarded a title of &quot;Sake Samurai&quot;.

Hawtin&#x27;s established his own music technology company, called PLAYdifferently, in 2016. The first release was the MODEL 1 mixer, co-designed with the award-winning Andy Rigby-Jones. The mixer has been adopted by DJs such as Carl Cox, Jamie Jones, Loco Dice and many others.

Hawtin co-founded Plus 8 Equities, a music technology fund along with John Acquaviva, Rishi Patel, Ben Turner and Pete Tong, where Hawtin serves as chairman. According to Billboard, the funds main goal is to advance music technology and collaborate with the startups engaged in developing new technologies able to advance music industry&quot;. 

In 2019, Hawtin launched his CLOSER App, a tool for deconstructing the audio from his own live performances while toggling between multiple camera angles.

<text>Niagara Falls is a city in Ontario, Canada, adjacent to, and named after, Niagara Falls. As of the 2021 census, the city had a population of 94,415. The city is located on the Niagara Peninsula along the western bank of the Niagara River, which forms part of the Canada–United States border, with the other side being the twin city of Niagara Falls, New York. Niagara Falls is within the Regional Municipality of Niagara and a part of the St. Catharines - Niagara Census Metropolitan Area (CMA).

Tourism is a major part of the city&#x27;s economy: its skyline consists of multiple high-rise hotels and observation towers that overlook the waterfalls and adjacent parkland. Souvenir shops, arcades, museums, amusement rides, indoor water parks, casinos, theatres and a convention centre are located nearby in the city&#x27;s large tourist area. Other parts of the city include historic sites from the War of 1812, parks, golf courses, commercial spaces, and residential neighbourhoods.

==History==
Prior to European arrival, present day Niagara Falls was populated by Iroquoian-speaking Neutral people but, after attacks from the Haudenosaunee and Seneca, the Neutral people population was severely reduced. The Haudenosaunee people remained in the area until Europeans made first contact in the late 17th century. The Niagara Falls area had some European settlement in the 17th century. Louis Hennepin, a French priest and missionary, is considered to be the first European to visit the area in the 1670s. French colonists settled mostly in Lower Canada, beginning near the Atlantic, and in Quebec and Montreal.

After surveys were completed in 1782 the area was referred to as &quot;Township Number 2&quot; as well as Mount Dorchester after Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester (and today is only honoured by Dorchester Road and the community of Dorchester Village). The earliest settlers of Township Number 2 were Philip George Bender (namesake of Bender Street and Bender Hill near Casino Niagara originally from Germany and later New Jersey and Philadelphia) and Thomas McMicken (a Scottish-born British Army veteran). Increased settlement in this area took place during and after the American Revolutionary War, when the British Crown made land grants to Loyalists to help them resettle in Upper Canada and provide some compensation for their losses after the United States became independent. Loyalist Robert Land received and was one of the first people of European descent to settle in the Niagara Region. He moved to nearby Hamilton three years later due to the relentless noise of the falls.
In 1791, John Graves Simcoe renamed the town as Stamford after Stamford, Lincolnshire in England but today Stamford is only used for an area northwest of downtown Niagara Falls as well as Stamford Street. During the war of 1812, the battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane took place nearby in July 1814. In 1856, the Town of Clifton was incorporated by Ogden Creighton after Clifton, Bristol. The name of the town was changed to Niagara Falls in 1881. In 1882, the community of Drummondville (near the present-day corner of Lundy&#x27;s Lane and Main Street) was incorporated as the village of Niagara Falls (South). The village was referred to as Niagara Falls South to differentiate it from the town. In 1904, the town and village amalgamated to form the City of Niagara Falls. In 1963, the city amalgamated with the surrounding Stamford Township. In 1970, the Niagara regional government was formed. This resulted in the village of Chippawa, Willoughby Township, and part of Crowland Township being annexed into Niagara Falls.

An internment camp for Germans was set up at The Armoury (now Niagara Military Museum) in Niagara Falls from December 1914 to August 1918.

=== Black history ===
Niagara Falls has had a Black population since at least 1783. Up to 12 African-Americans were a part of the Butler&#x27;s Rangers, including Richard Pierpoint. When they were disbanded in 1783, they tried to establish themselves through farming nearby, making them among the first Black settlers in the region. It is estimated that nearly 10 percent of the Loyalists to settle in the area were Black Loyalists.

Niagara Falls&#x27; Black population increased in the following decades, as a destination on the Underground Railroad. In 1856, a British Methodist Episcopal (BME) Church was established for African-Canadian worshipers. The BME Church, Nathaniel Dett Memorial Chapel is now a National Historic Site, remaining in operation into the 21st century. Composer, organist, pianist and music professor Nathaniel Dett was born in Niagara Falls in 1882.

In 1886, Burr Plato became one of the first African Canadians to be elected to political office, holding the position of City Councillor of Niagara Falls until 1901.

==Economy==
Tourism started in the early 19th century and has been a vital part of the local economy since that time. The falls became known as a natural wonder, in part to their being featured in paintings by prominent American artists of the 19th century such as Albert Bierstadt. Such works were reproduced as lithographs, becoming widely distributed. Niagara Falls marketed itself as a honeymoon destination, describing itself as the &quot;honeymoon capital of the world&quot;. Its counterpart in New York also used the moniker. The phrase was most commonly used in brochures in the early twentieth century and declined in usage around the 1960s.

With a plentiful and inexpensive source of hydroelectric power from the waterfalls, many electro-chemical and electro-metallurgical industries located there in the early to mid-20th century. Industry began moving out of the city in the 1970s and 80s because of economic recession and increasing global competition in the manufacturing sector. Tourism increasingly became the city&#x27;s most important revenue source.

Recent development has been mostly centred on the Clifton Hill and Fallsview areas. The Niagara Falls downtown (Queen Street) is undergoing a major revitalization; the city is encouraging redevelopment of this area as an arts and culture district. The downtown was a major centre for local commerce and night life up until the 1970s, when the Niagara Square Shopping Centre began to draw away crowds and retailers. Since 2006, Historic Niagara has brought art galleries, boutiques, cafés and bistros to the street. Attractions include renovation of the Seneca Theatre.

In 2004, several tourist establishments in Niagara Falls began adding additional fees to bills. These fees have various different names and range in what percentage of the bill they take. The collected money is untraceable and there are no controls over how each establishment spends it. The Ontario government—concerned tourists could be misled into believing the fees were endorsed by the government—warned hotels and restaurants in 2008 not to claim the fee if it was not being remitted to a legitimate non-profit agency that promotes tourism. The practise continues and takes in an estimated $15 million per-year. Hotels specifically charge a Municipal Accommodation Tax (MAT) fee, a percentage of which goes to the city. Fees that are present elsewhere only benefit the owners of the business itself, leading to these fees being criticized as deceptive. Some tourists have effectively fought the additional charge, while other businesses have enforced it as mandatory.

=== Comparison to Niagara Falls, New York ===
In the 20th century, there was a favourable exchange rate when comparing Canadian and U.S. currencies. 

Niagara Falls, New York, struggles to compete against Niagara Falls, Ontario; the Canadian side has a greater average annual income, a higher average home price, and lower levels of vacant buildings and blight, as well as a more vibrant economy and better tourism infrastructure. The population of Niagara Falls, New York fell by half from the 1960s to 2012. In contrast, the population of Niagara Falls, Ontario more than tripled.

The Ontario government introduced legal gambling to the local economy in the mid-1990s. Casino Niagara precipitated an economic boom in the late 1990s as numerous luxury hotels and tourist attractions were built, and a second casino, Niagara Fallsview, opened in 2004. Both attracted American tourists due in part to the comparatively less expensive Canadian dollar, and despite the opening of the Seneca Niagara Casino on the American side. When the Canadian and US currencies moved closer to parity in the 2000s, Niagara Falls, Ontario continued to be a popular destination for Americans, while Niagara Falls, New York, experienced a prolonged economic downturn. Ontario&#x27;s legal drinking age is 19, which attracts potential alcohol consumers from across the border, as the American drinking age is 21.

==Arts and culture==
Some cultural areas of Niagara Falls include Queen Street, Main and Ferry Streets, Stamford Centre and Chippawa Square. Community centres that are host to cultural activities include the City of Niagara Falls Museums, Niagara Falls Public Libraries, Coronation 50 Plus Recreation Centre, Club Italia and Scotia Bank Convention Centre.

Provincial roads (namely the Queen Elizabeth Way) are patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the rest by Niagara Regional Police (NRPS) for city streets and general policing or Niagara Parks Police (NPP) on property relating to Niagara Parks Commission. Policing on the Canadian side of bridges (Whirlpool and Rainbow Bridges) are conducted by both Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations, but may involve Niagara Regional Police and/or OPP, as well as US agencies. Michigan Central Railway Bridge is an inactive railway bridge; it is closed off by the Canadian Pacific Railways to prevent trespassing but can be accessed by NRPS or CBSA/CBP if required.

Niagara Falls is linked to major highways in Canada. The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), stretching from Fort Erie to Toronto, passes through Niagara Falls. Highway 420 (along with Niagara Regional Road 420) connect the Rainbow Bridge to the QEW. The Niagara Parkway is a road operated under the Niagara Parks Commission which connects Niagara-on-the-Lake to Fort Erie via Niagara Falls.

* The original routing of Highway 3 (later to become Highway 3A), which ended at the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge via River Road
* Highway 8, which ended at the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge via Bridge Street

===Rail===

Via Rail Canada and Amtrak jointly provide service to the Niagara Falls station via their &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; service between Toronto Union Station and New York Penn Station.
In summer 2009, GO Transit started a pilot project providing weekend and holiday train service from Toronto to Niagara Falls from mid June to mid October. These GO Trains run seasonally between Toronto Union Station and Niagara Falls at weekends.

At other times, regular hourly GO train services are provided between Toronto Union and Burlington station, where connecting bus services operate to and from the rail station at Niagara.

As of January 2019, GO Transit offers two-way, weekday commuter service from Niagara Falls station (Ontario) to Union Station (Toronto) as part of the Niagara GO Expansion. The full expansion project is expected to be complete by 2025.

<text>Detroit techno is a type of techno music that generally includes the first techno productions by Detroit-based artists during the 1980s and early 1990s. Prominent Detroit techno artists include Juan Atkins, Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Kevin Saunderson, Blake Baxter, Drexciya, Mike Banks, James Pennington and Robert Hood. Artists like Terrence Parker and his lead vocalist, Nicole Gregory, set the tone for Detroit&#x27;s piano techno house sound.

==The Belleville Three==

The three individuals most closely associated with the birth of Detroit techno as a genre are Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May, also known as the &quot;Belleville Three&quot;. The three, who were high school friends from Belleville, Michigan, created electronic music tracks in their basement(s). Derrick May once described Detroit techno music as being a &quot;complete mistake ... like George Clinton and Kraftwerk caught in an elevator, with only a sequencer to keep them company.&quot;

While attending Washtenaw Community College, Atkins met Rick Davis and formed Cybotron with him. Their first single &quot;Alleys of Your Mind&quot;, recorded on their Deep Space label in 1981, sold 15,000 copies, and the success of two follow-up singles, &quot;Cosmic Cars&quot; and &quot;Clear&quot;, led the California-based label Fantasy to sign the duo and release their album, &quot;Enter&quot;. After Cybotron split due to creative differences, Atkins began recording as Model 500 on his own label, Metroplex, in 1985. His landmark single, &quot;No UFO&#x27;s&quot;, soon arrived. Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Robert Hood also recorded on Metroplex. May said that the suburban setting afforded a different setting in which to experience the music. &quot;We perceived the music differently than you would if you encountered it in dance clubs. We&#x27;d sit back with the lights off and listen to records by Bootsy and Yellow Magic Orchestra. We never took it as just entertainment, we took it as a serious philosophy,&quot; recalls May.

The three teenage friends bonded while listening to an eclectic mix of music: Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Bootsy, Parliament, Prince, Depeche Mode, and The B-52&#x27;s. Juan Atkins was inspired to buy a synthesizer after hearing Parliament. Atkins was also the first in the group to take up turntablism, teaching May and Saunderson how to DJ.

Under the name Deep Space Soundworks, Atkins and May began to DJ on Detroit&#x27;s party circuit. By 1981, Mojo was playing the record mixes recorded by the Belleville Three, who were also branching out to work with other musicians. The trio traveled to Chicago to investigate the house music scene there, particularly the Chicago DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles. House was a natural progression from disco music, so that the trio began to formulate the synthesis of this dance music with the mechanical sounds of groups like Kraftwerk, in a way that reflected post-industrialist Detroit. An obsession with the future and its machines is reflected in much of their music, because, according to Atkins, Detroit is the most advanced in the transition away from industrialism.

Juan Atkins has been lauded as the &quot;Godfather of Techno&quot; (or &quot;Originator&quot;), while Derrick May is thought of as the &quot;Innovator&quot; and Kevin Saunderson is often referred to as the &quot;Elevator&quot;

==Futurism==
One of Techno’s innovators, Juan Atkins, references how P-funk, also known as Parliament-Funkadelic, was one of the first musical groups to influence his techno/futuristic sound and aesthetic (for example the group&#x27;s &quot;Mothership Connection&quot; stage-prop and album along with their unique cover art on other albums). The founding of Techno, being partially rooted in the intergalactic visions of funk, speaks to arguments from Schaub’s work that “‘Techno also represented an idealistic vision of music and a future culture that could exist free from the limitations, prejudice, and preconceptions that the Detroit urban environment manifested.” In this context, Techno strives not to fixate on gatekeeping the genre for Black people. Instead, its objective was to illuminate the role of music, vibrations, industrial sounds, and club culture to unify &quot;all&quot; people under the possession of techno music.

These early Detroit techno artists employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society. A notable exception to this trend was a single by Derrick May under his pseudonym Is , called &quot;Strings of Life&quot; (1987). This vibrant dancefloor anthem was filled with rich synthetic string arrangements and took the underground music scene by storm in May 1987. It &quot;hit Britain in an especially big way during the country&#x27;s 1987–1988 house explosion.&quot; It became May&#x27;s best known track, which, according to Frankie Knuckles, &quot;just exploded. It was like something you can&#x27;t imagine, the kind of power and energy people got off that record when it was first heard. &quot;

The club scene created by techno in Detroit was a way for suburban blacks in Detroit to distance themselves from &quot;jits&quot;, slang for lower class African Americans living in the inner city. &quot;Prep parties&quot; were obsessed with flaunting wealth and incorporated many aspects of European culture including club names like Plush, Charivari, and GQ Productions, reflecting European fashion and luxury, because Europe signified high class. In addition prep parties were run as private clubs and restricted who could enter based on dress and appearance. Party flyers were also an attempt to restrict and distance lower class individuals from the middle class club scene.

===Afrofuturism===
The three artists all contribute to the discourse of Afrofuturism through their re-purposing of technology to create a new form of music that appealed to a marginalized underground population. Especially within the context of Detroit, where the rise of robotics led to a massive loss of jobs around the time these three were growing up, technology is very relevant. The process &quot;took technology, and made it a black secret.&quot;

The sound is both futuristic and extraterrestrial, touching on the &quot;otherness&quot; central to Afrofuturist content. According to one critic, it was a &quot;deprived sound trying to get out.&quot; Tukufu Zuberi explains that electronic music can be multiracial and that critics should pay attention to &quot;not just sound aesthetics but the production process and institutions created by black musicians.&quot;

==The Music Institute==
Inspired by Chicago&#x27;s house clubs, Chez Damier, Alton Miller and George Baker started a club of their own in downtown Detroit, named The Music Institute at 1315 Broadway. The club helped unite a previously scattered scene into an underground &quot;family&quot;, where May, Atkins, and Saunderson DJed with fellow pioneers like Eddie &quot;Flashin&quot; Fowlkes and Blake Baxter. It allowed for collaboration, and helped inspire what would become the second wave of Detroit-area techno, which included artists whom the Belleville Three had influenced and mentored.

==Success abroad==
In 1988, due to the popularity of house and acid house music in Great Britain, Virgin Records talent scout Neil Rushton contacted Derrick May with a view to finding out more about the Detroit scene. To define the Detroit sound as being distinct from Chicago house, Rushton and the Belleville Three chose the word &quot;techno&quot; for their tracks, a term that Atkins had been using since his Cybotron days (&quot;Techno City&quot; was an early single).

==Recent work==
Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May remain active in the music scene today. In 2000, the first annual Detroit Electronic Music Festival was held. In 2004, May assumed control of the festival, renamed Movement. He invested his own funds into the festival, and &quot;got severely wounded financially.&quot; Kevin Saunderson helmed the festival, renamed FUSE IN, the following year. Saunderson, May, and Carl Craig all performed but did not produce the festival in 2006, when it was again called Movement. Saunderson returned to perform at the 2007 Movement as well.

==Politics==
The first wave of Detroit techno differed from the Chicago house movement, with the former originating in Detroit&#x27;s suburban black middle class community. Teenagers of families that had prospered as a result of Detroit&#x27;s automotive industry were removed from the kind of black poverty found in urban parts of Detroit, Chicago, and New York. This resulted in tensions in club spaces frequented by ghetto gangstas or ruffians where signs stating &quot;No Jits&quot; were common. Suburban middle class black youths were also attracted to Europhile culture, something that was criticized for not being authentically black. Schaub&#x27;s analysis of Underground Resistance valued &quot;speaking out of the perspective of the hood than about providing new visions of identity formation for people in the hood&quot;

Identity politics in Detroit techno is focused mostly on race relations. Throughout the creation of techno there was this constant and strong &quot;progressive desire to move beyond essentialized blackness&quot;. Even though the classist nature of techno avoided the artists and producers to separate themselves from the urban poor, especially in the first wave, it helped them make metropolitan spaces the subject of their own vision of different, alternative societies. These alternate societies aimed at moving beyond the concepts of race and ethnicity and blend all of them together. The early producers of Detroit techno state in multiple different occasions that the goal was to make techno just about music and not about race. As Juan Atkins said, &quot;I hate that things have to be separated and dissected [by race] ... to me it shouldn&#x27;t be white or black music, it should be just music&quot; 

==&quot;The New Dance Sound of Detroit&quot;==

The explosion of interest in electronic dance music during the late 1980s provided a context for the development of techno as an identifiable genre. The mid-1988 UK release of &quot;Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit&quot;, an album compiled by ex-Northern Soul DJ and Kool Kat Records boss Neil Rushton (at the time an A&amp;R scout for Virgin&#x27;s &quot;10 Records&quot; imprint) and Derrick May, was an important milestone and marked the introduction of the word &quot;techno&quot; in reference to a specific genre of music. Although the compilation put &quot;techno&quot; into the lexicon of British music journalism, the music was, for a time, sometimes characterized as Detroit&#x27;s high-tech interpretation of Chicago house rather than a relatively pure genre unto itself. In fact, the compilation&#x27;s working title had been &quot;The House Sound of Detroit&quot; until the addition of Atkins&#x27; song &quot;Techno Music&quot; prompted reconsideration. Rushton was later quoted as saying he, Atkins, May, and Saunderson came up with the compilation&#x27;s final name together, and that the Belleville Three voted down calling the music some kind of regional brand of house; they instead favored a term they were already using, &quot;techno&quot;.

==Second wave==
The first wave of Detroit techno had peaked in 1988–89, with the popularity of artists like Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Blake Baxter, and Chez Damier, and clubs like St. Andrews Hall, Majestic Theater, The Shelter, and the Music Institute. At the same time, Detroit techno benefited from the growth of the European rave scene and various licensing deals with labels in the UK, including Kool Kat Records. By 1989 May&#x27;s &quot;Strings of Life&quot; had achieved &quot;anthemic&quot; status. several years after its recording.

By the early 1990s, a second wave of Detroit artists started to break through, including, among others, Carl Craig, Underground Resistance (featuring Mike Banks, Jeff Mills, and Robert Hood), Blake Baxter, Jay Denham, and Octave One. According to music journalist Simon Reynolds, in the same period what began as a Europhile fantasy of elegance and refinement was, ironically, transformed by British and European producers into a &quot;vulgar uproar for E&#x27;d-up mobs: anthemic, cheesily sentimental, unabashedly drug-crazed.&quot; Detroit embraced this maximalism and created its own variant of acid house and techno. The result was a harsh Detroit hardcore full of riffs and industrial bleakness. Two major labels of this sound were Underground Resistance and +8, both of which mixed 1980s electro, UK synth-pop and industrial paralleling the brutalism of rave music of Europe.

Underground Resistance&#x27;s music embodied a kind of abstract militancy by presenting themselves as a paramilitary group fighting against commercial mainstream entertainment industry who they called &quot;the programmers&quot; in their tracks such as &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Elimination&quot;, &quot;Riot&quot; or &quot;Death Star&quot;. Similarly, the label +8 was formed by Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva which evolved from industrial hardcore to a minimalist progressive techno sound. As friendly rivals to Underground Resistance, +8 pushed up the speed of their songs faster and fiercer in tracks like &quot;Vortex&quot;.

On Memorial Day weekend of 2000, electronic music fans from around the globe made a pilgrimage to Hart Plaza on the banks of the Detroit River and experienced the first Detroit Electronic Music Festival. In 2003, the festival management changed the name to Movement, then Fuse-In (2005), and most recently, Movement: Detroit&#x27;s Electronic Music Festival (2007). The festival is a showcase for DJs and performers across all genres of electronic music, takes course over a period of three days, and is considered to be the best underground electronic music festival in the United States. There are also many events outside of the festival, including the largest afterparties at the Detroit Masonic Temple and another popular party at The Old Miami with a surprise line-up. Inter dimensional Transmissions also throws No Way Back yearly with a heavy rotation of resident/international artist.

<text>Oakville is a town and lower-tier municipality in Halton Region, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Lake Ontario between Toronto and Hamilton. At its 2021 census the town had a population of 213,759, with an estimated 233,700 people as of 2024, making it Ontario&#x27;s largest town. Oakville is part of the Greater Toronto Area and one of the most densely populated areas of Canada. According to the town, about 36% do not have English as their mother tongue, and land available for culture and recreation is over .

==History==
In 1793, Dundas Street was surveyed for a military road. In 1805, the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada bought the lands between Etobicoke and Hamilton from the indigenous Mississaugas people, except for the land at the mouths of Twelve Mile Creek (Bronte Creek), Sixteen Mile Creek, and along the Credit River. In 1807, British immigrants settled the area surrounding Dundas Street as well as on the shore of Lake Ontario.

In 1820, the Crown bought the area surrounding the waterways. The area around the creeks, , ceded to the Crown by the Mississaugas, was auctioned off to William Chisholm in 1827. He left the development of the area to his son, Robert Kerr Chisholm, and his brother-in-law, Merrick Thomas. Chisholm also formed shipbuilding business in Oakville Navy Street and Sixteen Mile Creek and lasted until 1842, but shipbuilding in Oakville lasted into the late 20th century.

The population in 1846 was 1,500. The community shipped large quantities of wheat and lumber via schooners and the railway. There were three churches, a grist mill and saw mill, and various small companies making threshing machines, wagons, watches, saddles, and metal goods. There were also tradesmen of various types.

Oakville&#x27;s industries also included shipbuilding. In the 1850s, there was an economic recession and the foundry, the most important industry in town, was closed. Basket-making became a major industry in the town, and the Grand Trunk Railway was built through it. In 1869, the population was 2,000. The community was served by the Great Western Railway and it was a port on Lake Ontario.

The town eventually became industrialized with the opening of Cities Service Canada (later BP Canada, and now Petro-Canada) and Shell Canada oil refineries (both now closed), the Procor factory (no longer manufacturing), and, most importantly, the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Canadian headquarters and plant, all close to the Canadian National Railway and the Queen Elizabeth Way highway between Toronto and Fort Erie (Buffalo).

In 1962, the town of Oakville merged with its neighbouring villages (Bronte, Palermo, Sheridan, and the remainder of Trafalgar Township) to become the new Town of Oakville, reaching northwards to Steeles Avenue in Milton. In 1973, the restructuring of Halton County into Halton Region brought the northern border southwards to just north of the future Highway 407.

<doc id="180190" wikidata="Q1941360" url="?curid=180190" title="Moana (1926 film)">
<text>Moana () is a 1926 American silent documentary film, or more strictly a work of docufiction, which was directed by Robert J. Flaherty, creator of &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; (1922).

==Production==

&quot;Moana&quot; was filmed in Samoa (then under the Western Samoa Trust Territory) in the villages of Safune district on the island of Savai&#x27;i. The name of the lead male character, &quot;Moana,&quot; means &#x27;deep sea, deep water&#x27; in the Samoan language. In making the film, Flaherty lived with his wife and collaborator Frances H. Flaherty and their three daughters in Samoa for more than a year. They arrived in Samoa in April 1923 and stayed until December 1924, with the film being completed in December 1925.

Hoping that Flaherty could repeat the success of &quot;Nanook&quot;, Paramount Pictures sent him to Samoa to capture the traditional life of the Polynesians on film. Flaherty reportedly arrived with 16 tons of filmmaking equipment. This included both a regular movie camera and a Prizma color camera, as Flaherty hoped to film some footage in that color process, but the Prizmacolor camera malfunctioned.

&quot;Moana&quot; is thought to be the first feature film made with panchromatic black-and-white film rather than the orthochromatic film commonly used at the time in Hollywood feature films. Flaherty developed his film as he went along, in a cave on Savai&#x27;i. In the process, he inadvertently poisoned himself and required treatment after he drank water from the cave that contained silver nitrate, which washed off the film stock. The silver nitrate also caused spots to form on the negative.

As in the earlier &quot;Nanook&quot; (and his later film, &quot;Man of Aran&quot;), Flaherty went well beyond recording the life of the people of Samoa as it happened. He followed his usual procedure of &quot;casting&quot; locals whom he considered potentially photogenic performers into &quot;roles&quot;, including creating fictitious family relationships.

He also, as in the other films, on occasion set up scenes in which exotic earlier practices were re-enacted as if still current. In &quot;Nanook&quot; and &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, it included setting up anachronistic hunting sequences. In &quot;Moana&quot;, at a time when Samoans were typically wearing modern Western-style clothing under the influence of Christian missionaries, Flaherty persuaded his performers to don traditional tapa cloth costumes (made from the bark of the paper mulberry tree, in a process shown in some detail in the film); the &quot;maidens&quot; went topless.

He also staged a coming-into-manhood ritual in which the young male lead underwent a painful traditional Samoan tattoo, for which the young man required a generous compensation. Those devices have led to Flaherty&#x27;s films sometimes being categorized as &quot;docufiction&quot;.

Still, it emerged that living off the land and the ocean in Samoa was comparatively easy, leaving limited scope for Flaherty to draw on his favored theme of &quot;Man against Nature&quot; as he had in &quot;Nanook&quot; and was to again in &quot;Man of Aran&quot;. Thus, although the film was visually stunning and drew critical praise at the time, it lacked the raw drama of &quot;Nanook&quot;, which may have contributed to its failure at the box office. (Bruce Posner, the film&#x27;s restorer, commented: &quot;God knows what Paramount expected. It was just poorly released. They tried to shift it into a love story of the South Seas, which it is, but not a conventional one.&quot;)

==Reception==
John Grierson coined the term &quot;documentary&quot; in his review for the film written under the name &quot;The Moviegoer&quot; in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; on February 8, 1926.

==Restoration==
The youngest of the children Robert and Frances Flaherty brought with them to Samoa was their then-three-year-old daughter Monica. In 1975, Monica Flaherty returned to Savai&#x27;i to create a soundtrack for her parents&#x27; hitherto-silent film, including recording ambient sounds of village life, dubbed Samoan dialogue and traditional singing. The resulting &quot;Moana with Sound&quot; was completed in 1980, with help from filmmakers Jean Renoir and Richard Leacock, and first shown publicly in Paris in 1981. At that stage, however, with the original negative no longer in existence, the visual quality of Monica Flaherty&#x27;s 16 mm print (a copy of a copy of her father&#x27;s original 35 mm nitrate film) left much to be desired, and it was to suffer further degradation with time. The 1981 version was not distributed, partly because of its visual flaws and partly because Monica Flaherty did not reach an agreement with Paramount over the proceeds.

More recently, preservationist and curator Bruce Posner and Finnish filmmaker Sami van Ingen, a great-grandson of the Flahertys, drew on the best surviving 35 mm copies of the film to prepare, with the assistance of restorer Thomas Bakels, a digitally restored print. This was matched by sound expert Lee Dichter to Monica Flaherty’s soundtrack. The restored &quot;Moana with Sound&quot; was shown at the New York Film Festival on September 30, 2014, and has also appeared, among other showings, at the National Archives in Washington DC (January 2015). The program for the New York Film Festival describes the restored version as &quot;absolutely wondrous&quot;.

<text>Michael Phillip Lerner (February 7, 1943 – August 28, 2024) was an American political activist, the editor of &quot;Tikkun&quot;, a progressive Jewish interfaith magazine based in Berkeley, California, and the rabbi of Beyt Tikkun Synagogue in Berkeley.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Michael Lerner was born in February 7, 1943, and grew up in the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey. In his youth, he attended Far Brook Country Day School, a private school that he characterized as having &quot;a rich commitment to interdenominational Christianity&quot;. While he has written that he appreciated &quot;the immense beauty and wisdom of the Christianity to which [he] was being exposed&quot;, he also felt religiously isolated, as the child of passionate Zionists who attended Hebrew school three times a week, while at the same time being heavily exposed to Christian-oriented cultural activities in school. At his own request, in the 7th grade he switched to a public school in the Weequahic neighborhood of Newark, where his peers were, in his estimation, 80% Jewish. He graduated from Weequahic High School in 1960. Lerner received a BA degree from Columbia University. In 1972 he earned a PhD in philosophy from University of California, Berkeley. In 1977 he received a PhD in Clinical/Social Psychology from the Wright Institute in Berkeley.

===Student activism===
While at Berkeley, Lerner became a leader in the Berkeley student movement and the Free Speech Movement, chair of the Free Student Union, and chair from 1966 to 1968 of the Berkeley chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). After teaching philosophy of law at San Francisco State University, he took a job as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Washington and taught ethics, social and political philosophy, philosophy of literature and culture, and introduction to philosophy.

Distressed over the disintegration of SDS in 1969, Lerner sought to re-organize New Left cadres formerly associated with SDS in a new organization called the Seattle Liberation Front (SLF) on January 19, 1970. While SLF did not publicly endorse violence as a political tactic, SLF members including Roger Lippman, Michael Justesen, and Susan Stern were also members of the Weather Underground, which had bombing attacks as a central part of its political strategy. After the &quot;Day After&quot; demonstration SLF had called on February 17, 1970 (to protest the verdicts in the Chicago Seven trial) turned violent, Lerner and others were arrested and charged with inciting a riot.

Lerner and his co-defendants became known as the &quot;Seattle Seven&quot;. During their trial, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover issued a public statement (repeated on radio and television) that described Lerner as &quot;one of the most dangerous criminals in America&quot;, even though he had never engaged in any act of violence. Federal agents testifying at the trial later admitted to having played a major role instigating the violence and ensuing riot.

The trial culminated in a courtroom brawl (during which Lerner was the only defendant to remain seated), and the presiding judge sent the defendants to jail on contempt of court charges. Lerner was transported to Terminal Island Federal Penitentiary in San Pedro, California, where he served several months before the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals overturned his conviction for contempt of court and ordered him released. The main charges relating to the riot were subsequently dropped by the federal government.

Meanwhile, the Washington State Legislature had passed a law, commonly referred to as the &quot;Lerner Act&quot;, that prohibited the University of Washington from hiring anyone &quot;who might engage in illegal political activity&quot;, and Lerner&#x27;s contract was not renewed. (The law was later overturned by the Washington Supreme Court).

During this period Lerner met several times with boxer Muhammad Ali, who was also active in the anti-war movement, at anti-war meetings organized by Lerner. Lerner recounts that Ali was the first practicing Muslim he had ever met. The two never met or spoke again after this period though in 1995 Lerner received a letter from Ali expressing appreciation for the book Lerner co-authored with Cornel West, &quot;Jews and Blacks: Let the Healing Begin&quot;. Muhammad Ali included an invitation to Lerner to speak at Ali&#x27;s memorial, to represent progressive Jewish faith, which took place in 2016. Lerner also learned from Ali&#x27;s lawyer that Ali had been a &quot;big fan&quot; of the rabbi&#x27;s work and that Ali was really sorry that he had not made more contact with Lerner over the past two decades. Ali and his wife had intended to do so many times and just hadn&#x27;t followed through.

===Professorship and research===
After completing his Ph.D. Lerner moved to Hartford, Connecticut where he served as professor of philosophy at Trinity College until 1975, when he moved back to Berkeley, joined the faculty at the University of California in the Field Studies program and taught law and economics until 1976 when he accepted a position at Sonoma State University for one year in sociology, teaching courses in social psychology. Meanwhile, he completed a second Ph.D. in 1977, this one in social/clinical psychology at the Wright Institute in Berkeley.

In 1976 Lerner founded the Institute for Labor and Mental Health to work with the labor movement and do research on the psychodynamics of American society. In 1979 he received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to train union shop stewards as agents of prevention for mental health disorders, and he simultaneously extended his previous study of the psychodynamics of American society. With a subsequent grant from the NIMH he studied American politics and reported that &quot;a spiritual crisis&quot; was at the heart of the political transformation of American society as well as at the heart of much of the psychic pain that was being treated in individual therapy.

His writing reflects a transposition of this analysis to economics too, viz. &quot;This focus on money and power may do wonders in the marketplace, but it creates a tremendous crisis in our society. People who have spent all day learning how to sell themselves and to manipulate others are in no position to form lasting friendships or intimate relationships... Many Americans hunger for a different kind of society—one based on principles of caring, ethical and spiritual sensitivity, and communal solidarity. Their need for meaning is just as intense as their need for economic security.&quot; :

===&quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine===
After serving for five years as dean of the graduate school of psychology at New College of California (now defunct) in San Francisco, Lerner and his then-wife Nan Fink created a general-interest intellectual magazine called &quot;Tikkun: A Bimonthly Jewish Critique of Politics, Culture and Society&quot;. &quot;Tikkun&quot; was started with the intention of challenging the Left for its inability to understand the centrality of religious and spiritual concerns in the lives of ordinary Americans.

With his associate editor Peter Gabel, Lerner developed a &quot;politics of meaning&quot;: that Americans hunger not only for material security but also for a life that is connected to some higher meaning, and that the failure of the liberal and progressive movements to win a consistent majority support was based on their inability to understand this hunger and to address it by showing Americans and middle income working people in other advanced industrial societies that it was the values of the competitive marketplace and its Bottom Line of money and power that is the fundamental source undermining ethical and spiritual values in the public sphere and then undermining friendships and marriages when these values are brought home into personal life.

This was intended to speak to the hunger for meaning that was characteristic of the thousands of people that Lerner and his colleagues were studying at the Institute for Labor and Mental Health. &quot;Tikkun&quot; was formed to educate the public about the findings of the Institute and to develop some of the implications of that work. However, because it also had an interest in being an &quot;alternative to the voices of Jewish conservatism,&quot; &quot;Tikkun&quot; was criticized by some Jewish groups.

In 1993, First Lady Hillary Clinton included the &quot;politics of meaning&quot; in her synthesis of political and social philosophy she was forming.

In 2002, Lerner organized a group called the Tikkun Community among readers of &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine and those who share its editorial vision.

===Rabbinical ordination===
Lerner received rabbinical ordination in 1995 through a beth din (rabbinical court) composed of three rabbis, &quot;each of whom had received orthodox rabbinic ordination&quot;. According to &quot;j. the Jewish news weekly&quot;, &quot;mainstream rabbinical leaders of the Reform, Conservative and Orthodox movements&quot; have questioned private ordinations such as Lerner&#x27;s, arguing that non-seminary ordinations risk producing poorly educated or fraudulent Rabbis. Similarly, some rabbis have challenged Lerner&#x27;s decision to not be trained for the rabbinate in a classical Jewish seminary (although Lerner did spend three years as a student at Jewish Theological Seminary). Lerner has been quoted in &quot;Jewish Weekly&quot; as saying that the non-seminary track is one that &quot;every Chabad rabbi takes, &amp; every ultra-Orthodox rabbi&quot;. Lerner pointed out that none of the rabbis in Jewish history ever attended a &quot;seminary&quot; until the middle of the 19th century, and that most rabbis in Israel today did not attend a seminary. They were ordained in the same manner, a Beth din composed of three rabbis. When Lerner attacked seminaries for being &quot;more interested in producing organizational men for Jewish life than spiritual leaders connected to the deepest spiritual and social-justice minds&quot;, Rabbi Alan Lew said &quot;That is arrogant nonsense ... I spent six years in extremely rigorous, round-the-clock study in the classic texts of our tradition. Authentic Jewish spirituality is in the texts, not in some fancy New Age ideas or watered-down kabbalah&quot;. Lerner&#x27;s synagogue &#x27;Beyt Tikkun&#x27; became an embodiment of what he described as &quot;neo-Hasidism,&quot; passionately pursuing the spiritual dimension of the prayers rather than rushing through them. The goal, he insisted, is to connect to God, not simply mouth every prayer in the prayerbook. His synagogue grew, according to members, not only because of Lerner&#x27;s willingness to take the social justice message of the prophets seriously, but also because the actual experience of being involved in prayer, meditation, singing and dancing in the synagogue became an ecstatic experience of transcendence for many of those who attended. Lerner&#x27;s 1994 book &quot;Jewish Renewal: A Path to Healing and Transformation&quot; published by HarperCollins (and in paperback as a Harper Perennial), became a national best-seller and brought thousands of young people into the emerging Jewish Renewal movement. After studying his background and qualifications, the Northern California Board of Rabbis accepted Lerner as a full member and he has remained a member ever since. Lerner was the first Jewish Renewal rabbi to achieve membership in a local American Board of Rabbis, but since that time in 1997, many local Boards of Rabbis have accepted Jewish Renewal rabbis into full membership.

Lerner was the spiritual leader of Beyt Tikkun synagogue in Berkeley, and a member of the Board of Rabbis of Northern California. He was also a member of Ohalah, the organization of Jewish Renewal Rabbis.

===Network of Spiritual Progressives===
In 2005 Lerner became chair of The Network of Spiritual Progressives whose mission was to &quot;challenge the materialism and selfishness in American society and to promote an ethos of love, generosity, and awe and wonder at the grandeur of the universe.&quot; They have since sponsored national conferences on both the East and West Coast. In 2007 Lerner launched a campaign for a &quot;Global Marshall Plan&quot;.

===Personal life, illness and death===
Lerner was married to Theirrie Cook until divorcing; he was then married to Nan Fink until divorcing in 1991, to Debora Kohn from 1998 until divorcing in 2014, and then to Cat Zavis in 2015, from whom he had separated in 2024. Lerner and Cook had a son.

In February 2009 Lerner publicly announced he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and mentioned this in many promotional mailings and published pieces. He was treated with surgery in March 2009, which was apparently successful.

Lerner died at his home in Berkeley on August 28, 2024, at the age of 81; he had congestive heart failure, and died through assisted suicide permitted by the California End of Life Option Act.

==Views==
===Positive Judaism===
Lerner was associated with and promoted Jewish Renewal, having received his &quot;semikhah&quot; from the movement&#x27;s founder, Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. Jewish Renewal is a small Jewish religious movement that Lerner described as &quot;positive Judaism&quot;, rejecting what he considered to be ethnocentric interpretations of the Torah. His publications promoted religious pluralism and progressive or liberal approaches to political problems. He was, for example, outspoken against xenophobia in the United States, and he attempted to build bridges with Christian, Buddhist and Muslim leaders around such issues.

Lerner&#x27;s call for a spiritual transformation of American society was first articulated in &quot;Tikkun&quot; and then in his book &quot;The Politics of Meaning&quot;. Lerner developed his ideas further in his books &quot;Spirit Matters&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; (2006).

Lerner strongly objected to Israel&#x27;s occupation of the West Bank. He supported the adoption of the 2003 Geneva Accords as a basis for an independent Palestinian state.

In February 2007, Lerner published a column entitled &quot;There Is No New Anti-Semitism,&quot; in which he criticized some American Jewish organizations for labeling critics of Israel as antisemites. He was especially critical of the Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which he characterized as &quot;Israel-can-do-no-wrong voices in American politics.&quot; Lerner wrote that this mentality, which frequently leads to accusations that Jews who oppose Israel&#x27;s policies toward the Palestinians are &quot;self-hating Jews,&quot; is alienating young Jews who &quot;say that they can no longer identify with their Jewishness.&quot;

===Controversy===
Lerner described some of his views as &quot;very controversial,&quot; particularly his views about building peace between Israel and Palestine. In 2003, the &quot;San Diego Jewish Journal&quot; described Lerner as &quot;the most controversial Jew in America,&quot; writing that &quot;He is relentlessly critical of Israel. He eulogizes Rachel Corrie. And he&#x27;s done more for peace than any conservative we know.&quot; That same year, the executive editor of &quot;The Jewish Exponent&quot; wrote that Lerner &quot;supports every measure against Israel short of its immediate destruction and often makes common cause with those who do plot the eradication of Israel&#x27;s Jews.&quot;

In 1997, former &quot;Tikkun&quot; editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory (&quot;Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say.&quot;), a few were critical (&quot;Have you gone off your rocker?&quot;). Lerner admitted that he had fabricated the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors&#x27; names were pseudonyms.

===Criticism of leftist antisemitism===
For many years, Lerner was an outspoken critic of modern antisemitism that he perceived to have arisen among some leftists. In 1992, he wrote &quot;The Socialism of Fools: Anti-Semitism on the Left&quot;, in which he described the manner in which the left often denies the existence of antisemitism, defended Zionism, and distinguished legitimate criticism of the State of Israel from Israel-bashing and antisemitism; and suggested ways in which progressives can fight antisemitism on the Left.

In 2003, Lerner criticized the left-wing anti-war ANSWER Coalition for the antisemitism that he and others believe is reflected in the rhetoric at ANSWER-sponsored demonstrations. He later claimed that because of his criticism, the ANSWER coalition—of which Lerner&#x27;s Tikkun community was a member—barred him from speaking at their rallies against the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

===Good Friday Prayer for the Jews===
Regarding the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, which allowed the re-introduction of the Tridentine Mass and the related Good Friday Prayer for the Jews, he said that the Pope took &quot;a powerful step toward the re-introduction of the process of demeaning Jews. You cannot respect another religion if you teach that those who are part of it must convert to your own religion.&quot;

== Beyt Tikkun Synagogue ==
Beyt Tikkun Synagogue is a Jewish Renewal congregation in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is a loosely organized, unconventional endeavor with a small physical base that is also described by its founder as a &quot;synagogue-without-walls&quot; that, since its founding, has served as a bully pulpit for Lerner.

===History===
Beyt Tikkun was founded in 1996 by Lerner and is loosely affiliated with his &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine. It describes itself as a &quot;hallachic community bound by Jewish law&quot;.

Beyt Tikkun has no building of its own, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it the &quot;synagogue-without-walls in San Francisco and Berkeley&quot;.

In 2010, Lerner, recovering from cancer, moved Beyt Tikkun closer to his Berkeley home: the East Bay, near the U.C. Berkeley campus.

===Controversies===
Beyt Tikkun found itself in the middle of controversies in 2005 and 2007 when it invited anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan to speak during Yom Kippur services.

Code Pink activist Rae Abliea addressed the synagogue—against the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip—on September 29, 2011.

==Awards and honors==
While at the Seminary, Lerner was elected national president of Atid, the college organization of the United Synagogue of America. Lerner was chosen by Utne Reader in 1995 as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;100 top visionaries&quot; along with Vaclav Havel and Noam Chomsky. In 2005 Lerner received the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Community Builders Prize from Morehouse College in Atlanta in recognition of his work in forging a &quot;progressive middle path that is both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine&quot; in his book &quot;Healing Israel/Palestine&quot; and in his writing in &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine. Tikkun magazine, which Lerner continues to edit, received from the mainstream media organization RNA The Religion Newswriters Association, the &quot;Best Magazine of the Year&quot; Award in both 2014 and 2015.

==Television appearances==
Lerner was a guest on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; several times. On March 5, 2006, he discussed his book, &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot;, on C-SPAN. Lerner was part of a panel of religious leaders on Meet the Press with Tim Russert on April 16, 2006. He was interviewed on Jewish reactions to the Christian Zionist movement of right-wing evangelical pastor John Hagee on the Bill Moyers PBS show on October 7, 2007.

Lerner delivered a eulogy at the memorial service for Muhammad Ali on June 10, 2016, praising Ali&#x27;s stances on social justice and calling for an end to antisemitism, homophobia, and Islamophobia. Lerner said, &quot;The way to honor the memory of Muhammad Ali is to be Muhammad Ali today in our own lives.&quot; &quot;Tell the leaders of Turkey to stop bombing and murdering their Kurd minority. Tell the U.S. to stop sending military supplies to Saudi Arabia, which is the sponsor of some of the most hate-filled teachings in the Islamic world and is one of the most repressive regimes on the face of the earth.&quot;

==Goldstone report and vandalism of Lerner&#x27;s home==
Lerner was one of a small group of Jewish leaders who supported Judge Richard Goldstone after Goldstone released his United Nations report that accused Israel and Hamas of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the winter 2009 Gaza War. After &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine announced that it would award Goldstone with its Tikkun Award, Lerner&#x27;s home was vandalized several times, with posters caricaturing him as a Nazi.

==Bibliography==
In 2024, Stanford University created an archive of Michael Lerner&#x27;s work.

<text>The Black Knight is a fictional character who first appeared as a minor antagonist in the 1975 comedy film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; by the Monty Python comedy troupe. A knight dressed in black who wears a helmet completely concealing his face, he is based on the black knight of the Arthurian legend. Like most of the characters in &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, he is played by a member of Monty Python, namely John Cleese, who primarily portrays Lancelot in the film.

The Black Knight appears in a single scene of &quot;Holy Grail&quot;, in which he guards a tiny bridge over a small stream and fights King Arthur, who wants to pass it; although a brave and skilled swordfighter, he is defeated by Arthur, who is soon bewildered by the knight&#x27;s staunch refusal to admit his obvious defeat. He also appears in the musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;, in which Christopher Sieber premiered the role in 2005.

==Overview==
In the film, King Arthur (Graham Chapman), accompanied by his squire Patsy (Terry Gilliam), is travelling through a forest when he observes a fight taking place between the Black Knight (John Cleese) and a Green Knight (also played by Gilliam) by a bridge over a small stream. The Black Knight defeats the Green one by throwing his sword straight through the eye slit of the Green Knight&#x27;s great helm.

Arthur congratulates the Black Knight and offers him a place at his court at the Round Table, but the Black Knight makes no response until Arthur moves to cross the bridge (in reality a small plank of wood). The Black Knight moves slightly to block Arthur and declares &quot;None shall pass&quot;. King Arthur objects, and the Black Knight threatens Arthur with death.

Reluctantly, King Arthur fights the Black Knight and, after a short battle, the Knight&#x27;s left arm is severed, and squirts out copious amounts of blood. The Knight refuses to stand aside, insisting &quot;&#x27;Tis but a scratch&quot;, and fights on. Next, his right arm is cut off, but the Knight still does not concede. As the Knight is disarmed, Arthur assumes the fight is over and kneels to pray. The Black Knight interrupts Arthur&#x27;s prayer by kicking him in the side of the head and accusing him of cowardice. Arthur chops off the Black Knight&#x27;s right leg. At this point, Arthur has lost all of his respect for the Knight, yet he still will not admit defeat, and attempts to ram his body into Arthur&#x27;s. Arthur is annoyed and sarcastically asks the Black Knight if he is going to bleed on him to win. With an air of resignation, Arthur finally cuts off the left leg as well. With the Black Knight now reduced to a simple torso with a head, he declares the fight a draw. Arthur then summons Patsy and &quot;rides&quot; away, leaving the Black Knight&#x27;s limbless torso screaming threats at him with a cracking voice.

==Behind the scenes==
According to the DVD audio commentary by Cleese, Michael Palin, and Eric Idle, the sequence originated in a story told to Cleese when he was attending an English class during his school days. Two Roman wrestlers were engaged in a particularly intense match and had been fighting for so long that the two combatants were doing little more than leaning into one another. It was only when one wrestler finally tapped out and pulled away from his opponent that he and the crowd realised the other man was, in fact, dead and had effectively won the match posthumously. The moral of the tale, according to Cleese&#x27;s teacher, was &quot;if you never give up, you can&#x27;t possibly lose&quot; – a statement that, Cleese reflected, always struck him as being &quot;philosophically unsound&quot;. The story would have been a deformed (or misremembered) description of the death of the Greek wrestler Arrhichion of Phigalia.

Cleese said that the scene would seem heartless and sadistic except for the fact that the Black Knight shows no pain and just keeps on fighting, or trying to, however badly he is wounded. Also, as the scene progresses and Arthur becomes increasingly annoyed, his dialogue lapses from medieval (&quot;You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine.&quot;) to modern (&quot;Look, you stupid bastard, you&#x27;ve got no arms left!&quot;), and finally to just plain sarcastic (&quot;What are you gonna do, bleed on me?&quot;), while the Black Knight remains just as defiant (&quot;I&#x27;m invincible!&quot; he yells with only one leg left, to which Arthur simply replies &quot;You&#x27;re a loony.&quot;).

This scene is one of the best-known of the entire film. A famous line of the scene, &quot;&#x27;Tis but a scratch&quot;, is similar to a line the character Mercutio speaks in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, wherein he demurs, saying &quot;Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch&quot;, referring to his mortal wound, and the former has since become an expression used to comment on someone who ignores a fatal flaw or problem. The phrase &quot;&#x27;Tis but a flesh wound&quot;, following a character entering &quot;with coconut shells tied to his feet&quot;, notably appeared in an early episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; titled &quot;The Giant Bombardon&quot;, broadcast in 1954; the Monty Python group has acknowledged being influenced by the Goons. A humorous reference to a potentially mortal injury being a &quot;flesh wound&quot; also appeared in the 1940 screwball comedy &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, in response to a maid being reported shot by a sheriff&#x27;s deputy.

===Performance difficulty===
The Knight was, in fact, played by two actors: John Cleese is in the Knight&#x27;s armour until he is down to one leg. The Knight is then played by a real one-legged man, a local by the name of Richard Burton, a blacksmith who lived near the film shoot (not to be confused with Richard Burton, the Welsh actor of the same name), because, according to the DVD commentary, Cleese could not balance well on one leg. After the Knight&#x27;s remaining leg is cut off, the quadruple-amputee that remains is again Cleese.

In the musical &quot;Spamalot&quot;, the scene with the Black Knight was the most difficult to play on stage, according to Eric Idle. Penn &amp; Teller created the illusion for the musical.

<text>The black knight is a literary stock character who masks his identity and that of his liege by not displaying heraldry. Black knights are usually portrayed as villainous figures who use this anonymity for misdeeds. They are often contrasted with the knight-errant (white knight). The character appeared in Arthurian literature and has been adapted and adopted by various authors, in cinema and popular culture. The character is sometimes associated with death or darkness.

==Historical figures==

He served as a soldier and diplomat under the Polish king Władysław II Jagiello and Hungarian-Bohemian king Sigismund of Luxembourg. During his life, he was regarded as a model of knightly virtues and was renowned for winning multiple tournaments in Europe.

Then the damosel, when she saw that knight, she bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled. Gramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With that the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel, have ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay, fair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in King Arthur&#x27;s kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in such array? it is shame that he beareth you company.&quot;

==Finance==
In business, a white knight is a friendly investor or savior, while a black knight functions as a destroyer. Typically, a black knight will enter a business or company as an influential person such as a major investor or as a member of the board of directors and will dismantle a profitable or asset-rich business to enrich themselves, which typically leaves the previously profitable company in a weaker financial position.

Such black knights achieve their aims by:
* siphoning out cash through high personal expenses, salaries and bonuses
* selling off profitable parts of the business to a private company related to the black knight
* buying unprofitable businesses / assets previously owned by the black knight
* selling assets at below market value to persons related to the black knight
* buying assets at inflated prices

Occasionally, the term &quot;black knight&quot; describes an investor who acquires a firm in opposition to the will of its management, as in a hostile takeover. The label may not be accurate if the ultimate intention of the acquirer is unknown. It could be for commercial reasons (rather than personal reasons), such as merging the entity with another entity owned by the acquirer to promote synergy.

<doc id="180200" wikidata="Q8118" url="?curid=180200" title="1912 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1912 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad () and commonly known as Stockholm 1912, were an international multi-sport event held in Stockholm, Sweden, between 6 July and 22 July 1912. The opening ceremony was held on 6 July.

Twenty-eight nations and 2,408 competitors, including 48 women, competed in 102 events in 14 sports. With the exception of tennis (starting on 5 May) and football and shooting (both starting on 29 June), the games were held within a month with an official opening on 6 July. It was the last Olympics to issue solid gold medals and, with Japan&#x27;s debut, the first time an official team from an Asian nation participated. Stockholm was the only bid for the games, and was selected in 1909.

The games were the first to have art competitions, women&#x27;s diving, women&#x27;s swimming, and the first to feature both the decathlon and the new pentathlon, both won by the American Jim Thorpe. Electric timing was introduced in athletics, while the host country disallowed boxing. Figure skating was rejected by the organizers because they wanted to promote the Nordic Games.
The United States won the most gold medals (26), while hosts Sweden won the most medals overall (65). These were the final Olympic Games for eight years due to the disruption of the First World War. The next Olympic Games were held in 1920 in Antwerp.

==Host selection==
Following the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, authorities in Sweden immediately sought to ensure that the next games would be held there. There were two Swedish members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the time, Viktor Balck and Clarence von Rosen. The pair proposed the idea to the Swedish governing bodies of athletics and gymnastics in order to ensure that they backed any potential bid. Support was given by the national associations on 18 April 1909 for a bid to host the Olympics in Stockholm on the basis that suitable financial arrangements could be made. King Gustaf V was petitioned on 6 May 1909 following the publication of preliminary plans for the Stockholm bid that the expected cost of hosting the Games would be 415,000 kronor (£23,050 or $115,250). The Government accepted the petition on behalf of the King and supported the bid.

On 28 May, at the meeting of the IOC in Berlin, the Swedish representatives declared that they had full financial support for hosting the next Games in Stockholm. A deal was made with the German IOC representative on the basis that Berlin would host the 1916 Summer Olympics. Pierre de Coubertin spoke at the meeting about his concerns that Sweden should ensure that the Games take place, as he did not want a repeat of the problems with Great Britain hosting the 1908 Games. He also expressed a desire that &quot;the Games must be kept more purely athletic; they must be more dignified, more discreet; more in accordance with classic and artistic requirements; more intimate, and, above all, less expensive.&quot; The Games were duly awarded to Sweden to host in Stockholm as the only nominated host city for the 1912 Summer Olympics.

==Organization==
The news that Stockholm was to host the 1912 Olympics was received with enthusiasm by the Swedish public. The organizing committee took de Coubertin&#x27;s words to heart, and aimed to achieve an Olympic Games which removed those elements which detracted from earlier Games. The committee was elected in the autumn of 1909, with Balck voted as the President of the committee, and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf selected as Honorary President. The committee&#x27;s first meeting took place on 7 October, and on 11 October they delegated the arrangements for the individual branches of sports to the relevant governing bodies in Sweden. There were four exceptions to this, with the game shooting, modern pentathlon and mountain ascents retained by the Olympic committee, and the horse riding competitions being organized by Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, who was the inspector of the Swedish cavalry. Altogether there were 187 members of these committees.

The official invitation to compete in the Games was issued on 18 November 1910 to 27 countries, either directly or through their representative on the IOC. A further 15 countries were to have been invited, but as they had no IOC representatives, the Swedish authorities were unsure how to proceed. Once the organizing committee for the Games received confirmation of the athletic associations in each of the 15 countries, they too were sent invitations. Some 61,800 entry forms were printed for the use of the various nations.

Free transport was arranged for the invited nations&#x27; equipment, and a discount of 50 percent was arranged for competitors and delegates on the state run railway. A daily newspaper which only covered the Olympics was arranged to be published during the Games, in both English and Swedish. Further arrangements were made for the general arrival of visitors in order to entertain them whilst they were not at the Games; a pleasure garden was opened north of the Olympic Stadium, and a series of indoor tennis courts were converted into a restaurant.
==Venues==


Twelve sports venues were used in the 1912 Summer Olympics. This marked the first time that more than one venue would be used for the football tournament, which has been the case ever since. Stockholm Olympic Stadium served as one of the equestrian venues for the 1956 Summer Olympics. Råsunda Stadium served as a venue for the 1958 FIFA World Cup and the 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. In the initial bid document it was identified that a new stadium would be needed, initially envisaged as being located in the Östermalm Athletic Grounds. In order to save funds, it was expected that only one of the stadium&#x27;s stands would be permanent, with the other three made of wood and dismantled following the Games. The cost of that stadium was estimated at 235,000 Kronor. Arrangements were made with the individual national committees to provide the use of Östermalm Athletic Grounds and Traneberg.

The cycling road race was held around Mälaren, the third largest lake in Sweden. The water events, including the swimming and the rowing, were held at Djurgårdsbrunnsviken, where a stadium was built. Kaknäs was already used as a shooting range, but alterations were needed to accommodate shooting events. Although it was not used as the Olympic stadium as originally intended, Östermalm hosted the lawn tennis and fencing competitions after a tennis pavilion was moved there from another location.

Five other locations were considered in addition to the Östermalm Athletic Grounds to locate the Olympic Stadium. The Stockholm Olympic Stadium was built on the site of the former Stockholm Athletic Grounds in order to retain the other locations for other uses during the Games. By placing it to the north of the city, the Olympic Stadium was within the immediate vicinity of other pre-existing sporting venues. Initial funding was given to the sum of 400,000 Kr for a timber stadium but Torben Grut, the architect, also drew up alternative plans for a stone stadium. Following discussions with the Swedish Central Association for the Application of Athletics, it was decided that the stone version should be built, and further funds were made available through a national lottery once guarantees were made that no further funding was to be asked for in order to build the stadium. However it was found that the original estimate for the stone stadium would still be too expensive, and the plans were once more modified in order to simplify the design and reduce costs. An agreement was entered into with a contractor on 2 November 1910 that it would be transferred complete by 25 May 1912.

==Opening ceremony==

The Games of the V Olympiad were opened on 6 July 1912. The Swedish Royal Family left Stockholm Palace at 10:40am, and were received at the Olympic Stadium by members of the IOC. Three thousand competing athletes had already assembled in the nearby Östermalm Athletic Grounds, and began to enter the stadium in alphabetical order by nation according to the Swedish spelling. The Swedish team entered last, but unlike the later tradition, the Greek team did not enter first.

A hymn was sung, a traditional Swedish chant was conducted and prayers were read first in Swedish and then in English. Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf addressed the King on behalf of the Swedish Olympic Association. King Gustav V then declared the Games officially open by a long speech:

Afterwards a trumpet fanfare was played and the Crown Prince called for cheers for the King. The athletes in their national groups marching out of the stadium in order ended the ceremony.

==Events==

The Swedish delegation at the IOC meeting in Berlin on 28 May 1909 had proposed a simple Olympic schedule containing only &quot;pure&quot; athletics, swimming, gymnastics and wrestling. However other countries requested that the schedule be more comprehensive, and with that in mind they put forward a further programme at the IOC meeting in 1911 which was met with approval. The sports which were added were the tug of war, cycling, fencing, football, horse riding, lawn tennis, rowing, shooting, skating and yacht racing. The question of adding skating to the programme was discussed once more on 7 February 1910, with the decision being made to drop it from the schedule. It was felt to be unsuitable because it was a winter sport, and it was to be part of the Nordic Games the following year. Boxing was removed from the programme as it was unappealing to the Swedes. Art competitions were considered at a further meeting on 14 February 1910, and were subsequently added to the programme, but now art competitions are no longer regarded as official Olympic events by the International Olympic Committee.
As a result, now the 1912 Summer Olympics programme considered composed of 14 sports encompassing 18 disciplines and 102 events. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

Baseball, Glima (as the second Olympic demonstration of the sport after 1908 Summer Olympics) and Gotland sports were unofficial demonstration sports. This was also the first year art competitions were held at the Olympics.

===Athletics===
The athletic events saw the introduction of a fully automatic timing system developed by R. Carlstedt. It involved attaching electromagnets to chronometers in a system which attached a control lamp to the starting gun for each race. This resulted in the firing of the gun starting a timer which was then stopped by one of the judges at the finishing line. The final of the men&#x27;s 100 metres was expected to be a mostly American affair, and it ended up with six athletes, only one of whom was not from the United States. It suffered from seven false starts before the athletes finally got away, with Ralph Craig winning the gold medal by in front of second place Alvah Meyer. Donald Lippincott won bronze, 15 cm behind the second man.

Kanakuri Shizō, a Japanese marathon runner, went missing during the race. He lost consciousness by heatstroke and a farming family helped him to stop at a party taking place in a villa on the marathon route in order to quench his thirst, then caught a train to Stockholm and left the country the next day. He returned to Japan without notifying race officials. 50 years later, after being invited back by the Swedish authorities, he completed the race with an (unofficial) time of 54 years, 8 months, 6 days, 8 hours, 32 minutes and 20.3 seconds. Portuguese Francisco Lázaro died from heat exhaustion while running the marathon, the only athlete to die during the running of an Olympic marathon.

American Jim Thorpe won the pentathlon and the newly created decathlon. Thorpe&#x27;s gold medals were stripped by the International Olympic Committee in 1913, after the IOC learned that Thorpe had taken expense money for playing baseball, violating contemporary Olympic amateurism rules, before the 1912 Games. This moved everyone else up in the rankings. In 1982, the IOC was convinced that the disqualification had been improper, as no protest against Thorpe&#x27;s eligibility had been brought within the required 30 days, and reinstated Thorpe&#x27;s medals. The replicas were presented to his children in 1983, 30 years after Thorpe&#x27;s death. Finally, in 2022, the IOC posthumously declared Thorpe as the sole winner of the pentathlon and decathlon events after extensive consultations with his former competitors&#x27; families who said they had always viewed Thorpe as the winner.

New Olympic records were set in the majority of track and field events, with only the men&#x27;s 200 metres, 10 km walk, standing high jump, standing broad jump, hop, step and jump, and the hurdle competitions failing to have new records set. Tell Berna captured a gold for the 3000m and Henry S. &quot;Harry&quot; Babcock took gold for the pole vault, setting an Olympic Record at 3.95m. Hannes Kolehmainen was the most successful in setting records at the games, with new Olympic Records set in the 5,000, 10,000 metre and cross country races.

===Cycling===

The cycling events at the 1912 Games were limited to a road race around Lake Mälaren, which had already been a successful route for a yearly cycling race. Although not originally in the schedule, several countries requested that track cycling be added; however, the organizing committee stuck by their plans not to build a new track cycling stadium as the only one in Stockholm had been destroyed in order for the Olympic Stadium to be built. In addition, Germany had specifically requested Cycle-Polo and Figure-Cycling to be added to the programme, both of which requests were turned down by the committee.

It was decided to hold the road race as a time trial, and to outlaw any non-competitive cyclists acting as pacemakers. Nineteen nations entered 151 athletes into the competition, which was a greater number than expected by the committee. The largest group was from Great Britain, who had entered twelve competitors from England, another twelve from Scotland, and a further nine from Ireland. The race began on 7 July, with the athletes leaving in groups. The first group left at 2am, with the remaining groups leaving at intervals of two minutes. The distance raced was , with South African Rudolph Lewis winning the gold medal in the individual race. Frederick Grubb of Great Britain won the silver medal, and Carl Schutte of the United States won the bronze. However, the average positions of the Swedish team were better than their competitors&#x27;, and so the Swedish team won the gold medal for the team competition. The silver and bronze medals followed the individual victories, going to Great Britain and the United States respectively – giving Grubb and Schutte a second medal each of the same varieties.

===Diving===
All of the medals in the men&#x27;s competitions were split between the diving teams of the Sweden and Germany. The men&#x27;s high dive was a Swedish white out, with Swedish divers taking all three medal positions. Erik Adlerz took the gold medal, and proceeded to take the gold medal for Sweden in the 10 metre platform too. Albert Zürner took the silver for Germany, and Gustaf Blomgren won the bronze medal for Sweden. Another white out occurred in the 3 metre springboard with all three medals going to the German team, with Paul Günther taking gold, Hans Luber in the silver medal position and Kurt Behrens in bronze. A 10-metre platform event also took place for women, with Sweden taking two more medals, Greta Johansson in gold and Lisa Regnell in silver. Great Britain&#x27;s Isabelle White won the bronze medal. The remaining finalists were all from Sweden.

===Equestrian===

Equestrian made its first appearance at a modern Olympics in the 1912 Games. Although competitions involving horse riding had been included in the programme of 1900, this was the first appearance of modern Olympic staples such as dressage, eventing and show jumping. It was expected that the competitors would be military personnel as they would have had the cavalry experience to compete. The competition was split between the military competitions, prize riding and prize jumping.

In the military competition, seven countries put forward competitors for the individual and team eventing. Each nation put forward four athletes with the exception of Denmark, which only put forward three. Some of the countries also nominated reserves in addition to their main athletes. The total length of the course was with the start and finish both in the grounds of the Field Riding Club. The heat was such on the day of the event that competitors lost as much as in weight. Swede Axel Nordlander won the individual competition, and led the Swedish eventing team to victory as well, earning himself two gold medals. In second place in the individual competition was German Friedrich von Rochow, who also earned a second silver medal as the team from Germany placed second overall. Only the bronze medals were split up between nationalities, with the American team including Guy Vernor Henry, Jr. taking the bronze for the team event, while Frenchman Jacques Cariou won the individual medal.

Two additional countries entered for the dressage, although only Sweden entered the maximum number of competitors. The event resulted in Sweden taking all three medals, with the gold going to Carl Bonde, the silver to Gustaf Adolf Boltenstern and the bronze to Hans von Blixen-Finecke. The individual show jumping competition was the only individual equestrian event at the 1912 Olympics in which Sweden won no medals, with the gold medal instead going to Cariou of the French to add to his bronze medal from the dressage, Rabod von Kröcher taking the silver for Germany, and Emmanuel de Blommaert winning the bronze for Belgium. The team event saw Sweden take another gold medal, with the French team second and the German team, featuring Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, in the bronze medal position.

===Fencing===

The foil competition became a full Olympic event, having appeared at the 1908 Games as a demonstration sport. Nedo Nadi and Pietro Speciale of Italy took the gold and silver medals respectively, and Richard Verderber of Austria placed third. There were individual and team events in both épée and sabre. The épée team event saw Belgium take the gold medal and Great Britain and the Netherlands in second and third place respectively. A member of the Belgian team went on to take the individual title as well, with Paul Anspach taking the gold medal. Ivan Joseph Martin Osiier of Denmark took the silver medal, and another Belgian who was not in the team event, Philippe le Hardy de Beaulieu, won the bronze medal.

The sabre competition was dominated by the competitors from Hungary, with their team taking the gold medal over Austria and the Netherlands. The individual competition saw a shut out by Hungarian athletes with Jenő Fuchs winning the overall competition, Béla Békessy in second and Ervin Mészáros in third.

===Football===
Thirteen countries signalled their intention to enter football teams for the 1912 Olympics. A standard cup tie system was implemented, with the final deciding the gold and silver medallists and a third/fourth position playoff deciding the bronze medal winner. Only FIFA affiliated teams were allowed to take part, with the public draw for the tournament taking place on 18 June 1911. The tournament itself started on 29 June. In the first round Finland defeated Italy 3–2, Austria beat Germany 5–1 and the Netherlands emerged victorious over Sweden 4–3. The team from Great Britain, who had won the gold medal at the 1908 Summer Games, were given a bye to the second round, where they faced Hungary and won 7–0. Finland also won their match, defeating Russia 2–1. Denmark matched the British scoreline, winning 7–0 against Norway, and the Netherlands won against Austria 3–1.

The semi final matches pitted Great Britain against Finland, where they won 4–0, and Denmark against the Netherlands, ending in a 4–1 victory for Denmark. The Netherlands won the third/fourth place playoff by the biggest scoreline of the tournament, beating Finland 9–0. Later on the same day the final was played in the Olympic Stadium, where Great Britain retained its gold medal against Denmark in front of 25,000 spectators. Goals from Harold Walden, Arthur Berry and two from Gordon Hoare helped Britain to win by a margin of 4–2.

===Gymnastics===

The gymnastic competition at the 1912 Games featured a single individual competition and three team events in addition to a variety of displays by the various teams. The Swedish team naturally won the Gymnastics event of the Swedish system, referred to in the programme as &quot;Team Competition I&quot;, with fellow Scandinavian teams Denmark and Norway taking the second and third positions. The all around team competition came second, with Italy taking the gold. In addition, one of the Italian team members, Alberto Braglia, won the individual gold for the same event. Louis Ségura of the French team won the individual silver, while another member of the Italian team, Adolfo Tunesi, won the individual bronze. The all around team competition saw Hungary take the silver medal and the team from Great Britain in third place. The final team competition allowed for a free choice of movements and apparatus. This was another all Scandinavian affair, with the Norwegian team emerging victorious, Finland in second and Denmark in the bronze medal position.

===Modern pentathlon===
Modern pentathlon was competed for at the 1912 Games, marking its first appearance in the Olympics. It was for these games that the five events of shooting, swimming, equestrian, fencing and cross country running were decided to make up the pentathlon. The competition was spread out across five days from 7 through to 12 July, ending with the cross country race. Only men participated in the event, although a woman named Helen Preece was briefly enrolled to compete until the organizing committee ultimately denied her entry.

For the shooting element, each competitor was allowed to bring their own pistol. The American competitor George S. Patton (later better known as the Second World War US Army General) used a .38 caliber Colt revolver, while the Danish competitors preferred the Danish Army service pistol, the Bergmann–Bayard, the Germans and Norwegians used the Luger P08 pistol and the Swedes used a target practice pistol by Smith &amp; Wesson. The shooting part of the competition was won by Gösta Åsbrink, with Georg de Laval and Gösta Lilliehöök in second and third place respectively, all three representing Sweden.

The swimming event was three lengths, each of , with the athletes split into eight heats and times going forward to calculate positions. Ralph Clilverd of Great Britain won this event, with Edmond Bernhardt of Austria in second and de Laval in third. The fencing competition saw each competitor face off against each other. Several opponents were noted for their particular skill in the event with Åke Grönhagen of Sweden coming first with 24 wins, Jean de Mas Latrie of France second with 23, Sidney Stranne of Sweden in third with 21 and Patton of the United States close behind with 20. Thirteen of the competitors cleared the equestrian course without any penalties, with Grönhagen winning the event, Bror Mannström of Sweden in second and de Laval third.

The cross country run was over 4,000 metres and started in the Olympic Stadium itself. The event was run as a time trial with competitors leaving one minute apart. As this was the final event, the winning competitors were announced after the race, with Lilliehöök winning the gold medal, Åsbrink taking silver and de Laval, bronze. The highest placed non-Swedish competitor was Patton, who finished fifth.

===Rowing===

The rowing events at the 1912 Olympics did not prove popular with the public. This was put down to the &quot;fatigue&quot; of the public due to the volume of sporting events. The eight competition was split into heats, with two teams in each heat. The two British crews were lucky not to be drawn against each other, with the team from Leander Club facing New College, Oxford in the final. Leander won by a length with a time of 6:15. The coxed four followed a similar format to the eights, with the German team from Ludwigshafener Ruderverein defeating Britain&#x27;s Thames Rowing Club in the final.

The competition for the coxed four, inriggers was much smaller, with only four nations competing. The Danish team defeated Sweden in the final. The single sculls heats proved controversial with the first round race between Mart Kuusik and Alfred Heinrich being re-run after a protest by Heinrich. In addition, Cecil McVilly was disqualified in the first round after colliding with the boat of Martin Stahnke. Wally Kinnear of Great Britain defeated Polydore Veirman of Belgium in the final, with Kinnear winning the matchup easily.

===Sailing===

The yachts for the sailing competition assembled at Nynäshamn on 19 July, along with the other vessels that were to take part in an Olympic regatta. The racing itself started the following day with the 12 metre class. There were only three nations and yachts competing in this event, the hosts Sweden, as well as Norway and Finland. Norway won the gold medal, Sweden the silver and Finland came in last place, winning bronze. The 10 metre class had the same number of countries entering it, although this time Sweden entered two yachts and Russia competed instead of Norway. The Swedish yacht &quot;Kitty&quot; was the winning vessel, with the Finnish boat in second and the Russians coming third.

A slightly improved field was featured in the 8 metre class, with four countries entering two yachts each. The medals were awarded to exactly the same nations as the 12 metre class, another all Scandinavian affair. The 6 metre class saw the most diverse field of any of the sailing events at the 1912 Olympics: six countries entered a total of nine yachts. France and Denmark competed in their only sailing event, along with Sweden, sending two yachts each. Those three nations were the successful in the event, with the French yacht &quot;Mac Miche&quot; taking the gold, the Danish &quot;Nurdug II&quot; taking silver and the Swedish &quot;Kerstin&quot; placing third.

===Shooting===

There were eighteen shooting events at the 1912 Olympics, of which eight were team events. The competition was split predominantly into three sections: military rifle shooting, shooting with miniature rifles, pistols and revolvers, and clay bird and running deer shooting. The Swedish and American competitors were the most successful at the competition, with seven gold medals each, although Sweden won a total of seventeen medals while the United States team won fourteen. 64-year-old Oscar Swahn, part of the Swedish single shot running deer team, is still the oldest gold medal winner in Olympic history.

===Swimming===
In swimming, Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku won the 100 metre freestyle for the United States, who also saw Harry Hebner win gold in the 100 metre backstroke. The Canadian team also took two gold medals, both by George Hodgson in the 400 and 1,500 metre events. The German swimming team won all three medals in the 200 metre breaststroke, with the gold going to Walter Bathe, who won a further gold in the 400 metre breaststroke. The Australasian team was victorious in the men&#x27;s relay, with the United States finishing in the silver medal position and Great Britain placing third.

The 1912 Games saw the implementation of swimming events for women, with the 100 metre freestyle and 400 metre team relay taking place. Fanny Durack won the individual contest, breaking the world record for the distance in the fourth heat. Her fellow Australian Mina Wylie won the silver medal, and Jennie Fletcher of Great Britain came third to take the bronze medal. The British team had further success in the women&#x27;s relay, winning the team relay with the German team in second place and the Austrian team in third. Because only four countries entered the relay there were no heats; only a final was held. The United States did not field a women&#x27;s team. New Olympic Records were set in all swimming events at the 1912 Games.

===Tennis===

Tennis on covered courts was agreed initially for the 1912 Games, with competitions run for gentlemen&#x27;s singles and doubles, ladies&#x27; singles, and mixed doubles. The outdoor tournament was confirmed once the Östermalm Athletic Grounds were completed in late 1911, with the plans modified to have both indoor and outdoor tournaments.

Six countries sent players for the covered court competitions, with representatives from Sweden, Great Britain, Denmark, France, Australasia, and Bohemia appearing. Included in this lineup was Australasia&#x27;s only competitor, Anthony Wilding from New Zealand, who was also the reigning Wimbledon gentlemen&#x27;s champion. The indoor knockout competition started on 5 May, and continued as expected until the semi-final round where Wilding was beaten by Britain&#x27;s Charles P. Dixon. The British player met Frenchman André Gobert in the final, but Gobert was victorious over the Englishman in straight sets. Wilding took the bronze medal in a playoff against another British player, Arthur Lowe.
The outdoors tennis competition saw 70 players enter from 12 nations. However, Great Britain did not enter any competitors as the dates of the outdoor competition clashed with the 1912 Wimbledon Championships, despite attempts by the British authorities to convince the Olympic organizing committee to change the dates. Other noted tennis players refused to compete at the Olympics and instead attended Wimbledon. The gold and silver medals in the gentlemen&#x27;s singles ended up being decided between two South Africans, with Charles Winslow and Harold Kitson playing each other. Winslow won the match and the gold medal, 7–5, 4–6, 10–8, 8–6. The duo also competed as a pair in the gentlemen&#x27;s doubles and took the gold medal, beating the Austrians Felix Pipes and Arthur Zborzil. Marguerite Broquedis of France defeated Dorothea Koring of Germany in the ladies&#x27; singles for the gold medal. In the mixed doubles Koring teamed up with Heinrich Schomburgk to win the gold, the duo defeating Sigrid Fick and Gunnar Setterwall of Sweden in the final.

===Tug of war===
The tug of war competition was scheduled to take place between 7 and 12 July, with two matches taking place each day. However, out of the five countries which elected to enter the competition, only two actually appeared. Great Britain arrived for its match against Bohemia, but the opposition team was nowhere to be found. Britain was duly declared the winner. The same thing happened once more for the second match, with the Swedish team, made up of policemen from Stockholm, arriving to find that the Austrian team had not arrived. Sweden was announced as the winners of the match in the Austrians&#x27; absence.

On the second day of the competition, Great Britain took on Sweden, the only occasion where both teams actually turned up for the bout. The British team were made up of the winners of the gold medal in the same event at the 1908 Games, with the exception of John Sewell and Mathias Hynes. As the British team also consisted of policemen, the bout ended up effectively being between the City of London Police and the Stockholm Police, with the Swedish team winning 2–0. Due to the non-appearance of the team from Luxembourg, that one match ended up being the entire tug of war event at the 1912 Olympics. Sweden was awarded the gold medal and Great Britain the silver.

===Water polo===

The water polo tournament was set up on a modified elimination system as there were six teams entered. The first round saw the British team defeating the Belgian team, Sweden defeating the French team and Austria defeating Hungary. Lots were drawn to determine which match would take place in the second round as there were three teams left in the competition. Great Britain were drawn to face Sweden, who they defeated. Austria automatically qualified for the final against the winner of the Britain-Sweden matchup. Great Britain won the gold medal in the event, defeating Austria 8–0. Playoff matches were then played between each pair of defeated teams in order to decide the second and third places. Sweden and Belgium played off after a further three matches to decide the silver and bronze medal positions, with Sweden emerging victorious 4–2.

===Wrestling===
The nations at the 1912 Games entered a total of 267 wrestlers, although the actual competitors who appeared in Sweden were fewer, with 171 actually turning up to compete. Greco-Roman wrestling was the only style of wrestling competed for at the Games. The bouts took place in the open air in an area of the Olympic stadium, with the wrestlers split according to weight into five divisions: featherweight, lightweight, middleweight A (later referred to as middleweight), middleweight B (later referred to as light heavyweight) and heavyweight.

The skills of the competitors from Finland were noted in the featherweight competition, with Kaarlo Koskelo taking the gold medal, while German Georg Gerstäcker took silver and a further medal went to Finland with Otto Lasanen taking bronze. The lightweight class drew the most attention from the public, with Emil Väre winning gold after beating all of his opponents by pin rather than by points. Swedish wrestlers Gustaf Malmström and Edvin Mattiasson took the silver and bronze medals respectively. Claes Johanson won Sweden&#x27;s only gold medal in the middleweight competition, with his fellow finalist from Russia, Martin Klein, retiring before fighting Johanson in the final. This was due to the semi-final match between Klein and Alfred Asikainen of Finland lasting 11 hours and forty minutes, although they took breaks for refreshments every half-hour. Klein was awarded the silver medal and Asikainen the bronze.

The light heavyweight competition saw another marathon length match, with the bout between Anders Ahlgren of Sweden and Ivar Böhling of Finland for the gold medal lasting more than nine hours. The match was then declared a draw with both athletes being awarded the silver medal as neither won the match. The bronze medal went to Hungary&#x27;s Béla Varga, who was defeated by Ahlgren in the semi-final match. Yrjö Saarela of Finland was victorious in the heavyweight competition after having placed second in the light heavyweight event at the 1908 Games. Johan Olin took another medal for Finland with the silver and Søren Marinus Jensen repeated his bronze medal at the 1908 Olympics with another for Denmark.

===Art competitions===

The 1912 Summer Olympics saw the introduction of art competitions at the Summer Olympics. Events were implemented for literature, sculpture, painting, architecture and music. Walter Winans won the gold medal for his sculpture, &quot;An American Trotter&quot;, which added to his previous gold medal for the running deer (double shot) competition at the 1908 Olympics and the silver medal in the running deer competition in 1912.

Baron Pierre de Coubertin, President of the IOC and founder of the modern Olympic movement, won the gold medal for literature. He actually entered the competition under the pseudonyms of Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach from Germany. With the exception of the sculpture competition, only gold medals were issued. Italian Riccardo Barthelemy won the medal for music with his &quot;Olympic Triumphal March&quot;, and fellow countryman Giovanni Pellegrini won the gold for painting. The Swiss architects Eugène-Edouard Monod and Alphonse Laverrière shared the gold for their stadium design. The sole silver medal, for sculpture, went to Frenchman Georges Dubois for his &quot;Model of the entrance to a modern stadium&quot;.

===Demonstration sports===

In the evening of 7 July, demonstrations took place in the Olympic Stadium of sports from the Swedish island of Gotland. These began at 7:30pm with a demonstration of Pärk, a type of tennis with seven players a side. At the same time, at the other end of the stadium, a type of Icelandic wrestling called Glima was demonstrated. Once those displays had concluded, further demonstrations were made of the Swedish sport varpa, similar to quoits, and stångstörtning, a version of the caber toss. The three disciplines showcased were pärk, varpa and stångstörtning.
Baseball was also demonstrated at the Games. A game was played between the United States, the nation where the game was developed, and Sweden, the host nation. The game was held on Monday, 15 July 1912 and started at 10 a.m. on the Ostermalm Athletic Grounds in Stockholm. The Americans were represented by various members of the American Olympic track and field athletics delegation, while the Swedish team was the Vesterås Baseball Club, which had been formed in 1910 as the first baseball club in Sweden. Four of the Americans played for Sweden, as the Swedish pitchers and catchers were inexperienced. One Swede eventually relieved Adams and Nelson, the American pitchers.

Six innings were played, with the Americans not batting in the sixth and allowing the Swedes to have six outs in their half of the inning. The game was umpired by George Wright, a retired American National League baseball player.

==Participating nations==
Twenty-eight nations competed at the 1912 Games. Egypt participated for the first time, as did Luxembourg, Iceland, Portugal, and Serbia. Japan also made their Olympic debut, marking the first appearance of an Asian country at an Olympic Games. Chile made its first appearance as a national team, with fourteen athletes attending the Games, although it had previously entered one individual at the 1896 Games. This was also the first time that athletes from Armenia had competed in the Olympics, as part of the team from Turkey (the officially recognised name for the Ottoman Empire). Serbia&#x27;s appearance was the only time it attended an Olympic Games as an independent nation until the 2008 Summer Olympics, almost one hundred years later.

The only nation that participated in the previous games in London 1908 but was absent in Stockholm 1912 was Argentina.

Austria and Hungary competed as two sovereign countries. The polity known as Austria-Hungary is mistakenly considered a single sovereign country, while in reality was two sovereign states in real union with a single monarch who was titled both emperor of Austria and king of Hungary.

At the time, Australasia (Australia and New Zealand), Canada and South Africa were all part of the British Empire. Bohemia was part of Austria. Iceland was part of Denmark. Finland was part of Russia. Egypt was de jure under the control of Turkey, but had been de facto run by the British since 1882.

This was the last Olympics that allowed &quot;private entries&quot;, i.e. individual athletes that were not part of a country&#x27;s officially selected team. Arnold Jackson was one such private entry; he won the 1500 metres by 0.1 seconds, ahead of an American trio, in what was acclaimed at the time to be &quot;the greatest race ever run&quot;. His medal is still credited to the United Kingdom, however.

===Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees===
==Medal count==
These are the top 10 nations that won medals at the 1912 Games. The medals themselves included solid gold medals, the last time these were given out.

<doc id="180201" wikidata="Q460730" url="?curid=180201" title="Riff">
<text>A riff is a short, repeated motif or figure in the melody or accompaniment of a musical composition. Riffs are most often found in rock music, punk, heavy metal music, Latin, funk, and jazz, although classical music is also sometimes based on a riff, such as Ravel&#x27;s Boléro. Riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple, catchy rhythmic figure, or as complex as the riff-based variations in the head arrangements played by the Count Basie Orchestra.

David Brackett (1999) defines riffs as &quot;short melodic phrases&quot;, while Richard Middleton (1999) defines them as &quot;short rhythmic, melodic, or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework&quot;. Author Rikky Rooksby states: &quot;A riff is a short, repeated, memorable musical phrase, often pitched low on the guitar, which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song.&quot;

BBC Radio 2, in compiling its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Riffs, defined a riff as the &quot;main hook of a song&quot;, often beginning the song, and is &quot;repeated throughout it, giving the song its distinctive voice&quot;.

Use of the term has extended to comedy, where &quot;riffing&quot; means the verbal exploration of a particular subject, thus moving the meaning away from the original jazz sense of a repeated figure that a soloist improvises over, to instead indicate the improvisation itself—improvising on a melody or progression as one would improvise on a subject by extending a singular thought, idea or inspiration into a &quot;bit&quot;, or &quot;routine&quot;.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;riff&quot; entered musical slang in the 1920s and is used primarily in discussion of forms of rock music, heavy metal or jazz. One explanation holds that &quot;most rock musicians use &quot;riff&quot; as a near-synonym for &quot;musical idea&quot;&quot; (Middleton 1990, p. 125), but the etymology of the term is not clearly known. 

Ian Anderson, in the documentary &quot;A World Without Beethoven&quot;, states (repeatedly) that &quot;riff&quot; is the abbreviation of &quot;repeated motif.&quot; Other sources propose &quot;riff&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;rhythmic figure,&quot; &quot;rhythm fragment,&quot; or &quot;refrain&quot;.

== Usage in jazz, blues, and R&amp;B ==

In jazz, blues and R&amp;B, riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions. Count Basie&#x27;s band used many riffs in the 1930&#x27;s, like in &quot;Jumping at the Woodside&quot; and &quot;One O Clock Jump&quot;. Charlie Parker used riffs on &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; and &quot;Buzzy&quot;. Oscar Pettiford&#x27;s tune &quot;Blues in the Closet&quot; is a rifftune and so is Duke Ellington&#x27;s tune &quot;C Jam Blues&quot;. Blues guitarist John Lee Hooker used riff on &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; in 1948.

The riff from Charlie Parker&#x27;s bebop number &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot; (1945) re-emerged four years later as the R&amp;B dance hit &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot;. The verse of &quot;The Hucklebuck&quot;, which was another riff, was &quot;borrowed&quot; from the Artie Matthews composition &quot;Weary Blues&quot;. Glenn Miller&#x27;s &quot;In the Mood&quot; had an earlier life as Wingy Manone&#x27;s &quot;Tar Paper Stomp&quot;. All these songs use twelve-bar blues riffs, and most of these riffs probably precede the examples given (Covach 2005, p. 71).

In classical music, individual musical phrases used as the basis of classical music pieces are called ostinatos or simply phrases. Contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in modal music and Latin jazz.

== Riff-driven ==

The term &quot;riff-driven&quot; is used to describe a piece of music that relies on a repeated instrumental riff as the basis of its most prominent melody, cadence, or (in some cases) leitmotif. Riff-driven songs are largely a product of jazz, blues, and post-blues era music (rock and pop). The musical goal of riff-driven songs is akin to the classical &quot;continuo&quot; effect, but raised to much higher importance (in fact, the repeated riff is used to anchor the song in the ears of the listener). The riff/continuo is brought to the forefront of the musical piece and often is the primary melody that remains in the listener&#x27;s ears. A &quot;call and response&quot; often holds the song together, creating a &quot;circular&quot; rather than linear feel.

Who recorded the first riff-driven rock and roll song is contested, but very early examples include the playing by René Hall on Ritchie Valens’ 1958 version of &quot;La Bamba&quot; (on a Danelectro six-string bass guitar), as well as Link Wray&#x27;s 1958 instrumental record &quot;Rumble.&quot;

A few examples of classic rock riff-driven songs are &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;Black Dog&quot; by Led Zeppelin, &quot;Day Tripper&quot; by The Beatles, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Get No) Satisfaction&quot; by The Rolling Stones, &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by Deep Purple, &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana, &quot;Johnny B Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry, &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; by Aerosmith, and &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by The Kinks.

<doc id="180204" wikidata="Q928530" url="?curid=180204" title="Bernardo del Carpio">
<text>Bernardo del Carpio (also spelled Bernaldo del Carpio) is a legendary hero of the medieval Spain. Until the end of the nineteenth century and the labors of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, he, not El Cid, was considered to have been the chief hero of medieval Christian Spain and was believed to be a historical person. His factual existence has been defended in the later 20th century, although the Spanish government has not designated him to be historical.

==The story==
The earliest form of the legend of Bernardo is found in the &quot;Chronicon mundi&quot; of Lucas of Tuy (1236), followed closely by the &quot;Historia Gothica&quot; of Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (1243) and the &quot;Primera Crónica General&quot; (1270).

According to the form of the legend found in the 13th-century chronicles, Bernardo was the son of the secret marriage of Sancho Díaz, count of Saldaña, and Jimena, daughter of King Alfonso II of Asturias (), although rumour had it that his mother was Timbor, sister of the Frankish king Charlemagne. He was born early in his Alfonso&#x27;s reign, but when the king learned of the illicit marriage he had Sancho imprisoned and Jimena placed in a convent. Bernardo was raised in the royal court.

When Alfonso grew old, he submitted to Charlemagne in return for protection against the Moors. Bernardo led the resistance to this submission, forcing Alfonso to renege. Charlemagne then invaded Asturias. Bernardo, leading the army, and his Moorish ally, King Marsil of Zaragoza, defeated the Franks at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass, where Roland was killed.

After his victory, Bernardo learned that his father was still alive. He went into mourning for his living father, but Alfonso still refused to free him. When Charlemagne returned to take revenge on Marsil, Bernardo joined him against his old ally. Charlemagne richly rewarded him and brought him back to France. Twenty-four years later he returned to Asturias and fought alongside King Alfonso III at Toledo.

When his cousin, Don Bueso, marched from France with an army, Bernardo defeated him in a duel and then defeated his army. He then demanded the freedom of his father, but was refused. A year later, he fought for the queen in a tournament, but his request for his father&#x27;s freedom was again refused. He then decided to go on a rampage, seizing land and generally terrorizing the kingdom for two years. He built up a large retinue and constructed a castle he called El Carpio near Salamanca as his headquarters. When Alfonso III marched on El Carpio, Bernardo demanded his father&#x27;s release. This was granted, but his father had died three days before. Bernardo thus lost the castle for nothing.

Bernardo returned to France for a time before Charlemagne sent him back with soldiers and horses to fight the Moors. He liberated Berbegal, Barbastro and Sobrarbe before settling down to marry Doña Galinda, daughter of Count Alardos de Latre. He repopulated the Canal de Jaca.

==Origins==
Although presented in the chronicles as history, the story is of Bernardo is fictitious, being full of anachronisms and chronologically impossible. He would have been 82 years old when he defeated Don Bueso and his father must have been 110 at his death. The &quot;Primera Crónica&quot; frequently expresses doubt about the story. The historical figure who is most likely the origin of the legend is Bernard of Septimania.

==Literary works about Bernardo del Carpio==
The original legend of Bernardo del Carpio was sung by the &quot;jongleurs&quot; (minstrels, professional reciters, entertainers) of the Kingdom of León. Later, the Castilian poet Pero Ferrús (fl. 1380) mentions Bernardo del Carpio in one of his cantigas, which combines the theme of the good life in Castile with a series of &quot;loores&quot;, or lyric paeans, to a series of Greek, Roman, Biblical, chivalric, and Arab heroes.

In 1624 Bernardo de Balbuena published &quot;El Bernardo&quot;, an epic poem recounting Bernardo&#x27;s exploits.

In the opening of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Miguel de Cervantes has the protagonist especially admiring Bernardo because he crushed Roland with his arms alone, although the context is clear that Quixote is placing too much credence in the fantastic stories of romance.

Cervantes referred to one of his works as &quot;the Bernardo&quot;. This uncompleted work is lost, as are almost all of Cervantes&#x27;s manuscripts. Daniel Eisenberg has proposed that in Cervantes&#x27;s Spain a book about a &quot; Bernardo&quot; must have been about Bernardo del Carpio. In contrast with Roland/Orlando, Bernardo was a Spanish hero, a national hero, and Cervantes was much in favor of celebrating Spanish heroes, or celebrating them more.

<text>The Orange Free State ( ; ) was an independent Boer-ruled sovereign republic under British suzerainty in Southern Africa during the second half of the 19th century, which ceased to exist after it was defeated and surrendered to the British Empire at the end of the Second Boer War in 1902. It is one of the three historical precursors to the present-day Free State province.

Extending between the Orange and Vaal rivers, its borders were determined by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1848 when the region was proclaimed as the Orange River Sovereignty, with a British Resident based in Bloemfontein. Bloemfontein and the southern parts of the Sovereignty had previously been settled by Griqua and by &quot;Trekboere&quot; from the Cape Colony.

The &quot;Voortrekker&quot; Republic of Natalia, founded in 1837, administered the northern part of the territory through a &quot;landdrost&quot; based at Winburg. This northern area was later in federation with the Republic of Potchefstroom which eventually formed part of the South African Republic (Transvaal).

Following the granting of sovereignty to the Transvaal Republic, the British sought to drop their defensive and administrative responsibilities between the Orange and Vaal rivers, while local European residents wanted the British to remain. This led to the British recognising the independence of the Orange River Sovereignty and the country officially became independent as the Orange Free State on 23 February 1854, with the signing of the Orange River Convention. The new republic incorporated the Orange River Sovereignty and continued the traditions of the Winburg-Potchefstroom Republic.

The Orange Free State was annexed as the Orange River Colony in 1900. It ceased to exist as an independent Boer republic on 31 May 1902 with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging at the conclusion of the Second Boer War. Following a period of direct rule by the British, it attained self-government in 1907 and joined the Union of South Africa in 1910 as the Orange Free State Province, along with the Cape Province, Natal, and the Transvaal. In 1961, the Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa.

The Republic&#x27;s name derives partly from the Orange River, which was named by the Dutch explorer Robert Jacob Gordon in honour of the Dutch ruling family, the House of Orange, whose name in turn derived from its partial origins in the Principality of Orange in French Provence. The official language in the Orange Free State was Dutch.

==History==

=== First settlements ===

Europeans first visited the country north of the Orange River towards the close of the 18th century. One of the most notable visitors was the Dutch explorer Robert Jacob Gordon, who mapped the region and gave the Orange River its name. At that time, the population was sparse. The majority of the inhabitants appear to have been members of the Sotho people but in the valleys of the Orange and Vaal were Korana (Khoikhoi) and a section of Barolong in the Drakensberg and on the western border lived numbers of Nomadic Southern Africans. Early in the 19th century Griqua established themselves north of the Orange.

===Boer immigration===

In 1824 farmers of Dutch, French Huguenot and German descent known as Trekboers (later named Boers by the English) emerged from the Cape Colony, seeking pasture for their flocks and to escape British governmental oversight, settling in the country. Up to this time the few Europeans who had crossed the Orange had come mainly as hunters or as missionaries. These early migrants were followed in 1836 by the first parties of the Great Trek. These emigrants left the Cape Colony for various reasons, but all shared the desire for independence from British authority. The leader of the first large party, Hendrik Potgieter, concluded an agreement with Makwana, the chief of the Bataung tribe of Batswana, ceding to the farmers the country between the Vet and Vaal rivers. When Boer families first reached the area they discovered that the country had been devastated, in the northern parts by the chief Mzilikazi and his Matabele in what was known as the Mfecane, and also by the Difaqane, in which three tribes roamed across the land attacking settled groups, absorbing them and their resources until they collapsed because of their sheer size. Consequently, large areas were depopulated. The Boers soon came into collision with Mzilikazi&#x27;s raiding parties, which attacked Boer hunters who crossed the Vaal River. Reprisals followed, and in November 1837 the Boers decisively defeated Mzilikazi, who thereupon fled northward and eventually established himself on the site of the future Bulawayo in Zimbabwe.

In the meantime another party of Cape Dutch emigrants had settled at Thaba Nchu, where the Wesleyans had a mission station for the Barolong. These Barolong had trekked from their original home under their chief, Moroka II, first south-westwards to the Langberg, and then eastwards to Thaba Nchu. The emigrants were treated with great kindness by Moroka, and with the Barolong the Boers maintained uniformly friendly relations after they defeated Mzilikazi. In December 1836 the emigrants beyond the Orange drew up in general assembly an elementary republican form of government. After the defeat of Mzilikazi the town of Winburg (so named by the Boers in commemoration of their victory) was founded, a Volksraad elected, and Piet Retief, one of the ablest of the Voortrekkers, chosen &quot;governor and commandant-general&quot;. The emigrants already numbered some 500 men, besides women and children and many servants. Dissensions speedily arose among the emigrants, whose numbers were constantly added to, and Retief, Potgieter and other leaders crossed the Drakensberg and entered Natal. Those that remained were divided into several parties.

===British rule===

Meanwhile, a new power had arisen along the upper Orange and in the valley of the Caledon. Moshoeshoe, a minor Basotho chief, had welded together a number of scattered and broken clans which had sought refuge in that mountainous region after fleeing from Mzilikazi, and had formed the Basotho nation which acknowledged him as king. In 1833 he had welcomed as workers among his people a band of French Protestant missionaries, and as the Boer immigrants began to settle in his neighborhood he decided to seek support from the British at the Cape. At that time the British government was not prepared to exercise control over the immigrants. Acting upon the advice of Dr John Philip, the superintendent of the London Missionary Society’s stations in South Africa, a treaty was concluded in 1843 with Moshoeshoe, placing him under British protection. A similar treaty was made with the Griqua chief Adam Kok III. By these treaties, which recognised native sovereignty, the British sought to keep a check on the Boers and to protect both the natives and Cape Colony. The effect was to precipitate collisions between all three parties.

The year in which the treaty with Moshoeshoe was made, several large parties of Boers recrossed the Drakensberg into the country north of the Orange, refusing to remain in Natal when the British annexed the newly formed Boer republic of Natalia to form the Colony of Natal. During their stay in Natal the Boers inflicted a severe defeat on the Zulus under Dingane in the Battle of Blood River in December 1838, which, following on the flight of Mzilikazi, greatly strengthened the position of Moshoeshoe, whose power became a menace to that of the Boer farmers. Trouble first arose, however, between the Boers and the Griqua in the Philippolis district. Some of the Boer farmers in this district, unlike their fellows dwelling farther north, were willing to accept British rule. This fact induced Mr Justice Menzies, one of the judges of the Cape Colony then on circuit at Colesberg, to cross the Orange and proclaim the country British territory in October 1842. The proclamation was disallowed by the Governor, Sir George Napier, who, nevertheless, maintained that the Boer farmers remained British subjects. After this episode the British negotiated their treaties with Adam Kok III and Moshoeshoe.

The treaties gave great offence to the Boers, who refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of the native chiefs. The majority of the Boer farmers in Kok&#x27;s territory sent a deputation to the British commissioner in Natal, Henry Cloete, asking for equal treatment with the Griquas, and expressing the desire to come under British protection under such terms. Shortly afterwards hostilities between the farmers and the Griqua broke out. British troops moved up to support the Griquas, and after a skirmish at Zwartkopjes (2 May 1845) a new arrangement was made between Kok and Peregrine Maitland, the then Governor of Cape Colony, virtually placing the administration of his territory in the hands of a British resident, a post filled in 1846 by Captain Henry Douglas Warden. The place purchased by Captain (afterwards Major) Warden as the seat of his court was known as Bloemfontein, and it subsequently became the capital of the whole country. Bloemfontein lay to the south of the region settled by Voortrekkers.

===Boer governance===
The Volksraad at Winburg during this period continued to claim jurisdiction over the Boers living between the Orange and the Vaal and was in federation with the Volksraad at Potchefstroom, which made a similar claim upon the Great Boers living north of the Vaal. In 1846 Major Warden occupied Winburg for a short time, and the relations between the Boers and the British were in a continual state of tension. Many of the farmers deserted Winburg for the Transvaal. Sir Harry Smith became governor of the Cape at the end of 1847. He recognised the failure of the attempt to govern on the lines of the treaties with the Griquas and Basotho, and on 3 February 1848 he issued a proclamation declaring British sovereignty over the country between the Orange and the Vaal eastward to the Drakensberg. Sir Harry Smith&#x27;s popularity among the Boers gained for his policy considerable support, but the republican party, at whose head was Andries Pretorius, did not submit without a struggle. They were, however, defeated by Sir Harry Smith in the Battle of Boomplaats on 29 August 1848. Thereupon Pretorius, with those most bitterly opposed to British rule, retreated across the Vaal.

===Orange River Sovereignty===

In March 1849 Major Warden was succeeded at Bloemfontein as civil commissioner by Mr C. U. Stuart, but he remained the British resident until July 1852. A nominated legislative council was created, a high court established and other steps taken for the orderly government of the country, which was officially styled the Orange River Sovereignty. In October 1849 Moshoeshoe was induced to sign a new arrangement considerably curtailing the boundaries of the Basotho reserve. The frontier towards the Sovereignty was thereafter known as the Warden line. A little later the reserves of other chieftains were precisely defined.

The British Resident had, however, no force sufficient to maintain his authority, and Moshoeshoe and all the neighboring clans became involved in hostilities with one another and with the Europeans. In 1851 Moshoeshoe joined the republican party in the Sovereignty in an invitation to Pretorius to recross the Vaal. The intervention of Pretorius resulted in the Sand River Convention of 1852, which acknowledged the independence of the Transvaal but left the status of the Sovereignty untouched. The British government (under the first Russell administration), which had reluctantly agreed to the annexation of the country, had, however, already repented its decision and had resolved to abandon the Sovereignty. Lord Henry Grey, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, in a dispatch to Sir Harry Smith dated 21 October 1851, declared, &quot;The ultimate abandonment of the Orange Sovereignty should be a settled point in our policy.&quot;

A meeting of representatives of all European inhabitants of the Sovereignty, elected on manhood suffrage, held at Bloemfontein in June 1852, nevertheless declared in favour of the retention of British rule. At the close of that year a settlement was at length concluded with Moshoeshoe, which left, perhaps, that chief in a stronger position than he had hitherto been. There had been ministerial changes in England and the Aberdeen ministry, then in power, adhered to the determination to withdraw from the Sovereignty. Sir George Russell Clerk was sent out in 1853 as special commissioner &quot;for the settling and adjusting of the affairs&quot; of the Sovereignty, and in August of that year he summoned a meeting of delegates to determine upon a form of self-government.

At that time there were some 15,000 Europeans in the country, many of them recent immigrants from Cape Colony. There were among them numbers of farmers and tradesmen of British descent. The majority of the whites still wished for the continuance of British rule provided that it was effective and the country guarded against its enemies. The representations of their delegates, who drew up a proposed constitution retaining British control, were unavailing. Sir George Clerk announced that, as the elected delegates were unwilling to take steps to form an independent government, he would enter into negotiations with other persons. &quot; And then,&quot; wrote George McCall Theal, &quot;was seen forced the strange spectacle of an English commissioner addressing men who wished to be free of British control as the friendly and well-disposed inhabitants, while for those who desired to remain British subjects and who claimed that protection to which they believed themselves entitled he had no sympathising word.&quot; While the elected delegates sent two members to England to try and induce the government to alter their decision, Sir George Clerk speedily came to terms with a committee formed by the republican party and presided over by Mr J. H. Hoffman. Even before this committee met a royal proclamation had been signed (30 January 1854) &quot;abandoning and renouncing all dominion&quot; in the Sovereignty.

The Orange River Convention, recognising the independence of the country, was signed at Bloemfontein on 23 February by Sir George Clerk and the republican committee, and in March the Boer government assumed office and the republican flag was hoisted. Five days later the representatives of the elected delegates had an interview in London with the colonial secretary, the Duke of Newcastle, who informed them that it was now too late to discuss the question of the retention of British rule. The colonial secretary added that it was impossible for England to supply troops to constantly advancing outposts, &quot;especially as Cape Town and the port of Table Bay were all she really required in South Africa.&quot; In withdrawing from the Sovereignty the British government declared that it had &quot;no alliance with any native chief or tribes to the northward of the Orange River with the exception of the Griqua chief Captain Adam Kok [III]&quot;. Kok was not formidable in a military sense, nor could he prevent individual Griquas from alienating their lands. Eventually, in 1861, he sold his sovereign rights to the Free State for £4000 and moved with his followers to the district later known as Griqualand East.

On the abandonment of British rule, representatives of the people were elected and met at Bloemfontein on 28 March 1854, and between then and 18 April were engaged in framing a constitution. The country was declared a republic and named the Orange Free State. All persons of European blood possessing a six months&#x27; residential qualification were to be granted full burgher rights. The sole legislative authority was vested in a single popularly elected chamber of the Volksraad. Executive authority was entrusted to a president elected by the burghers from a list submitted by the Volksraad. The president was to be assisted by an executive council, was to hold office for five years and was eligible for re-election. The constitution was subsequently modified but remained of a liberal character. A residence of five years in the country was required before aliens could become naturalised. The first president was Josias Philip Hoffman, but he was accused of being too complaisant towards Moshoeshoe and resigned, being succeeded in 1855 by Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, one of the voortrekkers, who had previously taken an active part in the affairs of the Natalia Republic.

===Conflict with the South African Republic===

Distracted among themselves, with the formidable Basotho power on their southern and eastern flank, the troubles of the infant state were speedily added to by the action of the Transvaal Boers of the South African Republic. Marthinus Pretorius, who had succeeded to his father&#x27;s position as commandant general of Potchefstroom, wished to bring about a confederation between the two Boer states. Peaceful overtures from Pretorius were declined, and some of his partisans in the Orange Free State were accused of treason in February 1857. Thereupon Pretorius, aided by Paul Kruger, conducted a raid into the Orange Free State&#x27;s territory. On learning of the invasion, President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff proclaimed martial law throughout the country. The majority of the burghers rallied to his support, and on 25 May, the two opposing forces faced one another on the banks of the Rhenoster. President Boshoff not only got together some 800 men within the Orange Free State, but he received offers of support from Commandant Stephanus Schoeman, the Transvaal leader in the Zoutpansberg district and from Commandant Joubert of Lydenburg. Pretorius and Kruger, realising that they would have to sustain attack from both north and south, abandoned their enterprise. Their force, too, only amounted to some three hundred. Kruger came to Boshoff&#x27;s camp with a flag of truce, the &quot;army&quot; of Pretorius returned north and on 2 June a treaty of peace was signed, each state acknowledging the absolute independence of the other.

The conduct of Pretorius was stigmatised as &quot;blameworthy.&quot; Several of the malcontents in the Orange Free State who had joined Pretorius permanently settled in the Transvaal, and other Orange Free Staters who had been guilty of high treason were arrested and punished. This experience did not, however, heal the party strife within the Orange Free State. In consequence of the dissensions among the burghers, President Boshoff tendered his resignation in February 1858, but was for a time induced to remain in office. The difficulties of the state were at that time so great that the Volksraad in December 1858 passed a resolution in favour of confederation with the Cape Colony. This proposition received the strong support of Sir George Grey, the then Governor of Cape Colony, but his view did not commend itself to the British government, and was not adopted.

In the same year, the disputes between the Basotho and the Boers culminated in open war. Both parties laid claims to land beyond the Warden line, and each party had taken possession of what it could, the Basotho being also expert cattle-lifters. In the war the advantage rested with the Basotho; thereupon the Orange Free State appealed to Sir George Grey, who induced Moshoeshoe to come to terms. On 15 October 1858, a treaty was signed defining the new boundary. The peace was nominal only, while the burghers were also involved in disputes with other tribes. Mr. Boshoff again tendered his resignation in February 1859 and retired to Natal. Many of the burghers would have at this time welcomed union with the Transvaal, but learning from Sir George Grey that such a union would nullify the conventions of 1852 and 1854 and necessitate the reconsideration of Great Britain&#x27;s policy towards the native tribes north of the Orange and Vaal rivers, the project was dropped. Commandant Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was, however, elected president in place of Boshoff. Though unable to effect a durable peace with the Basotho, or to realise his ambition for the creation of a single united Boer republic, Pretorius oversaw a period of increased strength and prosperity for the Orange Free State. The fertile district of Bethulie as well as Adam Kok&#x27;s territory was acquired, and there was a considerable increase in the Boer population. The burghers generally, however, had little confidence in their elected rulers and little desire for taxes to be levied. Wearied like Boshoff, and disillusioned with the affairs of the Orange Free State, Pretorius resigned the presidency in 1863 and moved to the Transvaal.

After an interval of seven months, Johannes Brand, an advocate at the Cape bar, was elected president. He assumed office in February 1864. His election proved a turning-point in the history of the country, which, under his guidance, became peaceful and prosperous. But before peace could be established an end had to be made of the difficulties with the Basothos. Moshoeshoe continued to menace the Free State border. Attempts at accommodation made by the Governor of Cape Colony, Sir Philip Wodehouse, failed, and war between the Orange Free State and Moshoeshoe was renewed in 1865. The Boers gained considerable successes, and this induced Moshoeshoe to sue for peace. The terms exacted were, however, too harsh for a nation yet unbroken to accept permanently. A treaty was signed at Thaba Bosiu in April 1866, but war again broke out in 1867, and the Free State attracted to its side a large number of adventurers from all parts of South Africa. The burghers thus reinforced gained at length a decisive victory over their great antagonist, every stronghold in Basutoland save Thaba Bosiu being stormed. Moshoeshoe now turned to Sir Philip Wodehouse for preservation. His call was heeded, and in 1868 he and his country were taken under British protection. Thus the thirty years&#x27; strife between the Basothos and the Boers came to an end. The intervention of the Governor of Cape Colony led to the conclusion of the treaty of Aliwal North (12 February 1869), which defined the borders between the Orange Free State and Basutoland. The country lying to the north of the Orange River and west of the Caledon River, formerly a part of Basutoland, was ceded to the Orange Free State, and became known as the Conquered Territory.

A year after the addition of the Conquered Territory to the state another boundary dispute was settled by the arbitration of Robert William Keate, lieutenant-governor of Natal. By the Sand River Convention, independence had been granted to the Boers living &quot;north of the Vaal&quot;, and the dispute turned on the question as to what stream constituted the true upper course of that river. Keate decided on 19 February 1870 against the Free State and fixed the Klip River as the dividing line, the Transvaal thus securing the Wakkerstroom and adjacent districts.

===Diamonds discovered===

The Basutoland difficulties were no sooner arranged than the Free Staters found themselves confronted with a serious difficulty on their western border. In the years 1870–1871 a large number of foreign diggers had settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers, which were situated in part on land claimed by the Griqua chief Nicholas Waterboer and by the Orange Free State.

The Free State established a temporary government over the diamond fields, but the administration of this body was satisfactory neither to the Free State nor to the diggers. At this juncture Waterboer offered to place the territory under the administration of Queen Victoria. The offer was accepted, and on 27 October 1871 the district, together with some adjacent territory to which the Transvaal had laid claim, was proclaimed, under the name of Griqualand West, British territory. Waterboer&#x27;s claims were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the British in 1834, and on various arrangements with the Kok chiefs; the Free State based its claim on its purchase of Adam Kok&#x27;s sovereign rights and on long occupation. The difference between proprietorship and sovereignty was confused or ignored. That Waterboer exercised no authority in the disputed district was admitted. When the British annexation took place a party in the Volksraad wished to go to war with Britain, but the counsels of President Johannes Brand prevailed. The Free State, however, did not abandon its claims. The matter involved no little irritation between the parties concerned until July 1876. It was then disposed of by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, at that time Secretary of State for the Colonies, who granted to the Free State a £90,000 payment &quot;in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to Griqualand West.&quot; Lord Carnarvon declined to entertain the proposal made by Mr Brand that the territory should be given up by Great Britain. In the opinion of historian George McCall Theal, the annexation of Griqualand West was probably in the best interests of the Free State. &quot;There was,&quot; he stated, &quot;no alternative from British sovereignty other than an independent diamond field republic.&quot;

At this time, largely owing to the struggle with the Basothos, the Free State Boers, like their Transvaal neighbors, had drifted into financial straits. A paper currency had been instituted, and the notes, known as &quot;bluebacks&quot;, soon dropped to less than half their nominal value. Commerce was largely carried on by barter, and many cases of bankruptcy occurred in the state. The influx of British and other immigrants to the diamond fields, in the early 1870s, restored public credit and individual prosperity to the Boers of the Free State. The diamond fields offered a ready market for stock and other agricultural produce. Money flowed into the pockets of the farmers. Public credit was restored. &quot;Bluebacks&quot; recovered par value, and were called in and redeemed by the government. Valuable diamond mines were also discovered within the Free State, of which the one at Jagersfontein was the richest. Capital from Kimberley and London was soon provided with which to work them.

===Gold discovered===

In 1934, new geophysical prospecting methods allowed for the discovery of deep gold-bearing reefs in the Orange Free State, which began the Free State Gold Rush. From 1936 to 1947, approximately 190 miles of drilling had been accomplished by over 50 companies for prospecting the area, and in 1951, the first gold bar was produced from these fields. By 1981, gold mining was contributing 37.4% of the provinces GDP, and the city of Welkom and town of Riebeeckstad had been established to accommodate the labour forces.

===Peaceful relations with neighbours===

The relations between the British and the Orange Free State, after the question of the boundary was settled, remained perfectly amicable down to the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. From 1870 onward the history of the state was one of quiet, steady progress. At the time of the first annexation of the Transvaal the Free State declined Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s invitation to federate with the other South African communities. In 1880, when a rising of the Boers in the Transvaal was threatening, President Brand showed every desire to avert the conflict. He suggested that Sir Henry de Villiers, Chief Justice of Cape Colony, should be sent into the Transvaal to endeavour to gauge the true state of affairs in that country. This suggestion was not acted upon, but when war broke out in the Transvaal, Brand declined to take any part in the struggle. In spite of the neutral attitude taken by their government a number of the Orange Free State Boers, living in the northern part of the country, went to the Transvaal and joined their brethren then in arms against the British. This fact was not allowed to influence the friendly relations between the Free State and Great Britain. In 1888 Sir Johannes Brand died.
During the period of Brand&#x27;s presidency a great change, both political and economic, had come over South Africa. The renewal of the policy of British expansion had been answered by the formation of the Afrikaner Bond, which represented the aspirations of the Afrikaner people, and had active branches in the Free State. This alteration in the political outlook was accompanied, and in part occasioned, by economic changes of great significance. The development of the diamond mines and of the gold and coal industries – of which Brand saw the beginning – had far-reaching consequences, bringing the Boer republics into contact with the new industrial era. The Orange Free Staters, under Brand&#x27;s rule, had shown considerable ability to adapt their policy to meet the altered situation. In 1889 an agreement made between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony government, whereby the latter was empowered to extend, at its own cost, its railway system to Bloemfontein. The Orange Free State retained the right to purchase this extension at cost, a right it exercised after the Jameson Raid.

Having accepted the assistance of the Cape government in constructing its railway, the state also in 1889 entered into a Customs Union Convention with them. The convention was the outcome of a conference held at Cape Town in 1888, at which delegates from Natal, the Free State and the Cape Colony attended. Natal at this time had not seen its way to entering the Customs union, but did so at a later date.

===Renewal of hostilities===

In January 1889 Francis William Reitz was elected president of the Orange Free State. Reitz had no sooner got into office than a meeting was arranged with Paul Kruger, president of the South African Republic, at which various terms were discussed and decided upon regarding an agreement dealing with the railways, terms of a treaty of amity and commerce, and what was called a political treaty. The political treaty referred in general terms to a federal union between the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, and bound each of them to help the other, whenever the independence of either should be assailed or threatened from without, unless the state so called upon for assistance should be able to show the injustice of the cause of quarrel in which the other state had engaged. While thus committed to an alliance with its northern neighbour no change was made in internal administration. The Free State, in fact, from its geographical position reaped the benefits without incurring the anxieties consequent on the settlement of a large Uitlander population on the Witwatersrand. The state, however, became increasingly identified with the reactionary party in the South African Republic.

In 1895 the Volksraad passed a resolution, in which they declared their readiness to entertain a proposition from the South African Republic in favour of some form of federal union. In the same year Ritz retired from the presidency of the Orange Free State. The 1896 presidential election to succeed him was won by M. T. Steyn, a judge of the High Court, who took office in February 1896. In 1896 President Steyn visited Pretoria, where he received an ovation as the probable future president of the two Republics. A further offensive and defensive alliance between the two Republics was then entered into, under which the Orange Free State took up arms on the outbreak of hostilities between the British and the South African Republic in October 1899.

In 1897 President Kruger, bent on still further cementing the union with the Orange Free State, had visited Bloemfontein. It was on this occasion that Kruger, referring to the London Convention, spoke of Queen Victoria as a &quot;kwaaje Vrouw&quot; (angry woman), an expression which caused a good deal of offence in England at the time, but which, in the phraseology of the Boers, was not meant by President Kruger as insulting.

In December 1897 the Free State revised its constitution in reference to the franchise law, and the period of residence necessary to obtain naturalization was reduced from five to three years. The oath of allegiance to the state was alone required, and no renunciation of nationality was insisted upon. In 1898 the Free State also acquiesced in the new convention arranged with regard to the Customs Union between the Cape Colony, Natal, Basutoland and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. But events were moving rapidly in the Transvaal, and matters had proceeded too far for the Free State to turn back. In May 1899 President Steyn suggested the conference at Bloemfontein between President Kruger and Sir Alfred Milner, but this act was too late. The Free Staters were practically bound to the South African Republic, under the offensive and defensive alliance, in case hostilities arose with Great Britain.

The Orange Free State began to expel British subjects in 1899, and the first act of the Second Boer War was committed by Orange Free State Boers, who, on 11 October 1899, seized a train upon the border belonging to Natal. For President Steyn and the Free State of 1899, neutrality was impossible. A resolution was passed by the Volksraad on 27 September declaring that the state would observe its obligations to the Transvaal whatever might happen.

After the surrender of Piet Cronjé in the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900, Bloemfontein was occupied by the British troops under Lord Roberts from 13 March onward, and on 28 May a proclamation was issued annexing the Free State to the British dominions under the title of Orange River Colony. For nearly two years longer the burghers kept the field under Christiaan de Wet and other leaders, but by the articles of peace signed on 31 May 1902 British sovereignty was acknowledged.

==Politics==

The 1854 constitution outlined that the unicameral legislature, Volksraad, was the supreme authority. Executive branch was led by State President who was elected by the Burghers from a list of candidates nominated by the Volksraad. 

===Divisions===

The country was divided into the following districts:

# Bloemfontein district: Bloemfontein, Reddersburg, Brandfort, Bethany, Edenburg
# Caledon River district: Smithfield
# Winburg district: Winburg, Ventersburg
# Harrismith district: Harrismith, Frankfort
# Kroonstad district: Kroonstad, Heilbron
# Boshof district: Boshof
# Jacobsdal district: Jacobsdal
# Philippolis district: Philippolis
# Bethulie district: Bethulie
# Bethlehem district: Bethlehem
# Rouxville district: Rouxville
# Lady Brand district: Lady Brand, Ficksburg
# Pniel district: Pniel
===Foreign relations===
The Orange Free State was one of two Boer Republics, alongside the Transvaal, able to persist and prosper long enough to gain international recognition. The Orange Free State would eventually establish diplomatic relations with the Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
In addition to connections with the Great Powers, the Orange Free State maintained political ties, manifested in varying forms with neighboring Transvaal and regularly sent and received official missions to and from regional significant native African tribes.

Despite the republic&#x27;s small size, immense distance and relative historical poverty, the Orange Free State established consuls of official representation in several European states and in the United States of America between 1855 and 31 May 1902, when the republic ceased to exist. The first, and throughout the existence of the republic, most important consular post was the Consulate General of the Orange Free State in the Netherlands. Between 1871 and 1902, the consul general in the Netherlands at times also held diplomatic prerogatives, with the title of &#x27;special envoy&#x27;. In this capacity the incumbent was charged with negotiating and concluding treaties with other states and international organisations on behalf of the Orange Free State government.

==Demographics==

An estimate in 1875: White: 75,000; Native and Coloured: 25,000. The first census, carried out in March 1880, reported 61,022 Europeans and 72,496 Black natives, total 133,518 inhabitants, out of which 70,150 were men. &#x27;Europeans&#x27; made up 45.7% of the population. Bloemfontein, the capital, had 2,567 inhabitants. The 1890 census, which was reportedly not very accurate, found a population of 207,503.

In 1904 the colonial census was taken. The population was 387,315, of whom 225,101 (58.11%) were blacks, 142,679 (36.84%) were whites, 19,282 (4.98%) were coloureds and 253 (0.07%) were Indians. The largest cities were Bloemfontein (33,883) (whites – 15,501 or 45.74%), Harrismith (8,300) (whites – 4,817 or 58.03%), Kroonstad (7,191) (whites – 3,708 or 51.56%).

In 1911 population was 528,174, of whom 325,824 (61.68%) were blacks, 175,189 (33.16%) were whites, 26,554 (5.02%) were coloureds and 607 (0.11%) were Indians. The capital, Bloemfontein, had a population of 26,925.

<text>The Orange River (from Afrikaans/Dutch: Oranjerivier) is a river in Southern Africa. It is the longest river in South Africa. With a total length of , the Orange River Basin extends from Lesotho into South Africa and Namibia to the north. It rises in the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho, flowing westwards through South Africa to the Atlantic Ocean. The river forms part of the international borders between South Africa and Lesotho and between South Africa and Namibia, as well as several provincial borders within South Africa. Except for Upington, it does not pass through any major cities. The Orange River plays an important role in the South African economy by providing water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. The river was named the Orange River in honour of the Dutch ruling family, the House of Orange, by the Dutch explorer Robert Jacob Gordon. Other names include simply the word for river, in Khoekhoegowab orthography written as !Garib, which is rendered in Afrikaans as Gariep River with the intrusion of a velar fricative in place of the alveolar click, Groote River (derived from Kai !Garib) or Senqu River (used in Lesotho), derived from ǂNū &quot;Black&quot;. It is known in isiZulu as isAngqu.

== Course ==

The Orange rises in the Drakensberg mountains along the border between South Africa and Lesotho, about west of the Indian Ocean and at an altitude of over . The extremity of the Orange River inside Lesotho is known as the Senqu. Parts of the Senqu River freeze in winter because of the high altitude. This creates droughts downstream, which mainly affect goat and cattle production.

The Orange River then runs westward through South Africa, forming the south-western boundary of the Free State province. In this section, the river flows first into the Gariep Dam and later into the Vanderkloof Dam. From the border of Lesotho to below the Vanderkloof Dam, the river bed is deeply incised. Further downstream, the land is flatter, and the river is used extensively for irrigation.

At the western point of the Free State, southwest of Kimberley, the Orange meets with its main tributary, the Vaal River, which forms much of the northern border of the province. From here, the river flows further westward through the arid wilderness of the southern Kalahari region and Namaqualand in the Northern Cape province to meet with Namibia at 20°E longitude. From here, it flows westward for , forming the international border between the province and Namibia&#x27;s ǁKaras Region. On the border, the river passes the town of Vioolsdrif, the main border post between South Africa and Namibia.

In the last of its course, the Orange receives many intermittent streams (such as the Fish River), and several large wadis lead into it. In this section, the Namib Desert terminates on the north bank of the river, so under normal circumstances, the volume of water added by these tributaries is negligible. Here, the bed of the river is once again deeply incised. The Augrabies Falls are located on this section of the Orange, where the river descends in a course of .

The Orange empties into the Atlantic Ocean between the small towns of Oranjemund (meaning &quot;Orange mouth&quot;) in Namibia and Alexander Bay in South Africa, about equidistant between Walvis Bay and Cape Town. Some from its mouth, it is obstructed by rapids and sand bars and is generally not navigable for long stretches.

The river has a total length of .

===Catchment and rainfall===

In the dry season, the volume of the water in the river is considerably reduced because of the rapid run-off and evaporation. At the source of the Orange, the rainfall is about per annum, but precipitation decreases as the river flows westward; at its mouth, the rainfall is less than per year. The factors that support evaporation, though, tend to increase in a westerly direction. In the wet season (summer), the Orange river becomes a brown coloured torrent. The huge mass of sediment carried constitutes a long-term threat to engineering projects on the river.

The total catchment of the Orange River (including the Vaal) extends over , i.e. equivalent to about 77% of the land area of South Africa (). Around (38%), however, are situated outside the country in Lesotho, Botswana, and Namibia.

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
Some of the earliest precolonial inhabitants called the river &quot;ǂNūǃarib&quot;, referring to its black colour, or sometimes just &quot;Kai !Arib&quot; (&quot;Great River&quot;), from which is derived the Afrikaans version &quot;Gariep&quot;, and translation &quot;Groote Rivier&quot;. The early Dutch name for the river was just that translation, Groote Rivier, meaning &quot;Great River&quot;. The river was named the Orange River by Colonel Robert Gordon, commander of the United East India Company (VOC) garrison at Cape Town, on a trip to the interior in 1779. Gordon named the river in honor of William V of Orange. A popular but incorrect belief is that the river was named after the supposedly orange color of its water, as opposed to the color of its tributary, the Vaal River, which name is derived from the name ǀHaiǃarib &quot;pale river&quot; (&quot;vaal&quot; being Afrikaans for pale or grey). Since the end of apartheid, the name &quot;Gariep&quot; has had greater favour in official correspondence in South Africa, although the name &quot;Orange&quot; has greater international recognition. In Lesotho, where the river rises, it is known as the Senqu River, derived from the original Khoemana name.
The Eastern Cape Geographical Names Committee has advertised its intention to consider a name change from the colonial name, for that portion of the river that forms the border between the Eastern Cape and the Free State, with suggestions being IGqili or Senqu. The advertisement placed in the &quot;Aliwal Weekblad&quot; newspaper states that the &quot;present name is perceived to have a strong association with the history of colonial subjugation and has therefore no place under the current democratic dispensation.&quot;

=== The Grootslang ===
In South African folklore, the Orange River is often associated with the Grootslang, a mythical being resembling a giant serpent, which is often connected to the river&#x27;s alluvial diamonds. The Grootslang is described as living in a gem-filled cave connected to the Orange River by a natural pipe through which the diamonds gradually enter the river. Other sites said to be lairs of the creature include the pool beneath the King George Cataract at Aughrabies Falls, which is also said to be a source of diamonds, and a large rock in the middle of the river itself. In this version of the legend, the Grootslang is also said to prey on cattle from the river&#x27;s banks.

== Economy ==
As the collection point for the majority of South Africa&#x27;s water, the Orange River plays a major role in supporting agriculture, industry, and mining. To assist in this, two large water schemes have been created, the Orange River Project and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project. Historically, the river played an important role in the South African diamond rush, with the first diamonds in the country being discovered in alluvial deposits on the Orange. Today, several commercial diamond mines operate along the final stretch of the Orange River and around its mouth.

Because of the lack of dangerous animals and high water levels during summer, the river is used for recreational canoeing and rafting. Orange River rafting has become very popular with many companies using their camps along the river from which to operate. The most popular trips are four-day and six-day river trips that take place either along the gorge below the Augrabies Falls or along the Richtersveld area.

===Orange River Project ===
The Orange River Project (ORP) was one of the largest and most imaginative projects of its kind in South Africa. It was constructed by Hendrik Verwoerd&#x27;s government at the height of the apartheid era. The ORP was built to exploit the waters of the Orange River—which, without the Vaal River, represents some 14.1% of the total runoff in South Africa—and in the process, to satisfy an increasing demand for water. The main objectives of the project were:
* to stabilise river flow,
* the generation and transmission of hydroelectric power,
* to provide a reliable water supply for users in the Orange River basin, and
* to give a new lease on life to water-deficient areas in the Eastern Cape, such as the Great Fish and Sundays River valleys.

The Gariep Dam near Colesberg is the main storage structure within the Orange River. From here, the water is supplied in two directions, westward along the Orange River (via hydroelectric power generators) to the Vanderkloof Dam and southward through the Orange-Fish Tunnel to the Eastern Cape.

==== Hydroelectricity ====
Eskom operates hydroelectric power stations at both the Gariep Dam and the Vanderkloof Dam. The hydroelectric power station at the Vanderkloof Dam was the first power-generation station in South Africa situated entirely underground. The towns Oviston and Oranjekrag were established to facilitate the construction and operation of the new infrastructure.
==== Irrigation ====

Irrigation in the vast area downstream of the Vanderkloof Dam, which has turned thousands of hectares of arid veld into highly productive agricultural land, was made possible by the construction of the Gariep and Vanderkloof Dams. Old established irrigation schemes such as those at Buchuberg, Upington, Kakamas, and Vioolsdrif have also benefitted because regulation of the flow is now possible. On the Namibian side of the river, Aussenkehr produces grapes with the help of water from the Orange.

In recent years, the wine-producing areas along the Orange River have grown in importance. Irrigation in the Eastern Cape has also received a tremendous boost, not only from the additional water being made available, but also owing to improvement in water quality. Without this improvement, the citrus farmers along the Lower Sundays River would almost certainly have continued to suffer losses of productivity.

===Lesotho Highlands Water Project===
The Lesotho Highlands Water Project was conceived to supplement the water supply in the Vaal River System. Water is delivered to South Africa by means of the delivery tunnel which passes under the Lesotho South Africa border at the Caledon River, and then under the Little Caledon River south of Clarens in the Free State, and discharges into the Ash River about further to the north. The scheme became viable when water demands in Gauteng reached levels that could no longer be supported economically by alternative schemes such as the Tugela River-Vaal River pumped storage scheme, which used the Sterkfontein Dam, located near Harrismith in the Free State.

===Alluvial diamonds===
In 1867, the first diamond discovered in South Africa, the Eureka Diamond, was found near Hopetown on the Orange River. Two years later, a much larger diamond known as the Star of South Africa was found in the same area, causing a diamond rush. This was soon eclipsed by the diamond rush to mine diamonds directly from kimberlite at Kimberley in 1871, although alluvial diamonds continued to be found in the Orange. Today, several commercial diamond mines operate on the last stretch of the river, as well as the beaches around its mouth. Diamond mines also operate on the middle stretch of the river.

===Rafting and canoeing===
During the temperate months of March and April, given good rains and the sluices of the dams being open, a canoeist (or rafter) can easily travel per day. The lower reaches of the river are most popular, because of the spectacular topography. Commercial tours are available, and these expeditions depart from the border town of Vioolsdrif.

== Wildlife ==
The Orange River has no large animals. It lies outside the range of the Nile crocodile, and although hippopotami were once abundant, they were hunted to extermination in the 19th century. The Orange River has a relative paucity of species diversity. Surveys from 1995 to 2001 in the Lower Orange River found 19 different fish species from eight different families. The two non-native species recorded in the surveys were &quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot; and &quot;Oreochromis mossambicus&quot;, the latter of which had increased rapidly in abundance since the early 1980s. Another exotic species, rainbow trout, is found in the river headwaters in Lesotho.
Seven species are endemic to the Vaal-Orange River system:
* Rock-catfish (&quot;Austroglanis sclateri&quot;)
* Maluti redfin or Maloti minnow (&quot;Pseudobarbus quathlambae&quot;)
* Namaquab barb (&quot;Barbus hospes&quot;) 
* River sardine (&quot;Mesobola brevianalis&quot;)
* Smallmouth yellowfish (&quot;Labeobarbus aeneus&quot;)
* Largemouth yellowfish (&quot;Labeobarbus kimberlyensis&quot;) 
* Orange River Mudfish (&quot;Labeo capensis&quot;)

<text>A biogeographic realm is the broadest biogeographic division of Earth&#x27;s land surface, based on distributional patterns of terrestrial organisms. They are subdivided into bioregions, which are further subdivided into ecoregions.
A biogeographic realm is also known as &quot;ecozone&quot;, although that term may also refer to ecoregions.

==Description==
The realms delineate large areas of Earth&#x27;s surface within which organisms have evolved in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated by geographic features, such as oceans, broad deserts, or high mountain ranges, that constitute natural barriers to migration. As such, biogeographic realm designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography. Biogeographic realms correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology.

From 1872, Alfred Russel Wallace developed a system of zoogeographic regions, extending the ornithologist Philip Sclater&#x27;s system of six regions.

Biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth&#x27;s surface based on &quot;life form&quot;, or the adaptation of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each realm may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories.

The distribution of organisms among the world&#x27;s biogeographic realms has been influenced by the distribution of landmasses, as shaped by plate tectonics over the geological history of Earth.

==Concept history==
The &quot;biogeographic realms&quot; of Udvardy were defined based on taxonomic composition. The rank corresponds more or less to the floristic kingdoms and zoogeographic regions.

The usage of the term &quot;ecozone&quot; is more variable. Beginning in the 1960s, it was used originally in the field of biostratigraphy to denote intervals of geological strata with fossil content demonstrating a specific ecology. In Canadian literature, the term was used by Wiken in macro-level land classification, with geographic criteria (see Ecozones of Canada). Later, Schultz would use it with ecological and physiognomical criteria, in a way similar to the concept of biome.

In the Global 200/WWF scheme, originally the term &quot;biogeographic realm&quot; in Udvardy sense was used. However, in a scheme of BBC, it was replaced by the term &quot;ecozone&quot;.

==Terrestrial biogeographic realms==
=== Udvardy biogeographic realms ===
===WWF / Global 200 biogeographic realms===

The World Wildlife Fund scheme is broadly similar to Miklos Udvardy&#x27;s system, the chief difference being the delineation of the Australasian realm relative to the Antarctic, Oceanic, and Indomalayan realms. In the WWF system, the Australasia realm includes Australia, Tasmania, the islands of Wallacea, New Guinea, the East Melanesian Islands, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. Udvardy&#x27;s Australian realm includes only Australia and Tasmania; he places Wallacea in the Indomalayan Realm, New Guinea, New Caledonia, and East Melanesia in the Oceanian Realm, and New Zealand in the Antarctic Realm.

The Palearctic and Nearctic are sometimes grouped into the Holarctic realm.

===Morrone biogeographic kingdoms===
Following the nomenclatural conventions set out in the International Code of Area Nomenclature, Morrone defined the next biogeographic kingdoms (or realms) and regions:
* Holarctic kingdom Heilprin (1887)
** Nearctic region Sclater (1858)
** Palearctic region Sclater (1858)
* Holotropical kingdom Rapoport (1968)
** Neotropical region Sclater (1858)
** Ethiopian region Sclater (1858)
** Oriental region Wallace (1876)
* Austral kingdom Engler (1899)
** Cape region Grisebach (1872)
** Andean region Engler (1882)
** Australian region Sclater (1858)
** Antarctic region Grisebach (1872)
* Transition zones: 
** Mexican transition zone (Nearctic–Neotropical transition)
** Saharo-Arabian transition zone (Palearctic–Ethiopian transition)
** Chinese transition zone (Palearctic–Oriental transition zone transition) 
** Indo-Malayan, Indonesian or Wallace&#x27;s transition zone (Oriental–Australian transition)
** South American transition zone (Neotropical–Austral transition)

==Freshwater biogeographic realms==
The applicability of Udvardy scheme to most freshwater taxa is unresolved.

The drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world are marked by continental divides. The grey areas are endorheic basins that do not drain to the ocean.

==Marine biogeographic realms==


According to Briggs and Morrone:

According to the WWF scheme:

<text>Precious metals are rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical elements of high economic value. Precious metals, particularly the noble metals, are more corrosion resistant and less chemically reactive than most elements. They are usually ductile and have a high lustre. Historically, precious metals were important as currency but they are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial raw materials. Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code.

The best known precious metals are the precious coinage metals, which are gold and silver. Although both have industrial uses, they are better known for their uses in art, jewelry, and coinage. Other precious metals include the platinum group metals: ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum, of which platinum is the most widely traded.
The demand for precious metals is driven not only by their practical use but also by their role as investments and a store of value. Historically, precious metals have commanded much higher prices than common industrial metals.

==Bullion==

A metal is deemed to be &quot;precious&quot; if it is rare. The discovery of new sources of ore or improvements in mining or refining processes may cause the value of a precious metal to diminish. The status of a &quot;precious&quot; metal can also be determined by high demand or market value. Precious metals in bulk form are known as &quot;bullion&quot; and are traded on commodity markets. Bullion metals may be cast into ingots or minted into coins. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a face value as money.

===Purity and mass===
The level of purity varies from issue to issue. &quot;Three nines&quot; (99.9%) purity is common. The purest mass-produced bullion coins are in the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, which go up to 99.999% purity. A 100% pure bullion is nearly impossible: as the percentage of impurities diminishes, it becomes progressively more difficult to purify the metal further. Historically, coins had a certain amount of weight of alloy, with the purity a local standard. The Krugerrand is the first modern example of measuring in &quot;pure gold&quot;: it should contain at least ounces of at least pure gold. Other bullion coins (for example the British Sovereign) show neither the purity nor the fine-gold weight on the coin but are recognized and consistent in their composition. Many coins historically showed a denomination in currency (example: American double eagle: $20).

===Coinage===
Many nations mint bullion coins. Although nominally issued as legal tender, these coins&#x27; face value as currency is far below their value as bullion. For instance, Canada mints a gold bullion coin (the Gold Maple Leaf) at a face value of $50 containing one troy ounce (31.1035 g) of gold, as of January 2022. The USD to CAD exchange rate averaged 1.129 in July 2009 according to OANDA Historical Exchange Rates. Although the exact moment that the $1,075 figure was determined is unknown, it may be considered a reasonable value for the time. Bullion coins&#x27; minting by national governments gives them some numismatic value in addition to their bullion value, as well as certifying their purity.

One of the largest bullion coins in the world was the 10,000-dollar Australian Gold Nugget coin minted in Australia, which consists of a full kilogram of 99.9% pure gold. In 2012, the Perth Mint produced a 1-tonne coin of 99.99% pure gold with a face value of $1 million AUD, making it the largest minted coin in the world with a gold value of around $50 million AUD. China has produced coins in very limited quantities (less than 20 pieces minted) that exceed of gold. Austria has minted a coin containing 31 kg of gold (the Vienna Philharmonic Coin minted in 2004 with a face value of 100,000 euro). As a stunt to publicise the 99.999% pure one-ounce Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series, in 2007 the Royal Canadian Mint made a 100 kg 99.999% gold coin, with a face value of $1 million, and now manufactures them to order, but at a substantial premium over the market value of the gold.

The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe mints the gold Mosi-oa-Tunya (coin) which is recognized as legal tender at the market value for its gold content.

===Economic use===
Gold and silver, and sometimes other precious metals, are often seen as defensive assets against both inflation and economic downturn. Silver coins have become popular with collectors due to their relative affordability, and, unlike most gold and platinum issues which are valued based upon the markets, silver issues are more often valued as collectibles, at far higher than their bullion value.

===Industrial use===
Platinum and palladium are key catalysts in hydrogenation reactions and emission-reducing catalytic converters, while gold is used in oxidation reactions and nanotechnology due to its stability. Platinum group metals(PGMs) have been used in the production of sulfuric and nitric acid for centuries. Additionally, gold and silver nanoparticles are used in biosensors and solar cells, underscoring their value in sustainable technologies.

=== Cultural and artistic use ===
Precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum have been used for millennia to create objects of cultural and artistic significance. In jewelry, they are a cornerstone for crafting wedding bands, engagement rings, and ceremonial adornments, often symbolizing love, commitment, and social status.

Beyond jewelry, these metals are employed in fine art, including sculptures, decorative artifacts, and religious icons, showcasing their versatility and aesthetic appeal. Wedding bands, in particular, remain a significant driver of demand for gold and platinum, blending economic and cultural value.

As modern tastes evolve, the use of recycled metals and innovative designs has brought a sustainable dimension to their cultural and artistic applications, reflecting contemporary values while maintaining their historical significance.

==Aluminium== 
Aluminium is now commonplace but was considered to be a precious metal until the late 1800s. Although aluminium is the third most abundant element and the most abundant metal in the Earth&#x27;s crust, it was at first found to be exceedingly difficult to extract the metal from its various non-metallic ores. The great expense of refining the metal made the small available quantity of pure aluminium more valuable than gold. Bars of aluminium were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1855, and Napoleon III&#x27;s most important guests were given aluminium cutlery, while those less worthy dined with mere silver. In 1884, the pyramidal capstone of the Washington Monument was cast of 100 ounces of pure aluminium. By that time, aluminium was as expensive as silver. The statue of Anteros atop the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain (1885–1893) in London&#x27;s Piccadilly Circus is also of cast aluminium. Over time, however, the price of the metal has dropped. The dawn of commercial electric generation in 1882 and the invention of the Hall–Héroult process in 1886 caused the price of aluminium to drop substantially over a short period of time.

<doc id="180222" wikidata="Q296039" url="?curid=180222" title="James LaBrie">
<text>Kevin James LaBrie (born May 5, 1963) is a Canadian singer, best known as the lead singer of American progressive metal band Dream Theater, which he has been fronting since 1991.

==Early life==
Kevin James LaBrie was born in Penetanguishene, Ontario, Canada and started playing drums at age five. By his mid-teens, he was a member of several bands as a front man that attempted singing and/or drumming. He stopped playing drums at age 17 and in 1981, at age 18, he moved to Toronto.

==Career==

===Coney Hatch===
LaBrie joined Coney Hatch in 1986 when they were attempting a new lineup. The band recorded a number of demonstration tapes in their rehearsal studio and performed live in Ontario clubs for several months. When their record company (Anthem) expressed their disapproval of the lineup, the band replaced LaBrie with Phil Naro in one last ditched attempt at forging ahead without Carl Dixon. That lineup was to be short lived as well. 

===Winter Rose===
Soon after parting ways with Coney Hatch, LaBrie became the vocalist for the glam metal band Winter Rose. The group also included Richard Chycki on guitar and bass, Randy Cooke on drums, and (in an earlier incarnation), Sebastian Bach on vocals. Chycki had also worked with Bach under the band names &#x27;Hope&#x27;, and later &#x27;Sebastian&#x27;, before settling on &#x27;Winter Rose&#x27;. The band recorded a series of demos through 1988 and 1989 with supporting musicians Bruce Dies and Rob Laidlaw. Most tracks weren&#x27;t commercially released until 1997 when a self-titled album was released by Inside Out Music, a full 7 years after the group had disbanded. Their track &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall In Love Again&quot; was released with a promo video in 1989 and would later be included on the album. All songs on the album were written by Richard Chycki and James LaBrie, save two which were written in whole by Richard Chycki.

===Dream Theater===

In 1990, LaBrie learned that American progressive metal band Dream Theater was looking for a new singer, so he submitted a tape and was quickly flown to New York for a full audition. The tryout went well, and he was chosen ahead of 200 other hopefuls to fill the full-time vocalist position in that band.

LaBrie has since had a significant impact on the vocal melodies on each Dream Theater album, but until recently has had little input on the instrumentation of Dream Theater&#x27;s music; 2011&#x27;s &quot;A Dramatic Turn of Events&quot; features LaBrie in the music credits on three songs. To date he has written or co-written lyrics for at least one song on eleven of the sixteen albums Dream Theater has released with him in the band, &quot;Images and Words,&quot; &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;, &quot;Dream Theater&quot; and &quot;The Astonishing&quot; containing none of them.

Asked by Prog-Sphere.com what is his favorite Dream Theater song to play live, James says &quot;The favorite song for me is Scarred, I love performing that live. And... well, Octavarium, that whole freakin’ thing.&quot;

===Solo===
With Matt Guillory, LaBrie has released five solo albums under various names (Mullmuzzler, James LaBrie&#x27;s Mullmuzzler, and simply James LaBrie).

In an interview from &quot;Beyond The Dark Horizon&quot; on June 12, 2010, James LaBrie stated that his next solo album entitled &quot;Static Impulse&quot;, is in the mixing stages and will contain 12 tracks. James stated &quot;It&#x27;s very heavy and I&#x27;m really excited.&quot;

On July 27, 2010 it was announced on Dream Theater&#x27;s website that &quot;Static Impulse&quot; would be released on September 27, 2010 through Inside Out Music. It features longtime collaborator Matt Guillory on keyboards, Marco Sfogli (who also played on LaBrie&#x27;s earlier album &quot;Elements of Persuasion&quot;) on guitars, Peter Wildoer of the Swedish melodic death metal band Darkane on drums and screaming vocals, and Ray Riendeau on bass.

James LaBrie stated &quot;The release of &quot;Static Impulse&quot; is one that the whole band is psyched about. This is modern metal and as heavy and relevant as any other band out there going in a similar musical direction. There are riffs that will blow your head off and melodies both musically and vocally that are hypnotic. Get in the driver&#x27;s seat and let the ears bleed. Enjoy and see you out there with a tour to follow up and support this release.&quot;

In 2011&#x27;s interview for Prog-Sphere.com, LaBrie stated that the US tour got cancelled, saying &quot;Because it was so disorganized last time. That&#x27;s why I basically said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t have the visas yet. Where we&#x27;re at this point, by the time you get the visas processed, we&#x27;re gonna have one rehearsal and then we&#x27;re gonna go out.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not doing that.&#x27;&quot;

In July 2013, LaBrie&#x27;s album &quot;Impermanent Resonance&quot; was released by Inside Out Music.

===Other projects===
Throughout his career with Dream Theater, LaBrie has lent his voice to many other artists&#x27; records as well as tribute albums. In 1991, not long after joining Dream Theater (and before ever appearing on a Dream Theater recording), he sang background vocals on the song &quot;Life in Still Water&quot; on Fates Warning&#x27;s &quot;Parallels&quot; album. He has appeared on many Trent Gardner releases (including &quot;Leonardo: The Absolute Man&quot; and &quot;Explorer&#x27;s Club&quot;), as well as appearing on albums by such artists as Shadow Gallery, Tim Donahue and Frameshift.

LaBrie provided the lead vocals for the main character in the rock opera album &quot;The Human Equation&quot; by Ayreon; in 2015, he reprised his role for a live version, &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;. He was also featured as the character &quot;The Historian&quot; in the album &quot;The Source&quot;.

LaBrie is also a featured vocalist on Henning Pauly&#x27;s &quot;Babysteps&quot; project released in 2006; LaBrie plays the role of the arrogant doctor.

Since 2004, LaBrie has been working with the True Symphonic Rockestra project, along with Thomas Dewald, Vladimir Grishko, Dirk Ulrich, Christoph Wansleben, Sandro Martinez, Paul Mayland, Marvin Philippi, and Igor Marin.
Their album, &quot;Concerto in True Minor - 3 Rock Tenors&quot; was released on iTunes and for download on Amazon on March 28, 2008, by Brainworx and Marinsound.

In 2016 LaBrie was the special guest on the Last Union debut album firstly meant to be named &quot;Most Beautiful Day&quot;. He sang in three songs: &quot;President Evil&quot;, &quot;Taken&quot; and &quot;A Place In Heaven&quot;. Eventually the album was called &quot;Twelve&quot; and finally released on December 21, 2018. &quot;Twelve&quot; was written and pieced together over a -year period.

==Personal life==

LaBrie had said in many older interviews that he was Christian, and actively practiced the religion. However, in 2005 he revealed that he&#x27;s since strayed from organized religion, and now considers himself &quot;a more spiritual-directed person&quot;.

In an interview with Elizabeth Zharoff, LaBrie said he met his wife Karen in high school. As of 2022, they have been married for 33 years.

==Singing==

===Influences===
His musical influences comes from many different genres, including such artists as Sebastian Bach, Aerosmith, Don Dokken, Metallica, The Doors, Ludwig van Beethoven, Nat King Cole, Queen, Sting, and Muse whose inspiration, according to LaBrie, is shown on Dream Theater&#x27;s album, &quot;Octavarium&quot;. LaBrie lists Freddie Mercury as his &quot;all-time favorite&quot; singer, and also admires such singers as Steve Perry, Lou Gramm, Rob Halford, Steven Tyler, Robert Plant, and Jeff Buckley, among others.

===Reception===
He was voted by fans to #16 on MusicRadar&#x27;s &quot;The greatest vocalists of all time&quot; in 2010.

===Food poisoning incident===
On December 30, 1994, while vacationing in Cuba, LaBrie was stricken with a severe case of food poisoning from contaminated pork and while vomiting, he ruptured his vocal cords. He saw three throat specialists who all said there was nothing they could do except have him rest his voice as much as possible. However, on January 12, 1995, against doctor&#x27;s orders, he was on the Waking Up the World Tour in Japan promoting Dream Theater&#x27;s &quot;Awake&quot; album with his voice far from normal. LaBrie has said he did not feel vocally &quot;normal&quot; until at least 2002. He has also said that this era was a very hard time for him as a singer, and depression as a result caused him to consider departing from the band, although his bandmates supported him and urged him to stay. After the World Tourbulence tour, he discovered that his voice had fully returned. He said that his voice was fully healed by time and training. However, while speaking to Greg Prato of Songfacts in 2019, LaBrie explained how the incident affected his vocal range. &quot;So, instead of hitting D&#x27;s and E&#x27;s and F-sharps and all that stuff, I was able to hit C, C-sharp, and D. But I had to really watch it. I have hit F notes here and there, but I have to really watch it. But that was probably the darkest moment in my life, for sure.&quot;

===Lip syncing allegations===
In February of 2022, rumors emerged of LaBrie lip syncing during the North American leg of Dream Theater&#x27;s Top of the World Tour as fan recordings from the tour were posted online. Specifically, fans pointed to the post-chorus section of the song &quot;Bridges In The Sky&quot; as evidence of LaBrie lip syncing to a pre-recorded vocal track. LaBrie addressed the controversy onstage during the band&#x27;s performance in Houston, Texas, on March 18, 2022, denying the allegations and claiming he has never lip synced in his entire life.

<doc id="180223" wikidata="Q106447" url="?curid=180223" title="Palearctic realm">
<text>The Palearctic or Palaearctic is a biogeographic realm of the Earth, the largest of eight. Confined almost entirely to the Eastern Hemisphere, it stretches across all of Eurasia north of the foothills of the Himalayas, and North Africa.

The realm consists of several bioregions, variously spanning the Euro-Siberian region; the Mediterranean Basin; North Africa; North Arabia; and Western, Central and East Asia. The Palaearctic realm also has numerous rivers and lakes, forming several freshwater ecoregions.

Both the eastern and westernmost extremes of the Paleartic span into the Western Hemisphere, including Cape Dezhnyov in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug the to the east and Iceland to the west. The term was first used in the 19th century, and is still in use as the basis for zoogeographic classification.

==History==
In an 1858 paper for the &quot;Proceedings of the Linnean Society&quot;, British zoologist Philip Sclater first identified six terrestrial zoogeographic realms of the world: Palaearctic, Aethiopian/Afrotropic, Indian/Indomalayan, Australasian, Nearctic, and Neotropical. The six indicated general groupings of fauna, based on shared biogeography and large-scale geographic barriers to migration.

Alfred Wallace adopted Sclater&#x27;s scheme for his book &quot;The Geographical Distribution of Animals&quot;, published in 1876. This is the same scheme that persists today, with relatively minor revisions, and the addition of two more realms: Oceania and the Antarctic realm.

==Major ecological regions==

The Palearctic realm includes mostly boreal/subarctic-climate and temperate-climate ecoregions, which run across Eurasia from western Europe to the Bering Sea.

===Euro-Siberian region===

The boreal and temperate Euro-Siberian region is the Palearctic&#x27;s largest biogeographic region, which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of Russia and Scandinavia to the vast taiga, the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent. South of the taiga are a belt of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. This vast Euro-Siberian region is characterized by many shared plant and animal species, and has many affinities with the temperate and boreal regions of the Nearctic realm of North America. Eurasia and North America were often connected by the Bering land bridge, and have very similar mammal and bird fauna, with many Eurasian species having moved into North America, and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia. Many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single Holarctic realm. The Palearctic and Nearctic also share many plant species, which botanists call the Arcto-Tertiary Geoflora.

===Mediterranean Basin===

The lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea in southern Europe, north Africa, and western Asia are home to the Mediterranean Basin ecoregions, which together constitute the world&#x27;s largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world, with generally mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean basin&#x27;s mosaic of Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub are home to 13,000 endemic species. The Mediterranean basin is also one of the world&#x27;s most endangered biogeographic regions; only 4% of the region&#x27;s original vegetation remains, and human activities, including overgrazing, deforestation, and conversion of lands for pasture, agriculture, and urbanization, have degraded much of the region. Formerly the region was mostly covered with forests and woodlands, but heavy human use has reduced much of the region to the sclerophyll shrublands known as chaparral, matorral, maquis, or garrigue. Conservation International has designated the Mediterranean basin as one of the world&#x27;s biodiversity hotspots.

===Sahara and Arabian deserts===
A great belt of deserts, including the Atlantic coastal desert, Sahara Desert, and Arabian Desert, separates the Palearctic and Afrotropic ecoregions. This scheme includes these desert ecoregions in the palearctic realm; other biogeographers identify the realm boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north, which places the deserts in the Afrotropic, while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert.

===Western and Central Asia===
The Caucasus mountains, which run between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, are a particularly rich mix of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, and include the temperate rain forests of the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests ecoregion.

Central Asia and the Iranian plateau are home to dry steppe grasslands and desert basins, with montane forests, woodlands, and grasslands in the region&#x27;s high mountains and plateaux. In southern Asia the boundary of the Palearctic is largely altitudinal. The middle altitude foothills of the Himalaya between about form the boundary between the Palearctic and Indomalaya ecoregions.

===East Asia===
China, Korea and Japan are more humid and temperate than adjacent Siberia and Central Asia, and are home to rich temperate coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, which are now mostly limited to mountainous areas, as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use. East Asia was not much affected by glaciation in the ice ages, and retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera, while Europe retained only 27 percent. In the subtropical region of southern China and southern edge of the Himalayas, the Palearctic temperate forests transition to the subtropical and tropical forests of Indomalaya, creating a rich and diverse mix of plant and animal species. The mountains of southwest China are also designated as a biodiversity hotspot. In Southeastern Asia, high mountain ranges form tongues of Palearctic flora and fauna in northern Indochina and southern China. Isolated small outposts (sky islands) occur as far south as central Myanmar (on Nat Ma Taung, ), northernmost Vietnam (on Fan Si Pan, ) and the high mountains of Taiwan.

===Freshwater===
The realm contains several important freshwater ecoregions as well, including the heavily developed rivers of Europe, the rivers of Russia, which flow into the Arctic, Baltic, Black, and Caspian seas, Siberia&#x27;s Lake Baikal, the oldest and deepest lake on the planet, and Japan&#x27;s ancient Lake Biwa.

One bird family, the accentors (Prunellidae), is endemic to the Palearctic region. The Holarctic has four other endemic bird families: the divers or loons (Gaviidae), grouse (Tetraoninae), auks (Alcidae), and waxwings (Bombycillidae).

There are no endemic mammal orders in the region, but several families are endemic: Calomyscidae (mouse-like hamsters), Prolagidae, and Ailuridae (red pandas). Several mammal species originated in the Palearctic and spread to the Nearctic during the Ice Age, including the brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;, known in North America as the grizzly), red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) in Europe and the closely related elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;) in far eastern Siberia, American bison (&quot;Bison bison&quot;), and reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;, known in North America as the caribou).

===Megafaunal extinctions===
Several large Palearctic animals became extinct from the end of the Pleistocene into historic times, including Irish elk (&quot;Megaloceros giganteus&quot;), aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;), woolly rhinoceros (&quot;Coelodonta antiquitatis&quot;), woolly mammoth (&quot;Mammuthus primigenius&quot;), North African elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana pharaoensis&quot;), Chinese elephant (&quot;Elephas maximus rubridens&quot;), cave bear (&quot;Ursus spelaeus&quot;), Straight tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) and European lion (&quot;Panthera leo europaea&quot;).

<doc id="180224" wikidata="Q385348" url="?curid=180224" title="Proscenium">
<text>A proscenium (, ) is the virtual vertical plane of space in a theatre, usually surrounded on the top and sides by a physical proscenium arch (whether or not truly &quot;arched&quot;) and on the bottom by the stage floor itself, which serves as the frame into which the audience observes from a more or less unified angle the events taking place upon the stage during a theatrical performance. The concept of the fourth wall of the theatre stage space that faces the audience is essentially the same.

It can be considered as a social construct which divides the actors and their stage-world from the audience which has come to witness it. But since the curtain usually comes down just behind the proscenium arch, it has a physical reality when the curtain is down, hiding the stage from view. The same plane also includes the drop, in traditional theatres of modern times, from the stage level to the &quot;stalls&quot; level of the audience, which was the original meaning of the &quot;proscaenium&quot; in Roman theatres, where this mini-facade was given more architectural emphasis than is the case in modern theatres. A proscenium stage is structurally different from a thrust stage or an arena stage, as explained below.

==Origin==
In later Hellenistic Greek theatres the proskenion (προσκήνιον) was a rather narrow raised stage where solo actors performed, while the Greek chorus and musicians remained in the &quot;orchestra&quot; in front and below it, and there were often further areas for performing from above and behind the proskenion, on and behind the skene. &quot;Skene&quot; is the Greek word (meaning &quot;tent&quot;) for the tent, and later building, at the back of the stage from which actors entered, and which often supported painted scenery. In the Hellenistic period it became an increasingly large and elaborate stone structure, often with three storeys. In Greek theatre, which unlike Roman included painted scenery, the proskenion might also carry scenery.

In ancient Rome, the stage area in front of the scaenae frons (equivalent to the Greek skene) was known as the &quot;pulpitum&quot;, and the vertical front dropping from the stage to the &quot;orchestra&quot; floor, often in stone and decorated, as the proscaenium, again meaning &quot;in front of the &quot;skene&quot;&quot;.

In the Greek and Roman theatre, no proscenium arch existed, in the modern sense, and the acting space was always fully in the view of the audience. However, Roman theatres were similar to modern proscenium theatres in the sense that the entire audience had a restricted range of views on the stage—all of which were from the front, rather than the sides or back. 

==Renaissance==

The oldest surviving indoor theatre of the modern era, the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza (1585), is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the first example of a proscenium theatre. The Teatro Olimpico was an academic reconstruction of a Roman theatre. It has a plain &quot;proscaenium&quot; at the front of the stage, dropping to the &quot;orchestra&quot; level, now usually containing &quot;stalls&quot; seating, but no proscenium arch.

However, the Teatro Olimpico&#x27;s exact replication of the open and accessible Roman stage was the exception rather than the rule in sixteenth-century theatre design. Engravings suggest that the proscenium arch was already in use as early as 1560 at a production in Siena.

The earliest true proscenium arch to survive in a permanent theatre is the Teatro Farnese in Parma (1618), many earlier such theatres having been lost. Parma has a clearly defined &quot;boccascena&quot;, or scene mouth, as Italians call it, more like a picture frame than an arch but serving the same purpose: to deineate the stage and separate the audience from its action.

==Baroque==
While the proscenium arch became an important feature of the traditional European theatre, often becoming very large and elaborate, the original &quot;proscaenium&quot; front below the stage became plainer.

The introduction of an orchestra pit for musicians during the Baroque era further devalued the &quot;proscaenium&quot;, bringing the lowest level of the audience&#x27;s view forward to the front of the pit, where a barrier, typically in wood, screened the pit. What the Romans would have called the &quot;proscaenium&quot; is, in modern theatres with orchestra pits, normally painted black in order that it does not draw attention.

==Confusion around Teatro Olimpico==
In this early modern recreation of a Roman theatre, confusion seems to have been introduced to the use of the revived term in Italian. This emulation of the Roman model extended to refer to the stage area as the &quot;proscenium&quot;, and some writers have incorrectly referred to the theatre&#x27;s scaenae frons as a proscenium, and have even suggested that the central archway in the middle of the scaenae frons was the inspiration for the later development of the full-size proscenium arch. There is no evidence at all for this assumption (indeed, contemporary illustrations of performances at the Teatro Olimpico clearly show that the action took place in front of the scaenae frons and that the actors were rarely framed by the central archway).

The Italian word for a scaenae frons is &quot;&quot;proscenio&quot;,&quot; a major change from Latin. One modern translator explains the wording problem that arises here: &quot;[In this translation from Italian,] we retain the Italian &quot;proscenio&quot; in the text; it cannot be rendered &quot;proscenium&quot; for obvious reasons; and there is no English equivalent ... It would also be possible to retain the classical &quot;frons scaenae&quot;. The Italian &quot;arco scenico&quot; has been translated as &quot;proscenium arch.&quot;

In practice, however, the stage in the Teatro Olimpico runs from one edge of the seating area to the other, and only a very limited framing effect is created by the coffered ceiling over the stage and by the partition walls at the corners of the stage where the seating area abuts the floorboards. The result is that in this theatre &quot;the architectural spaces for the audience and the action ... are distinct in treatment yet united by their juxtaposition; no proscenium arch separates them.&quot;

==Function==
A proscenium arch creates a &quot;window&quot; around the scenery and performers. The advantages are that it gives everyone in the audience a good view because the performers need only focus on one direction rather than continually moving around the stage to give a good view from all sides. A proscenium theatre layout also simplifies the hiding and obscuring of objects from the audience&#x27;s view (sets, performers not currently performing, and theatre technology). Anything that is not meant to be seen is simply placed outside the &quot;window&quot; created by the proscenium arch, either in the wings or in the flyspace above the stage. The phrase &quot;breaking the proscenium&quot; or &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; refers to when a performer addresses the audience directly as part of the dramatic production.

Proscenium theatres have fallen out of favor in some theatre circles because they perpetuate the fourth wall concept. The staging in proscenium theatres often implies that the characters performing on stage are doing so in a four-walled environment, with the &quot;wall&quot; facing the audience being invisible. Many modern theatres attempt to do away with the fourth wall concept and so are instead designed with a thrust stage that projects out of the proscenium arch and &quot;reaches&quot; into the audience (technically, this can still be referred to as a proscenium theatre because it still contains a proscenium arch, but the term thrust stage is more specific and more widely used).

In dance history, the use of the proscenium arch has affected dance in different ways. Prior to the use of proscenium stages, early court ballets took place in large chambers where the audience members sat around and above the dance space. The performers, often led by the queen or king, focused in symmetrical figures and patterns of symbolic meaning. Ballet&#x27;s choreographic patterns were being born. In addition, since dancing was considered a way of socializing, most of the court ballets finished with a ‘grand ballet’ followed by a ball in which the members of the audience joined the performance.

Later on, the use of the proscenium stage for performances established a separation of the audience from the performers. Therefore, more devotion was placed on the performers, and in what was occurring in the ‘show.’ It was the beginning of dance-performance as a form of entertainment like we know it today. Since the use of the proscenium stages, dances have developed and evolved into more complex figures, patterns, and movements. At this point, it was not only significantly important how the performers arrived to a certain shape on the stage during a performance, but also how graciously they executed their task. Additionally, these stages allowed for the use of stage effects generated by ingenious machinery. It was the beginning of scenography design, and perhaps also it was also the origin of the use of backstage personnel or &quot;stage hands&quot;.

==Other forms of theatre staging==
* Traverse stage: The stage is surrounded on two sides by the audience.
* Thrust stage: The stage is surrounded on three sides (or 270°) by audience. Can be a modification of a proscenium stage. Sometimes known as &quot;three quarter round&quot;. Also known as an apron stage.
* Theatre in the round: The stage is surrounded by audience on all sides.
* Black box theatre: The theatre is a large rectangular room with black walls and a flat floor. The seating is typically composed of loose chairs on platforms, which can be easily moved or removed to allow the entire space to be adapted to the artistic elements of a production. 
* Site-specific theatre (a.k.a. environmental theatre): The stage and audience either blend together, or are in numerous or oddly shaped sections. Includes any form of staging that is not easily classifiable under the above categories.

<doc id="180225" wikidata="Q739122" url="?curid=180225" title="Designing Women">
<text>Designing Women is an American television sitcom created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason that aired on CBS between September 29, 1986 and May 24, 1993, producing seven seasons and 163 episodes. It was a joint production of Bloodworth/Thomason Mozark Productions in association with Columbia Pictures Television for CBS.

The series centers on the lives of four women and one man working together at an interior design firm in 1980s Atlanta, Georgia, called Sugarbaker &amp; Associates. It originally starred Dixie Carter as Julia Sugarbaker, president of the design firm; Delta Burke as Suzanne Sugarbaker, the design firm&#x27;s and Julia&#x27;s ex-beauty queen sister; Annie Potts as head designer Mary Jo Shively; and Jean Smart as office manager Charlene Frazier. In the third season, Meshach Taylor was given a starring role for his previously recurring character of delivery man and later partner Anthony Bouvier. Later in its run, the series gained notoriety for its well-publicized behind-the-scenes conflicts and cast changes. Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks replaced Burke and Smart for season six, but Duffy was not brought back for the seventh and final season, and she was replaced by Judith Ivey.

==Premise==
Julia Sugarbaker (Dixie Carter) is an elegant, sophisticated, outspoken woman who is the co-founder and president of Sugarbaker &amp; Associates, an interior design firm located in her own home in Atlanta. She is partnered with her younger sister, Suzanne (Delta Burke), an attractive, selfish, self-centered former Miss Georgia World, who invested her money but does not have an official position within the business. Naïve but sweet-natured Charlene Frazier (Jean Smart), who worked as a secretary for Julia&#x27;s late husband, Hayden, also invested half of her savings at Sugarbaker&#x27;s and works as office manager. Charlene&#x27;s next-door neighbor and recently divorced best friend, Mary Jo Shively (Annie Potts), is the main interior designer of the firm and also a full partner.

Alongside the women, there is Anthony Bouvier (Meshach Taylor), an ex-convict who is hired as the company&#x27;s deliveryman and later becomes a full partner. By late 1986, Julia and Suzanne&#x27;s mother, Perky (Louise Latham), comes for a visit with her outrageous best friend Bernice Clifton (Alice Ghostley). Perky does not stay long and moves to Japan, leaving Bernice in Atlanta, where she begins to spend time with the others.

At the end of the fifth season, actress Delta Burke left the show after a much-publicized feud with the show&#x27;s producers, so her character, Suzanne, moved to Japan to join her mother, Perky. Actress Jean Smart also left at the beginning of the sixth season after deciding she wanted to spend more time with her young child.

To handle Smart&#x27;s departure, her character, Charlene, moved to England with her Air Force husband and their daughter. Julia and Suzanne&#x27;s obnoxious cousin Allison (Julia Duffy) acquires Suzanne&#x27;s share of the design firm and also rents her home. Charlene&#x27;s sister Carlene (Jan Hooks) moves in with her. Carlene also begins working at Sugarbaker&#x27;s, filling the office manager vacancy that older sister Charlene left behind.

Allison (Duffy) left after the sixth season. Texan widow Bonnie Jean Poteet (Judith Ivey), was written in for season seven. These changes failed to hold the attention of viewers who enjoyed the original cast of the first five seasons. &quot;Designing Women&quot; was cancelled after the seventh season.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
*Dixie Carter as Julia Sugarbaker, president and founder of Sugarbaker &amp; Associates interior design firm. Elegant and classy, but outspoken and opinionated, Julia is known for a no-nonsense demeanor; throughout the course of the show, Julia has several monologues and speeches from a feminist and liberal perspective, and is known for telling people off, earning her the nickname of &quot;The Terminator&quot;. She is very protective of her sister Suzanne, even though she is usually the first one to criticize her egocentric statements. Julia is notable as a very talented singer, usually performing in her church choir, and, later on, she also pretends to be a cabaret singer under the pseudonym &quot;Giselle&quot;.
*Annie Potts as Mary Jo Shively, Sugarbaker&#x27;s main designer. Mary Jo is a sarcastic but kind person and a devoted single mother of two. 
*Jean Smart as Charlene Frazier-Stillfield (seasons 1–5; guest star: season 6), Julia&#x27;s late husband&#x27;s former secretary and now office manager of Sugarbaker&#x27;s. Originally from a large family in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Charlene is naïve and sweet-hearted, whose ditziness can be annoying for her co-workers. She&#x27;s one of Elvis&#x27; biggest fans and worked with several big names while secretary in Arkansas, including Fred Smith, Sam Walton and Bill Clinton. Eventually, Charlene marries Colonel William Stillfield and they have a baby, Olivia. By 1991, they move to England, leaving her younger sister, Carlene, to fill in for her at Sugarbaker&#x27;s.
*Delta Burke as Suzanne Sugarbaker (seasons 1–5), Julia&#x27;s younger sister and a silent partner at Sugarbaker&#x27;s. A former beauty queen and alumna of Ole Miss, Suzanne is self-centered and vain, and generally more laissez-faire and traditional in contrast to her sister&#x27;s views. Thrice-divorced, Suzanne usually dates wealthy elderly men who are terminally ill. During the series, she deals with weight gain and confronts issues of body image for women. In 1991, Suzanne sells all of her shares and moves to Japan to live with her mother.
*Meshach Taylor as Anthony Bouvier (recurring: seasons 1–2, main: seasons 3–7), an ex-convict and a law student, who works as Sugarbaker&#x27;s delivery man until 1990 and then becomes a full partner. Anthony is very close to his co-workers but develops a special relationship with Suzanne throughout the series. After he is dumped by his girlfriend, Vanessa Chamberlain (Jackeé Harry), BJ sets up a trip to Las Vegas where a drunk Anthony marries a Folies Bergère singer, Etienne (Sheryl Lee Ralph). He eventually falls in love with her and tries to make the marriage work.
*Julia Duffy as Allison Sugarbaker (season 6), Julia and Suzanne&#x27;s conservative cousin who becomes a partner at Sugarbaker &amp; Associates. Allison comes from New York City for a visit after buying Suzanne&#x27;s shares and decides to move back to the South, taking possession of Suzanne&#x27;s house as well, which Anthony had been renting. They eventually became housemates, but are always arguing because of her attempts to throw him out. After one year being a partner at the design firm, Allison decides to invest in a Victoria&#x27;s Secret franchise, leaving Atlanta and Sugarbaker&#x27;s behind.
*Jan Hooks as Carlene Frazier-Dobber (seasons 6–7), Charlene&#x27;s naïve younger sister from Poplar Bluff, Missouri, who becomes a receptionist at Sugarbaker&#x27;s after divorcing her car salesman husband, Dwayne Dobber.
*Judith Ivey as Bonnie Jean &quot;BJ&quot; Poteet (season 7), a lively and sharp-witted Texas millionaire who becomes a Sugarbaker &amp; Associates partner after Allison sells her shares. Her late husband James Poteet, a successful tycoon, had a heart attack during their wedding reception, leaving her the control of his Atlanta-based company, Poteet Industries.

===Recurring===

*Olivia Brown as Vanessa Hargraves (season 4), Anthony&#x27;s girlfriend
*Hal Holbrook as Reese Watson (seasons 1–4), Julia&#x27;s love interest, a widowed and successful Atlanta attorney (the character was killed off in season 5 so Holbrook could appear on &quot;Evening Shade&quot;)
*Alice Ghostley as Bernice Clifton, the Sugarbakers&#x27; eccentric family friend; Ghostley was billed as a &quot;Special Guest Star&quot; throughout the series

==Episodes==

==Filming locations==
The exterior of the house seen in the series as the location of the Sugarbakers&#x27; design firm is the Angelo Marre House located in the historic Quapaw Quarter district in Little Rock, Arkansas.

The home of Suzanne Sugarbaker seen in the series is the Arkansas Governor&#x27;s Mansion, also in the Quapaw Quarter. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Critical reception==
When the show debuted in CBS&#x27;s Monday-night lineup in 1986, it garnered respectable ratings; however, CBS moved the show several times to other time slots. After dismal ratings in Sunday night and Thursday night time slots, CBS placed it on hiatus and was ready to cancel the show, but a viewer campaign saved the show and returned it to its Monday night slot. The show&#x27;s ratings solidified, and it regularly landed in the top 20 rankings. From 1989 through 1992, &quot;Designing Women&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (which also centered around a strong, opinionated female character) aired back-to-back, creating a very successful hour-long block for CBS, as both shows were thought to appeal to similar demographics. The show was a top 30 hit for three seasons, from 1989 to 1992, in which the 1989–1992 seasons made it the most successful of the time and helped CBS, which struggled in the ratings around the late 1980s. A move to the Friday night death slot in fall 1992 caused ratings to fall again and the series to be canceled.

==Political views==
Show creators Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and Harry Thomason were strong supporters of longtime friend and then-Democratic nominee for President of the United States, Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary. Midway through the seventh season, Julia is stranded in the airport while attempting to attend Clinton&#x27;s first inauguration, in an episode (&quot;The Odyssey&quot;) that aired five days prior. Earlier in the series, Charlene mentions working for Clinton during his Arkansas governorship. Another Clinton-related joke was the introduction during the sixth season of the prissy character, Allison Sugarbaker, who makes it quite clear to the others that she attended Wellesley College, Hillary&#x27;s alma mater. An early third season episode (&quot;The Candidate&quot;) also revolves around Julia running for commissioner; she debates on television against a conservative candidate, to whom she eventually loses.

In reality, Dixie Carter was a libertarian-leaning Republican who disagreed with some of the liberal views expressed by her onscreen character. However, she did support liberal causes, such as civil rights and same-sex marriage. Carter cut a deal with the Thomasons in which Julia would sing a song in a future episode for every liberal-leaning monologue.

She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Corvette Summer&quot; (1978) and won a Genie Award for &quot;Heartaches&quot; (1981), before appearing in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (1986), &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1986), &quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; (1989), &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989), &quot;&quot; (2021), and &quot;&quot; (2024). She voiced Bo Peep in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise (1995, 1999, and 2019) and in various Disney video games.

On television, Potts played Mary Jo Jackson Shively on the CBS sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; (1986–1993). She was nominated for a 1994 Primetime Emmy Award for playing Dana Palladino on the CBS sitcom &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; (1993–1995), she played teacher Louanne Johnson on ABC drama &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot; for one season 1996–1997, and was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award in 1998 and 1999 for playing Mary-Elizabeth &quot;M.E.&quot; Sims in the Lifetime drama series &quot;Any Day Now&quot; (1998–2002). Her other television credits include &quot;GCB&quot; (2012), &quot;The Fosters&quot; (2013–2018), and &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (2017–2024).

==Early life and education==
Potts was born in Nashville, Tennessee, the third child of Dorothy Harris (née Billingslea) and Powell Grisette Potts. She has two older sisters. They grew up in Franklin, Kentucky, where she graduated from Franklin-Simpson High School in 1970.

She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater. Potts and her first husband, Steven Hartley, were in a car crash that left several bones below her waist broken, including compound fractures to both legs, and caused the loss of the heel of her right foot. Hartley also lost his left leg.

==Career==
Potts made her debut on the big screen in 1978 in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer comedy film &quot;Corvette Summer&quot;, with Mark Hamill. She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1979 for her role in the film. In 1982, she won Genie Awards for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress for her role in the film &quot;Heartaches&quot;, about a young woman married to a stock car racer and carrying his friend&#x27;s child. In 1980, she played Edith Bedelmeyer, a woman who shared an attic apartment with three other women (played by Georgia Engel, Lorna Patterson, and Francine Tacker) on the short-lived comedy series &quot;Goodtime Girls&quot;.
Potts played receptionist Janine Melnitz in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film series; Potts created the character&#x27;s trademark New York accent based on a friend&#x27;s who was from the city. She then appeared as the pragmatic interior designer Mary Jo Shively on the CBS television sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; (1986–1993). She was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series in 1994 for her role as Dana Palladino on &quot;Love &amp; War&quot; (1993–1995). Other notable roles include Mary Elizabeth (O&#x27;Brien) Sims on the Lifetime Television drama series &quot;Any Day Now&quot; (1998–2002), for which she was nominated for two Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, the voice of Bo Peep in three of the &quot;Toy Story&quot; films, a supporting role in John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, and guest-starring roles on such CBS&#x27;s television series as &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Close to Home&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Men in Trees&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. She played a recurring role as Sophie Devere in the NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; from 2005 to 2009.

Potts has done work on audio books; including as the narrator and heroine of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Telegraph Days&quot;, winning the 2007 Audie Award for Solo Narration-Female, for her portrayal. She starred in the film version of McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Texasville&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;. She made her Broadway debut upon joining the cast of the Tony Award–winning play &quot;God of Carnage&quot; on November 17, 2009, succeeding Hope Davis in the role of Annette.

In 2012, Potts starred as Elizabeth &quot;Gigi&quot; Stopper in ABC&#x27;s comedy-drama series &quot;GCB&quot;, with Leslie Bibb, Kristin Chenoweth, Jennifer Aspen, Miriam Shor, and Marisol Nichols. She says she based her portrayal of the character on Dixie Carter, adding, &quot;Were she still alive, the role would have been hers and should have been.&quot; Potts also played a leading role in the 2012 Hallmark Channel original musical film &quot;The Music Teacher&quot;, about a high-school music teacher who is on the brink of losing her beloved school music program because of district budget cuts. In an effort to spare the program, Daley&#x27;s former students band together to stage a musical to raise money to keep the program alive.

In March 2013, Potts signed on for the lead role of the ABC comedy-drama pilot &quot;Murder in Manhattan&quot; about a mother and daughter who team up as amateur sleuths. ABC later looked for a cable network to distribute the series, opting not to air it on network television. In late 2013, it was announced that Potts would join Diane Paulus&#x27; revival of &quot;Pippin&quot; beginning January 21, 2014. She replaced Tony Award nominee Tovah Feldshuh in the role of Pippin&#x27;s grandmother Berthe. This marked her first appearance in a Broadway musical.

From 2017 to 2024, she was a series regular on the CBS sitcom &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;, playing Connie &quot;Meemaw&quot; Tucker, Sheldon&#x27;s maternal grandmother.

==Personal life==
Potts is the mother of three boys: one with her third husband Scott Senechal, and two with her fourth and current husband James Hayman.

<doc id="180232" wikidata="Q1949093" url="?curid=180232" title="Alex Van Halen">
<text>Alexander Arthur Van Halen ( , ; born May 8, 1953) is an American musician who was the drummer and a co-founder of the rock band Van Halen, which was formed in 1972 by Van Halen and his younger brother Eddie under the name &quot;Mammoth&quot; before adding Michael Anthony and David Lee Roth in 1974 and changing their name to Van Halen.

Warner Bros. signed the band in 1977, and the band&#x27;s debut album was released a year later. Prior to their disbandment in 2020, following Eddie&#x27;s death, Van Halen released 12 studio albums, and the brothers were the only two constant members of the band. Noted for his technical prowess, speed, and power, Alex Van Halen is widely regarded as one of the greatest drummers of all time.

== Early life ==
Van Halen was born in Amsterdam. The family name in Dutch is &quot;van Halen&quot; (with lower-case &#x27;v&#x27;) and is pronounced in Dutch as . His Dutch father, Jan van Halen (1920–1986), was an accomplished jazz saxophonist and clarinetist. His mother, Eugenia van Beers (1914–2005), was an Indo (Eurasian) from Rangkasbitung, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Alex spent his early years in Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands. The family moved to Pasadena, California, in 1962. The Dutch prefix &quot;van&quot; was capitalized by Alex&#x27;s parents during the family&#x27;s immigration to the US. Alex and his brother Eddie became naturalized U.S. citizens.

Both brothers were trained as classical pianists during childhood. Although Alex is known as a professional drummer, he began his musical aspirations as a guitarist, with his brother Eddie taking up drums. While Eddie was delivering newspapers to pay for his drum kit, Alex would practice playing on them. After spending some time playing Eddie&#x27;s drum kit, Alex became more skilled than Eddie was as a drummer. After Eddie heard Alex&#x27;s mastery of The Surfaris drum solo in the song &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, he decided to learn to play the electric guitar. Alex was influenced by Budgie drummer Ray Phillips.

Alex, Eddie and three other boys formed their first band, calling themselves &quot;The Broken Combs&quot;, while attending Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena, in which Alex played saxophone. When Eddie was in the fourth grade, they performed at lunchtime at the school.

In 1971, Van Halen graduated from Pasadena High School. He then took classes in music theory, scoring, composition and arranging at Pasadena City College for a short while. While there, Alex met Michael Anthony and David Lee Roth. They formed the band Mammoth, and Alex, along with the others, left Pasadena City College.

== Career ==
Alex and Eddie Van Halen had several early bands before the formation of Van Halen. In addition to The Broken Combs, there were The Space Brothers, The Trojan Rubber Company, and Mammoth.

In 1972, the brothers formed Mammoth with Mark Stone on bass and Eddie on lead vocals. The band rented David Lee Roth&#x27;s PA system for their shows. Soon after, Eddie became tired of singing lead, and asked Roth to join the band. Later, in 1974, since the name Mammoth was already taken by another band, the name was changed to Van Halen, and Stone was replaced by Michael Anthony. Roth has claimed that it was his idea to rename the band Van Halen, and that he actually named it after Alex. In addition to his musical duties at this time, Alex handled managerial duties, such as booking gigs, and the like for the band. Their 1978 self-titled debut album &quot;Van Halen&quot; was released to much fanfare, influencing many musicians in hard rock. Van Halen had released eleven more studio albums since then, and officially disbanded a month after Eddie&#x27;s death on October 6, 2020.

Although the term &quot;brown sound&quot; is generally associated with Eddie&#x27;s guitar, it was actually coined by Alex to refer to the sound of his snare drum.

Alex never recorded any music without his brother being involved, with Michael Anthony saying that &quot;the only person that he plays with is Ed.&quot; The only recording Alex has made outside of the band is playing keyboards on the Eddie Van Halen instrumental &quot;Respect the Wind&quot;, done for the &quot;Twister&quot; soundtrack and earning the Van Halen brothers a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In June 2024, Alex auctioned off all of his drum gear he had in storage for decades. This led people to believe that he will no longer be involved in music without his brother Edward on stage with him.

Alex released a book called &quot;Brothers&quot; on October 22, 2024 and commenced a 3 date promotional tour. 

==Equipment==
Van Halen endorses Ludwig drums, pedals and hardware, Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads and Regal Tip drumsticks. A Paiste endorser since March 1983, Van Halen, in co-operation with Paiste developed a signature ride cymbal—a 2002 24&quot; Big ride—which Paiste introduced at the 2010 Winter NAMM Show. He also had two Ludwig signature snares. Alex has used Rototoms and octobans in the past as well as electronic drums and is renowned for using extravagantly sized drum kits that feature an on-fire orchestral gong and four bass drums, having originally used only two.

Regal Tip created the Alex Van Halen signature drumsticks when he became an endorser.

== Influences ==
Van Halen&#x27;s main influences include Billy Cobham, Ginger Baker, Keith Moon and John Bonham, and he has cited jazz drummer Buddy Rich&#x27;s work as having an early and lifelong impact.

== Personal life ==
Van Halen married Valeri Kendall in June 1983, after a two-year engagement. The marriage ended in divorce two months later. In 1984 he married Kelly Carter. Their son Aric Van Halen, was born October 6, 1989. The couple divorced in August 1996. Carter was sued by Van Halen in 2013, over her commercial use of the &#x27;Van Halen&#x27; surname. The case was settled in 2015. His son Aric is a passionate runner and competed in the Olympic trials for the steeplechase in 2016. He is also a talented photographer.

Van Halen married his current wife, Stine Schyberg, in 2000. She is the mother of his son Malcolm Van Halen. Malcolm shares the passion of fast cars and racing with his father and uncle. 

Van Halen is the uncle of Wolfgang Van Halen.

Van Halen is an ordained minister. He presided at the second wedding of his brother Eddie in 2009 and his son Malcolm&#x27;s wedding in 2024.

Due to years of playing loud music, Alex is said to have major hearing loss in both ears. &quot;In 1995 Alex Van Halen complained to his stage engineer Jerry Harvey about it. He could no longer hear the band onstage and was putting his hearing in jeopardy. Harvey built a simple in-ear monitor using two speakers that were originally designed for a pacemaker. He tuned one for bass, the other for treble.&quot;

<text>A theatre-in-the-round, arena theatre, or central staging is a space for theatre in which the audience surrounds the stage.

Theatre-in-the-round was common in ancient theatre, particularly that of Greece and Rome, but was not widely explored again until the latter half of the 20th century.

The Glenn Hughes Penthouse Theatre in Seattle, Washington was the first theatre-in-the-round venue built in the United States. It first opened on May 19, 1940, with a production of &quot;Spring Dance&quot;, a comedy by playwright Philip Barry. The 160-seat theatre is located on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1947, Margo Jones established America&#x27;s first professional theatre-in-the-round company when she opened her Theater &#x27;47 in Dallas. The stage design as developed by Margo Jones was used by directors in later years for such well-known shows as &quot;Fun Home&quot;, the original stage production of &quot;Man of La Mancha,&quot; and all plays staged at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre (demolished in the 1960s), including Arthur Miller&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;After the Fall&quot;. Such theatres had previously existed in colleges, but not in professional theatre buildings.

Theater-in-the-round is a particularly appropriate setting for staging of dramas using Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;alienation effect&quot;, which stands in opposition to the more traditional &quot;Stanislavski technique&quot; in drama. Alienation techniques include visible lighting fixtures and other technical elements. Round theatres also allow lighting parts of the audience so that people are reminded that they are in a theatre watching a drama with others.

==Stage configuration==
The stage is always in the centre with the audience arranged on all sides, and is most commonly rectangular, circular, diamond, or triangular. Actors may enter and exit through the audience from different directions or from below the stage. The stage is usually on an even level with or below the audience in a &quot;pit&quot; or &quot;arena&quot; formation.

This configuration lends itself to high-energy productions and anything that requires audience participation. It is favoured by producers of classical theatre and it has continued as a creative alternative to the more common proscenium format.

In effect, theatre-in-the-round removes the fourth wall and brings the actor into the same space as the audience. This is often problematic for proscenium or end stage trained actors who are taught that they must never turn their backs to the audience, something that is unavoidable in this format. However, it allows for strong and direct engagement with the audience.

It is also employed when theatrical performances are presented in non-traditional spaces such as restaurants, public squares, or during street theater. Set design is usually minimal since it would obscure the audience&#x27;s view.

==History==
Theatre-in-the-round was common in ancient theatre, particularly that of Greece and Rome, but was not widely explored again until the latter half of the 20th century.

In Margo Jones&#x27; survey of theatre-in-the-round, the first two sources of central staging in the United States she identified were the productions by Azubah Latham and Milton Smith at Columbia University dating from 1914, and T. Earl Pardoe&#x27;s productions at Brigham Young University in 1922.

In 1924, Gilmor Brown founded the Fair Oaks Playbox in Pasadena, California, an important early practitioner of central staging in addition to other stage configurations that it pioneered in its advent of flexible staging. As Indicated by Jones, the centrally staged productions of the Fair Oaks Playbox were followed approximately eight years later by the work of Glenn Hughes in his Seattle Penthouse.

Stephen Joseph was the first to popularise the form in the United Kingdom from the US in the 1950s and set up theatres-in-the-round in Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Studio Theatre in Scarborough. The current theatre, opened in 1996, is known as the Stephen Joseph Theatre. Joseph was reputed to have once rhetorically asked, &quot;Why must authorities stand with their back to a wall?&quot; His answer was: &quot;So nobody can knife them from behind.&quot;

Sam Walters set up an impromptu performance space in the upstairs of the Orange Tree pub in Richmond, London in the early 1970s and subsequently moved across the road to a permanent Orange Tree Theatre.

In 1972, RG Gregory set up the Word and Action theatre company in Dorset in England to work exclusively in theatre-in-the-round. Gregory sought to create a grammar that would enable actors to maximise the form&#x27;s potential for connecting with the audience both as individuals and as a collective. All Word and Action productions were performed in normal lighting conditions, without costumes or makeup.

==Uses in television and concert halls==
The innovations of Margo Jones were an obvious influence on Albert McCleery when he created his &quot;Cameo Theatre&quot; for television in 1950. Continuing until 1955, McCleery offered dramas seen against pure black backgrounds instead of walls of a set. This enabled cameras in the darkness to pick up shots from any position.

Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 U.S. presidential campaign staged nine live televised question and answer sessions using a ground-breaking theatre-in-the-round format, adapted for a live televised audience. The first time use of the staging device was memorialized in the book, &quot;The Selling of the President 1968&quot; by Joe McGinniss. The producer of these Nixon &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; programs was Roger Ailes, who later went to on start Fox News. Ailes&#x27; innovation of the theatre-in-the-round format for candidate forums became the blueprint for modern &quot;town hall&quot; candidate formats and even multiple-candidate debates.

Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;68 Comeback Special&quot; TV program was performed with the musicians seated using a raised staging in-the-round format.

When an arena staging was conceived for the progressive-rock group Yes by their tour manager Jim Halley in the mid-1970s, it prompted a redesign of rock concerts and venue seating arrangements.

==The politics of the round==
The politics of theatre-in-the-round were explored most deliberately by RG Gregory. In his view the lit space of a proscenium arch is analogous to the seat of power; the audience adopts the role of passive receivers. In traditional theatre design, maximum care is taken with sight lines in order to ensure that the actor can engage every member of the audience at the same time.

However, once removed from the picture frame of the arch, the actors are compelled to turn their back on some members of the audience and so necessarily lose exclusive command of the acting space. All members of the audience can see the actor, but the actor can no longer see all of them. At this point, in order for the play to function, the audience themselves must be allowed to become key conductors of the meaning of the performance.

Some, like the writer Mick Fealty, have stressed a close analogy between Gregory&#x27;s description of the rudimentary dynamics of theater-in-the-round with the network effect of Internet-based communication in comparison to traditional broadcast and marketing channels.

==Arena stage archive==
George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia is home to the largest arena stage archive and contains material from the theatre&#x27;s 50-year history. Included in the collection are photographs, production notebooks, scrapbooks, playbills, oral histories and handwritten correspondence. According to their website, the total volume is or linear and is housed in the Fenwick Library.

==In popular culture==
*In the novel &quot;The Prestige&quot; by Christopher Priest, the magician Rupert Angier courts controversy by writing that stage magic should be performed &quot;in the round&quot; rather than in theatres with a proscenium arch.
*The English progressive rock band Yes were the first rock-era group to perform in-the-round during their 1978–79 Tormato tour. The band also performed using a round, rotating stage during portions of their Drama and Union tours in 1980 and 1991, respectively.
*The second tour of the global country-pop superstar Shania Twain, the Up! Tour (2003/04), had a stage configuration in the style of in-the-round. The tour was one of the most successful tours of 2004, and served to promote the RIAA diamond certified album, &quot;Up!&quot; (2002).
*The Into the Millennium Tour by the American boy band Backstreet Boys featured an in-the-round stage. The tour, which began in 1999 and ended in March 2000, is one of the most successful of all time.
*British rock band Def Leppard played in-the-round for several tours in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Their 1989 live VHS release was entitled &quot;&quot;. &quot;In-the-round is an incredibly, insanely aerobic kind of thing…&quot; remarked singer Joe Elliott, who gave up drinking on the &quot;Hysteria&quot; tour to cope with the physical demands. &quot;You can&#x27;t stand still; you&#x27;ve got to keep moving. The [other members of the band] had identical microphones on either side of the stage, so they could stand still for a little bit. I had to keep moving.&quot;
*To evoke a three-ring circus, American singer Britney Spears used an in-the-round setting for her 2009 &quot;The Circus Starring Britney Spears&quot; tour.
*Stand-up comedians have performed specials in-the-round, such as &quot;Dane Cook: Vicious Circle&quot; and Louis C.K.&#x27;s &quot;Oh My God&quot;.
* The Spice Girls used a circular, in-the-round stage for their Christmas in Spiceworld tour in 1999.
* U2&#x27;s 360° Tour used a very large circular stage.
* The Dixie Chicks&#x27; Top of the World Tour used a circular stage, except in venues where it was an end stage.
* Metallica have used a rectangular, diamond or oval-shaped stage in the center of the arena, beginning with their 1991 Wherever We May Roam Tour. On different tours, they have included an area within the stage, called &quot;the snake pit&quot;, where audience members can watch the show. Their 2012 European Black Album Tour used this format.
* In the musical &quot;The Producers&quot; Max Bialystock remarks that he invented &quot;theater in the square&quot;.
* Roger Waters&#x27; 2022 This Is Not a Drill tour is performed in-the-round with a large cross-shaped stage. Hanging overhead is a cross-shaped video screen arrangement that matches the shape of the stage.
* For the 2024-2025 Hit Me Hard and Soft: The Tour by Billie Eilish, Eilish is performing on a large rectangular in-the-round stage.

<doc id="180234" wikidata="Q182098" url="?curid=180234" title="Kilowatt-hour">
<text>A kilowatt-hour (unit symbol: kW⋅h or kW h; commonly written as kWh) is a non-SI unit of energy equal to 3.6 megajoules (MJ) in SI units, which is the energy delivered by one kilowatt of power for one hour. Kilowatt-hours are a common billing unit for electrical energy supplied by electric utilities. Metric prefixes are used for multiples and submultiples of the basic unit, the watt-hour (3.6 kJ).

==Definition==
The kilowatt-hour is a composite unit of energy equal to one kilowatt (kW) sustained for (multiplied by) one hour. The International System of Units (SI) unit of energy meanwhile is the joule (symbol J). Because a watt is by definition one joule per second, and because there are 3,600 seconds in an hour, one kWh equals 3,600 kilojoules or 3.6 MJ.

==Unit representations==
A widely used representation of the kilowatt-hour is &quot;kWh&quot;, derived from its component units, kilowatt and hour. It is commonly used in billing for delivered energy to consumers by electric utility companies, and in commercial, educational, and scientific publications, and in the media. It is also the usual unit representation in electrical power engineering. This common representation, however, does not comply with the style guide of the International System of Units (SI).

Other representations of the unit may be encountered:
* &quot;kW⋅h&quot; and &quot;kW h&quot; are less commonly used, but they are consistent with the SI. The SI brochure states that in forming a compound unit symbol, &quot;Multiplication must be indicated by a space or a half-high (centred) dot (⋅), since otherwise some prefixes could be misinterpreted as a unit symbol.&quot; This is supported by a standard issued jointly by an international (IEEE) and national (ASTM) organization, and by a major style guide. However, the IEEE/ASTM standard allows &quot;kWh&quot; (but does not mention other multiples of the watt-hour). One guide published by NIST specifically recommends against &quot;kWh&quot; &quot;to avoid possible confusion&quot;.
* In 2014, the United States official fuel-economy window sticker for electric vehicles used the abbreviation &quot;kW-hrs&quot;.
* Variations in capitalization are sometimes encountered: &quot;KWh&quot;, &quot;KWH&quot;, &quot;kwh&quot;, etc., which are inconsistent with the International System of Units.
* The notation &quot;kW/h&quot; for the kilowatt-hour is incorrect, as it denotes kilowatt per hour.

The hour is a unit of time listed among the non-SI units accepted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures for use with the SI. 

An electric heater consuming 1,000 watts (1 kilowatt) operating for one hour uses one kilowatt-hour of energy. A television consuming 100 watts operating continuously for 10 hours uses one kilowatt-hour. A 40-watt electric appliance operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt-hour.

==Electricity sales==
Electrical energy is typically sold to consumers in kilowatt-hours. The cost of running an electrical device is calculated by multiplying the device&#x27;s power consumption in kilowatts by the operating time in hours, and by the price per kilowatt-hour. The unit price of electricity charged by utility companies may depend on the customer&#x27;s consumption profile over time. Prices vary considerably by locality. In the United States prices in different states can vary by a factor of three.

While smaller customer loads are usually billed only for energy, transmission services, and the rated capacity, larger consumers also pay for peak power consumption, the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time, such as 15 minutes. This compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power. These charges are billed as demand changes. Industrial users may also have extra charges according to the power factor of their load.

Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours (TWh) for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year. A 365-day year equals 8,760 hours, so over a period of one year, power of one gigawatt equates to 8.76 terawatt-hours of energy. Conversely, one terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of about 114 megawatts for a period of one year.

==Examples==
In 2020, the average household in the United States consumed 893 kWh per month.

Raising the temperature of 1 litre of water from room temperature to the boiling point with an electric kettle takes about 0.1 kWh.

A 12-watt LED lamp lit constantly uses about 0.3 kWh per 24 hours and about 9 kWh per month.

In terms of human power, a healthy adult male manual laborer performs work equal to about half a kilowatt-hour over an eight-hour day.

==Conversions==
To convert a quantity measured in a unit in the left column to the units in the top row, multiply by the factor in the cell where the row and column intersect.

==Watt-hour multiples ==

All the SI prefixes are commonly applied to the watt-hour: a kilowatt-hour (kWh) is 1,000 Wh; a megawatt-hour (MWh) is 1 million Wh; a milliwatt-hour (mWh) is and so on.
The kilowatt-hour is commonly used by electrical energy providers for purposes of billing, since the monthly energy consumption of a typical residential customer ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand kilowatt-hours. Megawatt-hours (MWh), gigawatt-hours (GWh), and terawatt-hours (TWh) are often used for metering larger amounts of electrical energy to industrial customers and in power generation. The terawatt-hour and petawatt-hour (PWh) units are large enough to conveniently express the annual electricity generation for whole countries and the world energy consumption.

==Distinction between kWh (energy) and kW (power)==
A kilowatt is a unit of power (rate of flow of energy per unit of time). A kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy. Kilowatt per hour would be a rate of change of power flow with time.

Work is the amount of energy transferred to a system; power is the &quot;rate of delivery&quot; of energy.
Energy is measured in &quot;joules&quot;, or &quot;watt-seconds&quot;. Power is measured in &quot;watts&quot;, or &quot;joules per second&quot;.

For example, a battery stores energy. When the battery delivers its energy, it does so at a certain power, that is, the rate of delivery of the energy. The higher the power, the quicker the battery&#x27;s stored energy is delivered. A higher power output will cause the battery&#x27;s stored energy to be depleted in a shorter time period.

===Annualized power===
Electric energy production and consumption are sometimes reported on a yearly basis, in units such as megawatt-hours per year (MWh/yr) gigawatt-hours/year (GWh/yr) or terawatt-hours per year (TWh/yr). These units have dimensions of energy divided by time and thus are units of power. They can be converted to SI power units by dividing by the number of hours in a year, about .

Thus, = ≈ .

===Misuse of watts per hour===
Many compound units for various kinds of rates explicitly mention units of time to indicate a change over time. For example: miles per hour, kilometres per hour, dollars per hour. Power units, such as kW, already measure the rate of energy per unit time (kW=kJ/s). Kilowatt-hours are a product of power and time, not a rate of change of power with time.

Watts per hour (W/h) is a unit of a &quot;change&quot; of power per hour, i.e. an acceleration in the delivery of energy. It is used to measure the daily variation of demand (e.g. the slope of the duck curve), or ramp-up behavior of power plants. For example, a power plant that reaches a power output of from in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of .

Other uses of terms such as &quot;watts per hour&quot; are likely to be errors.

==Other related energy units==

Several other units related to kilowatt-hour are commonly used to indicate power or energy capacity or use in specific application areas.
Average annual energy production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatt-hours per year. This is used with loads or output that vary during the year but whose annual totals are similar from one year to the next. For example, it is useful to compare the energy efficiency of household appliances whose power consumption varies with time or the season of the year. Another use is to measure the energy produced by a distributed power source. One kilowatt-hour per year equals about 114.08 milliwatts applied constantly during one year.

The energy content of a battery is usually expressed indirectly by its capacity in ampere-hours; to convert ampere-hour (Ah) to watt-hours (Wh), the ampere-hour value must be multiplied by the voltage of the power source. This value is approximate, since the battery voltage is not constant during its discharge, and because higher discharge rates reduce the total amount of energy that the battery can provide. In the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery, it is the battery voltage (typically 3.7 V for Li-ion) that must be used to calculate rather than the device output (for example, usually 5.0 V for USB portable chargers). This results in a 500 mA USB device running for about 3.7 hours on a 2,500 mAh battery, not five hours.

The &quot;Board of Trade unit&quot; (B.T.U.) is an obsolete UK synonym for kilowatt-hour. The term derives from the name of the Board of Trade which regulated the electricity industry until 1942 when the Ministry of Power took over. It is distinct from a British Thermal Unit (BTU) which is 1055 J.

In India, the kilowatt-hour is often simply called a &quot;unit&quot; of energy. A million units, designated &quot;MU&quot;, is a gigawatt-hour and a &quot;BU&quot; (billion units) is a terawatt-hour.

<text>The Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit (GZK limit or GZK cutoff) is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is (50 EeV), or about 8 joules (the energy of a proton travelling at ≈ % the speed of light). The limit is set by the slowing effect of interactions of the protons with the microwave background radiation over long distances (≈ 160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected, although indeed some detections appear to have exceeded the limit, as noted below. For example, one extreme-energy cosmic ray, the Oh-My-God Particle, which has been found to possess a record-breaking (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 95 km/h baseball).

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced near our galaxy or that Lorentz covariance is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by Kenneth Greisen, Georgy Zatsepin, and Vadim Kuzmin based on interactions between cosmic rays and the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of would interact with cosmic microwave background photons formula_1 relatively blueshifted by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce pions through the formula_2 resonance,

: formula_3

or

: formula_4

Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels – ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons also decay to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high-energy photons plus (in some cases) high-energy electron–positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron pair production (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic-ray proton energies of only about . However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic-ray proton, as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron–positron pair production.

This factor comes from two causes: The pion has a mass only about ~130 times the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in pion production becoming the process limiting high-energy cosmic-ray travel, rather than the lower-energy process of light-lepton production.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the threshold for pion production. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic ray protons traveling over distances larger than () and with energies greater than the threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

The precise GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays, those with energies above , are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements known as HZE ions. In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form: however, as Greisen noted, the giant dipole resonance also occurs roughly in this energy range (at 10 EeV/nucleon) and similarly restricts very long-distance propagation.

==GZK paradox==

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic-ray experiments Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA), High Resolution Fly&#x27;s Eye Cosmic Ray Detector, the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above the GZK limit. 
These observations appear to contradict the predictions of special relativity and particle physics as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
* The observed EECR particles can be heavier nuclei instead of protons
* The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
* The cosmic rays could have local sources within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high-energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, neutrinos), which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons. This process proceeds through a (virtual) Z-boson:

: formula_5

The cross-section for this process becomes large if the center-of-mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross-section is called &quot;resonance&quot;). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be

: formula_6

where formula_7 is the mass of the Z-boson, and formula_8 the mass of the neutrino.

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic-ray flux that can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic-ray observatories. A former claim by the AGASA experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the High Resolution Fly&#x27;s Eye Experiment (HiRes) and the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR). HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit. Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy-nuclei events. The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum. According to Alan Watson, former spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression, in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world&#x27;s largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements, which is getting heavier with increasing energy.
The Telescope Array Project, a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons. The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference. According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure-proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
EUSO, which was scheduled to fly on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-fluorescence technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear, since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope===
Launched in June 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
* With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).
* UHECR protons accelerated (see also Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration) in astrophysical objects produce &quot;secondary electromagnetic cascades&quot; during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between about 1% and 50% of the GeV–TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the EGRET experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.

<doc id="180241" wikidata="Q575014" url="?curid=180241" title="Sanjuro">
<text>is a 1962 Japanese &quot;jidaigeki&quot; film directed, co-written and edited by Akira Kurosawa, starring Toshiro Mifune. It is a sequel to Kurosawa&#x27;s 1961 &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

Originally an adaptation of the Shūgorō Yamamoto novel &quot;Hibi Heian&quot;, the script was altered following the success of the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot; to incorporate the lead character of that film.

==Plot==
Nine young samurai believe that the lord chamberlain, Mutsuta, is corrupt after he tore up their petition against fraud at court. One of them tells the superintendent Kikui of this and he agrees to intervene. As the nine meet secretly to discuss this at a shrine, a rōnin overhears and cautions them against trusting the superintendent. While at first they do not believe him, he saves them from an ambush. But as their rescuer is about to leave, he realises that Mutsuta and his family must now be in danger and decides to stay and help.

By the time the samurai get to Mutsuta&#x27;s house, the chamberlain has been abducted and his wife and daughter are held prisoner there. Following the rōnin&#x27;s suggestion, a servant from the house gets the guards drunk, allowing the samurai to free the women. Then the group hide in a house next door to the superintendent&#x27;s compound. When Mutsuta&#x27;s wife asks the rōnin his name, he looks out of the window at the surrounding camellia trees and says it is , literally &quot;thirty-year-old camellia&quot;. The lady then criticises &quot;Sanjuro&quot; for killing too frequently and insists that &quot;the best sword is kept in its sheath.&quot;

Sanjuro decides to get closer to the corrupt officials and joins their henchman Hanbei, who had previously offered him a job after the ambush at the shrine. Although the samurai distrustfully decide to keep watch on him, Sanjuro realises he is being followed as he walks along with Hanbei, and their shadows are easily captured and bound. Made to believe that a much larger group may be involved, Hanbei leaves to request reinforcements. Sanjuro then frees the four captured samurai, although having to kill all their guards. He tells the four to leave him tied up, then explains to Hanbei on his return that he did not wish to die in a cause in which he had no stake.

The chamberlain&#x27;s whereabouts are not discovered until the next day, when Mutsuta&#x27;s wife and daughter find a piece of the torn petition in the small stream that flows from the superintendent&#x27;s compound past their hideout. Since an attack on the officials is impossible with the compound full of armed men, Sanjuro hatches a plan to get the army away by reporting to Hanbei that he saw the rebels at a temple where he was sleeping. Meanwhile he has told his group of samurai that he will send the signal to attack by floating large numbers of camellias down the stream.

The first part of the plan works, with the superintendent&#x27;s forces rushing off to the temple; however, Hanbei becomes suspicious after catching Sanjuro trying to drop the camellias into the stream and ties him up. Just as Hanbei is preparing to kill him, the remaining corrupt officials realise that Sanjuro has tricked them—his description of the temple was incorrect. They convince Hanbei not to waste any further time and instead catch up with the superintendent&#x27;s forces and have them return as soon as possible. However, Sanjuro tricks the officials into giving the signal for the samurai to come to the rescue. Hanbei returns to find he has been made a fool of once again.

Mutsuta is restored to his position and the superintendent commits hara-kiri, much to the chamberlain&#x27;s regret, as he wished to avoid a public scandal. As his family and the loyal samurai are celebrating, they discover that Sanjuro has slipped away. The samurai race off to find Sanjuro and Hanbei about to duel.

Sanjuro is reluctant to fight and tries to dissuade Hanbei, but Hanbei is furious at his loss of dignity and declares he can only find peace by killing Sanjuro. Hanbei draws his sword, but the faster Sanjuro kills him. When the young samurai cheer his victory, Sanjuro becomes angry, stating that Hanbei was just like him: &quot;a sword unsheathed&quot;. Also warning that he will kill them if they follow him. His admirers can only kneel and bow as he walks away.

==Cast==
==Production==
The story is primarily based on Shūgorō Yamamoto&#x27;s short story . Originally &quot;Sanjuro&quot; was to be a straight adaptation of the story. After the success of &quot;Yojimbo&quot; the studio decided to resurrect its popular antihero, and Kurosawa reimagined the script accordingly. But despite a certain element of continuity, the eventual film turned out to be more than just a sequel to &quot;Yojimbo&quot; for the hero goes on to develop in character from the swashbuckling original.

He is, as before, a masterless samurai who preserves his anonymity by the same means. When asked his name in &quot;Yojimbo&quot; he looks outside and names himself mulberry (&quot;Kuwabatake&quot;); in &quot;Sanjuro&quot; he chooses a camellia (&quot;Tsubaki&quot;). In both cases he gives &quot;Sanjūrō&quot; (thirty-year-old) as his given name, although in both films he admits to being closer to forty. Having the &quot;ronin&quot; take the name of a local plant rather than a great house or clan reflects a populist turn in contemporary samurai movies. A crucial difference between &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;Sanjuro&quot;, however, is that there is little connection to the Western genre in the sequel. The original was set in an out-of-the-way border town where the hero deals ruthlessly with local thugs, while in &quot;Sanjuro&quot; the action centres on a Japanese feudal power struggle in a clan fortress town. There the hero realises that Hanbei, his main opponent, is a man much like himself: a social outsider (an &quot;unsheathed sword&quot; in the words of the chamberlain’s wife) free to pick his own side in a conflict. The difference between them is only in the motives behind their choice.

There is also a greater element of social comedy, with the seasoned fighter constantly hampered by the failure of the young men whom he chooses to help to grasp the reality of the situation. But while he is their superior in tactics, the lady he has just rescued confounds him by insisting that he restrain himself, since killing people is a bad habit. Although there has to be some killing, largely as result of the inept actions of his young allies, the only truly violent moment comes at the very end in the duel between Sanjuro and Hanbei. From this he walks away in a fury because his young admirers are still unable to read human nature and understand the significance of what has just happened.

==Release==
&quot;Sanjuro&quot; was released on January 1, 1962 in Japan where it was distributed by Toho. The film was also released in the same year in the United States.

===Box office===
&quot;Sanjuro&quot; was Toho&#x27;s highest-grossing film in 1962, coming second place for the highest grossing Japanese productions in 1962. It earned in distributor rentals at the Japanese box office in 1962, exceeding &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;, which had sold tickets in Japan that year.

===Reception===
The film has been positively received by critics. It holds a 100% rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.38/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Technically impressive and superbly acted, &quot;Sanjuro&quot; is a funny, action-packed samurai adventure featuring outstanding cinematography and a charismatic performance from Toshiro Mifune&quot;. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of &quot;The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time&quot; by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.

==Legacy==
Mifune&#x27;s sword fighting in the film was used in an extensive illustrated example of &quot;samurai virtuosity with his sword&quot; in &quot;This Is Kendo&quot;, a 1989 kendo manual published in English.

==Remake==
The film was remade as &quot;Tsubaki Sanjuro&quot; in 2007 by Yoshimitsu Morita and starring Yūji Oda in the title role.

<text>An arena is a large enclosed platform, often circular or oval-shaped, designed to showcase theatre, musical performances, or sporting events. It is composed of a large open space surrounded on most or all sides by tiered seating for spectators, and may be covered by a roof. The key feature of an arena is that the event space is the lowest point, allowing maximum visibility. Arenas are usually designed to accommodate a multitude of spectators.

==Background==

The word derives from Latin &quot;&quot;, a particularly fine-grained sand that covered the floor of ancient arenas such as the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, to absorb blood.

The term &quot;arena&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for a very large venue such as Pasadena&#x27;s Rose Bowl, but such a facility is typically called a &quot;stadium&quot;. The use of one term over the other has mostly to do with the type of event. Football (be it association, rugby, gridiron, Australian rules, or Gaelic) is typically played in a stadium, while basketball, volleyball, handball, and ice hockey are typically played in an arena, although many of the larger arenas hold more spectators than do the stadiums of smaller colleges or high schools. There are exceptions. The home of the Duke University men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams would qualify as an arena, but the facility is called Cameron Indoor Stadium. Domed stadiums, which, like arenas, are enclosed but have the larger playing surfaces and seating capacities found in stadiums, are generally not referred to as arenas in North America. There is also the sport of indoor American football (one variant of which is explicitly known as arena football), a variant of the outdoor game that is designed for the usual smaller playing surface of most arenas; variants of other traditionally outdoor sports, including box lacrosse as well as futsal and indoor soccer, also exist.

The term &quot;arena&quot; is also used loosely to refer to any event or type of event which either literally or metaphorically takes place in such a location, often with the specific intent of comparing an idea to a sporting event. Such examples of these would be terms such as &quot;the arena of war&quot;, &quot;the arena of love&quot; or &quot;the political arena&quot;.

<text>Henry Sterling Creamer (June 21, 1879 – October 14, 1930) was a popular song lyricist and theater producer. He was born in Richmond, Virginia, and died in New York. He co-wrote many popular songs in the years from 1900 to 1929, often collaborating with Turner Layton, with whom he also appeared in vaudeville. He was African American.

==Career==
Creamer was a singer, dancer, songwriter and stage producer/director. He first performed on the vaudeville circuit in the U.S. and in Europe as a duo with pianist Turner Layton, with whom he also co-wrote songs. Two of their most enduring songs, for which Creamer wrote the lyrics, are &quot;After You&#x27;ve Gone&quot; (1918), which was popularized by Sophie Tucker, and &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot; (1922), which was included in the soundtrack for one of the dance numbers in the Fred Astaire / Ginger Rogers 1939 movie &quot;The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle&quot;. Way Down Yonder in New Orleans became a hit again in 1959 when the rocked up recording by Freddy Cannon sold a million copies. 

Success on Broadway arrived in 1922 when Creamer’s Creole Production Company produced the show &quot;Strut Miss Lizzie&quot;, and in 1923 to seal their success, Bessie Smith recorded their song &quot;Whoa, Tillie, Take Your Time&quot;. Creamer&#x27;s other Broadway stage scores include &quot;Three Showers&quot;. Creamer and Layton disbanded as a duo in 1924, when Layton relocated to Europe. He moved on to collaborate with other notable composers including J.C. Johnson, Jimmy Johnson, and vaudevillian Bert Williams. In 1924, Creamer joined ASCAP.

In the fall of 1926, Creamer was commissioned to direct the Cotton Club revue, &quot;The Creole Cocktail&quot;. The show featured Lottie Gee, Loncia Williams. Henry and LaPearl, Louie Parker, White and Sherman, Eddie Burke, Ruby Mason and Albertine Pickens.

Also in 1926, Creamer and James P. Johnson wrote &quot;Alabama Stomp&quot;. In 1930, they achieved another hit with &quot;If I Could Be with You&quot;, which was recorded by Ruth Etting. The song also became the theme song for McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers and was also a hit for Louis Armstrong (Okeh 41448).

Creamer was a co-founder with James Reese Europe of the Clef Club, an important early organization for African-American musicians and entertainers in New York City.

He died on October 14, 1930, at Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan) and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York).

<text>A black box theater is a simple performance space, typically a square room with black walls and a flat floor. The simplicity of the space allows it to be used to create a variety of configurations of stage and audience interaction. The black box is a relatively recent innovation in theatre.

== History ==
Black box theaters have their roots in the American avant-garde of the early 20th century. The black box theaters became popular and increasingly widespread in the 1960s as rehearsal spaces. Almost any large room can be transformed into a &quot;black box&quot; with the aid of paint or curtains, making black box theaters an easily accessible option for theater artists. Storefronts, church basements, and old trolley barns were some examples of the earliest versions of spaces transformed into black box theaters. Sets are simple and small and costs are lower, appealing to nonprofit and low-income artists or companies. The black box is also considered by many to be a place where more &quot;pure&quot; theatre can be explored, with the most human and least technical elements in focus.

The concept of a building designed for flexible staging techniques can be attributed to Swiss designer Adolphe Appia, circa 1921. The invention of such a stage instigated a half-century of innovations in the relationship between audience and performers. This idea would again be re-visited by Harley Granville Barker, using Appia&#x27;s design as his basis. Barker would have ideas of directing productions in “a great white box,” which would see success in 1970. As time went on, black boxes were decided on instead as black provided the most neutral setting for productions. Antonin Artaud also had ideas of a stage of this kind. The first flexible stage in America was located in the home living room of actor and manager Gilmor Brown in Pasadena, California. While the domestic decor meant that Brown&#x27;s stage was not a proper black box, the idea was still a revolutionary one. This venue, and two subsequent permutations, are known as the Playbox Theatre, and functioned as an experimental space for Brown&#x27;s larger venue, the Pasadena Playhouse.

==Use==
Such spaces are easily built and maintained. Black box theaters are usually home to plays or other performances requiring very basic technical arrangements, such as limited set construction. Common floor plans include thrust stage, modified thrust stage, and theater in the round.

Universities and other theater training programs employ the black box theater because the space is versatile and easy to change. The black backdrop can encourage the audience to focus on the actors, furthering the benefits. Additionally, as the audience is now closer to the stage due to the lack of a proscenium, a more intimate atmosphere is able to be created. This intimate space may also serve to try and eliminate the implied mental distance between the audience and actors, while it still physically remains. Many theater training programs will have both a large proscenium theater, as well as a black box theater. Not only does this allow two productions to be mounted simultaneously, but they can also have a large extravagant production in the main stage while having a small experimental show in the black box.

Black box spaces are also popular at fringe theater festivals; due to their simple design and equipment they can be used for many performances each day. This simplicity also means that a black box theater can be adapted from other spaces, such as hotel conference rooms. This is common at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe where the larger venues will hire entire buildings and divide each room to be rented out to several theater companies. &quot;The Black Box Theatre&quot; in Oslo, Norway, and the Alvina Krause Studio at Northwestern University are theaters of this type.

Black box theaters have also been known to come with a handful of disadvantages. The open space may leave &quot;too many&quot; options that can leave many at a loss for direction or inspiration. Lighting issues arise as the primary lighting is typically above the performance area. During blackout scenes, the close proximity of the audience allows them to still see the transitions happening on stage.

Black box spaces also see success within the music industry. These spaces are known to be used to host vocal and instrumental performances, rehearsals, shows, and competitions.

==Technical features==
Most older black boxes were built like television studios, with a low pipe grid overhead. Newer black boxes typically feature catwalks or tension grids, the latter combining the flexibility of the pipe grid with the accessibility of a catwalk. They were designed to be able to be spaces that can be molded into different settings easily for multiple performances. Black box theaters accommodate smaller audiences with the goal of having more intimate experiences.

The interiors of most black box theatres are painted black, although that is not exclusive. A black box doesn&#x27;t have to be black to be considered a black box. Black is most common because black paint is easily restored, leaving a flexibility to the space for productions: a wall or floor can be painted other colours for a set and then returned to the neutral black with little time or expense. While the absence of colour not only gives the audience a sense of &quot;anyplace&quot; (and thus allows flexibility from play to play or from scene to scene), Having the non stage areas black allows for an innovative lighting design to shine through. The architecture of black box theaters typically allow for easy modifications and decorations, but at the expense of time and monetary cost.

<text>Michael Anthony Sobolewski (born June 20, 1954) is an American musician who was the bassist and backing vocalist for the hard rock band Van Halen from 1974 to 2006. He performed on Van Halen&#x27;s first 11 albums and was their longest-tenured bassist. Following his 2006 departure, Anthony has collaborated with fellow former Van Halen bandmate Sammy Hagar for the supergroups Chickenfoot and Sammy Hagar and the Circle. In addition to his music career, he markets a line of hot sauces named Mad Anthony and related products. Anthony was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Van Halen in 2007.

== Early years ==
Anthony got his interest in music from his trumpeter father, and played the same instrument in his youth.

Anthony was born and partly raised in Chicago. The family moved to California twice in Anthony&#x27;s early years, settling in 1966 in Arcadia,which is next to Pasadena, where Alex and Edward Van Halen, with whom Anthony would later play in the band Van Halen, were raised. Anthony attended Dana Junior High School in Arcadia from 1967 to 1969. Anthony was in the marching band at the school. He ran track in junior high and also showed promise in baseball, as a catcher, but by the time he started high school he had ceased doing athletics to concentrate on music.

Anthony graduated from Arcadia High in 1972.

==Music career==
=== (1967–1974) Early musical endeavors ===

Anthony took an interest in guitar as a teenager, but picked up the bass instead since most of his other friends already played guitar or drums. Anthony&#x27;s friend Mike Hershey gave him a Fender Mustang electric guitar that Anthony converted by removing the two highest strings and playing it as a bass guitar. Eventually, his father bought him a Victoria copy of a Fender Precision Bass and a Gibson amplifier. Anthony mostly modelled his bass playing after Jack Bruce of Cream, but also admired Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Paul Jones and Harvey Brooks of Electric Flag. His first band was called Poverty&#x27;s Children. Other bands he played in included Black Opal, Balls, and Snake. Although Anthony is naturally left-handed, he plays right-handed.

Snake, a three-piece group featuring Anthony on lead vocals and bass guitar, was the last band in which Anthony played before joining Van Halen. Snake played covers of ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Foghat, along with some original songs. They played several of the same types of gigs as did the Van Halen brothers&#x27; band Mammoth. Snake once opened for Mammoth during a show at Pasadena High School. Mammoth&#x27;s PA failed that night, so Anthony lent them Snake&#x27;s PA.

While attending Pasadena City College, majoring in music, Anthony met Eddie Van Halen, who also took classes there. During this time, bass player Mark Stone parted ways with Mammoth and the Van Halens auditioned Anthony as a replacement. Anthony was impressed by their skill during subsequent jam sessions even though he had heard the brothers play before. After the session, the Van Halen brothers asked Anthony to join their band. One story claims that he first consulted Snake guitarist Tony Caggiano, who advised Anthony to join up with the guitar prodigy and his brother. However, according to Anthony&#x27;s web site, he immediately accepted. This has become the accepted version of events.

Anthony had planned to attend college in Santa Barbara after he graduated from Pasadena City College, but instead he dropped out of PCC just before he earned enough credits for a degree so that he could devote all his time to Van Halen.

=== (1974–2006) Van Halen ===

In 1974, Eddie Van Halen, Alex Van Halen, David Lee Roth and Anthony became known as Van Halen, dropping the name Mammoth when they discovered another local band using that moniker. After successfully navigating the Los Angeles and West Hollywood club scene and a 29 track demo produced by Kiss&#x27;s Gene Simmons, Van Halen was signed to Warner Bros. in 1977 and released their self-titled debut album on February 10, 1978. Anthony was a 20% member (manager Noel Monk being the 5th) of all debts and profits, including merchandise, until midway through the 1984 tour, when tensions rose to the point that Roth and the Van Halen brothers insisted that he sign away all future songwriting credit and royalties, retroactive with the current &quot;1984&quot; LP. Noel Monk later wrote of the event, &quot;If I were Mike, I would have told them to &#x27;fuck off&#x27; and not played that night, to show them my worth. Instead Mike didn&#x27;t say a word and signed away millions of dollars, as the three stood over him, lying on the floor.&quot;

The band released a total of eleven studio albums from 1978 through 1998, a live album in 1993, as well as two greatest hits compilations during Anthony&#x27;s tenure with the band.

Anthony produced a 1988 demo for his brother (Robert Lee Sobolewski) Bobby Leigh&#x27;s band Asylum Suite, which was formed in 1984 and featured singer Michael Thomas Fiore.

=== (1996–2003) Diminishing role with Van Halen and side projects ===

As early as 1996, rumors periodically surfaced that Anthony had been fired from Van Halen, despite claims to the contrary. Anthony continued working with the band although the rumors persisted until his actual departure following the 2004 reunion tour with Hagar.

Anthony&#x27;s involvement in recording the 1998 album &quot;Van Halen III&quot; was dramatically less than previous albums. Anthony played bass on three songs, with Eddie playing the bass parts for the six other songs that featured bass. Anthony is credited as a songwriter for the album along with the rest of the band. Anthony performed with the band for the 1998 tour, and was credited on messages from the band thereafter. He participated in the band&#x27;s three reunion efforts with David Lee Roth in 1996, 2000 and 2001 (with the latter resulting in early versions of &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot; tracks). Anthony&#x27;s name was also credited in a few band newsletters and appeared in band interviews during this time. Sometime after this, Anthony disappeared from public view until the 2004 reunion.

Anthony began periodic appearances with Sammy Hagar during his solo tours. He usually played as part of both the Waboritas and Los Tres Gusanos, two of Hagar&#x27;s bands. During 2002&#x27;s Roth/Hagar tour (otherwise known as the &quot;Sans Halen&quot; or &quot;Sam and Dave&quot; tour), both Anthony and ex-Van Halen vocalist Gary Cherone made guest appearances at concerts, sometimes together.

In 2002, Anthony, Hagar, Neal Schon, Deen Castronovo, and Joe Satriani formed the supergroup Planet Us and Anthony began making more frequent performances at Hagar concerts. Planet Us recorded two songs, including &quot;Psycho Vertigo&quot;, which was intended for the original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; soundtrack but ultimately did not make the album. That and the other Planet Us song written for the band, &quot;Peephole&quot;, were later released on the 2008 Hagar solo album &quot;Cosmic Universal Fashion&quot;.

=== (2003–2005) Van Halen reunion ===
Initially when Eddie and Alex asked Hagar to rejoin at the end of 2003 for a 2004 tour, the plan was to not invite Anthony back. Hagar, however, refused to perform if Anthony did not rejoin, and Anthony agreed to play but on a reduced royalties contract. The contract drawn up was for the duration of the tour only.

In 2004, Van Halen released the compilation album &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; which included three new songs. Anthony did not participate in the writing of nor did he play bass on the new songs and was not credited on the album for the new material, although he did sing backup vocals on all of them.

Anthony now states in media interviews that he has not spoken to the Van Halen brothers since the 2004 tour, except to Alex at the funeral of Van Halen drum tech Greg Emerson. He has also speculated that since the brothers were not pleased with Hagar&#x27;s commercial ventures such as the Cabo Wabo product line, their similar displeasure with Anthony&#x27;s hot sauce brand may have caused the rift that ultimately separated Hagar and Anthony from the band.

=== (2006–present) Departure from Van Halen and formation of Chickenfoot ===

Anthony spent the summer of 2006 touring as a member of the Other Half during a segment of the Sammy Hagar and the Waboritas tour. The Other Half featured Anthony and Hagar performing classic Van Halen songs from both the Roth and Hagar periods.

On September 8, 2006, Eddie Van Halen announced that his son Wolfgang was replacing Anthony as Van Halen&#x27;s bass player. On February 2, 2007, Van Halen announced that they were reuniting for a tour with original vocalist David Lee Roth. Their tour began on September 27, 2007. Anthony commented that he heard about his replacement &quot;on the Internet&quot; and added, &quot;I&#x27;m a little miffed that they&#x27;re calling it a Van Halen reunion. If I was dead and they needed someone to play, that&#x27;s one thing, but to me this is not a reunion.&quot; At the tour press conference David Lee Roth stated, &quot;This is not a reunion, this is a revision.&quot;

Anthony joined Hagar on live national television on February 25, 2007, during a pre-race performance for the California NASCAR race on Fox television. Anthony jumped onstage and joined Hagar during a performance of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Drive 55.&quot;

Anthony and Hagar were the only members, former or current, to appear at Van Halen&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007. Eddie Van Halen was in rehab at the time, and Alex Van Halen and David Lee Roth declined to appear.

Anthony is a founding member, bassist and backing vocalist for the band Chickenfoot with Sammy Hagar, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and guitarist Joe Satriani. The band released their first studio album in Europe on June 5, 2009, followed by the North American release on June 9. Chickenfoot released their sophomore effort, &quot;Chickenfoot III&quot;, on September 27, 2011.

Anthony is a member of Sammy Hagar and the Circle, a supergroup that formed in 2014 and features Hagar as well as guitarist Vic Johnson and drummer Jason Bonham.

== Iconic Jack Daniel&#x27;s Bass ==
At the height of Van Halen&#x27;s 1980&#x27;s popularity, Anthony coordinated with his bass tech, Kevin &quot;Dugie&quot; Dugan, to create his iconic Jack Daniel&#x27;s Bass Guitar. The first thing Dugan did was to come to an informal agreement with Jack Daniel&#x27;s to never produce more than three such basses without the company&#x27;s permission. The first version of the Jack Daniel&#x27;s Bass made its initial appearance in the &quot;Panama&quot; video in April of 1984 and is now displayed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The second version is in Anthony&#x27;s private storage and the third is still occasionally used by Anthony in live performances.

==Personal life==
Anthony met Sue Hendry when both attended Arcadia High School. They married in 1981. They have two daughters. Anthony and his family reside in Newport Beach, California. He can be seen during televised car shows, often being interviewed regarding his love and knowledge for classic motorcycles and cars.

Anthony mostly stayed on the sidelines of the rockstar &quot;party hard&quot; lifestyle, though he was often seen and photographed with a cigarette and a Jack Daniel&#x27;s (whiskey logo) bass guitar.

==Commercial ventures==
Anthony maintains a personal website titled &quot;Mad Anthony&#x27;s Cafe&quot; where he markets and sells a number of signature products including hot sauce, BBQ sauce, and hot mustard. His line of commercial foods is the result of a collaboration with a San Diego, California restaurant noted for its hot sauces. His hot sauce brand, &quot;Mad Anthony,&quot; has been noted on local news segments and on the Food Network for being &quot;high-end&quot; due to the quality of its ingredients and manufacturing process. The site also provides information on Anthony&#x27;s Schecter Guitar Research bass guitar series. Chickenfoot bandmate Sammy Hagar carries the bassist&#x27;s hot sauces at his Sammy&#x27;s Beach Bar &amp; Grill locations.

<doc id="180249" wikidata="Q125569" url="?curid=180249" title="Snub cube">
<text>In geometry, the snub cube, or snub cuboctahedron, is an Archimedean solid with 38 faces: 6 squares and 32 equilateral triangles. It has 60 edges and 24 vertices. Kepler first named it in Latin as &quot;cubus simus&quot; in 1619 in his Harmonices Mundi. H. S. M. Coxeter, noting it could be derived equally from the octahedron as the cube, called it snub cuboctahedron, with a vertical extended Schläfli symbol formula_1, and representing an alternation of a truncated cuboctahedron, which has Schläfli symbol formula_2.

== Construction ==
The snub cube can be generated by taking the six faces of the cube, pulling them outward so they no longer touch, then giving them each a small rotation on their centers (all clockwise or all counter-clockwise) until the spaces between can be filled with equilateral triangles.
The snub cube may also be constructed from a rhombicuboctahedron. It started by twisting its square face (in blue), allowing its triangles (in red) to be automatically twisted in opposite directions, forming other square faces (in white) to be skewed quadrilaterals that can be filled in two equilateral triangles.

The snub cube can also be derived from the truncated cuboctahedron by the process of alternation. 24 vertices of the truncated cuboctahedron form a polyhedron topologically equivalent to the snub cube; the other 24 form its mirror-image. The resulting polyhedron is vertex-transitive but not uniform.
=== Cartesian coordinates ===
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a snub cube are all the even permutations of
formula_3
with an even number of plus signs, along with all the odd permutations with an odd number of plus signs, where formula_4 is the tribonacci constant. Taking the even permutations with an odd number of plus signs, and the odd permutations with an even number of plus signs, gives a different snub cube, the mirror image. Taking them together yields the compound of two snub cubes.

This snub cube has edges of length formula_5, a number which satisfies the equation
formula_6
and can be written as
formula_7
To get a snub cube with unit edge length, divide all the coordinates above by the value &quot;α&quot; given above.

== Properties ==

For a snub cube with edge length formula_8, its surface area and volume are:
formula_9

The snub cube is an Archimedean solid, meaning it is a highly symmetric and semi-regular polyhedron, and two or more different regular polygonal faces meet in a vertex. It is chiral, meaning there are two distinct forms whenever being mirrored. Therefore, the snub cube has the rotational octahedral symmetry formula_10. The polygonal faces that meet for every vertex are four equilateral triangles and one square, and the vertex figure of a snub cube is formula_11. The dual polyhedron of a snub cube is pentagonal icositetrahedron, a Catalan solid.

== Graph ==

The skeleton of a snub cube can be represented as a graph with 24 vertices and 60 edges, an Archimedean graph.

<text>Donald Oscar Pederson (September 30, 1925 – December 25, 2004) was an American professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the designers of SPICE, a simulator for integrated circuits that has been universally used as a teaching tool and in the everyday work of circuits engineers. The IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award in Solid-State Circuits is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Pederson was born in Hallock, Minnesota to Oscar Jorgan and Beda Emilia Pederson. He attended Fergus Falls Public Schools in Fergus Falls, Minnesota during which time he built his first crystal radio by using junkyard finds and spare parts which were given by his uncle and cousin. During those years he also saved money, and eventually bought his first soldering iron and a vacuum tube. Don&#x27;s passion for electronics began in high school during physics class in Fargo, North Dakota where his parents had moved. He graduated high school at age 17 and entered Iowa State College in the autumn of 1943, but then left for the military during World War II. He served as a private in the U.S. Army in Austria, Germany, France and the Philippines from 1943 to 1946.

Upon his return from military service, he continued his undergraduate education at North Dakota Agricultural College (now North Dakota State University) and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1948. He then attended Stanford University for graduate school, where he received a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1951.

Pederson remained at Stanford as a researcher in the university&#x27;s electronics research lab. From 1953 to 1955, he worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories, in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and lectured at Newark College of Engineering (now New Jersey Institute of Technology). In 1955, Pederson joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences of the University of California, Berkeley as an assistant professor of electrical engineering. In the early 1970s he began work on SPICE, with his colleagues from the Electronic Research Lab. He retired in 1991, but continued to teach part-time.

Pederson died on December 25, 2004, in Concord, California, of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a general-purpose, open-source analog electronic circuit simulator.
It is a program used in integrated circuit and board-level design to check the integrity of circuit designs and to predict circuit behavior.

== Introduction ==
Unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts, it is not practical to breadboard integrated circuits before manufacture. Further, the high costs of photolithographic masks and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built.

Simulating the circuit with SPICE is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit. The SPICE simulators help to predict the behavior of the IC under different operating conditions, such as different voltage and current levels, temperature variations, and noise.

Board-level circuit designs can often be breadboarded for testing. Even with a breadboard, some circuit properties may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board, such as parasitic resistances and capacitances, whose effects can often be estimated more accurately using simulation. Also, designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances. In these cases it is common to use SPICE to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity.

Circuit simulation programs, of which SPICE and derivatives are the most prominent, take a text netlist describing the circuit elements (transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.) and their connections, and translate this description into equations to be solved. The general equations produced are nonlinear differential algebraic equations which are solved using implicit integration methods, Newton&#x27;s method and sparse matrix techniques.

== Origins ==
SPICE was developed at the Electronics Research Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley by Laurence Nagel with direction from his research advisor, Prof. Donald Pederson. SPICE1 is largely a derivative of the CANCER program, which Nagel had worked on under Prof. Ronald Rohrer. CANCER is an acronym for &quot;Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation&quot;. At these times many circuit simulators were developed under contracts with the United States Department of Defense that needed the ability to evaluate the radiation hardness of a circuit. When Nagel&#x27;s original advisor, Prof. Rohrer, left Berkeley, Prof. Pederson became his advisor. Pederson insisted that CANCER, a proprietary program, be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain.

SPICE1 was first presented at a conference in 1973. SPICE1 is coded in FORTRAN and to construct the circuit equations uses nodal analysis, which has limitations in representing inductors, floating voltage sources and the various forms of controlled sources. SPICE1 has relatively few circuit elements available and uses a fixed-timestep transient analysis. The real popularity of SPICE started with SPICE2 in 1975. SPICE2, also coded in FORTRAN, is a much-improved program with more circuit elements, variable timestep transient analysis using either the trapezoidal (second order Adams-Moulton method) or the Gear integration method (also known as BDF), equation formulation via modified nodal analysis (avoiding the limitations of nodal analysis), and an innovative FORTRAN-based memory allocation system. 
Ellis Cohen led development from version 2B to the industry standard SPICE 2G6, the last FORTRAN version, released in 1983. SPICE3 was developed by Thomas Quarles (with A. Richard Newton as advisor) in 1989. It is written in C, uses the same netlist syntax, and added X Window System plotting.

As an early public domain software program with source code available, SPICE was widely distributed and used. Its ubiquity became such that &quot;to SPICE a circuit&quot; remains synonymous with circuit simulation. SPICE source code was from the beginning distributed by UC Berkeley for a nominal charge (to cover the cost of magnetic tape). The license originally included distribution restrictions for countries not considered friendly to the US, but the source code is currently covered by the BSD license.

The birth of SPICE was named an IEEE Milestone in 2011; the entry mentions that SPICE &quot;evolved to become the worldwide standard integrated circuit simulator&quot;. Nagel was awarded the 2019 IEEE Donald O. Pederson Award in Solid-State Circuits for the development of SPICE.

== Successors ==
=== Open-source successors ===
No newer versions of Berkeley SPICE have been released after version 3f5 in 1993. Since then, the open-source or academic continuations of SPICE include: XSPICE, developed at Georgia Tech, which added mixed analog/digital &quot;code models&quot; for behavioral simulation; CIDER (previously CODECS), developed by UC Berkeley and Oregon State University, which added semiconductor device simulation; Ngspice, based on SPICE 3f5; WRspice, a C++ re-write of the original spice3f5 code. Other open-source simulators not developed by academics are QUCS, QUCS-S, Xyce, and Qucsator.

=== Commercial versions and spinoffs ===
Berkeley SPICE inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs, in academia, in industry, and in commercial products. The first commercial version of SPICE is ISPICE, an interactive version on a timeshare service, National CSS. The most prominent commercial versions of SPICE include HSPICE (originally commercialized by Ashawna and Kim Hailey of Meta Software, but now owned by Synopsys) and PSPICE (now owned by Cadence Design Systems). The integrated circuit industry adopted SPICE quickly, and until commercial versions became well developed many IC design houses had proprietary versions of SPICE.

Today a few IC manufacturers, typically the larger companies, have groups continuing to develop SPICE-based circuit simulation programs. Among these are ADICE and LTspice at Analog Devices, QSPICE at Qorvo, MCSPICE, followed by Mica at Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP Semiconductors, and TINA-TI at Texas Instruments. Both LTspice and TINA-TI come bundled with models from their respective company. Other companies maintain internal circuit simulators which are not directly based upon SPICE, among them PowerSpice at IBM, TITAN at Infineon Technologies, Lynx at Intel Corporation, and Pstar at NXP Semiconductors also.

== Program features and structure ==
SPICE became popular because it contained the analyses and models needed to design integrated circuits of the time, and was robust enough and fast enough to be practical to use. Precursors to SPICE often had a single purpose: The BIAS program, for example, did simulation of bipolar transistor circuit operating points; the SLIC program did only small-signal analyses. SPICE combined operating point solutions, transient analysis, and various small-signal analyses with the circuit elements and device models needed to successfully simulate many circuits.

=== Analyses ===
SPICE2 includes these analyses:
* AC analysis (linear small-signal frequency domain analysis)
* DC analysis (nonlinear quiescent point calculation)
* DC transfer curve analysis (a sequence of nonlinear operating points calculated while sweeping an input voltage or current, or a circuit parameter)
* Noise analysis (a small signal analysis done using an adjoint matrix technique which sums uncorrelated noise currents at a chosen output point)
* Transfer function analysis (a small-signal input/output gain and impedance calculation)
* Transient analysis (time-domain large-signal solution of nonlinear differential algebraic equations)

Since SPICE is generally used to model circuits with nonlinear elements, the small signal analyses are necessarily preceded by a quiescent point calculation at which the circuit is linearized. SPICE2 also contains code for other small-signal analyses: sensitivity analysis, pole-zero analysis, and small-signal distortion analysis. Analysis at various temperatures is done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature, allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes.

Other circuit simulators have since added many analyses beyond those in SPICE2 to address changing industry requirements. Parametric sweeps were added to analyze circuit performance with changing manufacturing tolerances or operating conditions. Loop gain and stability calculations were added for analog circuits. Harmonic balance or time-domain steady state analyses were added for RF and switched-capacitor circuit design. However, a public-domain circuit simulator containing the modern analyses and features needed to become a successor in popularity to SPICE has not yet emerged.

It is very important to use appropriate analyses with carefully chosen parameters. For example, application of linear analysis to nonlinear circuits should be justified separately. Also, application of transient analysis with default simulation parameters can lead to qualitatively wrong conclusions on circuit dynamics.

=== Device models ===
SPICE2 includes many semiconductor device compact models: three levels of MOSFET model, a combined Ebers–Moll and Gummel–Poon bipolar model, a JFET model, and a model for a junction diode. In addition, it had many other elements: resistors, capacitors, inductors (including coupling), independent voltage and current sources, ideal transmission lines, active components and voltage and current controlled sources.

SPICE3 added more sophisticated MOSFET models, which were needed due to advances in semiconductor technology.
In particular, the BSIM family of models were added, which were also developed at UC Berkeley.

Commercial and industrial SPICE simulators have added many other device models as technology advanced and earlier models became inadequate. To attempt standardization of these models so that a set of model parameters may be used in different simulators, an industry working group was formed, the Compact Model Council, to choose, maintain and promote the use of standard models. The standard models today include BSIM3, BSIM4, BSIMSOI, PSP, HICUM, and MEXTRAM.

Spice can use device models from foundry PDKs.

===Input and output: Netlists, schematic capture and plotting===
SPICE2 takes a text netlist as input and produces line-printer listings as output, which fits with the computing environment in 1975. These listings are either columns of numbers corresponding to calculated outputs (typically voltages or currents), or line-printer character &quot;plots&quot;. SPICE3 retains the netlist for circuit description, but allows analyses to be controlled from a command-line interface similar to the C shell. SPICE3 also added basic X plotting, as UNIX and engineering workstations became common.

Vendors and various free software projects have added schematic capture frontends to SPICE, allowing a schematic diagram of the circuit to be drawn and the netlist to be automatically generated and transferred to various SPICE backends. Also, graphical user interfaces were added for selecting the simulations to be done and manipulating the voltage and current output vectors. In addition, very capable graphing utilities have been added to see waveforms and graphs of parametric dependencies. Several free versions of these extended programs are available.

== SPICE usage beyond electronic simulation ==
As SPICE generally solves non-linear differential algebraic equations, it may be applied to simulating beyond the electrical realm.

Most prominent are thermal simulations, as thermal systems may be described by lumped circuit elements mapping onto the electronic SPICE elements (heat capacity → capacitance, thermal conductance/resistance → conductance/resistance, temperature → voltage, heat flow or heat generated → current ). As thermal and electronic systems are closely linked by power dissipation and cooling systems, electro-thermal simulation today is supported by semiconductor device manufacturers offering (transistor) models with both electrical and thermal nodes. So one may obtain electrical power dissipation, resulting in self-heating causing parameter variations, and cooling system efficiency in a single simulation run.

SPICE may very well simulate the electronics part of a motor drive. However it will equally well describe the electro-mechanical model of the motor. Again this is achieved by mapping mechanical onto the electrical elements (torque → voltage, angular velocity → current, coefficient of viscous friction → resistance, moment of inertia → inductance). So again the final model consists of only SPICE compatible lumped circuit elements, but one gains mechanical together with electrical data during simulation.

Electromagnetic modeling is accessible to a SPICE simulator via the PEEC (partial element equivalent circuit) method. Maxwell&#x27;s equations have been mapped, RLC, Skin effect, dielectric or magnetic materials and incident or radiated fields have been modelled.

However, as of 2019, SPICE cannot be used to &quot;simulate photonics and electronics together in a photonic circuit simulator&quot;, and thus it is not yet considered as a test simulator for photonic integrated circuits.

Micro-fluidic circuits have been modelled with SPICE by creating a pneumatic FET.

SPICE has been applied to model the interface between biological and electronic systems, e.g. as a design tools for synthetic biology and for the virtual prototyping of biosensors and lab-on-chip.

SPICE has been applied in operations research to evaluate perturbed supply chains.

<text>In geometry, stellation is the process of extending a polygon in two dimensions, a polyhedron in three dimensions, or, in general, a polytope in &quot;n&quot; dimensions to form a new figure. Starting with an original figure, the process extends specific elements such as its edges or face planes, usually in a symmetrical way, until they meet each other again to form the closed boundary of a new figure. The new figure is a stellation of the original. The word &quot;stellation&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;stellātus&quot;, &quot;starred&quot;, which in turn comes from the Latin &quot;stella&quot;, &quot;star&quot;.
Stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to &quot;faceting&quot;.

==Kepler&#x27;s definition==
In 1619 Kepler defined stellation for polygons and polyhedra as the process of extending edges or faces until they meet to form a new polygon or polyhedron. 

He stellated the regular dodecahedron to obtain two regular star polyhedra, the small stellated dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron. He also stellated the regular octahedron to obtain the stella octangula, a regular compound of two tetrahedra.

== Stellating polygons ==

Stellating a regular polygon symmetrically creates a regular star polygon or polygonal compound. These polygons are characterised by the number of times &quot;m&quot; that the polygonal boundary winds around the centre of the figure. Like all regular polygons, their vertices lie on a circle. &quot;m&quot; also corresponds to the number of vertices around the circle to get from one end of a given edge to the other, starting at 1.

A regular star polygon is represented by its Schläfli symbol {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot;}, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of vertices, &quot;m&quot; is the &quot;step&quot; used in sequencing the edges around it, and &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime (have no common factor). The case &quot;m&quot; = 1 gives the convex polygon {&quot;n&quot;}. &quot;m&quot; also must be less than half of &quot;n&quot;; otherwise the lines will either be parallel or diverge, preventing the figure from ever closing.

If &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; do have a common factor, then the figure is a regular compound. For example {6/2} is the regular compound of two triangles {3} or hexagram, while {10/4} is a compound of two pentagrams {5/2}. 

Some authors use the Schläfli symbol for such regular compounds. Others regard the symbol as indicating a single path which is wound &quot;m&quot; times around vertex points, such that one edge is superimposed upon another and each vertex point is visited &quot;m&quot; times. In this case a modified symbol may be used for the compound, for example 2{3} for the hexagram and 2{5/2} for the regular compound of two pentagrams.

A regular &quot;n&quot;-gon has stellations if &quot;n&quot; is even (assuming compounds of multiple degenerate digons are not considered), and stellations if &quot;n&quot; is odd.


Like the heptagon, the octagon also has two octagrammic stellations, one, {8/3} being a star polygon, and the other, {8/2}, being the compound of two squares.

== Stellating polyhedra ==

A polyhedron is stellated by extending the edges or face planes of a polyhedron until they meet again to form a new polyhedron or compound. The interior of the new polyhedron is divided by the faces into a number of cells. The face planes of a polyhedron may divide space into many such cells, and as the stellation process continues then more of these cells will be enclosed. For a symmetrical polyhedron, these cells will fall into groups, or sets, of congruent cells – we say that the cells in such a congruent set are of the same type. A common method of finding stellations involves selecting one or more cell types. 

This can lead to a huge number of possible forms, so further criteria are often imposed to reduce the set to those stellations that are significant and unique in some way. 

A set of cells forming a closed layer around its core is called a shell. For a symmetrical polyhedron, a shell may be made up of one or more cell types.

Based on such ideas, several restrictive categories of interest have been identified.
* Main-line stellations. Adding successive shells to the core polyhedron leads to the set of main-line stellations.
* Fully supported stellations. The underside faces of a cell can appear externally as an &quot;overhang.&quot; In a fully supported stellation there are no such overhangs, and all visible parts of a face are seen from the same side.
* Monoacral stellations. Literally &quot;single-peaked.&quot; Where there is only one kind of peak, or vertex, in a stellation (i.e. all vertices are congruent within a single symmetry orbit), the stellation is monoacral. All such stellations are fully supported.
* Primary stellations. Where a polyhedron has planes of mirror symmetry, edges falling in these planes are said to lie in primary lines. If all edges lie in primary lines, the stellation is primary. All primary stellations are fully supported. 
* Miller stellations. In &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot; Coxeter, Du Val, Flather and Petrie record five rules suggested by Miller. Although these rules refer specifically to the icosahedron&#x27;s geometry, they have been adapted to work for arbitrary polyhedra. They ensure, among other things, that the rotational symmetry of the original polyhedron is preserved, and that each stellation is different in outward appearance. The four kinds of stellation just defined are all subsets of the Miller stellations.

We can also identify some other categories:
*A partial stellation is one where not all elements of a given dimensionality are extended.
*A sub-symmetric stellation is one where not all elements are extended symmetrically.

The Archimedean solids and their duals can also be stellated. Here we usually add the rule that all of the original face planes must be present in the stellation, i.e. we do not consider partial stellations. For example the cube is not usually considered a stellation of the cuboctahedron.

Generalising Miller&#x27;s rules there are:
* 4 stellations of the rhombic dodecahedron
* 187 stellations of the triakis tetrahedron
* 358,833,097 stellations of the rhombic triacontahedron
* 17 stellations of the cuboctahedron (4 are shown in Wenninger&#x27;s &quot;Polyhedron Models&quot;)
* An unknown number of stellations of the icosidodecahedron; there are 7,071,671 non-chiral stellations, but the number of chiral stellations is unknown. (20 are shown in Wenninger&#x27;s &quot;Polyhedron Models&quot;)

Seventeen of the nonconvex uniform polyhedra are stellations of Archimedean solids.

===Miller&#x27;s rules===
In the book &quot;The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra&quot;, J.C.P. Miller proposed a set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered &quot;properly significant and distinct&quot;.

These rules have been adapted for use with stellations of many other polyhedra. Under Miller&#x27;s rules we find:
* There are no stellations of the tetrahedron, because all faces are adjacent
* There are no stellations of the cube, because non-adjacent faces are parallel and thus cannot be extended to meet in new edges
* There is 1 stellation of the octahedron, the stella octangula
* There are 3 stellations of the dodecahedron: the small stellated dodecahedron, the great dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron, all of which are Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra.
* There are 58 stellations of the icosahedron, including the great icosahedron (one of the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra), and the second and final stellations of the icosahedron. The 59th model in &quot;The fifty nine icosahedra&quot; is the original icosahedron itself.

Many &quot;Miller stellations&quot; cannot be obtained directly by using Kepler&#x27;s method. For example many have hollow centres where the original faces and edges of the core polyhedron are entirely missing: there is nothing left to be stellated. On the other hand, Kepler&#x27;s method also yields stellations which are forbidden by Miller&#x27;s rules since their cells are edge- or vertex-connected, even though their faces are single polygons. This discrepancy received no real attention until Inchbald (2002).

===Other rules for stellation=== 
Miller&#x27;s rules by no means represent the &quot;correct&quot; way to enumerate stellations. They are based on combining parts within the stellation diagram in certain ways, and don&#x27;t take into account the topology of the resulting faces. As such there are some quite reasonable stellations of the icosahedron that are not part of their list – one was identified by James Bridge in 1974, while some &quot;Miller stellations&quot; are questionable as to whether they should be regarded as stellations at all – one of the icosahedral set comprises several quite disconnected cells floating symmetrically in space.

As yet an alternative set of rules that takes this into account has not been fully developed. Most progress has been made based on the notion that stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting, whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices. For every stellation of some polyhedron, there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron, and vice versa. By studying facettings of the dual, we gain insights into the stellations of the original. Bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual, the dodecahedron.

Some polyhedronists take the view that stellation is a two-way process, such that any two polyhedra sharing the same face planes are stellations of each other. This is understandable if one is devising a general algorithm suitable for use in a computer program, but is otherwise not particularly helpful.

Many examples of stellations can be found in the list of Wenninger&#x27;s stellation models.

== Stellating polytopes ==

The stellation process can be applied to higher dimensional polytopes as well. A stellation diagram of an &quot;n&quot;-polytope exists in an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional hyperplane of a given facet.

For example, in 4-space, the great grand stellated 120-cell is the final stellation of the regular 4-polytope 120-cell.

==Naming stellations==
The first systematic naming of stellated polyhedra was Cayley&#x27;s naming of the regular star polyhedra (nowadays known as the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra). This system was widely, but not always systematically, adopted for other polyhedra and higher polytopes.

John Conway devised a terminology for stellated polygons, polyhedra and polychora (Coxeter 1974). In this system the process of extending edges to create a new figure is called &quot;stellation&quot;, that of extending faces is called &quot;greatening&quot; and that of extending cells is called &quot;aggrandizement&quot; (this last does not apply to polyhedra). This allows a systematic use of words such as &#x27;stellated&#x27;, &#x27;great&#x27;, and &#x27;grand&#x27; in devising names for the resulting figures. For example Conway proposed some minor variations to the names of the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra.

==Stellation to infinity==
Wenninger noticed that some polyhedra, such as the cube, do not have any finite stellations. However stellation cells can be constructed as prisms which extend to infinity. The figure comprising these prisms may be called a stellation to infinity. By most definitions of a polyhedron, however, these stellations are not strictly polyhedra. 

Wenninger&#x27;s figures occurred as duals of the uniform hemipolyhedra, where the faces that pass through the center are sent to vertices &quot;at infinity&quot;.

==From mathematics to art==


Alongside from his contributions to mathematics, Magnus Wenninger is described in the context of the relationship of mathematics and art as making &quot;especially beautiful&quot; models of complex stellated polyhedra.

The Italian Renaissance artist Paolo Uccello created a floor mosaic showing a small stellated dodecahedron in the Basilica of St Mark, Venice, c. 1430. Uccello&#x27;s depiction was used as the symbol for the Venice Biennale in 1986 on the topic of &quot;Art and Science&quot;. The same stellation is central to two lithographs by M. C. Escher: &quot;Contrast (Order and Chaos)&quot;, 1950, and &quot;Gravitation&quot;, 1952.

<text>Adalberto Rodríguez (January 22, 1934 – April 16, 1995), better known as Machuchal, was a Puerto Rican actor and comedian.

Rodríguez was born in the town of Sabana Grande, in southwest Puerto Rico. In his boyhood years he imitated animal sounds for his elementary school peers. His &quot;Machuchal&quot; stage name is that of the Sabana Grande barrio where he grew up. He enjoyed calling himself &quot;El alcalde de Machuchal&quot;, (the Mayor of Machuchal). The joke not only prevailed, it also helped launch him into stardom.

At age 17 and following high school, (1951), Adalberto Rodríguez moved to Río Piedras to enter the University of Puerto Rico with a view to obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration, and then, to pursue the career of attorney. Shortly after and at the same time, he worked as an announcer on radio station WIAC.

Machuchal was drafted to the military service in 1953 and served in the United States Army with the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He also fought in the Korean War. After his discharge in 1955 Rodríguez went back to Puerto Rico and resumed his studies earning a bachelor degree in business administration at UPR in 1957.

Rodríguez played the role of Puerto Rico&#x27;s mountain man, known as &quot;Jíbaro&quot;. He would wear the typical Jíbaro straw hat and the farmer&#x27;s typical shirt for many years on his daily appearances on Telemundo Puerto Rico&#x27;s midday show, &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;.

Rodríguez also participated in &quot;La Taberna India&quot;, (The &quot;India&quot; Tavern), a show that was sponsored for many years by the Puerto Rican beer of the same name. When &quot;La Taberna India&quot; moved to WAPA-TV in 1985-having by then become &quot;La Taberna Budweiser&quot;, &quot;Machuchal&quot; also moved to Telemundo Puerto Rico&#x27;s fiercest rival.

Rodríguez once prompted Mexican comedian Cantinflas to compliment him, saying that nobody in the world made him laugh like Machuchal did. Machuchal also participated in some movies, including &quot;Machuchal En Nueva York&quot; and &quot;El Agente 0&quot;.

Rodríguez also worked alongside other Puerto Rican show business figures, such as Tommy Muñiz, José Miguel Agrelot, Elin Ortiz, Sonia Noemí, and Eddie Miró.

In November 17 2024, Adalberto Rodríguez was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<text>Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. was an American semiconductor company based in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1957 as a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument by the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; who defected from Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. It became a pioneer in the manufacturing of transistors and of integrated circuits. Schlumberger bought the firm in 1979 and sold it to National Semiconductor in 1987; Fairchild was spun off as an independent company again in 1997. In September 2016, Fairchild was acquired by ON Semiconductor.

The company had locations in the United States at San Jose, California; San Rafael, California; South Portland, Maine; West Jordan, Utah; and Mountain Top, Pennsylvania. Outside the US, it operated locations in Australia; Singapore; Bucheon, South Korea; Penang, Malaysia; Suzhou, China; and Cebu, Philippines, among others.

==History==

===1950s===
In 1955, William Shockley founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, funded by Beckman Instruments in Mountain View, California; his plan was to develop a new type of &quot;4-layer diode&quot; that would work faster and have more uses than then-current transistors. At first he attempted to hire some of his former colleagues from Bell Labs, but none were willing to move to the West Coast or work with Shockley again at that time. Shockley then founded the core of the new company with what he considered the best and brightest graduates coming out of American engineering schools.

While Shockley was effective as a recruiter, he was less effective as a manager. A core group of Shockley employees, later known as the traitorous eight, became unhappy with his management of the company. The eight men were Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts. Looking for funding on their own project, they turned to Sherman Fairchild&#x27;s Fairchild Camera and Instrument, an Eastern U.S. company with considerable military contracts. In 1957 the Fairchild Semiconductor division was started with plans to make silicon transistors at a time when germanium was still the most common material for semiconductor use.

According to Sherman Fairchild, Noyce&#x27;s impassioned presentation of his vision was the reason Sherman Fairchild had agreed to create the semiconductor division for the traitorous eight. Noyce advocated the use of silicon as substrate – since the material costs would consist of sand and a few fine wires, the major cost would be in the manufacturing process. Noyce also expressed his belief that silicon semiconductors would herald the start of disposable appliances that, due to cheap electronic components, would not be repaired but merely discarded when worn out.

Their first transistors were of the silicon mesa variety, innovative for their time, but exhibiting relatively poor reliability.

Fairchild&#x27;s first marketed transistor was the 1958 2N697, a mesa transistor developed by Moore, and it was a success. The first batch of 100 was sold to IBM for $150 apiece in order to build the computer for the B-70 bomber. More were sold to Autonetics to build the guidance system for the Minuteman ballistic missile.

At the same time Jean Hoerni developed the planar process, which was a major improvement: planar transistors could be made more easily, at a lower cost and with greater performance and reliability, making other transistors obsolete. One such casualty was Philco&#x27;s transistor division, whose newly built $40 million plant to make their germanium PADT process transistors became nonviable. Within a few years, every other transistor company paralleled or licensed the Fairchild planar process. Hoerni&#x27;s 2N1613 was a major success, with Fairchild licensing the design across the industry.

In 1960, Fairchild built a circuit with four transistors on a single wafer of silicon, thereby creating the first silicon integrated circuit (Texas Instruments&#x27; Jack Kilby had developed an integrated circuit made of germanium on September 12, 1958, and was awarded a U.S. patent, however Kilby&#x27;s method was not scalable and the semiconductor industry adopted Fairchild&#x27;s process to manufacture integrated circuits). The company grew from twelve to twelve thousand employees, and was soon making $130 million a year.

===1960s===
Fairchild&#x27;s Noyce and Texas Instrument&#x27;s Kilby had independently invented the integrated circuit (IC) based on bipolar technology. In 1960, Noyce invented the planar integrated circuit. The industry preferred Fairchild&#x27;s invention over Texas Instruments&#x27; because the transistors in planar ICs were interconnected by a thin film deposit, whereas Texas Instruments&#x27; invention required fine wires to connect the individual circuits. Noyce&#x27;s invention was enabled by the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni. In turn, Hoerni&#x27;s planar process was inspired by the surface passivation method developed at Bell Labs by Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick in 1955 and 1957.

At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch and Derick technique and transistors was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni, who would later invent the planar process in 1959 while at Fairchild Semiconductor.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented at Bell Labs an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer, this concept forms the basis of CMOS technology today. In 1963, Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass built CMOS MOSFET logic.

In 1963, Fairchild hired Robert Widlar to design analog operational amplifiers using Fairchild&#x27;s process. Since Fairchild&#x27;s processes were optimized for digital circuits, Widlar collaborated with process engineer Dave Talbert. The collaboration resulted in two revolutionary products – μA702 and μA709. Hence, Fairchild dominated the analog integrated circuit market, having introduced the first IC operational amplifiers, or &quot;op-amps&quot;, Bob Widlar&#x27;s μA702 (in 1964) and μA709. In 1968, Fairchild introduced David Fullagar&#x27;s μA741, which became the most popular IC op amp of all time.

By 1965, Fairchild&#x27;s process improvements had brought low-cost manufacturing to the semiconductor industry – making Fairchild nearly the only profitable semiconductor manufacturer in the United States. Fairchild dominated the market in DTL, op-amps and mainframe computer custom circuits. In 1965, Fairchild opened a semiconductor assembly plant on the Navajo Nation in Shiprock, New Mexico. At its peak, the plant employed over a thousand Navajos, the majority of whom were women. In &quot;The Shiprock Dedication Commemorative Brochure&quot; released by the Fairchild company, the Diné (Navajo) women circuit makers were celebrated as &quot;culture workers who produced circuits as part of the &#x27;reproductive&#x27; labor of expressing Navajo culture, rather than merely for wages.&quot; This claim was based on the opinion that circuits of the electronic chips had a mere resemblance with the complex geometric patterns on the Navajo rugs. Paul Driscoll, the Shiprock plant manager, spoke of the &quot;untapped wealth of natural characteristics of the Navajo...the &quot;inherent flexibility&quot; and dexterity of the Indians.&quot; Although highly successful during its operation, the plant was closed in 1975. While the Fairchild corporation claims the Diné women were chosen to work in the Shiprock plant due to their &quot;&#x27;nimble fingers&#x27;&quot; as previously noted, the women of the Shiprock reservation were actually chosen as the workforce due to a lack of labor rights asserted by the women in addition to &quot;cheap, plentiful workers and tax benefits&quot;.

Fairchild had not done well in the digital integrated circuit market. Their first line of ICs was the &quot;micrologic&quot; resistor–transistor logic (RTL) line which was used in the Apollo Guidance Computer. It had the advantage of being extremely simple – each inverter consisted of just one transistor and two resistors. The logic family had many drawbacks that had made it marginal for commercial purposes, and not well suited for military applications: the logic could only tolerate about 100 millivolts of noise – far too low for comfort. It was awhile before Fairchild relied on more robust designs, such as diode–transistor logic (DTL) which had much better noise margins.

Sales due to Fairchild semiconductor division had doubled each year and by the mid-1960s comprised two-thirds of total sales of the parent company. In 1966, Fairchild&#x27;s sales were second to those of Texas Instruments, followed in third place by Motorola. Noyce was rewarded with the position of corporate vice-president and hence became the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the semiconductor division.

However, internal trouble at Fairchild began to surface with a drop in earnings in 1967. There was increasing competition from newer start-ups. The semiconductor division, situated in Mountain View and Palo Alto, California, was actually managed by executives from Syosset, New York, who visited the California sites once a year, even though the semiconductor division earned most of the profits of the company. Fairchild&#x27;s president at that time, John Carter, had used all the profits to fund acquisitions of unprofitable ventures.

Noyce&#x27;s position on Fairchild&#x27;s executive staff was consistently compromised by Sherman Fairchild&#x27;s faction. Charles E. Sporck was Noyce&#x27;s operations manager. Sporck was reputed to run the tightest operation in the world. Sporck, Pierre Lamond and most managers had grown upset and disillusioned with corporate focus on unprofitable ventures at the expense of the semiconductor division. Executives at the semiconductor division were allotted substantially fewer stock options compared to other divisions. In March 1967, Sporck was hired away by Peter J. Sprague to National Semiconductor. Sporck brought with him four other Fairchild personnel. Actually, Lamond had previously assembled a team of Fairchild managers in preparation to defect to Plessey, a British company. Lamond had recruited Sporck to be his own boss. When negotiations with Plessey broke down over stock options, Lamond and Sporck succumbed to Widlar&#x27;s and Talbert&#x27;s (who were already employed at National Semiconductor) suggestion that they look to National Semiconductor. Widlar and Talbert had earlier left Fairchild to join Molectro, which was later acquired by National Semiconductor.

In the fall of 1967, Fairchild suffered a loss for the first time since 1958 and announced write-offs of $4 million due to excess capacity, which contributed to a total loss of $7.6 million. Profits had sunk to $0.50 a share, compared to $3 a share the previous year, while the value of the stock dropped in half. In October 1967, the board ordered Carter to sell off all of Fairchild&#x27;s unprofitable ventures. Carter responded to the order by resigning abruptly.

Furthermore, Fairchild&#x27;s DTL technology was being overtaken by Texas Instruments&#x27;s faster TTL (transistor–transistor logic).

While Noyce was considered the natural successor to Carter, the board decided not to promote him. Sherman Fairchild led the board to choose Richard Hodgson. Within a few months Hodgson was replaced by a management committee led by Noyce, while Sherman Fairchild looked for a new CEO other than Noyce. In response, Noyce discreetly planned a new company with Gordon Moore, the head of R&amp;D. They left Fairchild to found Intel in 1968 and were soon joined by Andrew Grove and Leslie L. Vadász, who took with them the revolutionary MOS Silicon Gate Technology (SGT), recently created in the Fairchild R&amp;D Laboratory by Federico Faggin who also designed the Fairchild 3708, the world’s first commercial MOS integrated circuit using SGT. Fairchild MOS Division was slow in understanding the potential of the SGT which promised not only faster, more reliable, and denser circuits, but also new device types that could enlarge the field of solid state electronics – for example, CCDs for image sensors, dynamic RAMs, and non-volatile memory devices such as EPROM and flash memories. Intel took advantage of the SGT for its memory development. Federico Faggin, frustrated, left Fairchild to join Intel in 1970 and design the first microprocessors using SGT. Among the investors of Intel were Hodgson and five of the founding members of Fairchild.

Sherman Fairchild hired Lester Hogan, who was the head of Motorola semiconductor division. Hogan proceeded to hire another hundred managers from Motorola to entirely displace the management of Fairchild.

The loss of these iconic executives, coupled with Hogan&#x27;s displacement of Fairchild managers demoralized Fairchild and prompted the entire exodus of employees to found new companies.

Many of the original founders, otherwise known as the &quot;fairchildren&quot;, had left Fairchild in the 1960s to form companies that grew to prominence in the 1970s. Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore were among the last of the original founders to leave, at which point the brain-drain of talents that had fueled the growth of the company was complete.

A Fairchild advertisement of the time showed a collage of the logos of Silicon Valley with the annotation &quot;We started it all&quot;.
It was later, in 1971, Don Hoefler popularizated the name &quot;Silicon Valley USA&quot; in &quot;Electronic News&quot;. He notes he did not invent the name. See also Gregory Gromov and &quot;TechCrunch&quot; 2014 update of Hoefler&#x27;s article.

===1970s===
Hogan&#x27;s action to hire from Motorola had Motorola file a lawsuit against Fairchild, which the court then decided in Fairchild&#x27;s favor in 1973. Judge William Copple ruled that Fairchild&#x27;s results were so unimpressive that it was impossible to assess damages &quot;under any theory&quot;. Hogan was dismissed as president the next year, but remained as vice chairman.

In 1973, Fairchild became the first company to produce a commercial charge-coupled device (CCD) following its invention at Bell Labs. Digital image sensors are still produced today at their descendant company, Fairchild Imaging. The CCD had a difficult birth, with the devastating effects on Fairchild of the 1973–75 recession that followed on the 1973 oil crisis.

After Intel introduced the 8008 8-bit microprocessor, Fairchild developed the Fairchild F8 8-bit microprocessor, which was according to the CPU Museum &quot;in 1977 the F8 was the world&#x27;s leading microprocessor in terms of CPU sales.&quot;

In 1976, the company released the first video game system to use ROM cartridges, the Fairchild Video Entertainment System (or VES) later renamed Channel F, using the F8 microprocessor. The system was successful initially, but quickly lost popularity when the Atari 2600 Video Computer System (or VCS) was released.

By the end of the 1970s they had few new products in the pipeline, and increasingly turned to niche markets with their existing product line, notably &quot;hardened&quot; integrated circuits for military and space applications and isoplanar ECL products used in exotic applications like Cray Computers. Fairchild was being operated at a loss, and the bottomline subsisted mostly from licensing of its patents.

In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument was purchased by Schlumberger Limited, an oil field services company, for $425 million. At this time, Fairchild&#x27;s intellectual properties, on which Fairchild had been subsisting, were expiring.

===1980s===
In 1980, under Schlumberger management, the Fairchild Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence Research (FLAIR) was started within Fairchild Research.
In 1985 the lab was separated to form Schlumberger Palo Alto Research (SPAR).

Fairchild research developed the Clipper architecture, a 32-bit RISC-like computer architecture, in the 1980s, resulting in the shipping of the C100 chip in 1986. The technology was later sold to Intergraph, its main customer.

Schlumberger sold Fairchild to National Semiconductor in 1987 for $200 million. The sale did not include Fairchild&#x27;s Test Division, which designed and produced automated test equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor manufacturing industry, nor did it include Schlumberger Palo Alto Research.

In the early 1980s, Fairchild was one of several silicon valley tech companies involved in a lawsuit brought on by residents of San Jose, California. The case pertained to industrial solvent contamination of ground water and soil in San Jose&#x27;s Los Paseos neighborhood. A settlement was reached and the area designated a superfund. Superfund site cleanup ended in 1998.

===1990s===
In 1997, the reconstituted Fairchild Semiconductor was reborn as an independent company, based in South Portland, Maine, with Kirk Pond as CEO.

On March 11, 1997, National Semiconductor Corporation announced the US$550 million sale of a reconstituted Fairchild to the management of Fairchild with the backing of Sterling LLC, a unit of Citicorp Venture Capital. Fairchild carried with it what was mostly the Standard Products group previously segregated by Gil Amelio.

The Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation announced November 27, 1997, that it would acquire the semiconductor division of the Raytheon Corporation for about $120 million in cash. The acquisition was completed on December 31, 1997.

In December 1998, Fairchild announced the acquisition of Samsung&#x27;s power division, which made power MOSFETs, IGBTs, etc. The deal was finalized in April 1999 for $450 million. Fairchild remained an important supplier for Samsung.

In August 1999, Fairchild Semiconductor again became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol FCS. Fairchild&#x27;s South Portland, Maine, and Mountaintop, Pennsylvania, locations are the longest continuously operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the world, both operating since 1960.

===2000s===
On March 19, 2001, Fairchild Semiconductor announced that it had completed the acquisition of Intersil Corporation&#x27;s discrete power business for approximately $338 million in cash. The acquisition moved Fairchild into position as the second-largest power MOSFET supplier in the world, representing a 20 percent share of this $3 billion market that grew 40 percent last year.

On September 6, 2001, Fairchild Semiconductor announced the acquisition of Impala Linear Corporation, based in San Jose, California, for approximately $6 million in stock and cash. Impala brought with it expertise in designing analog power management semiconductors for hand-held devices like laptops, MP3 players, cell phones, portable test equipment and PDAs.

On January 9, 2004, Fairchild Semiconductor CEO Kirk Pond was appointed as a Director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, elected by member banks to serve a three-year term.

On April 13, 2005, Fairchild announced appointment of Mark Thompson as CEO of the corporation. Thompson would also be President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Fairchild Semiconductor International. He originally joined Fairchild as Executive Vice President, Manufacturing and Technology Group.

On March 15, 2006, Fairchild Semiconductor announced that Kirk P. Pond would retire as Chairman at the company&#x27;s annual stockholders&#x27; meeting on May 3, 2006. Pond would continue as a member of the company’s board of directors. Mark Thompson (then CEO) became Chairman.

On September 1, 2007, New Jersey–based RF semiconductor supplier Anadigics acquired Fairchild Semiconductor&#x27;s RF design team, located in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts, for $2.4 million.

===2010s===
In April 2011, Fairchild Semiconductor acquired TranSiC, a silicon carbide power transistor company originally based in Sweden.

On November 18, 2015, ON Semiconductor made an offer to acquire Fairchild Semiconductor for $2.4 billion (or $20 per share) after a few months of speculation that Fairchild was seeking a potential buyer.

On April 10, 2016, Fairchild Semiconductor moved its headquarters from San Jose (3030 Orchard Pkwy.) to Sunnyvale (1272 Borregas Ave.).

On September 19, 2016, ON Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor jointly announced that ON Semiconductor had completed its announced $2.4 billion cash acquisition of Fairchild.

In the fall of 2016, the Fairchild &#x27;ON&#x27; Semiconductor International closed the West Jordan, Utah, manufacturing plant.

==Landmark status==
On May 8, 1991, the State Historic Preservation Office designated the site of invention of the first commercially practicable integrated circuit as a California historical landmark #1000. A description on the commemorative plaque reads: &quot;At this site in 1959, Dr. Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation invented the first integrated circuit that could be produced commercially. Based on &#x27;planar&#x27; technology, an earlier Fairchild breakthrough, Noyce&#x27;s invention consisted of a complete electronic circuit inside a small silicon chip. His innovation helped revolutionize &#x27;Silicon Valley&#x27;s&#x27; semiconductor electronics industry, and brought profound change to the lives of people everywhere.&quot;

<doc id="180264" wikidata="Q11720" url="?curid=180264" title="Shenyang">
<text>Shenyang is a sub-provincial city in China and the provincial capital of Liaoning province. It is the province&#x27;s most populous city with a population of 9,070,093 as of the 2020 census, also making it the largest city in Northeast China by urban population, and the second-largest by metropolitan population (behind Harbin). The Shenyang metropolitan area is one of the major megalopolises in China, with a population of over 23 million. The city&#x27;s administrative region includes the ten metropolitan districts, the county-level city of Xinmin, and the counties of Kangping and Faku.

Shenyang has been controlled by numerous different states and peoples during its history. In the 14th century, the city came under the control of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), for whom it served as an important military stronghold. The 1621 Battle of Shen-Liao resulted in Shenyang briefly serving as the capital of the Jurchen Later Jin dynasty, the direct predecessor of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). The 1905 Battle of Mukden took place south of Shenyang as part of the Russo-Japanese War. The subsequent Japanese victory allowed its annexation of the region west of the old city and the increase of Japanese influence in Shenyang. In 1931, the Mukden incident led to the Japanese invasion and occupation of the rest of Northeast China, and the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, Shenyang remained a stronghold of the Kuomintang until its capture by the Communists in 1948 following the Liaoshen campaign.

Together with its surrounding cities, Shenyang is an important industrial center in China, and serves as the transportation and commercial hub of China&#x27;s northeast—particularly involved in links with Japan, Russia, and Korea. A center of heavy industry in China since the 1930s, and the spearhead of the Chinese central government&#x27;s Northeast Area Revitalization Plan, the city has been diversifying its industry, including expanding into the service sector. Growing industries include software, automotive and electronics. Shenyang is also a major city for scientific research and education in Northeast China. , it was listed among the top 125 cities by scientific output in the world, as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is home to several major universities, notably Northeastern University and Liaoning University, listed as prestigious universities in the Double First-Class Construction.

==Name==
&quot;Shenyang&quot; literally means &quot;the &quot;yang&quot; side of the Shen River&quot; and refers to the location of the Hun River (formerly called the Shen River, ), on the southern side of the city. According to Chinese naming tradition, a river&#x27;s north bank and a mountain&#x27;s south slope are angled more towards direct sunlight and thus are considered the &quot;sunny&quot;, or &quot;yang&quot;, side.

==History==
===Early history===

Archaeological findings show that humans resided in present-day Shenyang as early as 8000 years ago. The remains of the Xinle culture, a late Neolithic period society over 6800–7200 years old, are located in a museum in the north part of Huanggu District. It is complemented by a recreated village on site.

The city now known as Shenyang was first established during the Warring States period by Yan general Qin Kai, who conquered the Liaodong region from Gojoseon. It was then named Hou City (). Around 350 years later, during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han, the city was sacked and burnt by the Donghu nomads and subsequently abandoned. The area of modern Shenyang was divided between two commanderies called Liaodong and Xuantu . Liaodong was seized by a Han governor in 189. Liaodong and Xuantu were briefly united under Cao Wei and the Jin dynasty (266–420). The region was in disarray during the fourth century until the Goguryeo occupied both commanderies in 404. Under Goguryeo, the city was called Gaemo. They established the cities of Xuantucheng and Gaimoucheng in the region. The Sui dynasty recaptured the area and established a new Liaodong Commandery in what is now modern Shenyang. In 645, the Tang dynasty invaded Goguryeo and captured Xuantucheng and Gaimoucheng. Soon after, Liaodong was administratively reorganized and enjoyed nearly 250 years of stability and development.

In 916, the Shenyang region was captured by the Liao dynasty and was known as Shen Prefecture () until the end of Jin dynasty (who conquered the region in 1116). The area became known as the Shenyang Circuit () during the Yuan dynasty. After the fall of the Yuan, Shenyang came under the control of the Ming dynasty, and it was designated a guard town named Shenyang Central Guard (). During the Ming dynasty, Shenyang became one of the most important Chinese military strongholds beyond the Shanhai Pass.

===Manchu period===
In 1625, the Jurchen leader Nurhaci captured Shenyang from the Ming and decided to relocate his entire administrative infrastructure to the city, which was then called hoton ()in the Manchu language, Simiyan itself being the Manchu&#x27;s homophonic translation of the Korean&#x27;s rendering of the name Shenyang (심양). The official name was changed to Mukden (), or Shengjing () in 1634. The new name derives from the Manchu word, (), meaning &#x27;to rise&#x27; as reflected also by its Han Chinese name. Under Nurhaci&#x27;s orders, the Imperial Palace was constructed in 1626, symbolizing the city&#x27;s emerging status as the Jurchen political center. The palace featured more than 300 ostentatiously decorated rooms and 20 gardens as a symbol of power and grandeur.

After the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 and the routing of the Shun army in the Battle of Shanhai Pass just a day later, the Manchus successfully entered the Shanhai Pass to establish the Qing dynasty in China proper. The capital was subsequently relocated from Shenyang to Beijing. However, Shenyang retained considerable importance as the secondary capital and spiritual home of the Qing dynasty through the centuries. Treasures of the royal house were kept at its palaces, and the tombs of the early Qing rulers were once among the most famous monuments in China. In 1657, Fengtian Prefecture (; or ) was established in the Shenyang area, and Fengtian was sometimes used synonymously with Shenyang/Mukden.

===Russian and Japanese influence===

After the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, Japan coerced the annexation of the Liaodong Peninsula with the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, but had to give it up due to diplomatic pressure from the 1895 Triple Intervention. In the aftermath of the Japanese threat, Qing viceroy Li Hongzhang visited Moscow in 1896 and signed a secret treaty with Russian foreign minister Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, allowing the Russian Empire to build a Russian-gauge railway through Manchuria, which opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of another lease convention in 1898, effectively allowing Russia to annex Port Arthur in all but name. However, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Russian forces used that anti-foreigner insurgency as a pretext to formally invade and occupy most of Manchuria, and Mukden became a Russian stronghold in the Far East with the building of what would become the South Manchurian Railway - from Harbin via Mukden to Dalny.

During the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Mukden became the site of the Battle of Mukden from February 19 to March 10, 1905. Involving more than 600,000 combat participants, it was the largest battle since the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, and also the largest modern-era battle ever fought in Asia before World War II. Following this Japanese victory, Mukden became one of the chief bases of Japanese presence and economic expansion into southern Manchuria. It also became the government seat of Fengtian province in 1910. Mukden became one of the main epicenters of the Manchurian plague (1910–1911), which ultimately resulted in approximately 60,000 deaths.

===Warlord Era and Japanese occupation===
In 1914, the city changed back to its old name Shenyang, but continued to be known as Mukden (sometimes spelled Moukden) in some English sources and in Japan through much of the first half of the 20th century. The postmark of the Chinese postal administration kept the spelling &quot;MOUKDEN/&quot; for usage on international mails until the late 1920s. After that, a Chinese–Manchurian bilingual type &quot;SHENYANG (MUKDEN)/ ()&quot; datestamp was used until 1933.

In the early 20th century, Shenyang began expanding out of its old city walls. The Shenyang Railway Station on the South Manchurian Railway and the Shenyang North Railway Station on the Jingfeng Railway, both west of the old city, became the new commercial centers of Shenyang. In the 1920s, Mukden was the capital of the warlord Zhang Zuolin, who was later assassinated when his train was blown up on 4 June 1928 at a Japanese-guarded railway bridge. At the time, several factories were built by Zhang to manufacture ammunition in the northern and eastern suburbs. These factories laid the foundation for Shenyang&#x27;s industrial development.

At around 10:20 pm on 18 September 1931, a small quantity of dynamite was detonated close to a railway line near Mukden owned by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company by Kwantung Army Lt. Kawamoto Suemori. The Imperial Japanese Army, accusing Chinese dissidents of the act, then used the false flag explosion as pretext to launch a full attack on Mukden, and captured the city the following morning (September 19). After the Mukden Incident, the Japanese further invaded and occupied the rest of Northeast China, and created the puppet state of Manchukuo with the deposed emperor Aisin Gioro Puyi as the figurehead. During the Manchukuo era (1932–1945), the city was again called Fengtian (and Mukden in English), and was developed by the Japanese into a center of heavy industry. Japan was able to exploit resources in Manchuria using the extensive network of railroads. For example, vast expanses of Manchurian forest were chopped down. The development of Shenyang was also unbalanced in this period; municipal facilities were mostly located in Japanese residential areas, while Chinese residential areas had poor living conditions.

===Post-World War II===

Under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, the Far East Command of the Red Army occupied Manchuria in early August 1945 following the surrender of Japan. On 16 August 1945, Manchurian Emperor Puyi was captured in Shenyang Airport by the Soviets while he was in an airplane fleeing to Japan. On 20 August, Soviet troops captured Shenyang. British and US reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Northeast China and Eastern Inner Mongolia region looted and terrorized the people of Shenyang, and were not discouraged by Soviet occupation authorities from &quot;three days of rape and pillage&quot;.

The Soviets were replaced by the Republic of China Army, who were flown in on U.S. transport planes. During the Chinese Civil War, Shenyang remained a Kuomintang stronghold supplied by Claire Lee Chennault&#x27;s Civil Air Transport from 1946 to 1948, although the Chinese Communist Party controlled the surrounding countryside. By February 1948 the city was suffering from drastic shortages, and by the summer 140,000 refugees per month were fleeing. It was captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army on October 30, 1948, following a series of offensives led by Lin Biao known as the Liaoshen Campaign.

Over the past 200 years or so, Shenyang managed to grow and increase its industrial might during consecutive wars with Russia and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second World War, and China&#x27;s Civil War (Shenyang became the main battleground between the Communists and Nationalists).

=== 21st century ===
Directed by state efforts to reduce pollution and close unprofitable industry, the city has undergone deindustrialization, with the shutdown of large plants. Most notably, a large 1930s smelter in the central city was closed in 2000. The redevelopment of former polluted industrial land has resulted in gentrification.

==Old City==

The old city of Shenyang resided almost entirely within the modern day Shenhe District, and used to have two city walls.

Situated roughly within the area bounded by the four &quot;Shuncheng&quot; () roads/streets in Shenhe District, the (now-demolished) square-shaped inner city wall marked the bounds of ancient Shenyang. The earliest wall was built in 926 during early Liao dynasty to settle Northern Song civilians the Khitans abducted from raids to use as slave labourers, and was then made of rammed earth because the city was merely a small settlement at the time (historically the administrative center of the Liaodong region was at Liaoyang). However, in 1368, Hongwu Emperor of the newly founded Ming dynasty ordered a new regional military command—the Liaodong Regional Military Commission ()—to be established, and Shenyang was made a prominent regional &quot;guard town&quot; (). In 1388, Min Zhong (), the newly appointed city commissioner of the Shenyang Central Guard, wrote to Hongwu Emperor immediately upon his tenure requesting permission to upgrade the city wall, and the old wall was made taller and thoroughly reinforced with overlaid bricks. According to &quot;History of Ming&quot;, the reconstructed Ming-era wall was 2.5 &quot;zhàng&quot; () tall, more than 1 &quot;zhàng&quot; () wide at the top, and 9 &quot;li&quot; and 30 &quot;bu&quot; (about ) long. It has two layers of moats dug outside, each being 3 &quot;zhàng&quot; () wide and 8 &quot;chi&quot; () deep, fed with water from the Little Shen River (the present day South Canal). There were four city gates, each at the center of one side, connected by two main roads that intersected at Central Temple of the city&#x27;s center in a &quot;+&quot; fashion.

This Ming wall was heavily damaged in 1625 when the Manchus laid siege and captured the city, with only the north wall and gate tower (which had undergone reinforcing reconstructions in 1545 under the orders of Jiajing Emperor) remained intact. The Manchu leader Nurhachi however saw the city&#x27;s strategic value and decided to formally relocate his Later Jin capital from Liaoyang to Shenyang, and ordered the wall to be rebuilt. According to &quot;Annals of Mukden&quot; (), the new city wall was a standard black brick wall standing at a height of 3.5 &quot;zhàng&quot; (about ), a width of 1.8 &quot;zhàng&quot; (about ) and a total length of 9 &quot;li&quot; and 332 &quot;bu&quot; (about ), complete with 12 towers (8 gates and 4 corners) and a widened 14.5-&quot;zhàng&quot; (about ) moat. The city gates were increased from four to eight, though the old Ming-era north gate tower was preserved but sealed shut, later known as the &quot;Ninth Gate&quot; ().

The outer city wall, called the &quot;peripheral wall&quot; () or &quot;pass wall&quot; (), was actually a rammed earth rampart built in 1680 to expand the urban area outside the inner city. It was almost round in shape, standing at a height of 7.5 &quot;chi&quot; (around ) and an overall length of 32 &quot;li&quot; and 24 &quot;bu&quot; (about ), and also had eight towerless gates known as the &quot;peripheral gates&quot; (). The corresponding inner and outer gates were linked by roads that intersected within the inner city in a &quot;#&quot; pattern around the Mukden Palace.

Nearly all of these city walls and gates were demolished after 1949. Two gates and one corner tower of the inner wall were rebuilt during the 1990s. There had, however, been proposals to rebuild the other gates and towers in preparation to the 12th National Games in 2013.

Around outside Shenyang&#x27;s former outer wall, there were four pagodas each located within an associated Tibetan Buddhist temple, namely the East Pagoda in Yongguang Temple (), the South Pagoda in Guangci Temple (), the West Pagoda in Yanshou Temple () and the North Pagoda in Falun Temple (). They were built in 1643 and completed in 1645. The four pagodas are identical white Buddha-stupas as tall as . Nowadays only the temple for the North Pagoda is well preserved, the East and South has only the pagodas left, and the temple for the West Pagoda was rebuilt in 1998.

Both the Temple of Heaven and Temple of Earth were also to be found in the old city during the Qing dynasty. They were smaller replicas of Beijing&#x27;s counterparts. Neither exists today.

==Geography==
Shenyang ranges in latitude from 41° 11&#x27; to 43° 02&#x27; N and in longitude from 122° 25&#x27; to 123° 48&#x27; E, and is located in the central part of Liaoning province. The western parts of the city&#x27;s administrative area are located on the alluvial plain of the Liao River system, while the eastern part consists of the hinterlands of the Changbai Mountains, and is covered with forests. The highest point in Shenyang is above sea level and the lowest point only . The average elevation of the urban area is .

The city&#x27;s main urban area is located to the north of Hun River, formerly the largest tributary of the Liao River &quot;proper&quot; and often locally referred as the city&#x27;s &quot;mother river&quot;. The central urban area is surrounded by three artificial rivers — respectively the South Canal () from the south and southeast, the Xinkai River (, formerly the North Canal) from the north and northeast, and the Weigong River (, formerly the Weigong Nullah) from the west, all interconnected by channels as a continuous waterway. The South Canal in particular, famous for the series of linear parks and gardens along it, was canalized from the old course of the Wanquan River (), historically also called the Little Shen River () or Wuli River (), which was a principal water source for the old city. These are reinforced on the peripheries by smaller rivers such as Xi River (), Puhe River () and Mantang River (), and drains into the Hun River at three different locations on the southeast, due south and southwest side of the city. There was also previously another canal on the east side called Huishan Nullah () that drains into Xinkai River&#x27;s lower section, but is now no longer existent due to land reclamation from urban constructions.

===Environment===
Shenyang has many parks, among the most famous are the South Canal Linear Parks () situated along the homonymous river traversing the southern parts of Dadong, Shenhe and Heping Districts. It comprises 6 large parks and 18 riverside gardens covering an area of approximately , with exotic variety of vegetations such as rose, apricot, bladder cherry, honeylocust, natal lily, scarlet sage, morning glory and black-eyed-Susan, and extensive greenspaces of peach, pear, crabapples, ginkgos, weeping willows, pines and black locusts. It is the largest stretch of vegetated urban open space in Shenyang, contributing significantly to the city&#x27;s 40-percent &quot;greening ratio&quot;, and was instrumental in the city being awarded the &quot;national forest city&quot; title in 2005.

According to the Shenyang Environmental Protection Bureau, winter usage of coal by boiler stations for hydronic district heating is the source of 30 percent of the air pollution in Shenyang. Half of the 16 million metric tons of coal consumed by the city during the winter of 2013–2014 were used for heating. Other major factors include dust from construction sites (20 percent), vehicle exhaust (20 percent), industrial emissions (10 percent) and extraterritorial dust (20 percent, mostly yellow dust from Gobi Desert). However, air quality was described by the Bureau as &quot;slowly improving&quot;.
===Climate===

Shenyang has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcac&quot;) characterised by hot, humid summers due to the monsoon, and dry, cold winters due to the Siberian anticyclone. The four seasons here are distinctive. Nearly half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August. Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July, for an annual average of . The frost-free period is 183 days, which is long considering the severity of the winters. The city receives 2,421 hours of bright sunshine annually; monthly percent of possible ranges from 42 percent in July to 64 percent in February. Extreme temperatures range from to .


==Administrative divisions==

Shenyang&#x27;s metropolitan area traditionally consisted of the 5 small inner urban districts, surrounded by 4 larger outer suburban districts, and accompanied by 4 rural counties on the north and west sides. In general, agriculture, animal husbandry and agricultural product processing dominate northeastern Shenyang; eastern Shenyang is an automotive parts hub; southern Shenyang is a high-tech industrial base; and western Shenyang is home to heavy machinery manufacturing. The city center specialises in retail and financial services.

Out of the rural counties, the Xinmin County was upgraded to a county-level city in 1993, and the Liaozhong County was incorporated into a new suburban district in 2016 as part of the provincial/national development plan.

As a result, Shenyang now officially has direct jurisdiction over 10 city districts, 1 satellite city and 2 rural counties:
===Districts===

====Shenhe District====

The Shenhe District () is a part of the downtown and was also the most developed district in Shenyang. Until 2015, it held the seat of the City Government. The old city wall is entirely located in Shenhe District. It has an area of and a registered population of 716,417 (as per 2014). There is the Central Temple (), built during the Ming dynasty, showing the center of ancient Shenyang. This temple is located just south of the Middle Street (), one of the most famous shopping streets and the first commercial pedestrian zone in China. Shenhe District is also home to the famous Wu&#x27;ai Market (), the largest light industry wholesale trading center in the entire Bohai Economic Rim.

Shenhe District is the site of the Mukden Palace, just south of the Central Temple. It is also the site of Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s former home and headquarters, Shengjing Ancient Cultural Street. In the western Shenhe District there is a Muslim town, and the South Pagoda () is located in southern Shenhe District. There are a lot of high-end hotels located in Shenhe District, such as Sheraton, Kempinski, Lexington, Marriott (which is the first Marriott Hotel directly named &quot;Marriott&quot; in mainland China, but due to finance conflicts is not administered by Marriott International). The major thoroughfare of Youths Avenue (), the city&#x27;s primary north–south arterial road that traverses past the City Government Square () at the modern center of the city linking Beiling Park to the Taoxian Airport, separates the southern portion of Shenhe District from the neighbouring southern Heping District. The iconic Liaoning Broadcast and TV Tower is situated alongside this avenue.

Shenhe District is also home to Northeast China&#x27;s main railway hub, the Shenyang North Railway Station (locally known as the &quot;North Station&quot;). The railways leading to the station forms the border between Shenhe District and the neighbouring eastern portion of Huanggu District. The station building has recently undergone a major overhaul and extension.

====Heping District====
The Heping District () is located in the downtown of Shenyang, bordered Shenhe District. It is currently the most developed district in Shenyang. It has an area of and a population of 645,399 (2014). Heping District has all manner of commercial businesses that are brightly neon-lit at night, centered around Taiyuan Street (), one of the most famous shopping district in the Northeast. The Project 985 university, Northeastern University, is also located in Heping District.

The district, better known as the downtown, sprung up around Shenyang Railway Station (known locally as the &quot;South Station&quot; in contrast to the &quot;North Station&quot; in Shenhe District), the former hub of the South Manchurian Railway. At the center of the district is Zhongshan Square (), which features one of China&#x27;s largest statues of Chairman Mao—a record of the era of the Cultural Revolution. Northwest of Zhongshan Square lies the West Pagoda Korean Neighborhood or Koreatown. Many of the boulevards in this area are lined of very large ginkgo trees, which become golden in color and produce their distinctive fruits in autumn.

Heping District is also the core area for many political institutions in the Northeast, including CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, headquarters of the Northern Theater Command (previously the Shenyang Military Region), General Logistics Department and the consulates-general of the United States, Japan. South Korea, North Korea and other countries. Northeast Electricity, China Post, railways, other such industrial hubs and many media outlets such as Liaoning Radio and Television, Shenyang Radio and Television and &quot;Shenyang Daily&quot; newspaper are also located in this district.

====Dadong District====
The Dadong District () is an industrial zone and used to be the largest of the inner city districts. Its name derives from the fact that the district started off as the residential area immediately outside the old inner city wall&#x27;s Fujin Gate (), which is also called Great East Gate (). It has an area of and a population of 689,576 (2014).

The district contains popular tourist landmarks such as the 9.18 Historical Museum, the North and East Pagodas, Bawang Temple and the Wanquan Park. The oldest airfield in Shenyang, the now-defunct East Pagoda Airport, is also located in Dadong District.

====Huanggu District====

The Huanggu District () is named after Huanggutun (&quot;tun&quot; means village), where the Huanggutun Incident took place. The name is actually a mis-transliteration of the pronunciation for &quot;Fiyanggū&quot; (, , 1605–1643), the Manchu Prince Jian of the First Rank whose tomb was in the area. It has an area of and a population of 817,288 (2014).

The district is the site of Beiling park, the large historical mausoleum of Qing dynasty emperor Huang Taiji, as well as the Liaoning Mansion Hotel. It also hosts the seat of the Provincial Government of Liaoning.

====Tiexi District====
The Tiexi District () is the most populous district and makes up the western part of the inner city, west of the South Manchurian Railway (hence the district&#x27;s name) and south of the Jingshen Railway, and is famous for its heavy industry. This mixed-use district also contains large blocks of residential complexes, so as well as strips of small to medium-sized shopping districts. It previously had only an area of and a population of 764,419. In May 2002, the Shenyang city government annexed a large area of suburban land from the neighbouring Yuhong District to establish a new state-level development zone—the Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (), and transferred its administration to Tiexi District to form the Tiexi New District (), thus giving Tiexi District the current &quot;necked&quot; shape on the map. The new Tiexi District now has a population of 907,091 (2014), a total area of , and enjoys the same administrative rank as a municipality (Administrative Committee of Shenyang).

The district is featured in a 9-hour epic documentary film &quot;West of the Tracks&quot; by a young filmmaker Wang Bing. It shows the transition in this rust belt district—a palimpsest of not only Chinese but also world history. The first factories of this place were built in 1934 by the Japanese to produce war goods for the Imperial Army and nationalized after World War II. As late as the early 1980s, the factories here employed about one million workers, but all of them went jobless in the 1990s.

====Hunnan District====

The Hunnan District (), was formerly called the Dongling District () before June 17, 2014, referring to the UNESCO World Heritage Site-listed tombs dedicated to Nurhachi, the founder of Later Jin, and his empress Monggo-Jerjer. The large suburban district is located on the east and southeast side of urban Shenyang, with most of its territory south of the Hun River, hence its current name. It has an area of and a population of 324,074 (2014). The Shenyang municipal government moved to Hunnan District on 13 October 2015. The Shenyang Botanical Garden and the Shenyang International Expo Garden (which hosted the 2006 International Horticultural Exposition) are also located in this district.

Hunnan District hosts the city&#x27;s only operational commercial airport, the Taoxian International Airport, and is rapidly becoming high-end residential areas with luxury apartments, fine neighbourhoods and commercial developments, as Hunnan becomes the new center of Shenyang steadily with the new government being developed there. The district is traversed by two corridors along two major highways, one leading to the Eastern Mausoleum and the neighbouring city of Fushun, and the other leading to the airport.

Launched in 1988 as the Shenyang National New and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone and elevated to a national-level zone in 1991, the Hunnan New Area () focuses on electronic and information technology products such as software, computers, network systems, communication equipment and audio/visual equipment; advanced manufacturing technologies, especially for automobiles, medical equipment; advanced materials and biological and pharmaceutical products. Foreign companies such as the General Electric Co., Tyco International, and Mitsubishi Group operate in the zone.

====Sujiatun District====
The Sujiatun District () forms the southernmost part of the suburbs, located away from central Shenyang. The 2014 registered population of Sujiatun is 428,859. and it has an area of . Sujiatun is known mostly for its agricultural and industrial activity. It borders the districts of Yuhong and Heping to the north, Dongling to the northeast, Tiexi to the northwest; it also borders the prefecture-level cities of Fushun to the east, Benxi to the southeast, and Liaoyang to the southwest.

====Shenbei New District====
The Shenbei New District (), formerly Xinchengzi District (), is a new development zone and forms the majority of the northern suburbs. It has an area of and a population of 320,370 (2014). It borders Hunnan District to the southeast, Dadong and Huanggu Districts to the south, Yuhong District to the southwest, Xinmin City and Faku County to the northwest; it also borders the prefecture-level cities of Tieling to the northeast and Fushun to the southeast.

====Yuhong District====
The Yuhong District () forms part of the northwestern and western suburbs. It has an area of and a population of 435,333 (2014). It borders Shenbei New District to the northeast, Huanggu District to the east, Tiexi District to the south, and Xinmin City to the west. China Resources Beverage, the distributor of C&#x27;estbon Water, has its Northeast regional office in the district.

The large southwestern part of the neighbouring Tiexi District also used to belong to Yuhong District, but in May 2002, the southwestern part of Yuhong District was ceded on order of the city government to establish the Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and the administration of the region was later transferred to Tiexi District instead. This annexation of land left an exclave territory lying between Tiexi District, Heping District and Sujiatun District, separated from the main body of Yuhong District, hence making the Tiexi District flanked at the &quot;neck&quot; by the two parts of Yuhong.

====Liaozhong District====
The Liaozhong District (, referring to its central location within the province) is the newest and largest suburban district. Formerly the Liaozhong County (), its rural county status was made defunct in January 2016, and formally instated as a suburban city district on April 11, 2016. It lies southwest of downtown Shenyang, near the intersection of G1 Beijing–Harbin Expressway and G91 Liaozhong Ring Expressway. , it had a population of 532,900 residing in an area of . It is the most southwestern part of Shenyang City, bordering Xinmin City to the north, and Tiexi District to the northeast, as well as the prefecture-level cities of Liaoyang to the southeast, Anshan to the south and southwest, and Jinzhou to the west.

===Rural counties===

====Kangping County====

The Kangping County () is the northernmost and most remote part of the Greater Shenyang area, and has an area of with a population of 352,434 (2014). It was historically first established in 1880 under the blessing of the Guangxu Emperor, hence the name. The county borders the Faku County to the south, the prefecture-level cities of Tieling to the east, Fuxin to the southwest and Inner Mongolia&#x27;s Tongliao to the north. The county is mostly agricultural, with majority of its GDP coming from crop and fruit planting. However, in recent years the synthetic fabric, carbon fiber and alternative energy industries begin to take hold in Kangping. The county currently has the third largest wind farm in the whole province.

==Demographics==

Shenyang has a population of 8.1 million and its urban population is 5.74 million.
Ethnically and culturally diverse, Shenyang has 38 of China&#x27;s 56 recognized ethnic groups, including the Han Chinese majority that make up 91.26 percent of Shenyang&#x27;s population.

==Economy==

Shenyang is an important industrial center in China and is the core city of the Shenyang Economic Zone, a New Special Reform Zone. It has been focused on heavy industry, particularly aerospace, machine tools, heavy equipment and defence, and recently on software, automotive and electronics. The heavy industry started in the 1920s and was well developed before the second world war. During the first five-year plan (1951–1956) many factories were built in Tiexi district. At its peak in the 1970s, Shenyang was one of the top three industrial centers in China alongside Shanghai and Tianjin, and was at one time being considered for upgrading to a direct-controlled municipality. However, as the planned economy fell out of favor after the 1980s, the heavy industry had declined gradually and the city became a rust belt city, with hundreds of thousands of people laid off from bankrupted state-owned factories. Nonetheless, the economy of the city has revived significantly in recent years, thanks to the central government&#x27;s &quot;Revitalize Northeast China&quot; campaign and the rapid development of software and auto manufacture industries. Investment subsidies are granted to multinational corporations (MNCs) that set up offices or headquarters in Shenyang.

The services sector—especially banking—has been developing in Shenyang. Shenyang has several foreign banks, such as South Korea&#x27;s Hana Bank, Japan&#x27;s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Hong Kong&#x27;s Bank of East Asia, Singapore&#x27;s United Overseas Bank and the Britain-based HSBC. In 2006, the city hosted a total of 1,063 banks and bank branches and 144 insurance-related companies. By 2010, it aims to attract 30 foreign banks and 60 non-bank financial institutions.

The city has been identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit in the November 2010 Access China White Paper as a member of the CHAMPS (Chongqing, Hefei, Anshan, Maanshan, Pingdingshan and Shenyang), an economic profile of the top 20 emerging cities in China.

Shenyang has three development zones:
* Shenyang Finance and Trade Development Zone
* Shenyang High-Tech Industrial Development Zone
* Shenyang Economic &amp; Technological Development Zone

Numerous major industrial companies have their headquarters in Shenyang. Brilliance Auto is a major Chinese automobile manufacturer, and most of its production plants are also located in Shenyang. Shenyang Aircraft Corporation produces airplanes for civilian use as well as for the PLAAF. Neusoft Group is the biggest software company in China. Shenyang Machine Tool Group is the largest machine tool manufacturer in China. Tyco International, General Motors and Michelin Shenyang Tyre Corporation are expanding their operations in Shenyang.

The GDP per capita of the city of Shenyang is 78,490 yuan in 2009 (ranked 3rd out of all 58 cities and counties in Liaoning province).

==Transportation==
As the transport hub of Northeast China, Shenyang is served by air, rail, a currently Five-line subway system and an extensive network of streets and expressways, with bus services throughout the city. Terminal 3 at Shenyang Taoxian International Airport is the largest terminal in northeast China. A new tram network system was built in the city&#x27;s south in 2013.

===Rail===

Shenyang is the railway hub of Northeast China. Eight railways connect Shenyang with Beijing, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin and Fushun. The city is also served by the Qinhuangdao–Shenyang high-speed railway, the main passenger transport corridor in and out across the Shanhai Pass, and the first passenger-specific railway line in China. In early 2007, a high-speed train decreased travel time between Beijing and Shenyang by almost three-fold to around 4 hours. The Harbin–Dalian high-speed railway opened in late 2012 and connects Shenyang with other major cities in Northeast China such as Harbin, Changchun and Dalian at speeds of up to .

Shenyang has two major railway stations: the Shenyang North railway station in Shenhe District, and the Shenyang railway station in Heping District.

The Shenyang North Railway Station () was formerly the Liaoning General Station () before 1946, and colloquially known as the &quot;Old North Station&quot;. The original station building (now an MHCSPNL-listed heritage building), initially named the Fengtian City Station () at the time of completion, was built in 1927 at the terminal point of Jingfeng Railway, about southwest of the current station site, on the orders of warlord Zhang Zuolin to compete with the then Japanese-administered Shenyang Railway Station. The Main Station Building () of the current &quot;New North Station&quot; began construction in 1986 and was commissioned for operation in December 1990, and became one of the five most important railway hubs in China, earning itself the nickname &quot;Northeast&#x27;s No. 1 Station&quot; (). In 2011, a huge expansion project known as the &quot;North Station Transport Hub Reconstruction Project&quot; () was initiated in response to the growing demand of floor area posed by the increasing passenger traffic after introduction of the high-speed rail service. The station now has an additional 3-storey &quot;Sub-Station Building&quot; () and a &quot;North Square&quot; () on the northern (Huanggu District) side of the railways, while the old waiting lounge in the original 16-storey Main Station Building is now relocated to a large elevated concourse that bridges over the rail tracks, with a pillar-less roof (the largest in mainland China) doming the platforms. The original South Square () outside the Main Station Building was rebuilt into a multi-levelled complex, with two above ground forming an elevated airport-style drop-off zone and a large ground-level area for bus stops, as well as a three-level underground city providing shopping malls, parking lots, taxi pick-up and interchange with Subway Line 2, while also capable of rapid conversion into an air raid shelter if needed.
The Shenyang Railway Station () has a history of more than 100 years. It was built by the Russians in 1899 on the eastern side of the South Manchurian Railway and was named the Fengtian Station () at the time. It was later expanded by the Japanese after the Russo-Japanese War and renamed to Fengtian Yam () until the end of the World War II. Before adopting its current name, the station was known as the Shenyang South Railway Station () or simply the &quot;South Station&quot; (in contrast to the forementioned &quot;North Station&quot;) between 1945 and 1950, a name the locals still use colloquially to present days (though the current Shenyang South railway station is actually at the suburban junction between Hunnan and Sujiatun). Today, the station focuses on regular-speed passenger service and is being refurbished with a large archway and new terminal, reducing access to the boarding platforms by rerouting customers under and over ground while construction is completed. The station was expanded in 2010 with the addition of a new West Station Building () and a West Square () on the western side of the railways. The old East Station Building () is currently on the provincial protected heritage list.

Since 2011, a daily direct container rail service has carried automotive parts from Leipzig, Germany to Shenyang through Siberia with a 23-day transit time.

===Road===

In the Manchukuo era, the initial road transportation network was laid out, as is now in the central districts of Shenyang. The city follows a largely grid-style urban layout, with the roads follow a slightly tilted northwest-to-southeast orientation due to the South Manchurian Railway, which runs perpendicular to that direction. The streets in Shenyang are almost always named according to a routine convention — one that runs more in the north–south direction is called a &quot;street&quot; () or &quot;avenue&quot; (), and one that runs more east–west are call a &quot;road&quot; () or &quot;boulevard&quot; (). The only exceptions to this rule are the east–west Middle Street in Shenhe District, which takes its historical name from ancient times (though its modern official name is actually the &quot;Middle Street Road&quot;); and the north–south Minzhu Road () in Heping District that traverses diagonally across the superblock between the Shenyang Railway Station and the Zhongshan Park, but as one of the only three diagonal streets in the entire city it is accommodated as a &quot;road&quot; instead of &quot;street&quot; in keeping with the other two diagonal counterparts that run east–west.

In addition to the grid streets, Shenyang also was developing several ring road systems, going back as early as the &quot;Fengtian City Plan&quot; () proposed by the Japanese-controlled puppet Manchukuo government in 1932. Outside of the (now demolished) city walls, the city initially planned three beltways, namely the &quot;inner ring&quot;, &quot;middle ring&quot; and &quot;outer ring&quot; roads. Gradually with urban development, the inner ring idea faded away into the inner city grids, but the middle ring concept was retained and later transformed into the nowadays 1st Ring Road (, officially called the &quot;Middle Ring Road&quot; until 1995), and the outer ring morphed roughly into parts of the present day 2nd Ring Road (). The 3rd Ring Road () was completed in 1995, and in 2013 was upgraded into an 8-lane, freeway—the G1501 Shenyang Ring Expressway (). The 10-lane, 4th Ring Road () is a limited-access highway about out from the 3rd Ring, completed in 2013. The planned 6-lane, 5th Ring Road () and the proposed 6th Ring Road (), also known as the G91 Liaozhong Ring Expressway (), are both currently under construction.
Shenyang is connected to the other regions by several major expressways in radial pattern. The G15 Shenda Expressway () to the southwest is the first expressway built in China and is an 8-lane, controlled-access highway with a maximum speed limit of , connecting Shenyang to Dalian, one of the largest port city in China. The Shendan Expressway () to the southeast, part of the G1113 Dandong–Fuxin Expressway that traverses Shenyang from the northwest, is a 4-lane expressway leading to Benxi and Dandong, and also serves Shenyang Taoxian International Airport. The 4-lane G1212 Shenji Expressway () to the east was completed in 2011, linking Shenyang to Jilin via Fushun. The 8-lane Jingshen Expressway () to the west is an integral part of the extended G1 Jingha Expressway () beyond the northeast, and is a major interprovincial &quot;trunk road&quot; across the Shanhai Pass linking to the national capital Beijing some away. There are other smaller provincial-level expressways (&quot;S routes&quot;) to other cities like Fushun, Liaoyang and Panjin, as well as many long-distance and express bus routes to Beijing and other large Northeastern regional centers via major national roads such as the China National Highways 101, 102, 203 and 304.

===Airport===

The city is served by the Shenyang Taoxian International Airport, located in Hunnan District. It is one of the eight major airline hubs and the 23rd busiest airport in China.

There are three other airports in Shenyang, none of them open to public. The East Pagoda Airport () in Dadong District is the oldest airport in Shenyang, opened in 1920s and retired in the 1980s, though there has been proposals in 2013 to relocate and reopen it in Xinmin. The Beiling Airport () in Huanggu District is used by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation for test flights. The Yuhong Airport () in Yuhong District is commissioned for military use only by the local Northern Theater Command garrisons.

===Public transport===

In Shenyang, there are more than 160 bus routes. Shenyang used to have about 20 trolley bus routes, one of the biggest trolley bus networks in China. The entire network was demolished in 1999 after a serious electrocution accident that killed 5 passengers on August 12, 1998, and was replaced by gas and diesel-powered buses.

Trams in Shenyang were introduced in 1924, and had 6 lines in operation up until 1945. It suffered major disruptions during the Chinese Civil War from power outage and Kuomintang bombings, but quickly resumed operation after the conclusion of the Liaoshen Campaign. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the tram network was gradually replaced by the buses and trolley buses, and eventually closed in 1974. In December 2011, the Shenyang city government announced plans to rebuild the light rail transit network in 2012, comprising 4 lines with distance in the Hunnan New District. The Shenyang Modern Tram network started operation on August 15, 2013.
Shenyang has been planning an underground rapid transit system since 1940, but was unable to materialize the idea due to the city&#x27;s geology and engineering limitations. On November 18, 2005, the construction of the first Shenyang Metro line began and the construction of the second line started on November 18, 2006. The first (east–west) line was opened September 27, 2010, and the second (north–south) was opened on January 9, 2012. in 2023, the second line, running north to south, extended its southern portion to connect with the Shenyang Taoxian International airport. As of 2023, there are 5 running lines, with the latest of which (line 4) opening on September 29, 2023. Construction is difficult due to the granite-rich bedrock on which the city is built.

<text>Jin Xuefei (; born February 21, 1956) is a Chinese American poet and novelist who uses the pen name Ha Jin (). The name &quot;Ha&quot; comes from his favorite city, Harbin. His poetry is associated with the Misty Poetry movement.

==Early life, education, and immigration==
Ha Jin was born in Liaoning, China. His father was a military officer; at thirteen, Jin joined the People&#x27;s Liberation Army during the Cultural Revolution. Jin began to educate himself in Chinese literature and high school curriculum at sixteen. He left the army when he was nineteen as he entered Heilongjiang University, later earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English studies. This was followed by a master&#x27;s degree in Anglo-American literature at Shandong University.

Jin grew up in the chaos of early communist China. He was on a scholarship at Brandeis University when the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre occurred. The Chinese government&#x27;s forcible crackdown hastened his decision to emigrate to the United States, and was the cause of his choice to write in English &quot;to preserve the integrity of his work.&quot; He eventually obtained a Ph.D. One of his mentors was literary critic Eugene Goodheart.

==Career==

=== Novels and short writing ===
Jin sets many of his stories and novels in China, in the fictional Muji City. He has won the National Book Award for Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award for his novel, &quot;Waiting&quot; (1999). He has received three Pushcart Prizes for fiction and a Kenyon Review Award. Many of his short stories have appeared in &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot; anthologies. His collection &quot;Under the Red Flag&quot; (1997) won the Flannery O&#x27;Connor Award for Short Fiction, while &quot;Ocean of Words&quot; (1996) has been awarded the PEN/Hemingway Award. The novel &quot;War Trash&quot; (2004), set during the Korean War, won a second PEN/Faulkner Award for Jin, thus ranking him with Philip Roth, John Edgar Wideman and E. L. Doctorow as the only other authors to have won the prize more than once. &quot;War Trash&quot; was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.

=== Teaching and academic work ===
Jin currently teaches at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. He formerly taught at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia.

Jin was a Mary Ellen von der Heyden Fellow for Fiction at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany, in the fall of 2008. He was inducted to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2014.

On July 28, 2021, an asteroid was named after him: (58495) Hajin.

<text>Nilanjana Sudeshna &quot;Jhumpa&quot; Lahiri (born July 11, 1967) is a British-American author known for her short stories, novels, and essays in English and, more recently, in Italian.

Her debut collection of short-stories, &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; (1999), won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the PEN/Hemingway Award, and her first novel, &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2003), was adapted into the popular film of the same name.

&quot;The Namesake&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize finalist and was made into a major motion picture. &quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot; (2008) won the Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award, while her second novel, &quot;The Lowland&quot; (2013) was a finalist for both the Man Booker Prize and the National Book Award for Fiction. On January 22, 2015, Lahiri won the US$50,000 DSC Prize for Literature for &quot;The Lowland&quot;. In these works, Lahiri explored the Indian-immigrant experience in America.

In 2012, Lahiri moved to Rome and has since then published two books of essays, and began writing in Italian, first with the 2018 novel &quot;Dove mi trovo&quot;, then with her 2023 collection &quot;Roman Stories&quot;. She also compiled, edited, and translated the &quot;Penguin Book of Italian Short Stories&quot; which consists of 40 Italian short stories written by 40 different Italian writers. She has also translated some of her own writings and those of other authors from Italian into English.

In 2014, Lahiri was awarded the National Humanities Medal. She was a professor of creative writing at Princeton University from 2015 to 2022. In 2022, she became the Millicent C. McIntosh Professor of English and Director of Creative Writing at her alma mater, Barnard College of Columbia University.

==Early and personal life==
Lahiri was born in London, the daughter of Indian immigrants from the Indian state of West Bengal. Her family moved to the United States when she was three; Lahiri considers herself an American and has said, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t born here, but I might as well have been.&quot; Lahiri grew up in Kingston, Rhode Island, where her father Amar Lahiri worked as a librarian at the University of Rhode Island; the protagonist in &quot;The Third and Final Continent&quot;, the story which concludes &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot;, is modeled after him. Lahiri&#x27;s mother wanted her children to grow up knowing their Bengali heritage, and her family often visited relatives in Calcutta (now Kolkata).

When Lahiri began kindergarten in Kingston, Rhode Island, her teacher decided to call her by her familiar name Jhumpa because it was easier to pronounce than her more formal given names. Lahiri recalled, &quot;I always felt so embarrassed by my name... You feel like you&#x27;re causing someone pain just by being who you are.&quot; Her ambivalence over her identity was the inspiration for the mixed feelings of Gogol, the protagonist of her novel &quot;The Namesake&quot;, over his own unusual name. In an editorial in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Lahiri claims that she has &quot;felt intense pressure to be two things, loyal to the old world and fluent in the new.&quot; Much of her experiences growing up as a child were marked by these two sides tugging away at one another. When she became an adult, she found that she was able to be part of these two dimensions without the embarrassment and struggle that she had when she was a child. 

Lahiri graduated from South Kingstown High School and received her B.A. in English literature from Barnard College of Columbia University in 1989.

Lahiri then earned advanced degrees from Boston University: an M.A. in English, an M.F.A. in Creative Writing, an M.A. in Comparative Literature, and a Ph.D. in Renaissance Studies. Her dissertation, completed in 1997, was titled &quot;Accursed Palace: The Italian Palazzo on the Jacobean Stage (1603–1625)&quot;. Her principal advisers were William Carroll (English) and Hellmut Wohl (Art History). She took a fellowship at Provincetown&#x27;s Fine Arts Work Center, which lasted for the next two years (1997–1998). Lahiri has taught creative writing at Boston University and the Rhode Island School of Design.

In 2001, Lahiri married Alberto Vourvoulias-Bush, a journalist who was then deputy editor of &quot;TIME&quot; Latin America, and who is now its senior editor. In 2012, Lahiri moved to Rome with her husband and their two children, Octavio (born 2002) and Noor (b. 2005). 

On July 1, 2015, Lahiri joined the Princeton University faculty as a professor of creative writing in the Lewis Center for the Arts.

==Literary career==

Lahiri&#x27;s early short stories faced rejection from publishers &quot;for years&quot;. Her debut short story collection, &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot;, was finally released in 1999. The stories address sensitive dilemmas in the lives of Indians or Indian immigrants, with themes such as marital difficulties, the bereavement over a stillborn child, and the disconnection between first and second generation United States immigrants. Lahiri later wrote, &quot;When I first started writing I was not conscious that my subject was the Indian-American experience. What drew me to my craft was the desire to force the two worlds I occupied to mingle on the page as I was not brave enough, or mature enough, to allow in life.&quot; The collection was praised by American critics, but received mixed reviews in India, where reviewers were alternately enthusiastic and upset Lahiri had &quot;not paint[ed] Indians in a more positive light.&quot; &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; sold 600,000 copies and received the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction (only the seventh time a story collection had won the award).

In 2003, Lahiri published her first novel, &quot;The Namesake&quot;. The theme and plot of this story was influenced in part by a family story she heard growing up. Her father&#x27;s cousin was involved in a train wreck and was only saved when the workers saw a beam of light reflected off of a watch he was wearing. Similarly, the protagonist&#x27;s father in &quot;The Namesake&quot; was saved after a train wreck because a rescuer&#x27;s flashlight illuminated the fluttering white page of the father&#x27;s book, written by Russian author Nikolai Gogol. The father and his wife emigrated to the United States as young adults. After this life-changing experience, he named his son Gogol and his daughter Sonali. Together the two children grow up in a culture with different mannerisms and customs that clash with what their parents have taught them. A film adaptation of &quot;The Namesake&quot; was released in March 2007, directed by Mira Nair and starring Kal Penn as Gogol and Bollywood stars Tabu and Irrfan Khan as his parents. Lahiri herself made a cameo as &quot;Aunt Jhumpa&quot;.

Lahiri&#x27;s second collection of short stories, &quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot;, was released on April 1, 2008. Upon its publication, &quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot; achieved the rare distinction of debuting at number 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best seller list. &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; editor, Dwight Garner, stated, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to remember the last genuinely serious, well-written work of fiction—particularly a book of stories—that leapt straight to No. 1; it&#x27;s a powerful demonstration of Lahiri&#x27;s newfound commercial clout.&quot;

In February 2010, she was appointed a member of the Committee on the Arts and Humanities, along with five others.
In September 2013, her novel &quot;The Lowland&quot; was placed on the shortlist for the Man Booker Prize, which ultimately went to &quot;The Luminaries&quot; by Eleanor Catton. The following month it was also long-listed for the National Book Award for Fiction, and revealed to be a finalist on October 16, 2013. However, on November 20, 2013, it lost out for that award to James McBride and his novel &quot;The Good Lord Bird&quot;.

In December 2015, Lahiri published a non-fiction essay called &quot;Teach Yourself Italian&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about her experience learning Italian. In the essay she declared that she is now only writing in Italian, and the essay itself was translated from Italian to English. That same year, she published her first book in Italian, &quot;In altre parole&quot;, in which she wrote about her experience learning the language; an English translation by Ann Goldstein titled &quot;In Other Words&quot; was published in 2016.

Lahiri was in the winner of the DSC Prize for South Asian Literature 2015 for her book &quot;The Lowland&quot; at the Zee Jaipur Literature Festival for which she entered Limca Book of Records.

In 2017, Lahiri received the PEN/Malamud Award for excellence in the short story.

In 2018, Lahiri published her first novel in Italian, &quot;Dove mi trovo&quot; (2018). In 2019, she compiled, edited and translated the &quot;Penguin Book of Italian Short Stories&quot; which consists of 40 Italian short stories written by 40 different Italian writers. Lahiri later translated &quot;Dove mi trovo&quot; into English; the translation, &quot;Whereabouts&quot;, was published in 2021. In 2022, Lahiri published a new short story collection under the title &quot;Racconti Romani&quot; (Roman stories), the title being a nod to a book by Alberto Moravia of the same name. The English translation, &quot;Roman Stories,&quot; was published in October 2023, translated by Lahiri and Todd Portnowitz.

==Literary focus==
Lahiri&#x27;s writing is characterized by her &quot;plain&quot; language and her characters, often Indian immigrants to America who must navigate between the cultural values of their homeland and their adopted home.
Lahiri&#x27;s fiction is autobiographical and frequently draws upon her own experiences as well as those of her parents, friends, acquaintances, and others in the Bengali communities with which she is familiar. Lahiri examines her characters&#x27; struggles, anxieties, and biases to chronicle the nuances and details of immigrant psychology and behavior.

Until &quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot;, she focused mostly on first-generation Indian American immigrants and their struggle to raise a family in a country very different from theirs. Her stories describe their efforts to keep their children acquainted with Indian culture and traditions and to keep them close even after they have grown up in order to hang onto the Indian tradition of a joint family, in which the parents, their children and the children&#x27;s families live under the same roof.

&quot;Unaccustomed Earth&quot; departs from this earlier original ethos, as Lahiri&#x27;s characters embark on new stages of development. These stories scrutinize the fate of the second and third generations. As succeeding generations become increasingly assimilated into American culture and are comfortable in constructing perspectives outside of their country of origin, Lahiri&#x27;s fiction shifts to the needs of the individual. She shows how later generations depart from the constraints of their immigrant parents, who are often devoted to their community and their responsibility to other immigrants.

==Television==
Lahiri worked on the third season of the HBO television program &quot;In Treatment&quot;. That season featured a character named Sunil, a widower who moves to the United States from India and struggles with grief and with culture shock. Although she is credited as a writer on these episodes, her role was more as a consultant on how a Bengali man might perceive Brooklyn.

==Activism==
In September 2024, Lahiri withdrew her acceptance of the Isamu Noguchi Award given by the Noguchi Museum in New York City in protest over the museum&#x27;s decision to fire three employees for wearing keffiyehs in solidarity with Palestine. In October 2024, Lahiri signed an open letter alongside several thousand authors pledging to boycott Israeli cultural institutions.
