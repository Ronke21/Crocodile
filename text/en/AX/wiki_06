<text>American Motors Corporation (AMC; commonly referred to as American Motors) was an American automobile manufacturing company formed by the merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company on May 1, 1954. At the time, it was the largest corporate merger in U.S. history.

American Motors&#x27; most similar competitors were those automakers that held similar annual sales levels, such as Studebaker, Packard, Kaiser Motors, and Willys-Overland. Their largest competitors were the Big Three—Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.

American Motors&#x27; production line included small cars—the Rambler American, which began as the Nash Rambler in 1950, Hornet, Gremlin, and Pacer; intermediate and full-sized cars, including the Ambassador, Rambler Classic, Rebel, and Matador; muscle cars, including the Marlin, AMX, and Javelin; and early four-wheel drive variants of the Eagle and the Jeep Wagoneer, the first true crossovers in the U.S. market.

Regarded as &quot;a small company deft enough to exploit special market segments left untended by the giants&quot;, American Motors was widely known for the design work of chief stylist Dick Teague, who &quot;had to make do with a much tighter budget than his counterparts at Detroit&#x27;s Big Three&quot;, but &quot;had a knack for making the most of his employer&#x27;s investment&quot;.

After periods of intermittent independent success, Renault acquired a significant interest in American Motors in 1979, and the company was ultimately acquired by Chrysler in 1987.

== 1954 formation ==

In January 1954, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began the acquisition of the Hudson Motor Car Company (in what was called a merger). The new corporation would be called the American Motors Corporation. An earlier corporation with the same name, co-founded by Louis Chevrolet, had existed in Plainfield, New Jersey, from 1916 through 1922 before merging into the Bessemer–American Motors Corporation.

The Nash-Kelvinator/Hudson deal was a straight stock transfer (three shares of Hudson listed at , for two shares of American Motors and one share of Nash-Kelvinator listed at , for one share of American Motors) and finalized in the spring of 1954, forming the fourth-biggest auto company in the U.S. with assets of US$355 million and more than $100 million in working capital. The new company retained Hudson CEO A.E. Barit as a consultant and he took a seat on the board of directors. Nash&#x27;s George W. Mason became president and CEO.

Mason, the architect of the merger, believed that the survival of the U.S.&#x27;s remaining independent automakers depended on their joining to form one multiple-brand company capable of challenging the Big Three as an equal. The &quot;frantic 1953–54 Ford/GM price war&quot; devastated the remaining &quot;independent&quot; automakers. The reasons for the merger between Nash and Hudson included helping cut costs and strengthen their sales organizations to meet the intense competition expected from autos&#x27; Big Three.

One quick result from the merger was the doubling up with Nash on purchasing and production, allowing Hudson to cut prices an average of $155 on the Wasp line, and up to $204 on the more expensive Hornet models. After the merger, AMC had its first profitable quarter during the second three months of 1955, earning $1,592,307, compared to a loss of $3,848,667 during the same period in the previous year. Mason also entered into informal discussions with James J. Nance of Packard to outline his strategic vision. Interim plans were made for American Motors to buy Packard Ultramatic automatic transmissions and Packard V8 engines for certain American Motors products.

In July 1954, Packard acquired Studebaker. The new Studebaker-Packard Corporation (S-P) made the new Packard V8 engine and Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic automatic transmission available to American Motors for its 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models. When Mason died in 1954, George W. Romney succeeded him. Ironically, Romney had once been offered Nance&#x27;s job. In 1948, Romney received offers from Packard for the post of chief operating officer and from Nash for the number two position in the company. Although the Packard offer would have paid more, Romney decided to work under Mason because he thought Nash had a brighter future. Studebaker-Packard president James Nance refused to consider merging with American Motors unless he could take the top position (Mason and Nance were former competitors as heads of the Kelvinator and Hotpoint, respectively), and a week after Mason&#x27;s death, Romney announced &quot;there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly.&quot; Romney agreed with Mason&#x27;s commitment to buy S-P products. Mason and Nance had agreed that S-P would endeavor to purchase parts from American Motors in return, but S-P did not do so. As the Packard engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, American Motors began development of its own V8. American Motors also spent US$40 million developing its Double Safe Single Unit monocoque, which debuted in the 1956 model year. In mid-1956, the Packard V8 and TwinUltramatic transmission were phased out and replaced by American Motors&#x27;s new V8 and by GM Hydra-Matic and Borg-Warner transmissions.

== Product development in the 1950s ==

=== Product consolidation ===

American Motors combined the Nash and Hudson product lines under a common manufacturing strategy in 1955, with the production of Nashes and Hudsons consolidated at the Nash plant in Kenosha. The Detroit Hudson plant was converted to military contract production and eventually sold. The separate Nash and Hudson dealer networks were retained. The Hudsons were redesigned to harmonize with Nash&#x27;s body styles.

The fast-selling Nash Rambler model was sold as a Nash and a Hudson in 1955 and 1956. These badge-engineered Ramblers, and similarly the small Metropolitans, were identical except for the hubcaps, nameplates, and other minor trim.

The pre-existing full-size Nash product line was continued with the Nash Statesman restyled as the &quot;new&quot; Hudson Wasp and the Nash Ambassador restyled as the Hudson Hornet. Although the cars shared the same body shell, they were at least as different from one another as Chevrolet and Pontiac. Hudsons and Nashes each used their engines as they had previously: the Hudson Hornet continued to offer the I6 that had powered the (NASCAR) champion during the early 1950s; the Wasp now used the former engine of the Hudson Jet.

The Nash Ambassador and Statesman continued with overhead- valve and L-head sixes, respectively. Hudson and Nash cars had different front suspensions. Trunk lids were interchangeable, but other body panels, rear window glass, dash panels, and braking systems differed. The Hudson Hornet, Wasp, and their Nash counterparts had improved ride, visibility, and fuel economy because of their lighter unitized Nash body.

The larger Nash and Hudson range did not sell well, and AMC lost money each year. Dismayed with the results, Romney decided in 1956 that the company&#x27;s future lay with the compact Rambler line. Romney halted production on the new large cars and focused entirely on the new Rambler Six and V8 introducing them in 1956, despite being scheduled for a 1957 release. Sales of the new Ramblers were poor, and sales of the Hudson and Nash models were almost non-existent, resulting in a $31.7 million operating loss for 1956. Sales improved in 1957, but the company saw a $11.8 million loss. In response, Romney launched a massive public relations campaign, traveling nationwide in 12 months. Romney spoke at union halls, dinners, churches, fairgrounds, and radio and TV stations. He was anywhere where he could get the word out about Rambler. Rambler sales took off in 1958, up 58.7%, and 425 new dealers were signed up. As a result, 1958 became AMC&#x27;s first year of profitability since its formation, with $28 million in earnings. The Nash and Hudson brands were dropped, and Rambler became a marque in its own right and the mainstay of the company. The popular British-built Metropolitan subcompact continued as a standalone brand until it was discontinued in 1961. The prototype 1958 Nash Ambassador/Hudson Hornet, built on a stretched Rambler platform, was renamed at the last minute as &quot;Ambassador by Rambler&quot;. To round out the model line, American Motors reintroduced the previous 1955, wheelbase Nash Rambler as the new Rambler American with only a few modifications. This gave Rambler a compact lineup that included the reintroduced American, the wheelbase Rambler Six and Rebel V8, as well as the wheelbase Ambassador.

=== The &quot;dinosaur-fighter&quot; ===
Sales of Ramblers soared in the late 1950s partly because of American Motors&#x27; focus on the compact car and its marketing efforts. These included sponsoring the hugely popular Walt Disney anthology television series and as an exhibitor at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. George Romney himself pitched the Rambler product in television commercials.

While the &quot;Big Three&quot; introduced ever-larger cars, American Motors followed a &quot;dinosaur-fighter&quot; strategy. George W. Romney&#x27;s leadership focused the company on the compact car, a fuel-efficient vehicle 20 years before there was a real need for them. This gave Romney a high profile in the media. Two core strategic factors came into play: (1) the use of shared components in American Motors products and (2) a refusal to participate in the Big Three&#x27;s restyling race. This cost-control policy helped Rambler develop a reputation for building solid economy cars. Company officials were confident in the changing market and in 1959 announced a $10 million (US$ in 2016 dollars) expansion of its Kenosha complex (to increase annual straight-time capacity from 300,000 to 440,000 cars). A letter to shareholders in 1959 claimed that the introduction of new compact cars by American Motors&#x27; large domestic competitors (for the 1960 model year) &quot;signals the end of big-car domination in the U.S.&quot; and that American Motors predicts small-car sales in the U.S. may reach three million units by 1963.

American Motors was also beginning to experiment with non-gasoline-powered automobiles. On April 1, 1959, American Motors and Sonotone Corporation announced a joint research effort to consider producing an electric car that was to be powered by a &quot;self-charging&quot; battery. Sonotone had the technology for making sintered plate nickel–cadmium batteries that can be recharged very rapidly and are lighter than a typical automobile lead–acid battery.

In 1959, American Motors hired designer Dick Teague, who had previously worked for General Motors, Packard, and Chrysler; after Edmund E. Anderson left the company in 1961, Teague was named principal designer and in 1964, vice president.

== Changing focus in the 1960s ==

=== Innovation ===
To stay competitive, American Motors produced a wide range of products during the 1960s and added innovations long before the &quot;Big Three&quot; introduced them.

For example, the Rambler Classic was equipped with a standard tandem master cylinder in 1962 that provided stopping ability even if there was a failure in the brake system. Only Cadillac also included this safety feature six years before U.S. safety regulations required it on all cars.

Rambler also was an early pioneer in offering an automatic shift indicator sequence (P R N D2 D1 L, where if one selected &quot;D2&quot;, the car started in second gear, while &quot;1&quot; began in first gear) on its &quot;Flash-O-Matic&quot; transmission which is similar to today&#x27;s &quot;PRNDSL&quot; shift pattern, made mandatory for the 1968 model year cars, which required a neutral position between reverse and drive, while General Motors still offered a shift selector that had reverse immediately next to low gear (PNDSLR) well into the 1960s.

Unique in the U. S. automotive industry, American Motors offered adjustable front seat backrests from their Nash-origin, and in 1964, the Classic and Ambassador were equipped with standard dual reclining front seats nearly a decade before the Big Three offered them as options. Bendix disc brakes were made standard on the Marlin and optional on other models in 1965. This made the Marlin one of the first modern American cars with standard disc brakes, while the Big Three did not offer them until the early 1970s on most of their models to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.

In the early part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company&#x27;s history of building small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among U. S. automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a lot of new competition. Romney&#x27;s strategic focus was very successful, as reflected in the firm&#x27;s healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961, with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan that was new in the automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract included generous annual improvement pay increases, and automatic cost-of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, American Motors&#x27; successful sales executive.

By 1964, Studebaker production in the United States had ended, and its Canadian operations ceased in 1966. The &quot;Big Three&quot;, plus the smaller American Motors, Kaiser Jeep, International Harvester, Avanti, and Checker companies were the remaining North American auto manufacturers.
Abernethy believed that American Motors&#x27;s reputation of building reliable, economical cars could translate into a new strategy that could follow AMC buyers as they traded into larger, more expensive vehicles. American Motors, in reality, had produced large cars throughout its history. The Rambler Ambassadors were as large as a full-sized Ford or Chevy. There was only an absence of largest-sized cars from the American Motors lineup in 1963 and 1964 The first cars bearing his signature were the 1965 models. The 1965 models were a major makeover of the new platform that had just been introduced in 1963. These were a longer Ambassador series and new convertibles for the larger models. During mid-year, a fastback, called the Marlin, was added. It competed directly with cars like the Dodge Charger, but AMC&#x27;s &quot;family-sized&quot; fastback emphasized personal-luxury.

=== Tough choices ===
The continuing quest &quot;in the business world&#x27;s toughest race – the grinding contest against the Big Three automobile makers&quot; also meant annual styling changes requiring large expenditures. American Motors&#x27;s management total confidence &quot;that the new 1965 models would stem a bothersome decline&quot; actually began falling behind in share of sales.

Moreover, a new line of redesigned cars in the full and mid-sized markets was launched in the fall of 1966. The cars won acclaim for their fluid styling, and Abernethy&#x27;s ideas did work as Ambassador sales increased significantly. However, the dated designs of the Rambler Americans hurt its sales, which offset gains from Ambassador sales. There were quality control problems with introducing the new full-sized cars and persistent rumors of the company&#x27;s demise because of its precarious cash flow. Consumer Reports&#x27; negative ratings for American Motors&#x27; safety did not help.

During this time, AMC&#x27;s international sales were expanding. From only 18,000 cars five years ago, the 1965 model year AMC sold 74,420 vehicles in Canada, Europe, and Latin America. AMC remained the most significant U.S. seller of autos in both France and Germany.

Abernethy also called for the de-emphasis of the Rambler brand because he believed the public associated it too strongly with economy cars and that it was hindering the sale of American Motors&#x27; other models at a time when mid and luxury car sales were robust. As a result, he ordered that for 1966, the Ambassador and Marlin were to be badged purely as a product of American Motors. The strategy shift at first seemed to be working because sales of the redesigned 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors improved, even as AMC&#x27;s overall production decreased from the record level achieved in 1963. However, corporate earnings per share were a meager 27 cents per share, the lowest since AMC made its famous compact car comeback in 1958. Investors received a message of the changing fortune of the automaker when the company&#x27;s 1966 annual financial report was delivered in a plain brown wrapper, instead of the previous year&#x27;s glossy cover.
A completely new design was also slated for the larger 1967 models. This strategy added $60 million in retooling costs, a significant stretch for the company. The latest models shared fewer parts and were more expensive to build. Abernethy continued his objective to position the new Rebel and Ambassador designs on an equal basis with competitive economy models marketed by the Big Three.
American Motors did not have their own electric car program as did the Big Three, and after some negotiation, a contract was drawn in 1967 with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and a speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. A nickel-cadmium battery powered 1969 Rambler station wagon demonstrated the power systems that according to the scientist was a &quot;wonderful car&quot;. This was also the start of other &quot;plug-in&quot;-type experimental American Motors vehicles developed with Gulton – the Amitron city concept car and later the similar Electron.

Although the new models were well received by the motor industry media, the last quarter sales for AMC ended September 30, 1966 (AMC was not on a calendar fiscal year) were disappointing. The company recorded a balance sheet loss of $12,648,000 for the year before Tax Credits and deferred Tax Assets. By this time the board had lost confidence in Abernethy due to his vast spending which had unstabilized the company and each year under his leadership the company had suffered substantial financial losses. As a result, Abernethy was forced into taking an &quot;early retirement&quot; from American Motors on January 9, 1967. Abernethy was replaced by Roy D. Chapin Jr. (son of Hudson Motors founder Roy D. Chapin). Chapin quickly instituted changes to American Motors&#x27;s offerings and tried to regain market share by focusing on younger demographic markets. Chapin&#x27;s first decision was to cut the price of the Rambler to within $200 of the basic Volkswagen Beetle. Innovative marketing ideas included making air conditioning standard on all 1968 Ambassador models (available as a delete option). This made American Motors the first U.S. automaker to make air conditioning standard equipment on a line of cars, preceding even luxury makes such as Lincoln, Imperial, and Cadillac.

The company introduced exciting entries for the decade&#x27;s muscle car boom, most notably the AMX. At the same time, the Javelin served as the company&#x27;s entrant into the sporty pony car market created by the Plymouth Barracuda and the Ford Mustang. Additional operating cash was derived in 1968 through the sale of Kelvinator Appliance, once one of the firm&#x27;s core operating units. The Kelvinator divestiture left American Motors a downsized company solely manufacturing automobiles.

The Rambler marque was discontinued for the larger 1968 domestic models, leaving only the small Rambler American as the last product to bear the name through 1969. The Rambler brand continued to be used only for export markets, with Mexico being the last market to use it in 1983. From 1970, American Motors was the brand used for all American Motors passenger cars, and all vehicles from that date bore the American Motors name and the new corporate logo. However, &quot;American Motors&quot; and &quot;AMC&quot; were used interchangeably in corporate literature well into the 1980s. The branding issue was further complicated when the company&#x27;s Eagle all-wheel drive passenger cars were marketed as the American Eagle in the 1980s.

== 1970s product developments ==
===Jeep and AM General===

In the late 1960s, Kaiser Industries Corporation decided to leave the automotive industry and sought a buyer for its money-losing Kaiser Jeep division. American Motors&#x27; vice president for manufacturing, Gerald C. Meyers, headed the team sent to evaluate Kaiser&#x27;s Jeep factories. Although opposed by AMC&#x27;s top management, Chapin made a significant decision in February 1970 to purchase Kaiser Jeep for $70 million. Although it was a gamble, Chapin believed Jeep vehicles would complement American Motors&#x27; passenger car business. The Jeep market was also a market in which the Big Three had no presence, and therefore there was no competition. American Motors gained the iconic Jeep brand of light trucks and SUVs, as well as Kaiser-Jeep&#x27;s government contracts – notably the M151 line of military Jeeps and the DJ-Series postal Jeeps. American Motors also expanded its international network. The military and special products business was reconstituted as &quot;American Motors General Products Division&quot;, later reorganized as AM General.

===Hornet and Gremlin===
In 1970, American Motors consolidated all passenger cars under one distinct brand identity and debuted the Hornet range of compact cars. The Hornet and the later Gremlin shared platforms. The Gremlin, the first North American-built subcompact, sold more than 670,000 units from 1970 through 1978. The Hornet became American Motors&#x27; best-selling passenger car since the Rambler Classic, with more than 860,000 units sold when production ended in 1977. The Hornet platform continued to be built under various models through 1987.

For a time, both the Hornet and Gremlin could be ordered with Levi&#x27;s denim interiors.

===Matador===

The new facelifted, mid-sized AMC Matador replaced the Rebel in 1971, using an advertising campaign that asked, &quot;What&#x27;s a Matador?&quot; In 1972, American Motors won the tender for Los Angeles Police Department cruisers, and Matadors were used by the department from 1972 until 1975, replacing the Plymouth Satellite. American Motors supplied Mark VII Limited owner Jack Webb with two Matadors, a sedan and a wagon, for use in his popular television series &quot;Adam-12&quot;, increasing the cars&#x27; public profile. Matadors saw fleet use as taxis, government, police, and fire vehicles in some states.

In 1973, American Motors signed a licensing agreement with Curtiss-Wright to build Wankel engines for cars and Jeeps.

Starting in 1974, the Matador sedan and station wagon were mildly refreshed, with new boxier front and rear ends, making it full-sized. This second-generation model was produced virtually unchanged until 1978.

Sagging sales and tight finances resulted in the discontinuation of the Matador line after the 1978 model leaving American Motors to focus almost exclusively on its Hornet platform-based cars and the Jeep line.

===Ambassador===

From 1970, the Rebel and Ambassador were identical from the A-pillar back. The Ambassador continued as AMC&#x27;s upmarket model with higher trim, more equipment, and air conditioning as standard. From the A-pillar forward, the Ambassador was redesigned and stretched to become the biggest ever, just as the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo sparked gasoline rationing across the nation. The additional length was due to a new front-end design and more substantial energy-absorbing bumpers required of all automobiles sold in the U.S. Sales of all large cars fell due to economic problems and rising gasoline prices. The Ambassador became a full-sized car in 1974 and was discontinued after the 1974 model year, leaving only the Matador as American Motors&#x27; full-size offering. Nash and American Motors made Ambassadors from 1927 through 1974, the longest use of the same model name for any American Motors product and, at the time, the longest continuously used nameplate in the industry.

===Matador Coupe===

In 1974, the first-generation Matador two-door hardtop, known as the &quot;flying brick&quot; due to its poor aerodynamics in NASCAR competition, was replaced with a sleek, smoothly shaped, and radically styled two-door coupe. The model received praise for its design, including &quot;Best Styled Car of 1974&quot; by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine, customer satisfaction, and sold almost 100,000 coupes over five years. The Matador Coupe shared few components with the Matador sedan and station wagon other than suspension, drive train, some trim, and interior parts.

===Metropolitan Buses===

In 1974, American Motors&#x27;s AM General subsidiary began building urban transit buses in cooperation with Flyer Industries of Winnipeg, Manitoba. A total of 5,431 &quot;Metropolitan&quot; buses, including 219 electric trolley buses, were built before production ceased in 1979. Production of diesel buses had ceased in 1978, with only trolley bus production taking place in 1979.

===Pacer===

The AMC Pacer, an innovative all-new model introduced in March 1975 and marketed as &quot;the first wide small car&quot;, was a subcompact designed to provide the comfort of a full-sized car. Its pre-production development coincided with tightened U.S. federal passenger emissions and auto safety regulations. The Pacer sold well its first two years with 262,772 combined units sold in the US.

With the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, General Motors aborted the Wankel rotary engine around which the Pacer had been designed, as its fuel consumption exceeded that of conventional engines with similar power. Therefore, American Motors&#x27;s existing AMC Straight-6 engines were used in the Pacer instead. The fuel economy was better than the expected rotary engine&#x27;s, but the I6&#x27;s gas mileage was relatively low in light of the new focus on energy efficiency. Also, as the Pacer shared few components other than the drivetrain with other American Motors cars, it was expensive to make, and the cost increased when sales fell steeply after the first two years. The Pacer line was discontinued in mid-1980.

Development and production costs for the Pacer and Matador Coupe drained capital that might otherwise have been invested in updating the more popular Hornet and Gremlin lines so that toward the end of the 1970s, the company faced the growing energy crisis with aged products that were uncompetitive in hotly contested markets. However, &quot;AMC used cars, as far back as 1967, had the advantage of good warranty coverage … so most owners were conscious of low-cost car maintenance … AMC units became some of the very best buys on the used car market&quot; by 1975.

The 1977 Gremlin had redesigned headlights, grille, rear hatch, and fascia. For economy in the fuel crisis, American Motors offered the car with a more fuel-efficient Volkswagen-designed Audi 4-cylinder engine . The engine was expensive for American Motors to build, and the Gremlin retained the less costly but less economical as standard equipment.

The AMX nameplate was revived in 1977. It was a sporty appearance package on the Hornet hatchback featuring upgrades, as well as the inline six as standard with a choice of three-speed automatic or four-speed manual transmissions. The V8 engine was optional with the automatic transmission.

As all Matadors now received standard equipment that was formerly optional (e.g., power steering, automatic transmission), the &quot;Brougham&quot; package was dropped from 1977. Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and top-line Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.

===Concord===

For the 1978 model year, the Hornet platform was redesigned with an adaptation of the new Gremlin front-end design and renamed AMC Concord. American Motors targeted it at the emerging &quot;premium compact&quot; market segment, paying particular attention to ride and handling, standard equipment, trim, and interior luxury.

Gremlins borrowed the Concord instrument panel, a Hornet AMX-inspired GT sports appearance package, and a new striping treatment for X models.

The AMC Pacer hood was modified to clear a V8 engine, and a Sports package replaced the former X package. With falling sales of Matador Coupes, sedans, and wagons, their V8 engine was dropped, leaving only the Inline-6 (standard on coupes and sedans) and the V8 (optional on coupes and sedans, standard on wagons). The two-tone Barcelona luxury package was offered on Matador sedans, and two-tone red paint was introduced as an additional Barcelona option. Matador production ceased at the end of the model year with total sales of 10,576 units. The Matador was no longer attractive as automakers struggled to overcome economic woes, including continuing fuel price increases and double-digit U. S. inflation.

===Spirit===

For the 1979 model year, the Spirit sedan replaced the Gremlin. A new fastback version of the car, the Spirit Liftback, proved successful.

In December, Pacer production ceased after a small run of 1980 models was built to use up parts stock.

Concords received a new front-end treatment, and in their final season, hatchbacks became available in DL trim. On May 1, 1979, American Motors marked the 25th anniversary of the Nash-Hudson merger with &quot;Silver Anniversary&quot; editions of the AMC Concord and Jeep CJ in two-tone silver (Jeeps then accounted for around 50 percent of the company&#x27;s sales and most of their profits), and introduced the LeCar, a U.S. version of the small, fuel-efficient Renault 5, in dealer showrooms.

Concord and Spirit models were dropped after 1983.

== Financial developments, Renault partnership ==

=== Late 1970s ===


In February 1977, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that although American Motors had lost $73.8 million in the previous two fiscal years, U.S. banks had agreed to a year&#x27;s extension for a $72.5 million credit that had expired in January, that stockholders had received no dividends since 1974, and that Pacer sales did not match expectations. However, Time noted record Jeep sales and a backlog of orders for AM General&#x27;s buses.

In July 1977, it was announced that the General Services Administration of the Federal U.S. government had awarded AMC a three-year contract worth $15 million to lease 5,838 cars. Since the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1, 1976, the GSA had purchased 8,700 cars from AMC for $30 million.

On October 21, 1977, Roy Chapin Jr. retired, and Gerald C. Meyers became chairman and CEO.

On March 31, 1978, American Motors and Renault announced a sweeping agreement for jointly manufacturing and distributing cars and trucks that would benefit both. A month later, American Motors announced that it would halt the production of standard urban transit buses after about 4,300 were sold by its AM General subsidiary over a period of three years. In May 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the recall of all American Motors&#x27;s 1976 cars (except those conforming to California emissions regulations) – some 270,000 vehicles— plus 40,000 1975 and 1976 Jeeps and mini trucks, for correction of a fault in the pollution control system. Total cost was estimated at up to $3 million, or more than AMC had earned the previous quarter.

American Motors lost an estimated $65 million on its conventional (non-Jeep) cars for the fiscal year that ended September 30, 1978, but strong Jeep sales helped the company to an overall $36.7 million profit on sales of $2.6 billion. However, American Motors faced costly engineering work to bring their Jeeps into compliance with a federal directive for all 4-wheel-drive vehicles to average by 1981.

In December 1978 the government of Iran cut off oil exports to the world. This caused a devastating effect on all American automobile makers and American consumers. Gasoline prices jumped 52 percent between September and December 1979. Each of the Big Three (Ford, General Motors, Chrysler) lost money throughout 1979 leading to Chrysler becoming insolvent and considering bankruptcy by September. Ford survived only because of its European operations, eventually losing $7 billion in domestic sales from 1979 to 1982.

During the crisis, and with its domestic market share at 1.83%, American Motors struck a deal with Renault, the nationally owned French automaker in October 1979. AMC would receive a $150 million cash injection, $50 million in credits, and also the rights to start building the Renault 5 in 1982 (a deal for Renault products to be sold through the American Motors-Jeep dealer network had already been made in 1979). In return, Renault acquired a 22.5% interest in American Motors. This was not the first time the two companies had worked together. Lacking a prestige model line in the early 1960s, Renault assembled CKD kits and marketed Rambler cars in France.

In 1979, American Motors announced a record $83.9 million profit on sales of $3.1 billion (US$ in dollars) for the fiscal year ending in September—this despite an economic downturn, soaring energy prices, rising American unemployment, automobile plants shutting down, and an American market trend towards imported cars.

===1980s===

A drop in Jeep sales caused by the declining economy and soaring energy prices began to constrict American Motors&#x27; cash flow. At the same time, pressure increased on the company&#x27;s non-Jeep product lines. The face-lifts and rebranding of American Motors&#x27; once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). In response to the 1979 oil crisis, the Big Three had resorted to importing foreign motor vehicles, mainly Japanese models. Japanese models were mass-marketed and had lower manufacturing costs. By the end of 1980 Japanese manufacturers surpassed Detroit&#x27;s production totals, becoming first in the world. Indeed, the share of Japanese cars in U.S. auto purchases rose from 9 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980. The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, and Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing and Just In Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of American Motors&#x27; passenger product line: small cars.

While Americans turned to the new imports in increasing numbers, American Motors continued its struggle at the inefficient and aging downtown Kenosha, Wisconsin, facilities—the oldest continuously operating automobile plant in the world, where components and unfinished bodies still had to be transported across the city.

In early 1980, the banks refused American Motors further credit. Lacking both capital and resources for the new, truly modern products it needed to offer, the company turned to Renault for a $90 million loan (US$ in dollars). By September that year, American Motors&#x27;s U.S. market share had fallen to 1.7%, and in November sales dropped 19.1%. American Motors warned stockholders that the company could be bankrupted if they did not approve a plan for Renault to acquire as much as 59% of the company. On December 16, 1980, American Motors shareholders &quot;overwhelmingly approved making the French Government-owned Renault&quot; their company&#x27;s principal owner. Jean-Marc Lepeu, former corporate treasurer at Renault, became vice president for finance at American Motors. In September 1981, Jose Dedeurwaerder, a Renault veteran of 23 years, mainly in manufacturing, became American Motors&#x27; executive vice president for manufacturing.

In January 1982, the company&#x27;s president W. Paul Tippett Jr. replaced Gerald C. Meyers as chairman and CEO, and Dedeurwaerder moved up to be president. By this time Renault owned 46% of American Motors. Dedeurwaerder brought a broad perspective at this critical time: he is credited with streamlining many of American Motors&#x27; arcane management techniques. He also instituted important improvements in plant layouts, as well as in cost and quality control.

Having increased its stake in the company several times to keep it solvent, Renault eventually owned 49% in 1983. Some view this development as ending American Motors&#x27; run as a truly American car company.

New ownership and management heralded a new product venture for American Motors: a line of modern front-wheel drive cars, designed by Renault, to be produced at Kenosha.

== 1980s product developments ==
In 1980, all American Motors cars received a new rust-proofing process using Ziebart as Factory Rust Protection. The extra protection also included aluminized trim screws, plastic inner fender liners, and galvanized steel in every exterior body panel, along with the unibody getting a deep-dip (up to the window line) bath in epoxy-based primer. American Motors backed up the rust protection program with a 5-year &quot;No Rust Thru&quot; component to its comprehensive &quot;Buyer Protection Plan.&quot;

=== AMC Eagle ===
In August 1979, for the 1980 model year, American Motors introduced four-wheel-drive versions of the Spirit and Concord, calling the collective line the AMC Eagle. Eagles rapidly became one of the company&#x27;s best-known products and are considered one of the first &quot;crossover SUVs&quot;. Eagles used the 2-wheel drive body shells mounted on an all-new platform developed by American Motors in the late 1970s. Featuring an innovative full-time four-wheel-drive system, it sold best in snow-prone areas. Sales started strongly but declined over time. While the two-wheel drive Spirit and Concord were discontinued after 1983 as the company concentrated on its new Renault Alliance, the Eagle survived for five years longer, albeit only in station wagon form, into the 1988 model year. This meant the four-wheel-drive Eagle was the lone representative of the American Motors brand from 1984 until the 1988 model year. All the company&#x27;s remaining output was branded Renault or Jeep. The last AMC Eagle was built on December 14, 1987.

=== Renault Alliance, Encore, and GTA ===


The Renault Alliance was the first joint product of the American Motors-Renault partnership. Introduced in 1983, the Alliance was a front-wheel-drive Renault 9 compact car slightly restyled for the American market by Dick Teague, mainly to comply with American safety standards, and produced by American Motors at Kenosha. The car was badged as a Renault, and some cars also carried American Motors badges. It was available as a sedan with two or four doors and later as a convertible. The hatchback, introduced in 1984 and badged as the Renault Encore, was the same as the European Renault 11 model. 

The new model, introduced during increased interest in small cars, won several awards, including Motor Trend Car of the Year. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; declared: &quot;The Alliance may well be the best-assembled first-year car we&#x27;ve ever seen. Way to go Renault!&quot; The Alliance was listed as number one on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; list of ten best cars for 1983. The positive reception and sales of 200,000 Alliances by 1984 was hindered by the availability of only two body styles. The Alliance was a European-designed car that was not fully suited to U.S. market demands. The distribution network was also not well supported, which led to the lower quality delivered by dealerships with &quot;disastrous consequences&quot; for the image of the automobiles and high warranty costs because of quality failings, which greatly impacted sales from 1985 to the end of production in 1987.

After the 1983 model year, American Motors focused entirely on four-wheel drive autos; the company stopped producing rear-wheel-drive cars. American Motors facilities were then used to assemble the Renault-branded Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars.

For the final 1987 model year, a higher-performance version of the Alliance 2-door sedan and the convertible was sold as the Renault GTA. This version had a Renault two-liter engine that was exclusive to it and not shared with the European Renault 9 and 11 models. It was described as &quot;dandy little sports car&quot; and a &quot;pocket rocket&quot; defined as a low-priced &quot;car based on high production economy but with emphasis placed on appearance, performance and handling.&quot; 

The Encore models were renamed Alliance Hatchback in 1987. Alliance and GTA production ended in June of that year, while the Renault 9 and 11 models continued through the 1988 model year in Europe, being replaced by the all-new Renault 19.

=== Jeeps ===
More beneficial to American Motors&#x27; future was the introduction of an all-new line of compact Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer models in the autumn of 1983 for the 1984 model year. Renault&#x27;s François Castaing, head of AMC&#x27;s product development team, designed the new Jeep platform with styling by Dick Teague. Renault was interested in selling the Cherokee in Europe, but the vehicle needed to be lighter and more fuel-efficient to meet European expectations. The new XJ weighed , due to its unibody construction and lighter components such as the front seats taken from the Renault 9 and 11 and new Renault Alliance.
According to David Tracy, &quot;The new XJ Jeep ... was lighter, shorter, six inches narrower, and four inches lower than the Cherokee SJ it replaced, and yet — thanks to unibody construction — the XJ kept 90 percent of its predecessor&#x27;s interior volume.&quot; And, not only was fuel economy much improved, but &quot;articulation is also better, as is ground clearance, as well as approach, departure, and break-over angles. These, along with its smaller profile, make the XJ better both off-road and on.&quot;

AMC&#x27;s initial forecasts of 40,000 Cherokee and Wagoneer sales were shattered, with sales amounting to 75,000 in their first year. The three leading off-roading magazines, &quot;Petersen&#x27;s 4-Wheel &amp; Off-Road&quot;, &quot;Four Wheeler&quot;, and &quot;Off-Road&quot; each named the new Jeep Cherokee as the &quot;4x4 of the year.&quot; The popularity of these downsized Jeeps pioneered a new market segment for what later became defined as the sport utility vehicle (SUV). They initially used the AMC OHV four-cylinder engine with a carburetor, and a General Motors-built carbureted V6 was optional. In 1986, throttle-body injection replaced the carburetor on the 2.5 L I4 engines. A Renault Turbo-Diesel I4 diesel was also offered. Starting with the 1987 models, a new I6 engine, derived from the older I6 with a new head design and an electronic fuel injection system, replaced the outsourced V6. American Motors&#x27; &quot;new&quot; engine was designed with help from Renault and incorporated Renault-Bendix (Renix) parts for fuel and ignition management. The 4.0 developed an outstanding reputation for reliability and toughness. Retained by Chrysler after the buyout, the design received continuous improvements and refinements until its discontinuation at the end of the 2006 model year. The AMC 4.0 engine saw extensive application in XJ Cherokees and Wagoneers, Grand Cherokees, and Wranglers, and many of those engines saw (or are seeing) extremely long lives, quite a few exceeding . Chrysler built the XJ Cherokee until the end of the 2001 model year in the U.S. and until 2005 in China.

Three other designs continued to be used after the Chrysler buyout: the Grand Wagoneer full-size luxury SUV, the full-sized J-series pickups (built on the same chassis as the earlier SJ model Wagoneers and Cherokees that dated from 1963 with the AMC V8), and the Jeep Comanche (MJ) compact pickup, which debuted in 1986. Unlike most sport-utility vehicles based on adapted pickup truck designs, the Cherokee XJ SUV came first, and the Comanche was designed as a later pickup truck version.

Production of the full-sized pickups ceased after 1987. The Grand Wagoneer and 360 V8 engine were dropped after 1991 (the last American-made vehicle whose engine used a carburetor for fuel delivery), and the Comanche was discontinued after 1992.

== 1985 and the final buyout ==

=== Marketplace and management changes ===
Significant changes occurred in 1985 as the market moved away from American Motors&#x27; small models. With fuel relatively cheap again, buyers turned to larger, more powerful automobiles, and American Motors was unprepared for this development. Even the venerable Jeep CJ-5 was dropped after a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; TV news magazine staged exposé of rollover tendencies under extreme conditions. American Motors also confronted an angry workforce. Labor was taking revenge, and reports circulated about the sabotage of vehicles on the assembly lines because of the failure to receive promised wage increases. There were rumors that the aging Kenosha plant was to be shut down. At the same time, Chrysler was having trouble meeting the demand for its M-body rear-drive models (Dodge Diplomat, Plymouth Gran Fury, and Chrysler Fifth Avenue). Because they were assembled using the old &quot;gate and buck system&quot; and the tooling could be easily moved, Chrysler could supply the components and control the quality while AMC assembled the car. Therefore, Lee Iacocca and Joseph E. Cappy agreed to use some of AMC&#x27;s idle plant capacity in Kenosha.

In January 1985, Renault&#x27;s chairman in France, Bernard Hanon, was dismissed by the government in a shake-up triggered by huge losses as a result of his goal to revolutionize Renault&#x27;s product strategy in the 1970s and 1980s. He was instrumental in 1981 for the company to invest in AMC and also made Renault a full-line automaker, but this ballooned the firm&#x27;s debt. Renault relinquished its number one sales position in Europe, which it held from 1980 until 1983. The company had been losing money since 1981 and had fallen to sixth place behind Ford, Fiat, Volkswagen, Peugeot, and General Motors. Strikes plagued Renault at the end of 1984, and the French government introduced price controls that severely cut the profit margins on cars sold in France, Renault&#x27;s most important market. Hanon was replaced by Georges Besse, ex-president of Produits Chimiques Ugine Kuhlmann in France.

In April 1985, AMC Chairman W. Paul Tippett resigned to become president of a textile company. Jose J. Dedeurwaerder, president since 1982 and chief executive officer since September 1984, announced at the Paris Auto Show in October 1985, that AMC would begin imports of the innovative seven-seat, front-wheel-drive Espace minivan in the spring of 1986. This was part of expanding the range of Renault models that include plans for marketing the Renault Alpine GTA/A510 sports car through select AMC dealers. In December 1985, Dedeurwaerder became chairman of AMC&#x27;s executive committee while continuing as the company&#x27;s president and CEO. Joe Cappy was moved up from executive vice president to chief operating officer, and Tippet&#x27;s position was filled by an ex-Renault vice president, Pierre Semerena.

Semerena made his managerial reputation as a no-nonsense cost cutter. The new management responded with tactical moves by selling the lawn care Wheel Horse Products Division and signing an agreement to build Jeeps in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Pentagon had problems with AM General, a significant defense contractor, being managed by a partially French-government-owned firm. The U.S. government would not allow a foreign government to own a substantial portion of an important defense supplier. As a result, the profitable AM General Division was sold to LTV Corporation.

Another milestone within AMC&#x27;s management was the departure of Dick Teague. He was American Motors&#x27; design vice president for 23 years - an industry record. he was one of the most consistently resourceful automotive designers and responsible for many Jeep and AMC designs, including the Javelin, AMX, Hornet, Gremlin, Pacer, Matador coupe, and the Cherokee XJ.

=== Problems at Renault and assassination ===
In France, Renault continued to experience financial trouble. The investment in American Motors (including the construction of a new Canadian assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario) forced cuts at home, resulting in the closure of several French plants and mass layoffs. Renault was down to just three alternatives regarding its American holdings: (1) it could declare American Motors officially bankrupt, thereby losing its investment; (2) it could come up with more money, but Renault management perceived American Motors as a bottomless pit; or (3) American Motors could be put up for sale, and the French company could get back part of its investment. At the same time, Renault&#x27;s new chairman, Georges Besse, continued to champion the French firm&#x27;s future in the North American market, pointing to the company&#x27;s completion of the newest and most advanced automotive assembly plant in North America, then known as Bramalea Assembly, as well as the recent introduction of the thoroughly modern, fuel-injected 4.0 L and 2.5 L engines. In addition, Jeep vehicles were riding an unprecedented surge in demand. It seemed to Besse and others that American Motors was on course for profitability.

However, on November 17, 1986, Besse, who had a high profile among French capitalists, was assassinated by a member of a French clandestine far-left extremist group, Action Directe. AMC&#x27;s plans to reinvigorate sales with higher-priced Renaults continued for a little longer, with the plan being a three-pronged lineup beginning with the mid-sized Medallion, the larger Premier above it, and the sporty Renault Alpine providing a halo car. The Medallion and the Premier both went on sale, but Alpine never made its planned mid-1987 rollout.

=== Chrysler purchases American Motors stock ===
Under pressure from Renault executives following Besse&#x27;s death, Renault&#x27;s new president, Raymond Levy, set out to repair employee relations and divest the company of its investment in American Motors. Renault owned 46.1% of American Motors&#x27; outstanding shares of stock. In 1986, American Motors posted a $91.3 million loss.

The earlier agreement between Chrysler and American Motors in 1985, under which American Motors would produce M-body chassis rear-drive large cars for five years from mid-1986 through 1990, fed the rumor that Chrysler was about to buy AMC. According to the head of manufacturing for Chrysler, Stephan Sharf, the existing relationship with AMC producing a car for a competitor facilitated the negotiations.

On March 9, 1987, Chrysler agreed to buy Renault&#x27;s share in American Motors, plus all the remaining shares, for about $1.5 billion ($ in dollars). 
Chrysler made no secret that they were only interested in AMC for Jeep, AMC&#x27;s new assembly plant in Canada, and AMC&#x27;s network of 1,300 dealerships nationwide. Chrysler president Lee Iacocca was quoted in the March 10, 1987 LA Times as saying:

With the sale complete, American Motors became the Jeep-Eagle division of Chrysler on August 25, 1988, and was fully merged as of March 29, 1990.

The sale came at a time when the automotive press was enthusiastic about the proposed 1988 lineup of Renault, Eagle, and Jeep vehicles and reported that the small automaker&#x27;s financial outlook was improving. American Motors&#x27; quarterly results for all of 1987 were positive. Chrysler purchased American Motors when the company appeared to be in an excellent financial position with its new product line.

It was the Jeep brand that Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca wanted – in particular, the ZJ Grand Cherokee, then under development by Jeep engineers, which ultimately proved highly profitable for Chrysler (the nameplate remains in production today). However, the buyout included other attractive deal sweeteners for Chrysler. Among them was the world-class, brand-new manufacturing plant in Bramalea, Ontario, which offered Iacocca an unprecedented opportunity to increase his company&#x27;s production capacity at a fire-sale price. American Motors had designed and built the plant in anticipation of building the Renault 25-based Eagle Premier. Additional profitable acquisitions were the American Motors dealer network (the addition of which strengthened Chrysler&#x27;s retail distribution – many American Motors dealers switched to selling Chrysler products), and American Motors&#x27; underrated organization and management talent – which Chrysler quickly assimilated (numerous leading Chrysler engineers and executives were ex-American Motors).

Renault left the U.S. market entirely as a brand in 1987. Thus, the Renault Medallion was sold through the new Jeep-Eagle division as an Eagle, not a Renault. The Jeep-Eagle division was formed from the American Motors Jeep Renault dealer network. The Jeep and Eagle vehicles were marketed primarily by former American Motors dealers. The American Motors badge was last used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then eliminated, and the Eagle car brand was phased out by 1998.

==Leadership==
=== 1954: George W. Mason ===

The 1954 merger of Nash-Kelvinator Corporation and Hudson Motor Car Company that established American Motors was led by Nash-Kelvinator president George W. Mason to reap benefits from the strengths of the two firms to battle the much larger &quot;Big Three&quot; automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The merger was initially intended to be three-way, with Packard being the number three. Mason had first discussed the possibility of a merger with Packard president James J. Nance in the late 1940s. Nance insisted that if Packard were to join, he would have to be the CEO of the new company. Mason fully intended to lead the new company, thus the deal did not go through. Packard acquired Studebaker two months after Nash acquired Hudson.

Mason became CEO and president of the new company, and Hudson&#x27;s president A.E. Barit retired to become an American Motors board member. Mason selected long-time Nash associate and future governor of Michigan, George W. Romney, as vice president. Roy Abernethy, ex-vice president of sales for Willys, was hired to be vice president of sales.

=== 1954–1962: George W. Romney ===

Following Mason&#x27;s sudden death on October 8, 1954, Romney took over, reorganizing the company and focusing American Motors&#x27; future on a new small car line. Mason&#x27;s death also allowed Romney to put an end to any further discussions for a merger between American Motors and Studebaker-Packard.

By the end of 1957, the legacy Nash and Hudson brands were completely phased out and replaced with the Rambler and Metropolitan brands. The company struggled initially, but Rambler&#x27;s sales took off under Romney. A Rambler won the 1959 Mobil Economy Run, and by 1960, was the third-most-popular brand of automobile in the United States, behind Ford and Chevrolet.

=== 1962–1967: Roy Abernethy ===

George Romney left American Motors in 1962 to run for governor in Michigan and was replaced as CEO by Roy Abernethy. Abernethy had been with AMC since the 1954 merger and as vice president of sales was responsible for successfully building AMC&#x27;s sales and distribution network during the 1950s and early 1960s.

After two model years (1963 and 1964) of only producing compact cars, Abernethy shifted the focus of American Motors back to bigger and more profitable cars such as the Ambassador line and tried to move away from the perceived negative of the Rambler&#x27;s economy car image. Ambassador sales jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965. In 1966, they went to more than 71,000. However, the enormous costs of developing the new cars and engines meant American Motors now had problems in securing working capital to keep the company going. American Motors sales dropped 20% in the first half of 1966, and the firm reported a fiscal six-month loss of $4.2 million on sales of $479 million. Consequently, Robert B. Evans invested more than $2 million because American Motors&#x27;s stock was selling for only 60% of the company&#x27;s net worth; thus, he became its largest stockholder and was named its chairman on June 6, 1966, replacing Richard E. Cross, who continued as a director and chairman of the executive committee. In the quarter ending September 30, 1966, American Motors recorded a loss of $12,648,000 before tax credits and deferred tax assets. In the face of deteriorating financial and market positions, Abernethy &quot;retired&quot; as CEO in 1967, and Evans &quot;resigned&quot; as chairman.

=== 1967–1977: Roy D. Chapin Jr. ===

Abernethy was replaced by Roy D. Chapin Jr., the son of Hudson co-founder Roy D. Chapin. William V. Luneberg replaced Evans as president. American Motors&#x27; public explanation for the removals was that the two had &quot;stepped aside according to a plan to give a younger team an opportunity to move the company forward&quot;.

Chapin took charge of revitalizing the company, and designer Dick Teague economized by developing several vehicles from common stampings. The AMC Matador was in reality a facelift of the AMC Rebel, itself derived from the 1967 AMC Ambassador platform. While prices and costs were cut, Teague designed new and more sporty automobiles resulting in the Javelin and AMX muscle cars; and the AMC Hornet. From 1970 Jeep production complemented AMC&#x27;s existing passenger-car business. Under Chapin&#x27;s leadership, AMC produced all-new compact car designs based on the Hornet platform including the Gremlin and Concord.

=== 1977–1982: Gerald C. Meyers ===

On May 24, 1977, Gerald C. Meyers replaced the retiring William Luneburg as president and Chief Operating Officer. Only 5 months later, upon the retirement of Chapin, Meyers became chairman and CEO on October 21, 1977. At the time, Meyers was 49 years old, and became the youngest top executive in the automobile industry. Meyers abandoned AMC&#x27;s policy of head-on competition and instead focused on revamping its four-wheel drive vehicles, a market segment left untended by the large automakers, and by acquiring advanced technology.

Meyer&#x27;s began talks with Renault in 1979 and from 1980, American Motors partnered with the French automaker to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles.

On December 16, 1980, Renault became the principal owner of American Motors.

At age 53, Meyers retired from the company in February 1982. By that time, Renault controlled 46% of American Motors.

=== 1982–1984: W. Paul Tippett Jr. ===

Meyers was succeeded as chairman by former American Motors president W. Paul Tippett Jr. At the time, Tippett was a member of American Motors management for only three years but had overseen almost all vehicle-making operations during his time as president. Jose Dedeurwaerder, a Renault manager, replaced Tippet as president.

Tippet&#x27;s tenure as CEO was short-lived and in September 1984, he was replaced by Dedeurwaerder.

=== 1984–1986: Jose J. Dedeurwaerder ===

On September 28, 1984, Dedeurwaerder was promoted to CEO, with Tippett remaining on as chairman. On February 25, 1985, AMC announced its first full-year profit since 1979. The success was short-lived as on July 31, 1985, AMC announced that it had received a $50 million loan from Renault following a second-quarter loss of $70.4 million.

Under Dedeurwaerder, Chrysler entered an agreement with American Motors in 1985 to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys, as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in American Motors&#x27; Kenosha, Wisconsin, plant. At the time, American Motors had excess manufacturing capacity.

In January 1986, Dedeurwaerder was named Renault&#x27;s executive vice president of worldwide sales and marketing. He remained president and CEO, and chairman of the executive committee at AMC until March 23, 1986, when he was succeeded in the former two roles by Joseph E. Cappy.

By 1986, Renault had lost $700 million on $22 billion of sales in the U.S market, and was $9 billion in debt.

=== 1986–1987: Joseph E. Cappy ===

On March 23, 1986, former executive vice president of operations Joseph E. Cappy was named president and chief executive officer of American Motors.

In 1987, after further new-vehicle development that included the Medallion (a rebadged Renault 21) and Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italian-designed new full-sized front-wheel drive sedan that became the Eagle Premier, Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in American Motors to Chrysler, which made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of American Motors stock. Chrysler acquired American Motors in August 1987. The primary task of Chrysler management was to integrate the two companies as quickly as possible. American Motors&#x27; final CEO, was tasked with achieving this by Chrysler president Gerald Greenwald.

After the buyout Cappy joined Chrysler as group vice president of the new Jeep-Eagle division. In 1989, he was named Chrysler&#x27;s vice president of brand development. The following year he became Chrysler&#x27;s vice president of international operations.

== Business legacy ==
American Motors was forced to constantly innovate for 33 years until Chrysler absorbed it in 1987. The lessons learned from this experience were integrated into the company that bought American Motors. The organization, strategies, and several key executives allowed Chrysler to gain an edge over the competition. Even today, the lessons gained from the American Motors experience continue to benefit other firms in the industry. There are many legacies of American Motors&#x27;s business strategies.

American Motors could formulate strategies that industry critics often evaluated as &quot;strokes of brilliance&quot;. According to Roy D. Chapin Jr., American Motors realized they were up against the giants of the industry, so to compete successfully they had to be able to move quickly and with ingenuity. An essential strategy practiced by American Motors was to rely on outside vendors to supply components in which they had differential advantages. This approach was finally accepted within the U.S. auto industry, but only after each of the Big Three experienced the failure of attempting to be self-sufficient.

The smallest U.S. automaker did not have &quot;the massive R&amp;D budgets of General Motors, Ford, and foreign competitors … thus American Motors placed R&amp;D emphasis on bolstering the product life cycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps).&quot; In 1985, American Motors originated product lifecycle management (PLM) as a strategic business approach according to Sidney Hill Jr., executive editor for &quot;Manufacturing Business Technology&quot;, in an effort to better compete against its much larger rivals by ramping up its product development process.

Another example of American Motors&#x27; agility was the ability of management to squeeze money out of reluctant bankers, even in the face of bankruptcy. These core abilities helped save the company from collapse and, after each obstacle, gave it the wherewithal to keep it operating. Ironically, American Motors was never stronger than just before its demise.

American Motors&#x27; managers anticipated important trends in the automotive industry. It preached fuel efficiency in the 1950s, long before most auto buyers demanded it. Led by American Motors&#x27; Rambler and several European cars, the small car innovation reduced the Big Three&#x27;s market share from 93% in 1957 to 82% in 1959. The company inherited foreign manufacturing and sales partnerships from Nash and continued developing business relations, decades before most of the international consolidations among automobile makers took place. American Motors was the first U.S. automaker to establish an ownership agreement with a foreign automaker, Renault.

Although small in size, American Motors was able to introduce numerous industry innovations. Starting in 1957, American Motors was the only U.S. manufacturer to fully immerse all automobile bodies in primer paint for protection against rust, until competitors adopted the practice in 1964. Even one of American Motors&#x27;s most expensive new product investments (the Pacer) established many features that were later adopted by the auto industry worldwide. These included aerodynamic body design, space-efficient interiors, aircraft-style doors, and a large greenhouse for visibility. American Motors was also effective in other areas, such as marketing, by introducing low-rate financing. American Motors&#x27; four-wheel-drive vehicles established the foundation for the modern SUV market segments, and &quot;classic&quot; Jeep models remain the benchmark in this field. Roy D. Chapin drew on his experiences as a hunter and fisherman and marketed the Jeep brand successfully to people with like interests. The brand developed a cult appeal that continues.

The purchase of American Motors was instrumental in reviving Chrysler. According to Robert Lutz, former president of Chrysler, the American Motors acquisition was a big and risky undertaking. The purchase was part of Chrysler&#x27;s strategic &quot;retreat-cum-diversification&quot; plan that he states did not have the proper focus. Initially, the goal was to obtain the world-renowned Jeep brand. However, Lutz discovered that the decision to buy American Motors turned out to be a gold mine for Chrysler. At that time, Chrysler&#x27;s management was attempting to find a model to improve structure and operations, &quot;something that would help get our minds unstuck and thinking beyond the old paradigms that we were so familiar with&quot;. In this transformation, &quot;Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC was one of the all-time great moments in corporate serendipity&quot; according to Lutz &quot; that most definitely played a key role in demonstrating how to accomplish change&quot;.

According to Lutz (1993), while American Motors had its share of problems, it was far from being a bunch of &quot;brain-dead losers&quot;. He describes the &quot;troops&quot; at American Motors as more like the Wake Island Marines in battle, &quot;with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy, they were able to roll out an impressive succession of new products&quot;. After first reacting with anger to the purchase, Chrysler managers soon anticipated the benefits. To further solidify the organizational competencies held by American Motors, Lee Iacocca agreed to retain former American Motors units, such as engineering, completely intact. In addition, American Motors&#x27; lead engineer, François Castaing, was made head of all engineering at Chrysler. In an unthinkable strategic move, Castaing completely dismantled the entrenched Chrysler groups. In their place, American Motors&#x27;s &quot;platform team&quot; was implemented. These were close-knit cross-functional groups responsible for the whole vehicle, contrasted with Chrysler&#x27;s highly functional structure. In this capacity, Castaing&#x27;s strategy was to eliminate the corporate administrative overhead bureaucracy. This move shifted corporate culture and agitated veteran executives who believed that Chrysler&#x27;s reputation as &quot;the engineering company&quot; was being destroyed. Yet, according to the popular press, by the 1980s, Chrysler&#x27;s reputation was shot, and in Lutz&#x27;s view, only dramatic action would change that. In summary, Chrysler&#x27;s purchase of American Motors laid the critical foundation to help re-establish a strategy for its revival in the 1990s.

Top managers at Chrysler after the AMC buyout appeared to have made errors similar to those by American Motors. For example, Chrysler invested heavily in new untested models while not keeping up its profitable high-volume lines.

The American Motors influence also continued at General Motors. GM recruited a new executive team to turn itself from near bankruptcy in the early 2000s. Among the new strategists at GM was Lutz, who understood the importance of passion in product design. Lutz&#x27;s new thinking at GM incorporated the systems and structures that originated from American Motors&#x27;s lean and focused operations.

Renault implemented the lessons it learned from its investment in American Motors. The French firm took a parallel approach as it did with its initial ownership of American Motors and applied it to resurrect the money-losing Nissan automaker in Japan.

In 2009, in a deal brokered by the Obama administration, Italian automaker Fiat initiated a white knight takeover of Chrysler to save the struggling automaker from liquidation. The deal was immediately compared to the American Motors-Renault deal; some commentators noted the irony in that Chrysler now faced the same fate that American Motors faced 30 years earlier, while others expressed skepticism of whether the Italian firm could save Chrysler, given how the Renault deal failed. However, there were crucial differences between the two:
*Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne became CEO of Chrysler as part of the deal and immediately began globally integrating Fiat and Chrysler&#x27;s assets and product lines.
*The Fiat-Chrysler merger did not face the political opposition the American Motors-Renault deal did since a family group led Fiat with significant equity, and the U.S. government supported the merger.
*While American Motors proved to be a continuous money-loser for Renault, Chrysler returned to profitability fairly quickly and became an essential source of revenue and profits for Fiat, which has been struggling to maintain volume and profitability amid the European debt crisis.

The two firms would later fully merge to create Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014, and would further merge with the French firm PSA Group, owners of the Citroën and Peugeot brands, to form Stellantis in 2021.

== Legacy of products ==

=== Passenger automobiles ===
Chrysler revived the &quot;Spirit&quot; name, which was discontinued by AMC after 1983 for use on one of its A platform cars (the Dodge Spirit) from 1989 until 1995. The planned Renault Medallion was sold as the Eagle Medallion in 1988 and 1989. The planned all-new 1988 Renault Premier, a joint development effort between American Motors and Renault, and for which the Brampton Assembly plant (Brampton, Ontario — originally called the Bramalea Plant) was built, was sold by Chrysler as the 1988–1992 Eagle Premier, with a rebadged Dodge Monaco variant available from 1990 through 1992. The full-sized Premier&#x27;s platform was far more advanced than anything Chrysler was building. After some re-engineering and a re-designation to Chrysler code LH, the Eagle Premier went on to form the backbone of Chrysler&#x27;s passenger car lineup during the 1990s as the Chrysler Concorde (a revived model name that was briefly used by Plymouth in 1951 and 1952—and AMC itself only a decade before), Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler LHS, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision. Plymouth almost received their rendition of the LH platform, which was to be called the Accolade. Still, Chrysler decided to drop this version just before LH production started. The Chrysler 300M was likewise a Premier/LH-derived car and was initially to have been the next-generation Eagle Vision until the Eagle brand was dropped after 1998. The LH Platform was subsequently re-engineered, using Mercedes-Benz components, into the Chrysler LX Platform, which was the basis for the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Challenger. Chrysler&#x27;s successor Stellantis later revived the Hornet name in 2023 for Dodge as a rebadged variant of the Alfa Romeo Tonale.

=== Jeep vehicles ===
Chrysler marketed the SJ Jeep Grand Wagoneer until 1991, leaving it almost entirely unaltered from the final American Motors rendition before the buyout. The Jeep Comanche pickup truck remained until 1992, while the Cherokee remained until 2001 in the United States. The XJ Cherokee was produced in China through 2006 as the Cherokee 2500 (2.5L) and Cherokee 4000 (4.0L). Although it was not introduced until 1993, the Jeep Grand Cherokee was initially an American Motors-developed vehicle.

Traces of American Motors remained within. American Motors&#x27; Toledo, Ohio, plants continued to manufacture the Jeep Wrangler and Liberty, as well as parts and components for Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep vehicles (although Toledo Machining and Forge were closed in 2005). Although heavily downsized, American Motors&#x27; main plant in Wisconsin operated as the Kenosha Engine Plant, producing engines for several Chrysler Group products, including the Wrangler. The plant was closed as part of the post-bailout restructuring of Chrysler in October 2010. The engine was used until the 2006 model year by DaimlerChrysler in the Jeep Wrangler. American Motors&#x27; technologically advanced Bramalea Assembly and Stamping Plants in Brampton, Ontario, later produced the LX-cars – the Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger, and the now discontinued Dodge Magnum.

In terms of American Motors-related parts, some were used as late as 2006, when the Jeep Wrangler (the last new product introduced by American Motors before the Chrysler deal) was still using the AMC Straight-6 engine in some models, as well as the recessed &quot;paddle&quot; door handles that were used since the 1968 model year by American Motors. Both were retired when the Wrangler was completely redesigned for the 2007 model year.

AM General, sold by American Motors in 1983, is still in business building the American Motors-designed Humvee for American and allied militaries. AM General also built the now-discontinued civilian variant, the H1, and manufactured a Chevrolet Tahoe-derived companion, the H2, under contract to GM, who acquired the rights to the civilian Hummer brand in 1999. GM was forced to phase out the Hummer brand in early 2010 due to its bankruptcy restructuring after offering it for sale, but failing to find a suitable buyer.

Although Chrysler introduced new logos for its brands in the 1990s and again in 2010 after the Fiat Group took control of the company, Jeep still uses the American Motors-era logo introduced shortly after American Motors purchased the brand in 1970. Until the Chrysler purchase, Jeep&#x27;s logo also featured the American Motors emblem.

== International legacy ==

Beginning in 1960, American Motors&#x27; executive vice president of international operations Roy D. Chapin Jr. embarked on a strong international campaign to set up importation and local assembly operations of American Motors vehicles worldwide. In five years, Chapin increased foreign sales to 73,489 cars, which at the same time grew AMC&#x27;s share of the U.S. export market from 2.5 percent to 14.3 percent.

Chapin successfully established or re-established vehicle assembly operations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium (via Renault of France), Chile, Costa Rica, Germany, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, South Africa, and Venezuela. He also strengthened international export operations with exports to the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway in Europe, and to countries in the Middle East, the Caribbean, and South America.

The Rambler Classic would become the basis of Argentina&#x27;s future national car, the Torino. After becoming CEO in 1967, Chapin organized the acquisition of Kaiser Jeep from Kaiser Industries in 1970, with American Motors, thereby inheriting all existing international Jeep operations. These helped sustain American Motors during the 1970s and 1980s.

While the Rambler marque had been dropped in the United States after the 1969 model year, all export markets retained the Rambler name, with the longest to retain it being Mexico until 1983.

== Legacy of divisions and facilities ==

=== Former brands and divisions ===
During its history, American Motors bought or created, then later sold and divested itself of several specialized divisions, some of which continue to exist today:

&quot;Kelvinator&quot;, the subdivision of Nash-Kelvinator, was sold by American Motors in 1968 to White Consolidated Industries and subsequently became part of Electrolux. The Kelvinator Company is still in business.

&quot;Jeep&quot; is a brand under &quot;Stellantis&quot;. It was a brand of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles until January 16, 2021. Many Jeep models retained the mechanical specifications and styling cues developed by American Motors well into the 1990s or even into the first decade of the 2000s.

&quot;AM General&quot; is now owned by KPS Capital Partners. It was organized as an LLC in August 2004.

&quot;Wheel Horse Products Division&quot; is now owned by the Toro Company.

&quot;Beijing Jeep&quot; was established by American Motors in 1984 to produce Jeeps for the burgeoning Chinese market; the joint venture was inherited by Chrysler and is currently owned by Mercedes-Benz Group, which renamed it Beijing Benz. American Motors&#x27; trials with the venture were the subject of a book on the venture, &quot;Beijing Jeep&quot;, by James Mann.

=== Facilities ===
American Motors World Headquarters (1954–1975) was located at 14250 Plymouth Road in Detroit and was widely known as the &quot;Plymouth Road Office Center (PROC)&quot;. In 1975, American Motors moved its headquarters from the facility on Plymouth Road to a newly constructed building on Northwestern Highway in Southfield, Michigan, known as the American Center.

The initial building was built during 1926–27 by the Electric Refrigeration Corporation (subsequently Nash-Kelvinator) with design by Amedeo Leoni, industrial layout by Wallace McKenzie, and tower enclosure and industrial units by William E. Kapp of SHG. The original three-story factory and four-story administration building had been headquarters to Nash-Kelvinator from 1937 until 1954, as well as a factory for refrigerators, electric ranges, and commercial refrigeration—as well as airplane propellers for the U.S. military effort during World War II.

During World War II, the U.S. War Department contracted with Nash-Kelvinator to produce 900 Sikorsky R-6 model helicopters. As part of that contract, a site north of the factory was used as the smallest airport in the world as a flight testing base. Nash-Kelvinator produced about 50 R-6s a month during the war. When the contract was terminated at the war&#x27;s end, 262 helicopters had been constructed.

During Chrysler&#x27;s occupancy of the complex, it was known as Jeep and (Dodge) Truck Engineering (JTE), including facilities for body-on-frame work as well as testing facilities and labs. The buildings included , approximately one-third devoted to engineering and computer functions.

As of 2007, Chrysler employed over 1,600 people at the complex, moving those operations in mid-2009 to the Chrysler Technology Center. The property was put up for sale by Chrysler in early 2010. It was bought by a local man who gutted the building for scrap and left it in a dilapidated state before losing it to foreclosure. The abandoned building was in possession of the city of Detroit and officials were considering if the industrial site would be more marketable if the building was torn down. In 2018, the Wayne County Commission approved a land swap that included a new jail complex for the county as well as a potential revival for the old American Motors building.

* American Center – American Motors&#x27; corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan, is still standing, still open, and still called &quot;American Center&quot;. The original &quot;American Center&quot; signage at the top of the building remained until 2005. However, the American Motors logo has been removed. The signage has since been changed to Charter One. The 25-story building is rented to several organizations and companies as office space. After the Chrysler acquisition, Chrysler Financial occupied as much as of the building.
* Toledo South Assembly Plants – Torn down by Chrysler in 2007. Until it was demolished, most of the signage outside the factories was still visible, and there were areas where Chrysler painted over the American Motors logo.
* Toledo Forge – Torn down by Chrysler in 2007.
* Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly and Satellite Stamping Plants – Still in use by Chrysler. American Motors designed this US$260 million (US$ in dollars), plant, which was operational by 1986. This plant was designed and built by American Motors for the specific purpose of building the Eagle Premier. Like the older Brampton plant, this factory was also part of American Motors (Canada) Ltd., and with the Chrysler buyout in 1987, it became part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant built the LX vehicles: the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Charger, and the Dodge Challenger.
* Kenosha &quot;Main&quot; Plant – Portions of the Kenosha Main Plant (later Chrysler&#x27;s Kenosha Engine plant with some new additions) at 52nd Street and 30th Avenue continued to be run by Chrysler as an engine-production factory. This plant closed in October 2010 as part of Chrysler LLC&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure which resulted from the automotive industry crisis. Demolition of the plant began in early December 2012.
* Canadian Fabricated Products Ltd. – An American Motors division (part of American Motors of Canada) in Stratford, Ontario; established in 1971 and sold post-buyout by Chrysler in 1994; produced automotive interior trim.
* Guelph Products – An American Motors division (also part of American Motors of Canada) in Guelph, Ontario; opened in 1987 and subsequently sold by Chrysler in early 1993; the operation supplied molded plastic components to the Brampton Assembly Plant.
* Coleman Products Corporation – An American Motors subsidiary in Coleman, Wisconsin. Manufactured automotive wiring harnesses for American Motors and other automakers.
* Evart Products Co. – An American Motors subsidiary in Evart, Michigan. The plant was established in 1953 with 25 workers and eventually expanded to over 1,200, becoming Osceola County&#x27;s largest employer. This factory manufactured injection molded plastic parts (notably, grilles) for American Motors (supplying 90% of in-house needs), as well as for other automakers. In 1966, Products Wire Harness was built. After Chrysler purchased American Motors, Collins &amp; Aikman took over the factory.
* Mercury Plastics Co. – Mercury Plastics operated a plant at 34501 Harper Ave., Mt. Clemens, Michigan. The company was acquired in 1973 for 611,111 shares of American Motors stock. The company produced plastic parts for American Motors, as well as for uses in other industries.
* Windsor Plastics Co. – Windsor Plastics, 601 North Congress Avenue, Evansville, Indiana, was acquired in 1970. The division produced plastic parts for American Motors and other industries. The company was sold to Guardian Industries in 1982 and underwent a name change to Guardian Automotive Trim, Inc. It is still in operation. The original factory in Evansville continues to manufacture plastic parts for the OEM and aftermarket automotive industries. Items manufactured include grilles, bezels, and other parts.
* The American Motors Proving Grounds – The former American Motors Proving Grounds in Burlington, Wisconsin, had initially been Nash&#x27;s test track and subsequently became Jeep&#x27;s test facilities (after American Motors acquired Kaiser Jeep in the 1970s). The grounds were disused after Chrysler&#x27;s takeover of American Motors in 1987. Subsequently, they became the engineering and test facility for MGA Research. The company rents out this proving grounds to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), for &quot;ride-and-drive&quot; events by automakers, as well as for movies and commercials.
* Axle tooling equipment – Sold in 1985 to Dana Holding Corporation, and they named the AMC-15 axles as Dana 35. Dana manufactured the AMC-20 axles for AM General&#x27;s Hummer H1. The company also continues to produce the AMC-15 axle; however, they have been upgraded from American Motors&#x27; original design with multiple variations (including front axle designs).
* Holmes Foundry, Ltd. – American Motors&#x27; block-casting foundry was a major American Motors factory now obliterated. Holmes had its main office and foundry at 200 Exmouth Street, Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Holmes was established in 1918 by J. S. Blunt and was called Holmes Blunt Limited. In the early years, Ford Motor Company contracted the plant for a steady supply of engine casting blocks. This factory had a local reputation as a dirty, dangerous workplace. The company had three divisions, all operating on one site at the edge of Sarnia. Beginning in 1962, American Motors contracted with Holmes Foundry to supply American Motors with cylinder block castings. American Motors acquired 25% interest in the foundry in January 1966. In July 1970, American Motors acquired 100% of Holmes Foundry through an exchange of shares, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. However, it was not until October 1981 that Holmes Foundry finally became a division of American Motors of Canada. As part of its acquisition of American Motors in 1987, Chrysler Corporation took ownership of the Holmes facility and its manufacturing business but closed the operation on September 16, 1988. The industrial facilities were cleaned of their environmental contaminants in 2005 in preparation for a new highway interchange to be built on the site.
* Kenosha &quot;Lakefront&quot; (Kenosha, Wisconsin) Plant – The American Motors plant in downtown Kenosha along Lake Michigan was razed, and after reclamation, the land was used for new development. At the company&#x27;s inception in 1954, the plant covered and, together with the Milwaukee plant, had an annual production capacity of 350,000 cars. In 1977, the factory was used for the car-production scenes for the movie &quot;The Betsy&quot;.
* Milwaukee Body (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) Plant – American Motors inherited a body plant in Milwaukee from Nash. The plant had been the main body plant for the Seaman Body Corporation, which did a lot of business assembling bodies of various designs with Nash and other makers. Nash had purchased half of this company in 1919 and took over the remaining half in 1936. For American Motors, the plant was sometimes a problem. For example, in late 1961, George Romney stormed through the plant and threatened to close it and eliminate its 9,000 jobs due to labor problems. The plant survived until the Chrysler buyout. Chrysler later decided to dispose of the factory. Upon closure, the site was named a Superfund site. The factory was demolished, and the site was rehabilitated and redeveloped.
* Danforth Ave (Toronto, Ontario) Plant – Inherited from Nash. This plant was purchased by Nash from Ford of Canada in 1946. The first Canadian-built Nash rolled off the line in April 1950. Upon the formation of American Motors in 1954, the plant assembled 1955 Nash and Hudson Ramblers (2 and 4-door sedans), as well as Nash Canadian Statesman and Hudson Wasp (4-door sedans). In 1956, the plant continued to assemble the Nash and Hudson Rambler (4-door sedans and wagons) and the Nash Canadian Statesman (4-door sedan), but the Hudson Wasp was imported. That same year, American Motors (Canada) Limited was formed – taking over Nash Motors of Canada Limited and Hudson Motors of Canada Limited. In 1957, American Motors assembled the Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V8 at the Danforth plant. American Motors closed the plant in July 1957 and imported Ramblers into Canada until 1961. The structure remains today as the Shoppers World Danforth Lowe&#x27;s store.
* Tilbury, Ontario Assembly Plant – Another plant American Motors inherited from the 1954 merger, this one via Hudson. Specifically, it was a contract with CHATCO Steel Products, which owned the plant. American Motors ceased Hudson production at the Tilbury plant in 1955.
* Brampton Assembly Plant – American Motors opened a plant in 1960 in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. It was part of American Motors of Canada. Rambler Drive, a small street just west of this plant, still exists and leads into a residential subdivision built in the 1960s. In 1987, with the Chrysler buyout, the division and the plant were absorbed, becoming part of Chrysler Canada Limited. The plant was closed in 1994 and sold to Wal-Mart for use as their Canadian warehouse. This plant/warehouse was demolished in 2004 and redeveloped in 2007, with multiple smaller commercial buildings now onsite; a new Lowes Home Improvement Warehouse now takes up the most extensive section of this commercial development. Note that this is a separate facility from the current Brampton (formerly Bramalea) Assembly and Satellite Stamping Plants nearby.
* South Charleston Stamping Plant – A South Charleston, West Virginia, facility. While American Motors leased it, the plant stamped steel automotive parts. American Motors announced it would expand productive capacity in 1974 when automobile sales were not increasing. Most of the stamping work for AMC cars was performed by suppliers. The automaker aimed to integrate body panel stamping into its manufacturing system. The initial phase of development for the plant called for four press lines until 1977, but a fifth line was added to the operation late summer of 1976. The facility also incorporated AMC&#x27;s international operations by importing steel from Belgium and shipping body parts to assembly plants in Canada and Mexico, as well as to its Milwaukee and Kenosha factories. Parts for the Gremlin, Hornet, and Pacer were produced in West Virginia. Some of the new equipment installed by AMC was financed by industrial revenue bonds issued by Kanawha County with the debt to be retired through the lease payments from AMC. In 1978, Volkswagen of America purchased the plant. The sale generated an undisclosed amount of cash for AMC after posting a $46 million loss for 1977 and the agreement will be for VW continue to supply stampings to AMC after taking over the plant in January 1978. The facility supplied stampings for the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant but subsequently VW sold the plant when it ceased production at Westmoreland in 1988. It was purchased by Park Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio. In October 2006, Union Stamping and Assembly declared bankruptcy. The current owner of the facility is Gestamp. The plant is used to design and make metal components for vehicles. In 2023, the company announced an investment of $69.5 million over two years to create 100 jobs and make metal parts for electric vehicles. West Virginia government provided a $7.5 million incentive.

== Earlier use of the name ==
The era of 1900 until 1925 saw various corporations, in several U.S. states, use similar &quot;American&quot; names, such as American Motor Carriage Company (Ohio, 1902–1903), American Automobile Manufacturing Company (Indiana, 1911–1912), and American Motors Incorporated (New York, 1919–1920). In 1916, an earlier &quot;American Motors Corporation&quot;, apparently unrelated to the more famous later corporation of the same name, was formed in Newark, New Jersey, with Louis Chevrolet as vice president and chief engineer. By 1918, it was producing cars in a plant at Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1923, it merged with the Bessemer Motor Truck Company of Pennsylvania into Bessemer–American Motors Corporation, which lasted less than a year before merging with the Winther and Northway companies into Amalgamated Motors. The latter company ceased soon after.

== Later reuse of the trademark ==
A new company was formed in Palmdale, California, in 2001. Registration for the American Motors trademarks was filed in 2001 by this California-based firm. The company&#x27;s website specifically claimed no affiliation to the previous American Motors but used American Motors&#x27; history and logos on its website. The website is now dead, and the company&#x27;s claims to American Motors&#x27; trademarks expired in 2005.

The new Chrysler LLC holds a live registration for the name &quot;American Motors&quot;, which was applied for in 2005. The &quot;AMC&quot; wordmark, complete with &quot;A-mark&quot; graphic logo, as was originally used in 1970 and through the late-1980s, was registered and published for comment by Chrysler as of 2010.

American Motors contracted with Volkswagen to buy tooling for the Audi 2.0 L OHC I4. Major parts (block, crankshaft, head assembly) were initially purchased from Audi and shipped to the U.S., where American Motors accomplished final assembly at a plant explicitly purchased for the production of this engine. Sales never reached numbers to justify taking over total production. American Motors made several changes to the engine. By contractual agreement, they were prevented from using the Volkswagen or Audi names in association with the American Motors assembled version.

== Collectibility ==


American Motors models historically regarded by hobbyists as particularly &quot;collectible&quot; include the Javelin, AMX, and performance specials such as the 1957 Rambler Rebel, 1965–67 Marlin, 1969 Hurst SC/Rambler, 1970 Rebel Machine, and 1971 Hornet SC/360. These models enjoyed limited popularity when new, resulting in low production figures. In January 2007, the AMC AMX was &quot;really taking off in the muscle car market&quot; according to the editors of &quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot;, and it had &quot;left its mark among AMC collectors&#x27; minds as a great alternative&quot; to higher-priced Hemi-powered muscle cars.

The early Javelin (1968–70) stands out from the Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler pony cars. Car expert Jack Nerad noted in a 2007 article &quot;several fully restored AMX models&quot; listed for sale at &quot;little more than half the price of a comparable Buick Gran Sport, Chevrolet Chevelle, Olds 4-4-2 or Pontiac GTO&quot; in support of the author&#x27;s opinion that the 1971–74 Javelin was &quot;clearly an outstanding alternative muscle car for the enthusiast on a budget.&quot;

According to James C. Mays, automotive historian and author of &quot;The Savvy Guide to Buying Collector Cars at Auction&quot;, the &quot;Wow! Factor&quot; is an important and measurable pleasure to an owner whether their car is driven or sits in a climate-controlled garage. His &quot;Wow! Factor&quot; includes examples of a bright red 1969 AMX that, according to its owner, &quot;is just a fast Rambler&quot;, but draws more people at events than the more prestigious Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as well as a &quot;million-dollar moment&quot; when a Rambler owner was serenaded with the &quot;Beep Beep&quot; song by The Playmates while fueling at a travel plaza. Moreover, the author&#x27;s collector car, a 1969 Ambassador station wagon, made friends as strangers came to greet and host him as if &quot;long lost kin&quot;. Mays points out the ready availability of parts for American Motors engines and his experiences in having service done on Ramblers without being charged for the work in exchange for the experience of driving a &quot;sassy Rambler&quot; (a 1966 American convertible) and having pictures taken with it.

Other American Motors models, once somewhat ignored by the hobby, are now considered &quot;future collectibles&quot;. Examples include the 1959 Ambassador 4-door hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were produced, and the Jeep Scrambler CJ8, a combined pickup truck-Jeep, of which only a few thousand were made.

&quot;Hemmings Classic Car&quot; magazine included the 1969–70 Rebel SST and the 1974–78 Matador coupe in their 2008 list of &quot;dollar-for-pound (weight)&quot; cars that could be bought in show-quality condition for a comparatively modest outlay. The writer also noted that &quot;most of AMC&#x27;s &#x27;70s lineup&quot; qualified for inclusion on the list.

The AMC Gremlin is described as having &quot;a cult-like following&quot; in today&#x27;s collectible car market. The Gremlin shares components with some other American Motors models, making its repair and restoration relatively inexpensive compared with other &quot;historic cars&quot;.

The AMC Pacer increased in value according to a Pacer owner who is the CEO of a major insurance provider for collector car owners.

There are active Rambler and American Motors car clubs in the U.S. and elsewhere (examples in External Links).

=== &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine revival April Fool&#x27;s joke ===
In April 2008, &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine released an article claiming that American Motors was in the process of being revived. The vehicles in the works were to be the AMX, Matador, Ambassador, Pacer, and Gremlin. It was a popular article, illustrated with drawings of the concept cars entering production and accompanied by plentiful information. However, it was later revealed as an April Fools&#x27; joke.

<text>The Chatham Islands ( ; Moriori: , &#x27;Misty Sun&#x27;; ) are an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean about east of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, administered as part of New Zealand, and consisting of about 10 islands within an approximate radius, the largest of which are Chatham Island and Pitt Island (&quot;Rangiauria&quot;). They include New Zealand&#x27;s easternmost point, the Forty-Fours. Some of the islands, formerly cleared for farming, are now preserved as nature reserves to conserve some of the unique flora and fauna.

The islands were uninhabited when the Moriori people arrived around 1500 CE and developed a peaceful way of life. In 1835, members of the Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama Māori iwi from the North Island of New Zealand invaded the islands and nearly exterminated the Moriori, enslaving the survivors.

In the period of European colonisation, the New Zealand Company claimed that the British Crown had never included the Chatham Islands as being under its control, and proposed selling it to Germans to be a German colony. In 1841, a contract was drawn up for the sale of the islands for £10,000, (equivalent to approximately £860,000 in 2023), but the sale failed and the Chatham Islands officially became part of the Colony of New Zealand in 1842.

In 1863 the Moriori were officially released from slavery through a proclamation by the resident magistrate.

The Chatham Islands had a resident population of Waitangi is the main port and settlement. The local economy depends largely on conservation, tourism, farming, and fishing. The Chatham Islands Council provides local administration – its powers resemble those of New Zealand&#x27;s unitary authorities. The Chatham Islands have their own time zone, which is 45 minutes ahead of mainland New Zealand.

==Geography==

The Chatham Islands lie roughly east of Christchurch in the South Island. The nearest New Zealand mainland point to the islands is Cape Turnagain, in the North Island, distant. The islands sit on the Chatham Rise, a large, relatively shallowly submerged (no more than deep at any point) plateau that stretches east from near the South Island. The Chatham Rise is part of the now largely submerged continent of Zealandia. The islands, which emerged only within the last 4 million years, are the only part of the Chatham Rise showing above sea level.

The two largest islands, Chatham Island and Pitt Island (Rangiaotea), constitute most of the total area of , with 12 scattered islets making up the rest. The islands are hilly, with the coastal areas being a mix of cliffs, dunes, beaches, and lagoons. Pitt is more rugged than Chatham.

The highest point () is on a plateau near the southernmost tip of Chatham Island, south of Lake Te Rangatapu. The plateau is dotted with numerous lakes and lagoons, flowing mainly from the island&#x27;s nearby second-highest point, Maungatere Hill, at . Notable are the large Te Whanga Lagoon, and Huro and Rangitahi. Chatham has a number of streams, including Te Awainanga and Tuku.

Chatham and Pitt are the only inhabited islands; the other islands are conservation reserves with restricted or prohibited access. The livelihoods of the inhabitants depend on agriculture – the islands export coldwater crayfish – and, increasingly, on tourism.

The main islands, in order of occupation, are:
The International Date Line lies to the east of the Chathams, even though the islands lie east of 180° longitude. The Chathams observe their own time, which is 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time, including during periods of daylight-saving time; the Chatham Standard Time Zone is distinctive as one of very few that differ from others by a period other than a whole hour or half-hour. (New Zealand Time orients itself to 180° longitude.)

=== Geology ===
The Chatham Islands are far from the Australian-Pacific plate boundary that dominates the geology of mainland New Zealand. The islands&#x27; stratigraphy consists of a Mesozoic schist basement, typically covered by marine sedimentary rocks. Both these sequences are intruded by a series of basalt eruptions. Volcanic activity has occurred multiple times since the Cretaceous, but currently there is no active volcanism near any part of the Chatham Rise. Prominent columnar basalt can be seen at Ohira Bay (one of the indentations in the north coast of Petre Bay) between Te Roto and Port Hutt.

===Climate===
The Chatham Islands have an oceanic climate (Koppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) characterised by a narrow temperature range and relatively frequent rainfall. Their isolated position far from any sizeable landmass renders the record high temperature for the main settlement (Waitangi) just . The climate is cool, wet and windy, with average high temperatures between in summer, and between in July (in the Southern Hemisphere winter). Snowfall is extremely rare, the fall recorded near sea level in July 2015 marking the first such reading for several decades. Under the Trewartha climate classification, the Chatham Islands have a humid subtropical climate (Cf) for the lack of cold weather during the winter and a daily mean temperature above for 8 months or more.

==Ecology==


=== Plants ===

The natural vegetation of the islands was a mixture of forest, scrubby heath, and swamp, but today most of the land is fern or pasture-covered, although there are some areas of dense forest and areas of peat bogs and other habitats. Of interest are the akeake trees, with branches trailing almost horizontally in the lee of the wind. The ferns in the forest understory include &quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;.

The islands are home to a rich bio-diversity including about 50 endemic plants adapted to the cold and the wind, such as the Chatham Islands forget-me-not (&quot;Myosotidium hortensia&quot;), the Chatham Islands sow-thistle &quot;(Embergeria grandifolia)&quot;, rautini (&quot;Brachyglottis huntii&quot;), the Chatham Islands kakaha (&quot;Astelia chathamica&quot;), soft speargrass (&quot;Aciphylla dieffenbachii&quot;), and the Chatham Island akeake or Chatham Island tree daisy (&quot;Olearia traversiorum&quot;).

=== Birds ===
The islands are a breeding ground for huge flocks of seabirds and are home to a number of endemic birds, some of which are seabirds and others which live on the islands. The best known species are the magenta petrel (IUCN classification CR) and the black robin (IUCN classification EN), both of which came perilously close to extinction before drawing the attention of conservation efforts. Other endemic species are the Chatham oystercatcher, the Chatham gerygone, the Chatham pigeon, Forbes&#x27; parakeet, the Chatham snipe and the shore plover. The endemic Chatham shag (IUCN classification CR), the Pitt shag (IUCN classification EN) and the Chatham albatross (IUCN classification VU) are at risk of capture by a variety of fishing gear, including fishing lines, trawls, gillnets, and pots.

A number of species have gone extinct since human settlement, including the Chatham raven, Chatham fernbird, Chatham Islands penguin and the three endemic species of flightless rails, the Chatham rail, Dieffenbach&#x27;s rail, and Hawkins&#x27;s rail.

=== Mammals ===
Marine mammals found in the waters of the Chathams include New Zealand sea lions, leopard seals, and southern elephant seals. Many whale species are attracted to the rich food sources of the Chatham Rise.

=== Dragonflies and damselflies ===
Only three species of Odonata are known from the Chatham Islands, while 14 have been recorded throughout New Zealand.

* Zygoptera Selys, 1854
*# Lestidae Calvert, 1901
*## &quot;Austrolestes colensonis&quot; (White in White &amp; Gardiner Butler, 1846)
*# Coenagrionidae Kirby, 1890
*## &quot;Xanthocnemis tuanuii&quot; Rowe, 1981
* Anisoptera Selys, 1854
*# Corduliidae Kirby, 1890
*## &quot;Procordulia smithii&quot; (White in White &amp; Gardiner Butler, 1846) 

According to Marinov &amp; McHugh (2010), the poor diversity is linked to harsh environmental conditions, such as generally low annual temperatures, constant strong winds and high acidity in the habitats where their larvae develop.

&quot;Xanthocnemis tuanuii&quot; is endemic to the Chatham Islands, but close to &quot;Xanthocnemis zealandica&quot; (McLachlan, 1873) from mainland New Zealand and genetic studies suggest that the two species cohabitate on the Chatham Islands Nolan &amp; al (2007).

According to Marinov &amp; McHugh (2010), the Chatham Island population of &quot;Austrolestes colensonis&quot; differs genetically from the populations on New Zealand’s main islands, but the differences seem too weak to separate them into two species.

=== Threats ===
Much of the natural forest of the islands has been cleared for farming. Introduced species that prey on the indigenous birds and reptiles are a threat. On Mangere and Rangatira Islands, which are now preserved as nature reserves to conserve some of the unique flora and fauna, livestock has been removed and native wildlife is recovering.

Most lakes have been affected by agricultural run-off, but water quality has improved and river quality is generally classed as &#x27;A&#x27;.

In February 2025, the Department of Conservation (DOC) announced a pest eradication project on the island. The project, part of the Island-Ocean Connection Challenge (IOCC), targets three islands up to 15 times larger than any previously cleared of pests in New Zealand. The goal is to remove invasive species, restore ecosystems, and protect native wildlife, including kākāpō, seabirds, and rare plants. The total project cost is estimated at $202 million, with $54 million from the government and $11.5 million raised through philanthropy, leaving $137 million still needed.

==History==
===Moriori===

The first human inhabitants of the Chathams were Polynesians who probably settled the islands around 1500 CE (though possibly as late as 1550 CE), and in their isolation became the Moriori. It was formerly believed that the Moriori migrated directly from the more northerly Polynesian islands. However, linguistic research in the early 2000s instead concluded that the ancestral Moriori were Māori arrivals from New Zealand:

Scholarship over the past 40 years has radically revised the model offered a century earlier by Smith: the Moriori as a pre-Polynesian people have gone (the term Moriori is now a technical term referring to those ancestral Māori who settled the Chatham Islands).

The plants cultivated by Māori were ill-suited for the colder Chathams, so the Moriori lived as hunter-gatherers and fishermen. While their new environment lacked the resources for building ocean-going craft for long voyages, the Moriori invented the &quot;waka kōrari&quot;, a semi-submerged craft constructed of flax and lined with air bladders from kelp. This craft was used to travel to the outer islands on &#x27;birding&#x27; missions. After generations of warfare, bloodshed was outlawed by the chief Nunuku-whenua and Moriori society became peaceful. Disputes were resolved by consensus or by duels in which, at the first sign of bloodshed, the fight was deemed over. The population before European contact was about 2,000.

===Early European arrival===

The name &quot;Chatham Islands&quot; comes from the name for the main island, which itself gets its name from John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, who was the First Lord of the Admiralty in 1791, when reached the island. The ship, whose captain was William R. Broughton, was part of the Vancouver Expedition. The crew landed on the island on 29 November 1791 and claimed possession for Great Britain. Following a misunderstanding, Broughton&#x27;s men shot and killed a Moriori resident of Kaingaroa, named Torotoro (or Tamakororo). Chatham Islands date their anniversary on 29 November, and observe it on the nearest Monday to 30 November.

Sealers and whalers soon started hunting in the surrounding ocean with the islands as their base. It is estimated that 10 to 20 per cent of the indigenous Moriori soon died from diseases introduced by foreigners. The sealing and whaling industries ceased activities about 1861, while fishing remained as a major economic activity.

===Māori settlement===
On 19 November and 5 December 1835, about 900 Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama men, women and children, previously resident in Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington) and led by the chief Pōmare Ngātata, arrived on the brig &quot;Lord Rodney&quot;. The group brought with them 78 tonnes of seed potato, 20 pigs and seven large &quot;waka&quot;.

The incoming Māori were received and initially cared for by the local Moriori. When it became clear that the visitors intended to stay, the Moriori withdrew to their marae at Te Awapatiki to meet and debate what to do about the Māori settlers. The Moriori decided to keep with their policy of non-aggression. Soon, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama began to &quot;takahi&quot;, or walk the land, to lay claim to it.

Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama saw the Moriori meeting as a precursor to warfare on the part of Moriori and responded. The Māori attacked and in the ensuing action killed over 260 Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled: &quot;[The Māori] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed – men, women and children – indiscriminately&quot;. A Māori chief, Te Rakatau Katihe, said in the Native Land Court in 1870: &quot;We took possession ... in accordance with our custom, and we caught all the people. Not one escaped. Some ran away from us, these we killed; and others also we killed – but what of that? It was in accordance with our custom. I am not aware of any of our people being killed by them.&quot;

After the killings, Moriori were forbidden to marry Moriori, or to have children with each other. Māori kept Moriori slaves until 1863, when slavery was abolished by proclamation of the resident magistrate. Many Moriori women had children by their Māori masters. A number of Moriori women eventually married either Māori or European men. Some were taken away from the Chathams and never returned. Ernst Dieffenbach, who visited the Chathams on a New Zealand Company ship in 1840, reported that the Moriori were the virtual slaves of Māori and were severely mistreated, with death being a blessing. By the time the slaves were released in 1863, only 160 remained, hardly 10% of the 1835 population.

===Further European arrivals===
In early May 1838 (some reports say 1839, but this is contradicted by ship records) the French whaling vessel &quot;Jean Bart&quot; anchored off Waitangi to trade with the Māori. The number of Māori boarding frightened the French, escalating into a confrontation in which the French crew were killed and the &quot;Jean Bart&quot; was run aground at Ocean Bay, to be ransacked and burned by Ngāti Mutunga. When word of the incident reached the French naval corvette &quot;Heroine&quot; in the Bay of Islands in September 1838, it set sail for the Chathams, accompanied by the whalers &quot;Adele&quot; and &quot;Rebecca Sims&quot;. The French arrived on 13 October and, after unsuccessfully attempting to entice some Ngāti Tama aboard, proceeded to bombard Waitangi. The next morning about a hundred armed Frenchmen went ashore, burning buildings, destroying &quot;waka&quot;, and seizing pigs and potatoes. The attacks mostly affected Ngāti Tama, weakening their position relative to Ngāti Mutunga.

In 1840, Ngāti Mutunga decided to attack Ngāti Tama at their pā. They built a high staging next to the pā so they could fire down on their former allies. Fighting was still in progress when the New Zealand Company ship &quot;Cuba&quot; arrived as part of a scheme to buy land for settlement. The Treaty of Waitangi, at that stage, did not apply to the islands. The company negotiated a truce between the two warring tribes. In 1841, the New Zealand Company had proposed to establish a German colony on the Chathams. The proposal was discussed by the directors, and the secretary of the company John Ward signed an agreement with Karl Sieveking of Hamburg on 12 September 1841. The price was set at £10,000. However, when the Colonial Office stated that the islands were to be part of the Colony of New Zealand and any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, Joseph Somes claimed that Ward had been acting on his own initiative. The proposed leader John Beit and the expedition went to Nelson instead.

The company was then able to purchase large areas of land at Port Hutt (which the Māori called &quot;Whangaroa&quot;) and Waitangi from Ngāti Mutunga and also large areas of land from Ngāti Tama. This did not stop Ngāti Mutunga from trying to get revenge for the death of one of their chiefs. They were satisfied after they killed the brother of a Ngāti Tama chief. The tribes agreed to an uneasy peace, which was formally confirmed in 1842.

Reluctant to give up slavery, Matioro and his people chartered a brig in late 1842 and sailed to Auckland Island. While Matioro was surveying the island, two of the chiefs who had accompanied him decided the island was too inhospitable for settlement, and set sail before he had returned, stranding him and his 50 followers. Pākehā settlers arrived in 1849 and Matioro and most of his people moved to Stewart Island in 1854.

An all-male group of German Moravian missionaries arrived in 1843. When a group of women were sent out to join them three years later, several marriages ensued; a few members of the present-day population can trace their ancestry back to those missionary families.
In 1865, the Māori leader Te Kooti was exiled on the Chatham Islands along with a large group of Māori rebels called the Hauhau, followers of Pai Mārire who had murdered missionaries and fought against government forces mainly on the East Coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The rebel prisoners were paid one shilling a day to work on sheep farms owned by the few European settlers. Sometimes they worked on road and track improvements. They were initially guarded by 26 guards, half of whom were Māori. They lived in &quot;whare&quot; along with their families. The prisoners helped build a redoubt of stone surrounded by a ditch and wall. Later, they built three stone prison cells. In 1868 Te Kooti and the other prisoners commandeered a schooner and escaped back to the North Island.

Almost all the Māori returned to Taranaki in the 1860s, some after a tsunami in 1868.

=== 1880s to today ===
The economy of the Chatham Islands, then dominated by the export of wool, suffered under the international depression of the 1880s, only rebounding with the building of fish freezing plants at the island villages of Ōwenga and Kaingaroa in 1910. Construction of the first wharf at Waitangi began in 1931 with completion in 1934. On 25 November 1940, during the Second World War, a German raider captured and then sank the Chatham Islands supply ship the &quot;Holmwood&quot;, so the wharf saw little use by ships. A flying-boat facility was built at Te Whanga Lagoon soon after and a flying boat service continued till 1966 when it was replaced with conventional aircraft.

After the Second World War, the island economy suffered again from its isolation and government subsidies became necessary. This led to many young Chatham Islanders leaving for the mainland. There was a brief crayfish boom, which helped stabilize the economy in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From the early 2000s cattle became a major component of the local economy.

==== Moriori community ====
The Moriori community is organised as the Hokotehi Moriori Trust. The Moriori have received recognition from the Crown and the New Zealand government and some of their claims against those institutions for the generations of neglect and oppression have been accepted and acted on. Moriori are recognised as the original people of Rekohu. The Crown also recognised the Ngāti Mutunga Māori as having indigenous status in the Chathams by right of around 160 years of occupation.

The population of the islands is around 600, including members of both ethnic groups. In January 2005, the Moriori celebrated the opening of the new Kopinga Marae (meeting house).

Modern descendants of the 1835 Māori conquerors claimed a share in ancestral Māori fishing rights. This claim was granted. Now that the primordial population, the Moriori, have been recognised to be former Māori—over the objections of some of the Ngāti Mutunga—they too share in the ancestral Māori fishing rights. Both groups have been granted fishing quotas.

==Population==

Chatham Islands covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Chatham and Pitt Islands are inhabited and had a population of 612 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 51 people (−7.7%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 12 people (2.0%) since the 2013 census. There were 390 dwellings. The median age was 44.0 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 99 people (16.2%) aged under 15 years, 96 (15.7%) aged 15 to 29, 318 (52.0%) aged 30 to 64, and 102 (16.7%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 72.5% European/Pākehā, 68.6% Māori, 3.9% Pasifika, 2.0% Asian, 1.0% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders, and 1.5% other. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The Chatham Islands had a population of 663 at the 2018 New Zealand census. There were 276 households, comprising 354 males and 312 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.13 males per female.

The percentage of people born overseas was 5.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 48.4% had no religion, 33.5% were Christian, 5.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 51 (9.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 147 (26.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $36,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 108 people (19.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 318 (57.6%) people were employed full-time, 108 (19.6%) were part-time, and 9 (1.6%) were unemployed.

Most residents live on Chatham Island, with only a few dozen on Pitt Island. The main settlement is the town of Waitangi, centrally located on the west coast, with residents as of Its facilities include a hospital with resident doctor, bank, several stores, engineering and marine services, and the main shipping wharf. Other villages include Te One, near Waitangi, Owenga in the south-east, Kaingaroa in the north-east, and Port Hutt in the north-west.

==Government==
===Local government===

For local government purposes, the Chatham Islands and the adjoining sea is known as the Chatham Islands Territory and is administered by the Chatham Islands Council, which was established by the Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 (Statute No 041, Commenced: 1 November 1995). These succeeded, respectively, the Chatham Islands County, which was established in 1901, and the Chatham Islands County Council, which was established in 1926. The Council is a territorial authority that has many of the functions, duties and powers of a district council and of a regional council, making it in effect a unitary authority with slightly fewer responsibilities than other unitary authorities. The Council comprises a directly-elected mayor and eight councillors, one of whom is also deputy mayor. Certain regional council functions are being administered by Environment Canterbury, the Canterbury Regional Council.

In the 2010 local government elections, Chatham Islands had New Zealand&#x27;s highest rate of returned votes, with 71.3 per cent voting.

===Parliamentary electorates===
The Chatham Islands are within a single electorate which sends one member to Parliament. Until the 1990s, the Chatham Islands were in the Lyttelton electorate, but since then they have formed part of the Rongotai general electorate, which otherwise lies in south Wellington. Julie Anne Genter is the MP for Rongotai. The Te Tai Tonga Māori electorate (currently held by Tākuta Ferris) includes the Chatham Islands; before the seats were reformed in 1996 the archipelago was part of Western Maori.

===State services===
Policing is carried out by a sole-charge constable appointed by the Wellington police district, who has often doubled as an official for many government departments, including court registrar (Department for Courts), customs officer (New Zealand Customs Service) and immigration officer (Department of Labour – New Zealand Immigration Service).

A District Court judge sent from either the North Island or the South Island presides over court sittings, but urgent sittings may take place at the Wellington District Court.

Because of the isolation and small population, some of the rules governing daily activities undergo a certain relaxation. For example, every transport service operated solely on Great Barrier Island, the Chatham Islands or Stewart Island / Rakiura need not comply with section 70C of the Transport Act 1962 (the requirements for drivers to maintain driving-hours logbooks). Drivers subject to section 70B must nevertheless keep record of their driving hours in some form.

The Canterbury District Health Board is responsible for providing publicly funded health services for the island. Prior to July 2015, this was the responsibility of the Hawke&#x27;s Bay District Health Board.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Most of the Chatham Island economy is based on fishing and crayfishing, with only a fragment of the economic activity in adventure tourism. This economic mix has been stable for the past 50 years, as little infrastructure or population is present to engage in higher levels of industrial or telecommunications activity.

Two 225 kW wind turbines and diesel generators provide power on Chatham Island, at costs of five to ten times that of electricity on the main islands of New Zealand. During 2014, 65% of the electricity was generated from diesel generators, the balance from wind. For heating, electricity comes second to wood and, in 2013, solar power contributed about a third as much as mains-generated electricity.

===Transport===
Visitors to the Chathams usually arrive by air from Auckland, Christchurch or Wellington (around two hours from Christchurch on an ATR 72–500) to Tuuta Airport on Chatham Island. While freight generally arrives by ship (two days sailing time), the sea journey takes too long for many passengers, and is not always available.

Tasman Empire Airways Ltd (TEAL) initially serviced the Chathams by air using flying boats. With the withdrawal of TEAL, the RNZAF maintained an infrequent service with Short Sunderland flying boats. NZ4111 was damaged on takeoff from Te Whanga Lagoon on 4 November 1959 and remains as a wreck on the island. The last flight by RNZAF flying boats was on 22 March 1967. For many years Bristol Freighter aircraft served the islands, a slow and noisy freight aircraft converted for carrying passengers by installing a removable passenger compartment equipped with airline seats and a toilet in part of the cargo hold. The air service primarily served to ship out high-value export crayfish products.

The grass landing field at Hapupu, at the northern end of the Island, proved a limiting factor, as few aircraft apart from the Bristol Freighter had both the range to fly to the islands and the ruggedness to land on the grass airstrip. Although other aircraft did use the landing field occasionally, they would often require repairs to fix damage resulting from the rough landing. Hapupu is also the site of the Hāpūpū / J M Barker Historic Reserve (one of only two national historic reserves in New Zealand), where there are momori rakau (Moriori tree carvings).

In 1981, after many years of requests by locals and the imminent demise of the ageing Bristol Freighters, the construction of a sealed runway at Karewa, Tuuta Airport, allowed more modern aircraft to land safely. The Chathams&#x27; own airline, Air Chathams, with its head office in Te One, now operates services to Auckland on Thursdays, Wellington on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and Christchurch on Tuesdays. The timetable varies seasonally, but generally planes depart the Chathams around 10.30 am (Chathams Time) and arrive in the mainland around noon. There they refuel and reload, and depart again at around 1 pm back to the Chathams. Air Chathams operates twin turboprop ATR 72–500 aircraft (freight and passenger) and Fairchild Metroliners.

The ship &quot;Rangatira&quot; provided a freight service from Timaru to the Chatham Islands from March 2000 to August 2015. The MV &quot;Southern Tiare&quot; provides a freight service between Napier, Timaru and the Chathams.

There is a small section of tar sealed road between Waitangi and Te One, but the majority of the islands&#x27; roads are gravel.

=== Telecommunications ===
A 1.5 kW wireless link opened in 1913, a public radio link to the mainland was built in 1953 and an island phone system in 1965. In 2003 a digital microwave system was installed for 110 phones in Ōwenga.

The islands were linked as part of the Rural Broadband Initiative in 2014, when satellite bandwidth was increased, and broadband is now provided by Wireless Nation, though Farmside provide some coverage.

As late as 2019 there was no mobile phone coverage on the islands, however in December 2021, five 4G cellular towers were turned on to enable mobile phone coverage on Chatham and Pitt Island and deliver faster broadband. The main tower is positioned on Target Hill, which transmits to the other four towers through a microwave radio link; it is backhauled by Eutelsat 172B to a network in Wellington. The upgraded network delivers greater bandwidth than the previous link, and provides reliable broadband.

==Education==
There are three schools on the Chathams, at Kaingaroa, Te One, and Pitt Island. Pitt Island and Kaingaroa are staffed by sole charge principals, while Te One has three teachers and a principal. The schools cater for children from year 1 to 8. There is no secondary school. The majority of secondary school-aged students leave the island for boarding schools in mainland New Zealand. A small number remain on the island and obtain their secondary education by correspondence.

<text>Crater Lake National Park is a national park of the United States located in southern Oregon. Established in 1902, Crater Lake is the fifth-oldest national park in the United States and the only national park in Oregon. The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of Mount Mazama, a destroyed volcano, and the surrounding hills and forests.

The lake is deep at its deepest point, which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second-deepest in North America and the tenth-deepest in the world. Crater Lake is often referred to as the seventh-deepest lake in the world, but this former listing excludes the approximately depth of subglacial Lake Vostok in Antarctica, which resides under nearly of ice, and the recent report of a maximum depth for Lake O&#x27;Higgins/San Martin, located on the border of Chile and Argentina. However, when comparing its average depth of to the average depth of other deep lakes, Crater Lake becomes the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and the third-deepest in the world. The impressive average depth of this volcanic lake is due to the nearly symmetrical caldera formed 7,700 years ago during the violent climactic eruptions and subsequent collapse of Mount Mazama and the relatively moist climate that is typical of the crest of the Cascade Range.

The caldera rim ranges in elevation from . The United States Geological Survey benchmark elevation of the lake surface is . The national park encompasses . Crater Lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. All water that enters the lake is eventually lost from evaporation or subsurface seepage. The lake&#x27;s water commonly has a striking blue hue, and the lake is refilled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.

==Park purpose==
As stated in the foundation document:
==Geology==
Volcanic activity in this area is fed by subduction off the coast of Oregon as the Juan de Fuca Plate slips below the North American Plate (see plate tectonics). Heat and compression generated by this movement has created a mountain chain topped by a series of volcanoes, which together are called the Cascade Range. The large volcanoes in the range are called the High Cascades. However, there are many other volcanoes in the range as well, most of which are much smaller.

About 400,000 years ago, Mount Mazama began its existence in much the same way as the other mountains of the High Cascades, as overlapping shield volcanoes. Over time, alternating layers of lava flows and pyroclastic flows built Mazama&#x27;s overlapping cones until it reached about in height.
As the young stratovolcano grew, many smaller volcanoes and volcanic vents were built in the area of the park and just outside what are now the park&#x27;s borders. Chief among these were cinder cones. Although the early examples are gone—cinder cones erode easily—there are at least 13 much younger cinder cones in the park, and at least another 11 or so outside its borders, that still retain their distinctive cinder cone appearance. There continues to be debate as to whether these minor volcanoes and vents were parasitic to Mazama&#x27;s magma chamber and system or if they were related to background Oregon Cascade volcanism.

After a period of dormancy, Mazama became active again. Then, around 5700 BC, Mazama collapsed into itself during a tremendous volcanic eruption, losing in height. The eruption formed a large caldera that, depending on the prevailing climate, was filled in about 740 years, forming a beautiful lake with a deep blue hue, known today as Crater Lake.

The eruptive period that decapitated Mazama also laid waste to much of the greater Crater Lake area and deposited ash as far east as the northwest corner of what is now Yellowstone National Park, as far south as central Nevada, and as far north as southern British Columbia. It produced more than 150 times as much ash as the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

This ash has since developed a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or loamy sands which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.

== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Crater Lake National Park has a dry-summer subarctic climate (&quot;Dsc&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at the lake is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of .

Snow is relatively rare at low elevations in western Oregon, but it is common at higher elevations, especially at Crater Lake. Measurements at park headquarters, above sea level, show that snow falls more often here than at any other long-term weather station in Oregon. Winter, which typically begins at the park in September and runs through June, includes an average of 101 days with measurable snowfall. Up to of snow have fallen on the park in a single day (in 1937, 1951, and 1971), in a month (January 1950), and in a year (1950).

Snow typically accumulates in the park to depths of by early spring. Most of the park&#x27;s roads remain closed through late spring, and snow lingers into the summer. In July and August, snowfall is uncommon, and &quot;one magnificent day typically follows another&quot;.

December is the coldest month, when highs average about and lows average about . August is the warmest month, with an average high of roughly and an average low of about . The highest recorded temperature was and the lowest was . Annual precipitation averages about a year. December is the wettest, averaging about .

Although snow covers Crater Lake National Park for eight months of the year (average annual snowfall is ), the lake rarely freezes over due, in part, to a relatively mild onshore flow from the Pacific Ocean. The last recorded year in which the lake froze over was in 1949, a very long, cold winter. A 95% surface freeze occurred in 1985. The immense depth of Crater Lake acts as a heat reservoir that absorbs and traps sunlight, maintaining the lake temperature at an average of on the surface and at the bottom throughout the year. The surface temperature fluctuates a bit, but the bottom temperature remains quite constant.

==Fauna==
Mammals that are residents of this national park are Canadian lynxes, bobcats, beavers, chipmunks, pronghorns, foxes, squirrels, porcupines, black bears, coyotes, pika, badgers, deer, elk, muskrats, and martens. Birds that commonly fly through this park including raptors are American dippers, Peregrine falcons, ravens, Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers, Canada jays, bald eagles, hummingbirds and spotted owls while Canada geese float on its lake.

==Park features==
* The Pumice Desert: A very thick layer of pumice and ash leading away from Mazama in a northerly direction. Even after thousands of years, this area is largely devoid of plants due to excessive porosity (meaning water drains through quickly) and poor soil composed primarily of regolith.
* The Pinnacles: When the very hot ash and pumice came to rest near the volcano, it formed gas-charged deposits. For perhaps years afterward, hot gas moved to the surface and slowly cemented ash and pumice together in channels and escaped through fumaroles. Erosion later removed most of the surrounding loose ash and pumice, leaving tall pinnacles and spires.

* Mount Scott is a steep andesitic cone whose lava came from magma from Mazama&#x27;s magma chamber; geologists call such volcano a parasitic or satellite cone. Volcanic eruptions apparently ceased on Scott sometime before the end of the Pleistocene; one remaining large cirque on Scott&#x27;s northwest side was left unmodified by post-ice-age volcanism.
* In the southwest corner of the park stands Union Peak, an extinct volcano whose primary remains consist of a large volcanic plug, which is lava that solidified in the volcano&#x27;s neck.
* Crater Peak is a shield volcano primarily made of andesite and basalt lava flows topped by andesitic and dacite tephra.
* Timber Crater is a shield volcano located in the northeast corner of the park. Like Crater Peak, it is made of basaltic and andesitic lava flows but, unlike Crater, it is topped by two cinder cones.
* Rim Drive is the most popular road in the park; it follows a scenic route around the caldera rim.
* Llao Rock on the north side rises above the lake, with a trail from Rim Drive leading to the summit.
* The Pacific Crest Trail, a long-distance hiking and equestrian trail that stretches from the Mexican to Canadian borders, passes through the park.
* Old-growth forests covering .

==History==

Local Native Americans witnessed the collapse of Mount Mazama and kept the event alive in their legends. One ancient legend of the Klamath people closely parallels the geologic story which emerges from today&#x27;s scientific research. The legend tells of two Chiefs, Llao of the Below World and Skell of the Above World, pitted in a battle which ended up in the destruction of Llao&#x27;s home, Mt. Mazama. The battle was witnessed in the eruption of Mt. Mazama and the creation of Crater Lake.

A trio of gold prospectors—John Wesley Hillman, Henry Klippel, and Isaac Skeeters—were the first American prospectors to visit the lake. On June 12, 1853, they stumbled upon the long, sloping mountain while hunting for provisions. Stunned by the vibrant blue color of the lake, they named the indigo body of water &quot;Deep Blue Lake&quot; and the place on the southwest side of the rim where he first saw the lake later became known as Discovery Point. But gold was more on the minds of settlers at the time and the discovery was soon forgotten. The suggested name later fell out of favor by locals, who preferred the name &quot;Crater Lake.&quot;

William Gladstone Steel devoted his life and fortune to the establishment and management of a national park at Crater Lake. His preoccupation with the lake began in 1870. In his efforts to bring recognition to the park, he participated in lake surveys that provided scientific support. He named many of the lake&#x27;s landmarks, including Wizard Island, Llao Rock, and Skell Head.

With the help of geologist Clarence Dutton, Steel organized a USGS expedition to study the lake in 1886. The party carried the &quot;Cleetwood&quot;, a half-ton survey boat, up the steep slopes of the mountain then lowered it to the lake. From the stern of the &quot;Cleetwood&quot;, a piece of pipe on the end of a spool of piano wire sounded the depth of the lake at 168 different points. Their deepest sounding, , was very close to the modern official depth of made in 2000 by sonar. At the same time, a topographer surveyed the area and created the first professional map of the Crater Lake area.
Partly based on data from the expedition and lobbying from Steel and others, Crater Lake National Park was established May 22, 1902, by President Theodore Roosevelt. And because of Steel&#x27;s involvement, Crater Lake Lodge was opened in 1915 and the Rim Drive was completed in 1918.

Highways were later built to the park to help facilitate tourism. The 1929 edition of &quot;O Ranger!&quot; described access and facilities available by then:
Crater Lake National Park is reached by train on the Southern Pacific Railroad lines into Medford and Klamath Falls, at which stops motor stages make the short trip to the park. A hotel on the rim of the lake offers accommodations. For the motorist, the visit to the park is a short side trip from the Pacific and Dalles-California highways. He will find, in addition to the hotel, campsites, stores, filling stations. The park is open to travel from late June or July 1 for as long as snow does not block the roads, generally until October.

The lake is described in the poetry of Joaquin Miller.

==Activities==

There are many hiking trails and several campgrounds inside the park. Unlicensed fishing is allowed without any limitation of size, species, or number. The lake is believed to have no indigenous fish, but several species of fish were introduced beginning in 1888 until all fish stocking ended in 1941. Kokanee salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus nerka&quot;) and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) now thrive and reproduce here naturally.
Swimming is allowed in the lake, and the boat tours, which stop at Wizard Island, a cinder cone inside the lake, operate daily during the summer. All lake access for people is from Cleetwood Trail, a steep walking trail, and there are no roads for cars, trucks, or wagons that lead to the waterfront. All of the boats in the lake were delivered by helicopter.

Numerous observation points along the caldera rim for the lake are readily accessible by automobile via the Rim Drive, which is long and has an elevation gain of .

The highest point in Crater Lake National Park is Mount Scott at . Getting there requires a fairly steep hike from the Rim Drive trailhead. On a clear day, visibility from the summit exceeds , and one can, in a single view, take in the entire caldera. Also visible from this point are the white-peaked Cascade Range volcanoes to the north, the Columbia River Plateau to the east, and the Western Cascades and the more-distant Klamath Mountains to the west.

The scenery of Crater Lake is fully accessible during the summer months. Heavy snowfalls in this park during the fall, winter, and spring months force many road and trail closures, including the popular Rim Drive, which is generally completely open from July to October and partially open in some other months, such as May, June, and November.

== Trails ==

=== Cleetwood Cove ===
The Cleetwood Cove trail originates on the north side of the lake about east of North Junction along East Rim Drive. The trail is the only one that accesses the shoreline of the lake, descending from the Cleetwood Cove parking lot. First opened during the summer of 1960, the trail is long with an 11% grade that rates it as a strenuous route on the return trip. Due to its steep grade, the trail is not accessible for mobility-impaired visitors. A dock with concessionaire boats facilitates tours around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island for dropping off and picking up passengers. Swimming and fishing are permitted. Snow may cover the trail from October to July with some variance depending on yearly snowfall conditions.

=== The Watchman ===
The Watchman Peak trail begins from the Watchman Overlook parking lot, about northwest of Rim Village. The trail is long with a elevation change. It is a steady uphill trail on an isolated mountain on the west rim of the crater, with several switchbacks, providing wide views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island. Several nearby landmarks are visible from the summit, including Mount McLoughlin, Mount Thielsen, Union Peak, Mount Scott and the Klamath Basin. The trail ends next to a historic fire lookout tower built in 1932.

=== Lightning Spring ===
The Lightning Spring trail starts from the Lightning Spring picnic area. It is a hike with an elevation gain of . The trail circles around several meadows up to the Lightning Spring creek. The trail is known for the frequent sight of grazing deer.

=== Castle Crest Wildflower Garden ===
This is considered to be the easiest trail, looping around the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden. It starts from the East Rim Road, near the park&#x27;s headquarters. It received its name because of a large stretch of meadows around which the trail circles and which is bursting with wildflowers in the springtime. The trail is about before it reaches the wildflower meadow garden, from which other improvised routes depart.

=== Plaikni Falls ===
The Plaikni Falls trail is the newest trail in the Crater Lake park. It stretches from the trailhead located south from the Phantom Ship Overlook on Pinnacles Road, which spins off Rim Drive. The trail leads to Plaikni Falls. Most of the trail is wheelchair-accessible. The final stretch is fairly uphill, which may prove moderately challenging.

=== Garfield Peak ===

The Garfield Peak trail is a moderately challenging hike to Garfield Peak. The trailhead is located east of the Crater Lake Lodge and gains approximately of elevation. Several spots along the trail provide viewpoints overlooking the Phantom Ship island and Dutton Cliff. A few viewpoints offer unique views of Wizard island. The trail is popular in the late afternoon on account of unique shifting colors over the lake and its surroundings.

<text>The Aichi D3A (Navy designation &quot;Type 99 Carrier Bomber&quot;; Allied reporting name &quot;Val&quot;) is a World War II carrier-borne dive bomber. It was the primary dive bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and was involved in almost all IJN actions, including the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The Aichi D3A was the first Japanese aircraft to bomb American targets in the war, commencing with Pearl Harbor and U.S. bases in the Philippines, such as Clark Air Force Base. They sank more Allied warships than any other Axis aircraft.

==Design and development==
In mid-1936, the Japanese Navy issued the 11-Shi specification for a monoplane carrier-based dive bomber to replace the existing D1A biplane then in service. Aichi, Nakajima, and Mitsubishi all submitted designs, with the former two subsequently being asked for two prototypes each.

The Aichi design started with low-mounted elliptical wings inspired by the Heinkel He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot;. It flew slowly enough that the drag from the landing gear was not a serious issue, so the fixed gear was used for simplicity. The aircraft was to be powered by the Nakajima Hikari 1 nine-cylinder radial engine.

The first prototype was completed in December 1937, and flight trials began a month later, after which it was designated as D3A1. Initial tests were disappointing. The aircraft was underpowered and suffered from directional instability in wide turns, and in tighter turns it tended to snap roll. The dive brakes vibrated heavily when extended at their design speed of , and the Navy was already asking for a faster diving speed of 

The second aircraft was extensively modified before delivery to try to address the problems. Power was increased by replacing the Hikari with the Mitsubishi Kinsei 3 in a redesigned cowling, and the vertical tail was enlarged to help with the directional instability. The wings were slightly larger in span and the outer sections of the leading edges had wash-out to combat the snap rolls, and strengthened dive brakes were fitted. These changes cured all of the problems except the directional instability, and it was enough for the D3A1 to win over the Nakajima D3N1.

In December 1939, the Navy ordered the aircraft as the Navy Type 99 Carrier Bomber Model 11 (&quot;kanjō bakugekiki&quot;, usually abbreviated to 艦爆 &quot;&quot;.). The production models featured slightly smaller wings and increased power in the form of the Kinsei 43 or Kinsei 44. The directional instability problem was finally cured with the fitting of a long dorsal fin-strake which started midway down the rear fuselage, and the aircraft actually became highly maneuverable.

In June 1942, an improved version of D3A1, powered by a Kinsei 54, was tested and designated as D3A2 or the Model 12. The extra power reduced range, so the design was further modified with additional fuel tanks to bring the total tankage to , giving it the range needed to fight effectively over the Solomon Islands. Known to the Navy as the Model 22, it began to replace the Model 11 in front-line units in the autumn of 1942, and most Model 11s were then sent to training units. While some late production models of D3A1 were fitted with a propeller spinner, it became a standard with D3A2.

==Equipment==
The pilot position was equipped with a Type 95 telescopic gunsight in the earlier models and a Type 99 in the later models, which were used for aiming the bomb during the dive. The observer/navigator position was equipped with a Type 97 Mk1 drift sight, which was a long vertical tube located in the front-left of the observer&#x27;s seat. In addition, the observer position was equipped with a drift meter that was mounted on the floor in the front-right of the observer&#x27;s seat. The observer also operated a Type 96 Mk2 radio set that was mounted in front of the observer&#x27;s seat and behind the pilot&#x27;s seat. On top of the radio set was a Type 3 reflector compass for precise navigation.

Armament was two fixed forward-firing Type 97 machine guns, and one flexible 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 92 machine gun at the rear end of cockpit, which was operated by the observer. Normal bomb load was a single 250 kg bomb (e.g., Type 99 No 25 semi-AP or Type 98 No 25 land bomb) carried under the fuselage, swung out under the propeller on release by a trapeze. Two additional 60 kg bombs (e.g., Type 99 No 6 semi-AP or Type 2 No 6 land bomb) could be carried on wing racks located under each wing outboard of the dive brakes.

Initially, D3A dive bombers were painted in silver. During the summer of 1941, the paint finish changed to light olive grey. The color changed again in early 1942 to dark green.

==Operational history==
An individual D3A dive bomber was commanded by the senior ranking crew member aboard, which could be the observer rather than the pilot. This was in contrast to US Navy, where the pilot was almost always the commander of a dive bomber. For example, Petty Officer First Class Kiyoto Furuta was serving as a pilot to Lieutenant Takehiko Chihaya during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and later on to Lieutenant Keiichi Arima during the two carrier battles of the Solomon Islands campaign, both of whom were observers.

The D3A1 first saw combat operation in November 1939, one month prior to its official acceptance as the Navy Type 99 dive bomber. Nakajima sent several examples to the 14th Air group operating at Haikou on Hainan island in South China. These D3A1s were commanded by Lieutenant Sadamu Takahashi and supported the Imperial Japanese Army in the capture of Nanning, which was intended to cut the supplies coming from French Indochina. After the capture of Nanning, they continued to be operated in the area in 1940. In May 1940, 12th Air Group became the second front-line unit to be equipped with the new D3A1 dive bombers. They first participated in the capture of Yichang and conducted anti-shipping operations on Yangtze river, west of Yichang, in order to cut the Chinese supplies coming from Chongqing. In September, D3A1 from the 12th Air Group started to fly missions against Chongqing, which was the Chinese capital at the time. After the invasion of Indochina in autumn 1940, 14th Air Group operated at Hanoi and flew missions against Kunming and Burma Road.

The D3A1 commenced carrier qualification trials aboard the aircraft carriers and during 1940, while a small number of aircraft made their combat debut from land bases over China. Starting with the attack on Pearl Harbor, the D3A1 took part in all major Japanese carrier operations in the first 10 months of the war. They achieved their first major success against the Royal Navy during their Indian Ocean raid in April 1942. D3A1 dive bombers scored over 80% hits with their bombs during attacks on two heavy cruisers and an aircraft carrier during the operation.

Before the Indian Ocean raid, the established doctrine regarding attacks against ships was to arm all D3A1 dive bombers with semi-AP bombs. On 5 April 1942, an IJN carrier force attacked Colombo on Ceylon with half of its complement, while the other half was kept in reserve for strikes against ships. Since a second strike against Colombo was deemed necessary, the dive bombers of the reserve force were rearmed from semi-AP bombs to land bombs. When British heavy cruisers were spotted soon afterwards, the reserve force was sent with a portion of D3A1 dive bombers armed with land bombs. In the subsequent attack, land bombs unintentionally proved very effective in suppressing the anti-aircraft fire from the ships. As a result, the doctrine was modified in order to intentionally equip the first few D3A1 dive bombers with land bombs. This new method was already implemented for the attack that sank just four days later, and continued to be used from then on.

During 1942, dive bombing attacks by carrier-based D3A1 and D3A2 bombers significantly contributed to sinking of three US fleet carriers: &quot;Lexington&quot; at the Battle of the Coral Sea, &quot;Yorktown&quot; at the Battle of Midway and &quot;Hornet&quot; at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. In addition, they damaged the carrier &quot;Enterprise&quot; both at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Besides carrier-based units, D3A dive bombers also operated from land bases during the Solomon Islands campaign, where they participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign, Operation I-Go, Operation SE and Operation RO, and during the New Guinea campaign, where they participated in the Battle of Milne Bay and Battle of Buna–Gona. The main land-based unit to operate D3A dive bombers during these campaigns and battles was the 2nd/582nd Air Group.

During the course of the war, D3A dive bombers often combined their attacks upon enemy warships with the IJN Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bomber; consequently enemy vessels were often sunk by a combination strike of bombs and torpedoes. However, there were occasions when just the D3A&#x27;s would make the attacks, or at least score the sinking hits. Discounting the Pearl Harbor strike, which also used the B5N for level bombing and torpedo attacks, D3A dive bombers were credited with sinking the following Allied warships (partial list):
* , American destroyer, 19 February 1942 – Australia (Darwin)
* , American destroyer, 1 March 1942 – Java Sea
* , American destroyer, 1 March 1942- Indian Ocean

* , American destroyer, 7 May 1942 – Pacific Ocean
* , American destroyer, 1 February 1943 – Pacific Ocean (Ironbottom Sound)
* , American destroyer, 7 April 1943 – Pacific Ocean (Ironbottom Sound)
* , American oiler, 8 April 1943 – Pacific Ocean (Tulagi, Solomon Islands)
* , American destroyer, 26 December 1943 – Pacific Ocean
* , American destroyer, sunk by kamikaze 1 November 1944 – Pacific Ocean
* , American destroyer, sunk by kamikaze 10 June 1945 – Japan (Okinawa)

As the war progressed, there were instances when the dive bombers were pressed into duty as fighters in the interceptor role, their maneuverability being enough to allow them to survive in this role. When the Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; became available, the D3A2s ended up with land-based units or operating from the smaller carriers, which were too small to handle the fast-landing &quot;Suisei&quot;. When American forces recaptured the Philippines in 1944, land-based D3A2s took part in the fighting but were hopelessly outdated and losses were heavy. By then, many D3A1s and D3A2s were operated by training units in Japan, and several were modified with dual controls as Navy Type 99 Bomber Trainer Model 12s (D3A2-K). During the last year of the war, the D3A2s were pressed back into combat for &quot;kamikaze&quot; missions.

<doc id="176558" wikidata="Q157217" url="?curid=176558" title="House of Hanover">
<text>The House of Hanover ( ) is a European royal house with roots tracing back to the 17th century. Its members, known as Hanoverians, ruled Hanover, Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Empire at various times during the 17th to 20th centuries. Originating as a cadet branch of the House of Welf (also &quot;Guelf&quot; or &quot;Guelph&quot;) in 1635, also known then as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Hanoverians ascended to prominence with Hanover&#x27;s elevation to an Electorate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. In 1714 George I, prince-elector of Hanover and a descendant of King James VI and I, assumed the throne of Great Britain and Ireland, marking the beginning of Hanoverian rule over the British Empire. At the end of this line, Queen Victoria&#x27;s death in 1901, the throne of the United Kingdom passed to her eldest son Edward VII, a member of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, through his father Albert, Prince Consort. The last reigning members of the House of Hanover lost the Duchy of Brunswick in 1918 when Germany became a republic and abolished royalty and nobility. 

The formal name of the house was the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Hanover line. The senior line of Brunswick-Lüneburg, which ruled Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, became extinct in 1884. The House of Hanover is now the only surviving branch of the House of Welf, which is the senior branch of the House of Este. The current head of the House of Hanover is Ernst August, Prince of Hanover.

==History==
===Dukes and Electors of Brunswick-Lüneburg===
George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg was the first member of the House of Hanover. When the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg was divided in 1635, George inherited the Principality of Calenberg and moved his residence to Hanover. His son, Christian Louis, inherited the Principality of Lüneburg from George&#x27;s brother. Calenberg and Lüneburg were then shared between George&#x27;s sons until united in 1705 under his grandson, also called George, who subsequently became George I of Great Britain. All members held the title of &quot;Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg&quot;.
* George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, first member of the House of Hanover.
* Christian Louis, 1st son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1641–1648) and Prince of Lüneburg (1648–1665). He relinquished Calenburg when he became Prince of Lüneburg.
* George William, 2nd son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1648–1665) and Prince of Lüneburg (1665–1705). He relinquished Calenburg when he became Prince of Lüneburg on the death of his brother, Christian Louis.
* John Frederick, 3rd son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1665–1679).
* Ernest Augustus, 4th son of Duke George, Prince of Calenberg (1679–1698). He became Prince of Calenberg on the death of his brother John Frederick. He was elevated to prince-elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. Ernest Augustus&#x27;s wife, Sophia of the Palatinate, was declared heiress of the throne of England by the Act of Settlement of 1701, which decreed Roman Catholics could not accede to the throne. Sophia was at that time the senior eligible Protestant descendant of James I of England.
* George Louis, son of Duke Ernest Augustus and Sophia, became Elector and Prince of Calenberg in 1698 and Prince of Lüneburg when his uncle George William died in 1705. He inherited his mother&#x27;s claim to the throne of Great Britain when she died in 1714.

=== Monarchs of Great Britain, Ireland, and Hanover ===

George Louis became the first British monarch of the House of Hanover as George I in 1714. The dynasty provided six British monarchs:

&quot;Of the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; (changed in 1801 to &quot;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;):
# George I ( 1714–1727) (Georg Ludwig = George Louis)
# George II ( 1727–1760) (Georg August = George Augustus)
# George III ( 1760–1820)
# George IV ( 1820–1830)
# William IV ( 1830–1837)
# Victoria ( 1837–1901).

George I, George II, and George III also served as electors and dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, informally, Electors of Hanover (cf. &quot;personal union&quot;). They served as dual monarchs of Britain and Hanover, maintaining control of the Hanoverian Army and foreign policy. From 1814, when Hanover became a kingdom following the Napoleonic Wars, the British monarch was also King of Hanover.

Upon the death of William IV in 1837, the personal union of the thrones of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended. Succession to the Hanoverian throne was regulated by semi-Salic law (agnatic-cognatic), which gave priority to all male lines before female lines, and so it passed not to Queen Victoria but to her uncle, the Duke of Cumberland. In 1901, when Queen Victoria, the last British monarch provided by the House of Hanover, died, her son and heir Edward VII became the first British monarch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Edward took his family name from that of his father, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

===After end of personal union===
After the death of William IV in 1837, the following kings of Hanover continued the dynasty:

* Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover (r. 1837–1851)
* George V (r. 1851–1866, deposed)

The Kingdom of Hanover ended in 1866, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and the King of Hanover (and Duke of Cumberland) was forced to go into exile in Austria. The 1866 rift between the houses of Hanover and Hohenzollern was settled by the 1913 marriage of Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia to Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, the last king&#x27;s grandson.

=== Prince-bishops of Osnabrück ===
At the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Peace of Westphalia (1648) awarded the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück alternately to a Catholic bishop and to a cadet branch of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Since the treaty gave cadets priority over heirs and reigning princes, Osnabrück became a form of appanage (in alternation) of the House of Hanover.

* Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg (r. 1662–1698), fourth son of George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg
* Ernest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (r. 1715–1728), sixth son of Ernest Augustus, Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg
* Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (r. 1764–1802), second son of George III

Osnabrück was mediatized to Hanover in 1803.

=== Dukes of Brunswick ===

In 1884, the senior branch of the House of Welf became extinct. By semi-Salic law, the House of Hanover would have acceded to the Duchy of Brunswick, but there had been strong Prussian pressure against having George V of Hanover or his son, the Duke of Cumberland, succeed to a member state of the German Empire, at least without strong conditions including the swearing to the German constitution. By a law of 1879, the Duchy of Brunswick established a temporary council of regency to take over at the Duke&#x27;s death and, if necessary, to appoint a regent.

The Duke of Cumberland proclaimed himself Duke of Brunswick at the Duke&#x27;s death, and lengthy negotiations ensued but were never resolved. Prince Albert of Prussia was appointed regent. After his death in 1906, Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg succeeded him. The Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s eldest son died in a car accident in 1912; the father renounced Brunswick in favour of his younger son Ernest Augustus, who married the Kaiser&#x27;s daughter Victoria Louise the same year, swore allegiance to the German Empire and was allowed to ascend the throne of the Duchy in November 1913. He was a major-general during the First World War, but he was overthrown as Duke of Brunswick in 1918. His father was also deprived of his British titles in 1919 for &quot;bearing arms against Great Britain&quot;.

After having left Brunswick Palace, the duke and his family moved back to their exile seat Cumberland Castle at Gmunden, Austria, but in 1924 he received Blankenburg Castle and some other estates in a settlement with the Free State of Brunswick, and moved there in 1930. A few days before Blankenburg was handed over to the Red Army by British and American forces in late 1945, to become part of East Germany, the family quickly moved to Marienburg Castle (Hanover) with all their furniture, transported by British army trucks by the order of King George VI. Duke Ernest Augustus died at Marienburg Castle in 1953. His Herrenhausen Palace in Hanover had been completely destroyed during World War II. His eldest son, Prince Ernest Augustus, sold his remaining property at Herrenhausen Gardens in 1961 but kept the nearby Princely House, a small palace built in 1720 by George I for his daughter Anna Louise. It is now his grandson Ernest Augustus&#x27;s private home.

=== Claimants ===

The later heads of the House of Hanover have been:
* George V (1866–1878)
* Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale (1878–1923)
* Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick (1923–1953), son of the previous
* Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover (1953–1987)
* Ernest Augustus, Prince of Hanover (1987–present)
** Ernest Augustus, Hereditary Prince of Hanover (heir apparent)

The family has been resident in Austria since 1866 and thus took on Austrian nationality besides their German and British. Since the later king Ernest Augustus had been created Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh by his father George III in 1799, these British peerages were inherited by his descendants. In 1914 the title of a Prince of Great Britain and Ireland was additionally granted to the members of the house by King George V. These peerages and titles however were suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. However, the title &quot;Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; had been entered into the family&#x27;s German passports, together with the German titles, in 1914. After the German Revolution of 1918–19, with the abolishment of nobility&#x27;s privileges, titles officially became parts of the last name. So, curiously, the British prince&#x27;s title is still part of the family&#x27;s last name in their German passports, while it is no longer mentioned in their British documents.

On 29 August 1931, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick, as head of the House of Hanover, declared the formal resumption, for himself and his dynastic descendants, of use of his former British princely title as a secondary title of pretense, which style, &quot;Royal Prince of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;, his grandson, the current head of the house, also called Ernest Augustus, continues to claim. He has the right to petition under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917 for the restoration of his ancestors&#x27; suspended British peerages &quot;Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale&quot; and &quot;Earl of Armagh&quot;, but he has not done so. His father, another Ernest Augustus, did, however, successfully claim British nationality after World War II by virtue of a hitherto overlooked (and since repealed) provision of the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705. According to the decision taken by a court of the House of Lords, all family members bear the last name &quot;Guelph&quot; in the UK and are styled Royal Highnesses in their documents.

<doc id="176561" wikidata="Q154294" url="?curid=176561" title="Athina Onassis">
<text>Athina Hélène Onassis (; born Athina Hélène Roussel (), 29 January 1985) is a French-Greek heiress and equestrian, the only surviving descendant of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, and the only child of Aristotle&#x27;s daughter Christina Onassis.

She makes rare public appearances.

==Early life, family and education==
Onassis was born at American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, to Christina Onassis (1950–1988) and her fourth husband, Thierry Roussel, a French pharmaceutical heir. She was baptized on the island of Skorpios, owned by the Onassis family at the time. Her parents were married from 1984 to 1987. They divorced after Roussel had two children with his mistress, Swedish model Marianne &quot;Gaby&quot; Landhage. Christina Onassis died of pulmonary edema in November 1988, when Athina was three years old. After her mother&#x27;s death, she was raised by Roussel and Landhage, whom Roussel later married.

For her early education, Onassis attended a school in Lussy-sur-Morges, Switzerland, where the Roussels lived. Following a preparatory course in Brussels, Belgium, she passed her baccalauréat exam in the summer of 2003.

Onassis has three half-siblings via her father&#x27;s relationship with Landhage: Erik Christopher Roussel (born July 1985), Sandrine Roussel (born May 1987), and Johanna Roussel (born July 1991).

==Equestrian==

Onassis is a competitive show jumper in select events of the Global Champions Tour. She began riding as a child, and finished second in an event in Jerez, Spain in 2001. She later chose to compete as a Greek citizen for the Avlona Riding Club in Athens, under the name Athina Onassis. In November 2012, Onassis suffered a spinal injury in a fall from her horse, but represented Greece in the 2013 European Show Jumping Championships and the 2014 World Championships.

Onassis is a patroness of the Global Champions Tour. The &quot;Athina Onassis International Horse Show&quot;, a show jumping competition, was established in 2007 in São Paulo and moved to Rio de Janeiro in 2009. In 2014, the competition moved to Pampelonne beach in Saint-Tropez, France. Onassis and her former husband were joint owners of AD Sport Horses, a horse breeding and training business based in Fleurus, Belgium. In February 2014, Onassis paid $12 million for a estate and barn in Wellington, Florida. She sold the estate in April 2017 for $12.75 million.

==Personal life==
Onassis began dating Brazilian professional showjumper and two-time Olympic medalist Álvaro de Miranda Neto in March 2003 and moved to São Paulo. She bought a duplex overlooking Ibirapuera Park for $8.6 million.

Miranda and Onassis were married on 3 December 2005. Most guests attending the lavish ceremony were Brazilian VIPs or friends from the equestrian community. The bride&#x27;s father and stepmother were not present. The couple reportedly asked for their guests to donate to charity. Following her marriage, Onassis assumed the name of Athina Onassis.

In 2016, the couple legally separated, following Miranda&#x27;s alleged infidelity. Divorce negotiations began almost immediately, with Onassis hiring high-profile divorce lawyer Robert Stephan Cohen. The divorce caused complicated legal issues in the courts of Antwerp, Belgium, where Onassis had been living. Miranda challenged the prenuptial agreement and demanded alimony payments, and there were custody disputes over jointly owned horses. The divorce was settled in November 2017. After her divorce, she moved to Greece.

==Wealth==
Athina Onassis is the sole heiress of Christina Onassis, who inherited 55% of Aristotle Onassis&#x27;s fortune. The remaining 45% of Aristotle&#x27;s fortune (minus $26 million settled upon Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis) was left to the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation, established in honor of Alexander Onassis, Athina&#x27;s late uncle, who had died in 1973. When Athina Onassis was seven years old, &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited a report from the Associated Press, naming Onassis one of the year&#x27;s new billionaires, and even though she is often credited as a &quot;billionaire heiress&quot; throughout the media, the true extent of her wealth remains unknown. There have been several estimates of her inheritance, including the island of Skorpios, which was later sold to trusts connected with Ekaterina Rybolovleva, with some accounts claiming that Onassis&#x27;s net worth is less than $1 billion.

Onassis&#x27; mother Christina never trusted Thierry Roussel completely, which led the family to arrange for a board of administrators to control the family&#x27;s money until Athina came of age. The trustees Christina selected to manage the estate were Stelio Papadimitriou, Paul Ioannidis, Apostolos Zabelas, and Theodore Gabrielides. During Athina&#x27;s childhood and adolescence, all expenditures made on her behalf by her father (using money from the inheritance) had to be approved by the board, which led to her father threatening to move back to France, where the estate would have had to pay much higher income tax.

In 1999, a Vaduz court ordered the management of Athina&#x27;s inheritance to be transferred to the KPMG Fides auditing firm in Lucerne, Switzerland. At that time, aged 13, Onassis stated that she felt &quot;great aversion to anything Greek&quot;. In one of her few interviews, published in &quot;Oggi&quot;, an Italian magazine, she later stated that she blamed &quot;all the problems&quot; on the Onassis name. Similarly, her stepmother, Gaby Landhage, stated on American television show &quot;20/20&quot; that Athina had told her &quot;if she could burn all the Onassis money, she would do it.&quot;

On her 18th birthday, Athina took control of her mother&#x27;s inheritance. After her 21st birthday in 2006, her lawyers unsuccessfully fought to instate her as President of the Onassis Foundation, as the board claimed she was unqualified and denied that she was an heir to the estate of Aristotle Onassis. Invoking her grandfather&#x27;s legacy in memory of Alexander Onassis, the board&#x27;s representatives stated that she had no connection with the Greek culture, religion, language or shared experience, that she never went to college, and had no work experience.

<text>Maple sugar is a traditional sweetener in Canada and the northeastern United States, prepared from the sap of the maple tree (&quot;maple sap&quot;).

== Sources ==

Three species of maple trees in the genus &quot;Acer&quot; are predominantly used to produce maple sugar: the sugar maple (&quot;A. saccharum&quot;), the black maple (&quot;A. nigrum&quot;), and the red maple (&quot;A. rubrum&quot;), because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies or variety in a more broadly viewed concept of &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavor of the sap.

A few other species of maple are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple sugar, including the box elder (or Manitoba maple, &quot;A. negundo&quot;), the silver maple (&quot;A. saccharinum&quot;), and the bigleaf maple (&quot;A. macrophyllum&quot;). Similar sugars may also be produced from birch or palm trees, among other sources.

==Preparation==

Maple sugar is what remains after the sap of the sugar maple is boiled for longer than is needed to create maple syrup or maple taffy. Once almost all the water has been boiled off, all that is left is a solid sugar. By composition, this sugar is about 90% sucrose, the remainder consisting of variable amounts of glucose and fructose. This is usually sold in pressed blocks or as a translucent candy. It is difficult to create as the sugar easily burns and thus requires considerable skill.

==Regulation for product labeling==
In Canada, maple sugar is one of several maple products manufactured from maple sap or maple syrup, including maple butter and maple taffy. Under the Food and Drugs Act and Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, Canadian regulations require that maple sugar products identify the business identity and country of origin on the retail product label.

==History==
Maple sugar was made by many First Nations/American Indian peoples. Unlike maple syrup, it was easy to transport and long lasting. It is called &quot;ziinzibaakwad&quot; by the Anishinaabeg. &quot;Blessing of the Bay&quot;, the second ocean-going merchant ship built in the English colonies, carried maple sugar from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to New Amsterdam as early as 1631. French awareness of the process is indicated in at least one engraver&#x27;s works, those of the mid-18th-century artist Jean-Francois Turpin, the engraver Bernard (including several for Diderot&#x27;s 1755 &quot;Encyclopedie.&quot;) and others.

Maple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by abolitionists in the years before the war because most cane sugar and molasses were produced by Southern slaves. For example, Lucretia Mott was known for giving out maple candies wrapped in papers that bore messages like &quot;Take this, my friend, you need not fear to eat. No slave hath toiled to cultivate this sweet.&quot;

==Uses==
Maple sugar is used to flavor maple products and as an alternative to cane sugar.

<doc id="176565" wikidata="Q264327" url="?curid=176565" title="Hungarian cuisine">
<text>Hungarian or Magyar cuisine (Hungarian: &quot;Magyar konyha&quot;) is the cuisine characteristic of the nation of Hungary, and its primary ethnic group, the Magyars. Hungarian cuisine has been described as being the spiciest cuisine in Europe. This can largely be attributed to the use of their piquant native spice, Hungarian paprika, in many of their dishes. A mild version of the spice, Hungarian sweet paprika, is commonly used as an alternative. Traditional Hungarian dishes are primarily based on meats, seasonal vegetables, fruits, bread, and dairy products.

==General features==

Hungarian cuisine is mostly continental Central European, with some elements from Eastern Europe such as the use of poppy, and the popularity of kefir and quark. Paprika is often associated with Hungary and is used prominently in several dishes. Traditional Hungarian paprika is characterised by its bright colour and distinct heat, differentiating it from milder variations of paprika popular elsewhere in the world. Other herbs and spices commonly used in Hungarian cuisine include garlic, marjoram, caraway seeds, celery seeds and dill seeds. Typical Hungarian food is heavy on dairy and meats, similar to that of neighboring Czech and Slovak cuisines. Chicken, pork and beef are common, while turkey, duck, lamb, fish and game meats are mostly eaten on special occasions. Hungary is also known for relatively inexpensive salamis and sausages it produces primarily from pork, but also poultry, beef and others.

Bread is perhaps the most important and basic part of the Hungarian diet. It is eaten at all meals, accompanying main dishes. Before the fall of communism in 1990, white bread was a staple food. Numerous other types of baked goods, such as buns and pastries both salty and sweet, often creatively filled, have proliferated in recent years.

Main dishes may &quot;require&quot; a side dish (köret) or not. It is unusual to violate this convention. The side dish is most commonly potato in various styles, but rice or steamed vegetables are also popular. Some foods have a customary side dish (e.g., &quot;csirkepaprikás&quot; &#x27;paprika chicken&#x27; is almost always eaten with small dumplings similar to gnocchi (&quot;nokedli&quot;), while others may take any side dish (e.g., &quot;rántott sajt&quot; &#x27;fried cheese&#x27;). Some dishes also have toppings or bread on the side considered almost mandatory, for example, the sour cream and bread with &quot;töltött káposzta&quot; &#x27;stuffed cabbage&#x27;.

Recently, Hungarian chefs have become more creative, so Hungarian dishes prepared for tourists may seem unusual to Hungarians who are familiar with more traditional preparations.

Goulash is a famous Hungarian dish. Other famous Hungarian meat stews include paprikás, a thicker stew with meat simmered in thick, creamy, paprika-flavored gravy, and pörkölt, a stew with boneless meat (usually beef or pork), onion, and sweet paprika powder, both served with &quot;nokedli&quot; or galuska (small dumplings). In some old-fashioned dishes, fruits such as plums and apricots are cooked with meat or in piquant sauces/stuffings for game, roasts and other cuts. Various kinds of noodles, dumplings, potatoes, and rice are commonly served as a side dish. Hungarian dry sausages (kolbász) and winter salami are also widely eaten.

Other characteristics of Hungarian cuisine are the soups, casseroles, desserts, and pastries and stuffed crêpes (&quot;palacsinta&quot;), with fierce rivalries between regional variations on the same dish (such as the Hungarian hot fish soup called fisherman&#x27;s soup or &quot;halászlé&quot;, cooked differently on the banks of Hungary&#x27;s two main rivers: the Danube and the Tisza), &quot;palacsinta&quot; (pancakes served flambéed in dark chocolate sauce filled with ground walnuts) and Dobos cake (layered sponge cake, with chocolate buttercream filling and topped with a thin layer of crunchy caramel).

Two elements of Hungarian cuisine that impress foreigners are the various vegetable stews called &quot;főzelék&quot; as well as cold fruit soups, such as cold sour cherry soup ().

Hungarian cuisine uses a large variety of cheeses, but the most common are &quot;túró&quot; (a type of crumbly quark), cream cheeses, picante ewe-cheese &quot;(juhtúró),&quot; the most common Hungarian cheeses like Karaván, , Pálpusztai, Emmentaler, Edam and Trappista.

There are many smoked pork products. Many dishes get their character from the smoky taste of one or more of these ingredients. A variety of Hungarian smoked sausages, smoked ham, and smoked lard are also consumed without further preparation. These are accompanied with bread and fresh vegetables, are often called &#x27;cold dish&#x27;, and mainly consumed for breakfast or dinner, but sometimes offered as starter in restaurants.

Freshwater fish dishes are very common. In addition to the popular fisherman&#x27;s soup, frying fish on reeds, making káposzta (csíkos káposzta) or even kolbász out of it also used to be popular.

Pickled (fermented) vegetables are often used. The most common is &quot;savanyú káposzta&quot; (lit: sour-cabbage, sauerkraut) and soured peppers, gherkins, but a mix of cauliflower, green tomatoes, baby water melon, and other vegetables is also frequent. These are traditionally consumed in the winter and often were the main source of vitamin-C throughout the cold months of winter. Some seasonal, hearty dishes such as &quot;töltött káposzta&quot;, &quot;húsos káposzta&quot; and &quot;korhelyleves&quot; are based on &quot;savanyú káposzta&quot;. Classic Hungarian restaurants often offer some variations as side dish, a refreshing complement to heavy dishes.

==Seasonings==
Hungarian food uses selected spices judiciously to add flavor, especially paprika, a spice made of ground red pepper.

Paprika being the most important spice, there are many traditional variations and styles ranging from sweet to extremely spicy. The sweet and more mild paprika tend to be more common, but the spicy varieties are still very popular. Hot chilis are also often given as a garnish in traditional Hungarian cuisine, but when not, dried hot chilis or hot chili paste are typically given on the side.

Hungarians are known for loving spicy foods and eat everything with paprika and Piros Arany(a popular Hungarian paprika cream, meaning &#x27;Red Gold&#x27;). They also put the Hungarian chili sauce Erős Pista, in their Fisherman&#x27;s soup and paprikash.

After paprika, garlic and onion bulbs are some of the most popular aromatics, either or both being used in most every savoury dish.

Herbs are also a key component of Hungarian cuisine, with dill, bay leaf, marjoram, and parsley being the most common. Tarragon, savoury, horseradish, and lovage are also quite common, but less so than the previous. Even herbs such as thyme, patience dock, mint and chives can also be component of some dishes, although considerably less frequently than those mentioned before.

The savoury side of Hungarian cuisine makes use of many spices, most notably paprika. However, Magyar cuisine uses many other spices as well with black pepper, caraway, dill seed, and poppy seed being some of the most common for savoury dishes. Though juniper berries and coriander are also frequently used, but generally only for specific dishes. Mustard seed is uncommon as an ingredient itself, but prepared mustards are used often. Hungarian mustards are often likened to a Dijon-style mustard, though they are not typically made with wine and generally use seeds of the white mustard plant; it is also not uncommon for them to include herbs, particularly tarragon and parsley.

Sweet dishes are typically spiced with different seasonings. Cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, cloves, lemon peel, and vanilla are the most common. Allspice, while traditionally relegated to sweet dishes in western cuisines, is used in both sweet and savoury applications in Hungarian cuisine.

While not really a seasoning, the use of a thick sour cream called &quot;tejföl&quot; as a topping is another common feature in many dishes.

When products use Hungarian-style as a variation, the flavour is usually pepper, onion or bacon.

==History==



The historical Hungarian cuisine has influenced the history of the Magyar people, and vice versa. The importance of livestock and the nomadic lifestyle of the Magyar people, as well as a hearkening to their steppe past, is apparent in the prominence of meat in Hungarian food and may be reflected in traditional meat dishes cooked over the fire like goulash (in Hungarian &quot;gulyás&quot;, lit. &quot;cattleman&#x27;s (meal)&quot;), &quot;pörkölt&quot; stew and the spicy fisherman&#x27;s soup called &quot;halászlé&quot; are all traditionally cooked over the open fire in a &quot;bogrács&quot; (or cauldron). In the 15th century, King Matthias Corvinus and his Neapolitan wife Beatrice, influenced by Renaissance culture, introduced new ingredients such as sweet chestnut and spices such as garlic, ginger, mace, saffron and nutmeg, onion and the use of fruits in stuffings or cooked with meat. Some of these spices such as ginger and saffron are no longer used in modern Hungarian cuisine. At that time and later, considerable numbers of Saxons (a German ethnic group), Armenians, Italians, Jews, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire; dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa. Some cakes and sweets in Hungary show a strong German-Austrian influence. All told, modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Uralic components mixed with West Slavic, Balkan, Austrian, and German. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine.

Although Hungary is a major source of paprika, and it is the spice most closely associated with Hungary, peppers, the raw material in paprika production, originated from North America was only later introduced to the Old World, to Spain in the 16th century, as part of the Columbian exchange. The spice was first used in Hungarian cuisine in the early 19th century.

Historically Magyar cuisine had a decisive role in the gastronomy of the Carpathian basin. Because of the Habsburg ruling class making it difficult for the kingdom to do industrial work, the country&#x27;s small producer markets became prominent, and were therefore also called the monarchy&#x27;s larder. Hungarian cuisine is famously rich in flavours and has also played a major role in the cuisine of neighbouring peoples.

==Hungarian meals==

In Hungary, people usually have a large breakfast. Hungarian breakfast generally is an open sandwich with bread or toast, butter, cheese or different cream cheeses, &quot;túró&quot; cheese, tejföl or &quot;körözött&quot; (Liptauer cheese spread), cold cuts such as ham, liver pâté (called &quot;májkrém&quot; or &quot;kenőmájas&quot;), bacon, salami, mortadella, sausages such as kabanos, beerwurst or different Hungarian sausages or kolbász. Traditionally fresh tomatoes and green peppers (sometimes scallion, radish and cucumber) are served with these when they are in season. Eggs (fried, scrambled or boiled) may also be part of breakfast.

Some types of meat that were commonly eaten in the past (such as beef tongue, &quot;disznósajt&quot; (head cheese) or &quot;véres hurka&quot; (similar to black pudding) are now more associated with the countryside.

Meals are often eaten with savanyúság and millet.

Contemporary Hungarians do not always eat this typical breakfast. For many, breakfast is a cup of milk, tea or coffee with pastries, a bun, a &quot;kifli&quot; or a &quot;strudel&quot; with jam or honey, or cereal, such as muesli and perhaps fruit. Children can have rice pudding (&quot;tejberizs&quot;) or semolina cream (&quot;tejbegríz&quot;) for breakfast topped with cocoa powder and sugar or with fruit syrup. Bodzaszörp or hot drinks are preferred for breakfast. In the past, breakfast itself was much more important, often only breakfast and dinner were eaten. In those days, cabbage soup was a common breakfast.

&quot;Villásreggeli&quot; or brunch (literally &#x27;breakfast with fork&#x27;) is a more luxurious big breakfast given on special occasions or holidays. Often guests are invited. Deviled eggs, cold steak, cold salads, salmon omelettes, pancakes, a spicy cheese spread made with sheep milk cheese called &quot;körözött&quot;, caviar, foie gras, fruit salads, compote, fruit yogurts, fruit juices, champagne and pastries, cakes and cookies may be served.

Tízórai refers to a meal eaten between breakfast and lunch.

Lunch is the major meal of the day, traditionally with several courses, but often just one course in modern times. Cold or hot appetizers may be served sometimes (for example, fish, egg or liver), then soup. Soup is followed by a main dish. The main dish is a dish including meat, side dishes and salad (such as the &quot;uborkasaláta&quot;, a typical sidedish made with smetana, paprika and continental cucumber) or savanyúság (from pickled vegetables - paprika, cucumber, sauerkraut, etc.), which precedes the dessert. Fruit may follow. In Hungary, pancakes (or rather, crepes) may be served as a main dish or as a dessert but not for breakfast. Salad is typically served with meat dishes, made of lettuce with tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, or some pickled variant of them. A simple thin sliced cucumber or tomato salad in vinaigrette is also typical. Salads such as Salade Olivier or potato salad are made of boiled potatoes, vegetables, hard-boiled eggs, mushrooms, fried or boiled meat or fish, in vinaigrette, aspic or mayonnaise. These salads are eaten as appetizers or even as a main course.

Some people and children eat a light meal in the afternoon, called &quot;uzsonna&quot;, usually an open sandwich, pastry, slice of cake or fruit.

Dinner is typically less important than lunch, and there is no typical Hungarian dinner. It may either be a lunch-type meal, with multiple courses and the same foods one would serve for lunch, or it could be the same as a traditional Hungarian breakfast, with bread, cold cuts, cheeses, tomatoes and peppers as described above. When dinner is an important occasion it will be prepared the same way and with the same courses a full lunch would be. When it&#x27;s not an important occasion, it&#x27;s a good time to eat leftovers.

Hungarian meal times are somewhat flexible. Typical times are as follows: Breakfast 6-9 am; Lunch 12 noon-2 pm; Dinner 6-9 pm.

==Special occasions==

For Christmas, Hungarians have a fish soup called &quot;halászlé&quot;. Other dishes may be served, such as roast goose, roast turkey or roast duck, cabbage rolls &quot;(töltött káposzta)&quot;. Pastry roll filled with walnut or poppy seed called &quot;(bejgli)&quot; is a usual Christmas food, and candies and sweets used to decorate the Christmas tree, such as szaloncukor are eaten during all Christmas, when everybody picks them and eats them directly from the tree. In some households, Lentil stew, also known as &#x27;Lencse Fozelek&#x27;, is consumed to bring good luck and health in the upcoming years.

Other traditional foods such as Pozsonyi kifli, a type of Bejgli is also commonly eaten in Christmas dinners (Pozsony being the original name of Bratislava), next to regular Bejglies and Strudels(rétes).

On New Year&#x27;s Eve (&quot;Szilveszter&quot;), Hungarians traditionally celebrate with &quot;virsli&quot; (Vienna sausage) and lentil soup. On New Year&#x27;s Day, it is common to eat either lentil soup or &quot;korhelyleves&quot;, a meaty sauerkraut soup said to cure hangovers. 

There is also a lot of superstition attached to New Year&#x27;s food: on New Year&#x27;s Eve, a coin is baked into the pogácsa. Whoever finds the lucky coin will have a lucky and prosperous New Year. But all the scones have to be gone before midnight, otherwise everything goes the other way.

It was tradition to bake rétes (strudels) as long as possible, because then you would be that much richer the following year.

It is also tradition for girls to put small pieces of paper with a man&#x27;s name in the middle of dumplings or other raw dough. At exactly midnight, they threw them into the boiling water, the first male name that came up revealing the name of their future husband.

Easter is considered a huge event (&quot;Húsvét&quot;) and is celebrated all over Hungary. The families and their friends have the Mom and daughter prepare meals such as Smoked Ham with boiled eggs and small sandwiches and drinks quite commonly to have palinka on the table and then wait for Fathers and sons to arrive and say a poem (Husvéti Vers) and then spray on their hair with a perfume. Once the Father and son water the Mom and daughters known as &quot;Locsolkodás&quot;. They have a meal a drink then they go to the next family member until they visited all. In Szabolcs County make a special sweet yellow cheese, &quot;Sárgatúró&quot;, made with quark (túró) and eggs. The kalács eaten then is often called &quot;pászkakalács&quot;.

==Drinks==

Hungarian wine dates back to at least Roman times, and that history reflects the country&#x27;s position between the West Slavs and the Germanic peoples.

The best-known wines are the white dessert wine called &quot;Tokaji Aszú&quot; (after the North-Eastern region of Hungary, Tokaj) and the red wines from Villány (Southern part of Hungary). Famous is also the wine called Bull&#x27;s Blood (&quot;Egri Bikavér&quot;), a dark, full-bodied red wine. Hungarian fruit wines, such as red-currant wine, are mild and soft in taste and texture. A special kind of wine is the &quot;Ürmös&quot; in which next to the grapes, wormwood is also put into the barrel.

Hungary&#x27;s most notable liquors are &quot;Unicum&quot;, a herbal bitters, and &quot;Pálinka&quot;, a range of fruit brandies (plum, apricot and pear are popular). Also notable are the 21 brands of Hungarian mineral waters (for example, &quot;Apenta&quot; and &quot;Kékkúti&quot;). Some of them have therapeutic value, such as &quot;Mira&quot;.

The elderberry (bodza), currant, wild strawberry (szamóca), viola (plant) (ibolya), lavender and raspberry (málna) szörp (a concentrate created from sugar and fruits or flowers) is also common. The Jaffa flavoured Szobi szörp was an iconic soft drink before the change of regime. &quot;Traubi&quot; or &quot;Traubisoda&quot;, is another soft drink based on an Austrian license produced in Balatonvilágos since 1971.

<text>French toast is a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan-fried. Alternative names and variants include eggy bread, Bombay toast, gypsy toast, and poor knights (of Windsor).

When French toast is served as a sweet dish, sugar, vanilla, or cinnamon are also commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.

==Preparation==

Slices of bread are soaked or dipped in a mixture of beaten eggs, often whisked with milk or cream. Sliced or artisan loaves cut to thick are frequently used as the bread of choice. Sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla may be variously added to the mixture. The bread is then fried in butter or olive oil until browned and cooked through. Day-old bread is often used, both for its thrift and because it will soak up more egg mixture without falling apart.

The cooked slices may be served with sugar or sweet toppings such as caramel, ice cream, jam, honey, fruit, or maple syrup.

<doc id="176568" wikidata="Q2479643" url="?curid=176568" title="Logan (Iroquois leader)">
<text>Logan the Orator ( 1723 – 1780) was a Cayuga orator and war leader born of one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. After his 1760s move to the Ohio Country, he became affiliated with the Mingo, a tribe formed from Seneca, Cayuga, Lenape and other remnant peoples. He took revenge for family members killed by Virginian long knives in 1774 in what is known as the Yellow Creek Massacre. His actions against settlers on the frontier helped spark Dunmore&#x27;s War later that year.

Logan became known for a speech, later known as Logan&#x27;s Lament, which he reportedly delivered after the war. Scholars dispute important details about Logan, including his original name and whether the words of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Lament&quot; were his.

==Identity debate==
Scholars agree that Logan was a son of Chief Shikellamy, an important diplomat for the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. But, as anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace has written, &quot;Which of Shikellamy&#x27;s sons was Logan the orator has been a matter of dispute.&quot; Logan the orator has been variously identified as &quot;Tah-gah-jute,&quot; &quot;Tachnechdorus&quot; (also spelled &quot;Tachnedorus&quot; and &quot;Taghneghdoarus&quot;), &quot;Soyechtowa&quot;, &quot;Tocanioadorogon,&quot; the &quot;Great Mingo&quot;, James Logan, and John Logan.

The name &quot;Tah-gah-jute&quot; was popularized in an 1851 book by Brantz Mayer entitled &quot;Tah-gah-jute: or Logan and Cresap&quot;. However, historian Francis Jennings wrote that Mayer&#x27;s book was &quot;erroneous from the first word of the title.&quot; He identified Logan as James Logan, also known as &quot;Soyechtowa&quot; and &quot;Tocanioadorogon.&quot; Historians who agree that Logan the orator was not named &quot;Tah-gah-jute&quot; sometimes identify him as &quot;Tachnechdorus.&quot; But Jennings identifies Tachnechdorus as Logan the orator&#x27;s older brother.
Logan&#x27;s father Chief Shikellamy, who was Oneida, worked closely with Pennsylvania official James Logan to maintain the Covenant Chain relationship with the colony of Pennsylvania. Following a prevailing Native American practice, the young man who would become Logan the Mingo took the name &quot;James Logan&quot; out of admiration for his father&#x27;s friend.

With the disruption of warfare, disease, and encroachment, some Seneca, Susquehannock, and Cayuga among the Haudenosaunee migrated to the Ohio Country, as did Lenape. Joining in a process of ethnogenesis, they became known as the Mingo tribe. Logan the Mingo is usually identified as a Mingo &quot;chief&quot;, but historian Richard White has written that &quot;He was not a chief. Kayashuta and White Mingo were the Mingo chiefs. Logan was merely a war leader.&quot; The Haudenosaunee and other Native American tribes tended to have peace chiefs and war chiefs, or leaders. Like his father, Logan generally maintained friendly relationships with white settlers who were moving from eastern Pennsylvania and Virginia into the Ohio Country: the region that is now Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and western Pennsylvania.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
John Logan&#x27;s Father was the Haudenosaunee Chief, Shikellamy of the Oneida Tribe. His mother was Neanoma a Cayuga, and step-mother was Tutelo. Shikellamy and Neanoma were married in New York State. A historical marker in Danby, New York, designates the &quot;possible birthplace of Chief Logan (Tah-Gah-Jute),&quot; and then quotes Logan&#x27;s famous speech.

John Logan was also known as Tachnechtoris, &quot;The Spreading Oak&quot; or John Shikellamy. He had 3 known brothers and one sister. John was the oldest of the siblings. His next brother was known as Tah-gah-jute, Sayughtowa, &quot;The Beetling Brow&quot;, or James Logan. James later in life was referred to as &quot;Logan, the Mingo.&quot; His brother, Arahhot or &quot;Unhappy Jake&quot; was killed in the war with the Catawbas in 1744. John Petty or Sogogeghyata, was the youngest of his brothers and bore the name of a Shamokin Indian Trader. John Logan&#x27;s sister was known as the widow of Cajadies who was known as &quot;the best hunter among all of the Indians&quot; who died in November 1747.

Children, by tradition, took the clan or tribe of the mother. The Shikellamy children were of the Cayuga Tribe.

Statement of Jesse Logan, aged 106 years old and Great Grandson of Chief Shikellamy Cornplanter Reservation, Penn October 9, 1915:

===Yellow Creek massacre===
Logan&#x27;s friendly relations with white settlers changed after the Yellow Creek massacre of April 30, 1774. A group of Virginia Long knives led by Daniel Greathouse murdered a number of Mingo, among them Logan&#x27;s brother (commonly known as John Petty) and at least two other close female relatives, one of them pregnant and caring for an infant daughter. Her children&#x27;s father was John Gibson, a prominent trader in the region. These Mingo had been living near the mouth of Yellow Creek, and had been lured to the cabin of Joshua Baker, a settler and rum trader who lived across the Ohio River from their village. The Mingo in Baker&#x27;s cabin were all murdered, except for the infant mixed-race child, who was spared with the intention of giving her to her father. At least two canoes were dispatched from the Yellow Creek village to aid their members, but they were repelled by Greathouse&#x27;s men concealed along the river. In all, approximately a dozen Mingo were murdered in the cabin and on the river. Logan was not present in the area when the massacre took place, and was summoned to return by runners.

===Logan&#x27;s revenge===

Influential tribal chiefs in the region, such as Cornstalk (Shawnee), White Eyes (Lenape), and Guyasuta (Seneca/Mingo), attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution lest the incident develop into a larger war, but by Native American custom Logan had the right to retaliate for the murders. Several parties of mixed Mingo and Shawnee warriors soon struck the frontier, including one led by Logan. They attacked settlers in several frontier regions, both killing and taking captives. One known as the Spicer Massacre in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, responded by launching an expedition against the Mingo and Shawnee, in the conflict known as Dunmore&#x27;s War.

===Logan&#x27;s Lament===

Logan was not at the Battle of Point Pleasant (October 10, 1774), the only major battle of Dunmore&#x27;s War. Following the battle, Dunmore&#x27;s army marched into the Ohio Country and compelled the Ohio Indians to agree to a peace treaty.

According to tradition, Logan refused to attend the negotiations and instead made a speech that became legendary:

First published in &quot;The Virginia Gazette&quot; in 1775, the speech was more widely popularized when Thomas Jefferson reprinted it in his book &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1782). In 1822 the speech inspired the John Neal novel &quot;Logan&quot;, which also featured Logan as a main character. The American elm tree in Pickaway County, Ohio under which Logan was said to have given the speech became known as the &quot;Logan Elm.&quot; It grew to great size before dying in 1964.

===Logan&#x27;s Letter===
===Later life and death===
The remainder of Logan&#x27;s life is shrouded in obscurity. Logan continued his attacks on white settlers and associated himself with British-allied Mohawks during the American Revolution. He died in an altercation near Lake Erie in 1780. He was reportedly assassinated by his own nephew, urged on by other Mingo who were concerned at Logan&#x27;s erratic behavior. Years later, the nephew stated that he had agreed to kill Logan &quot;Because he was too great a man to live.&quot;
==Legacy==
Numerous places carry Logan&#x27;s name, including:
*Logan, Ohio
*Logan County, West Virginia (None of the 9 other &quot;Logan&quot; counties in the USA is named for the Mingo leader.)
**Logan, West Virginia
**Chief Logan State Park, West Virginia
*Logan Elm State Memorial, Ohio
**Logan Elm High School is located near the state memorial
*Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York, an area traditional to the Cayugas, has a large monument to him.
*Chief Logan Reservation – a camp property in Ray, Ohio opened in 1963 by the Chief Logan Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The Chief Logan Council was consolidated in 1994, and the camp management was passed on to the newly created Simon Kenton Council, who closed the camp permanently after the 2019 season.
*Logan Honors Program - at Fort Steuben Scout Reservation in Freeport, Ohio, managed by the Ohio River Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
*Logan Branch of Spring Creek in Centre County, Pennsylvania.
*Logan and Michael Cresap resolved their differences after Cresap proved that he was innocent of the massacre of Logan&#x27;s people. Cresap named a son after Logan and, since then, three generations of Cresap male descendants have been named Logan. The tradition has been continued in the 21st century.
*Indianola Junior High School in Columbus, Ohio, has a sculpture detail of Logan with the carved caption TAHGAHJUTE

<text>A small domestic appliance, also known as a small electric appliance or minor appliance or simply a small appliance, small domestic or small electric, is a portable or semi-portable machine, generally used on table-tops, counter-tops or other platforms, to accomplish a household task. Examples include microwave ovens, kettles, toasters, humidifiers, food processors and coffeemakers. They contrast with major appliances (known as &quot;white goods&quot; in the UK), such as the refrigerators and washing machines, which cannot be easily moved and are generally placed on the floor. Small appliances also contrast with consumer electronics (British &quot;brown goods&quot;) which are for leisure and entertainment rather than purely practical tasks.

==Uses==
Some small appliances perform the same or similar function as their larger counterparts. For example, a toaster oven is a small appliance that performs a similar function as an oven. Small appliances often have a home version and a commercial version, for example waffle irons, food processors, and blenders are small household appliances. A food processor will perform the tasks of chopper, slicer, mixer as well as juicer. Instead of buying multiple small appliances, you can buy a single food processor. The commercial, or industrial, version is designed to be used nearly continuously in a restaurant or other similar setting. Commercial appliances are typically connected to a more powerful electrical outlet, are larger and stronger, have more user-serviceable parts, and cost significantly more. These commercial versions are capable of performing heavy tasks in one go.

==Types and examples==
Small appliances include those used for :
* Beverage-making, such as electric kettles, coffeemakers or iced tea-makers
* Cleaning, such as vacuum cleaner
* Cooking, such as on a hot plate or with a microwave oven
* Lighting, using light fixtures
* Thermal comfort, such as an electric heater or fan
Many small appliances perform a combination of the above processes such as mixing, heating by a bread machine

==Prices==

Small appliances can be very inexpensive, such as an electric can opener, hot pot, toaster, or coffee maker which may cost only a few U.S. dollars, or very expensive, such as an elaborate espresso maker, which may cost several thousand U.S. dollars. Most homes in developed economies contain several cheaper home appliances, with perhaps a few more expensive appliances, such as a high-end microwave oven or mixer. A small appliances like chopper, juicer, grinder and mixer may cost you few dollars. Instead of buying separate units the food processor will be less expensive. Sometime these kind of smart appliances saves money as well as the space.

==Powering==

Many small appliances are powered by electricity. The appliance may use a permanently attached cord that is plugged into a wall outlet or a detachable cord. The appliance may have a cord storage feature. A few hand-held appliances use batteries, which may be disposable or rechargeable. Some appliances consist of an electrical motor upon which is mounted various attachments so as to constitute several individual appliances, such as a blender, a food processor, or a juicer. Many stand mixers, while functioning primarily as a mixer, have attachments that can perform additional functions.

A few gasoline and gas-powered appliances exist for use in situations where electricity is not expected to be available, but these are typically larger and not as portable as most small appliances. Items that perform the same function as small appliances but are hand-powered are generally referred to as tools or gadgets, for example a hand cranked egg beater, a grater, a mandoline, or a hand-powered meat grinder.

==Safety==

Small appliances which are defective or improperly used or maintained may cause house fires and other property damage, or may harbor bacteria if not properly cleaned. It is important that users read the instructions carefully and that appliances that use a grounded cord be attached to a grounded outlet. Because of the risk of fire, some appliances have a short detachable cord that is connected to the appliance magnetically. If the appliance is moved further than the cord length from the wall, the cord will detach from the appliance.

==Designations and regulations==

Designations and regulations of &quot;small appliances&quot; vary by country and are not simply determined by physical sizes. For instance, United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations mandate that small appliances must meet two standards:

* Completely manufactured, charged, and sealed in a factory
* Contains five pounds or less of refrigerant

The designations and regulations of &quot;small appliances&quot; are very important in order to assure the safety of the public. Here are some rules and regulations for small appliances:
* Altering the design of certified recovered small appliances in a way that would affect the equipment&#x27;s ability to meet the certification standards is strictly prohibited
* The equipment must meet the minimum requirements for certification

<doc id="176583" wikidata="Q936252" url="?curid=176583" title="Painted Desert (Arizona)">
<text>The Painted Desert is a United States desert of badlands in the Four Corners area, running from near the east end of Grand Canyon National Park and southeast into Petrified Forest National Park. It is most easily accessed from the north portion of Petrified Forest National Park. The Painted Desert is known for its brilliant and varied colors: these include the more common red rock, but also shades of lavender.

== History ==

The Painted Desert was named by a Spanish expedition under Francisco Vázquez de Coronado during his 1540 quest to find the Seven Cities of Cibola. He located these some east of Petrified Forest National Park. Finding the cities were not made of gold, Coronado sent an expedition to find the Colorado River to gain supplies. Passing through the wonderland of colors, they named the area &quot;El Desierto Pintado&quot; (&quot;The Painted Desert&quot;).

Much of the Painted Desert within Petrified Forest National Park is protected as Petrified Forest National Wilderness Area, where motorized travel is limited. The park offers both easy and longer hikes into the colored hills. The Painted Desert continues north into the Navajo Nation, where off-road travel is allowed only by permit.

==Geology==
The desert is composed of stratified layers of siltstone, mudstone, and shale of the Triassic Chinle Formation, which erode easily. These fine-grained rock layers contain abundant iron and manganese compounds, which provide the pigments for the various colors of the region. Thin, resistant lacustrine limestone layers and volcanic flows cap the mesas. Numerous layers of silicic volcanic ash occur in the Chinle and provide the silica for the petrified logs of the area. The erosion of these layers has resulted in the formation of the badlands topography of the region.

In the southern portions of the desert, the remains of a Triassic period coniferous forest have fossilized over millions of years. Wind, water and soil erosion continue to change the face of the landscape by shifting sediment and exposing layers of the Chinle Formation. An assortment of fossilized prehistoric plants and animals are found in the region, as well as ancient dinosaur tracks and evidence of early human habitation.

==Area and climate==
The Painted Desert extends roughly from Cameron–Tuba City southeast to past Holbrook and the Petrified Forest National Park. The desert is about long by about wide, making it roughly in area. Bordering southwest and south is the Mogollon Plateau, and on the plateau&#x27;s south border the Mogollon Rim, the north border of the Arizona transition zone.

Owing to the strong rain shadow of the Mogollon Rim, the Painted Desert has a cold desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;), with hot, dry summers and chilly (though virtually snow-free) winters. The annual precipitation is the lowest in northern Arizona and in many places is lower even than Phoenix.

==Accessibility==
Much of the region is accessible only by foot or unpaved road though major highways and paved roads cut across the area. The towns of Cameron and Tuba City, both on the Navajo Nation, are two major settlements. A permit is required for all backroad travel on the Navajo Nation.

<text>Rambler is an automobile brand name that was first used by the Thomas B. Jeffery Company between 1900 and 1914.

Charles W. Nash bought Jeffery in 1916, and Nash Motors reintroduced the name to the automobile marketplace from 1950 through 1954. The &quot;Rambler&quot; trademark registration for use on automobiles and parts was issued on 9 March 1954 for Nash-Kelvinator.

Nash merged with the Hudson Motor Car Company to form American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1954. The Rambler line of cars continued through the 1969 model year in the United States and 1983 in international markets.

Rambler cars were often nicknamed the &quot;Kenosha Cadillac&quot; after the original location and their most significant place of manufacture in the city of Kenosha, Wisconsin.

==Rambler 1897–1914==
The first use of the name Rambler for an American-made automobile dates to 1897 when Thomas B. Jeffery of Chicago, Illinois, builder of the Rambler bicycle, constructed his prototype automobile.

After receiving positive reviews at the 1899 Chicago International Exhibition &amp; Tournament and the first National Automobile Show in New York City, Jeffery entered the automobile business. Following the sudden death of his Rambler partner, R. Philip Gormully, Jeffery sold their bicycle business to the American Bicycle Company, but retained rights to the Rambler name. In 1900, he bought the old Sterling Bicycle Co. factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and set up shop.

Thomas Jeffery and his son Charles experimented with such early technical innovations as a steering wheel (as opposed to a tiller), left-hand driving and the engine placement under a hood instead of under the seat, but they was decided that such features were too advanced for the motoring public of the day. The first Ramblers were tiller-steered, had right-hand drive, and the single-cylinder engine was positioned under the seat. Rambler innovated various design features and was the first to equip cars with a spare wheel-and-tire assembly. This allowed the driver, when experiencing a flat tire, to exchange the spare wheel and tire for the flat one, rather than patching.

Jeffery started commercially mass-producing automobiles in 1902. By the end of the year the company had produced 1,500 motor cars, priced at US$750 (), one-sixth of all cars that were manufactured in the U.S. during that year. The Thomas B. Jeffery Company was the second largest auto manufacturer at that time, behind Oldsmobile.

In 1904, Jeffery built 2,342 Ramblers. Higher-powered two-cylinder versions with front-mounted engines and steering wheels were now available. In 1905, the single-cylinder was discontinued, and three larger two-cylinder models priced from $1,200 to $3,000 were offered (equivalent to between US$ and $ in ). A Rambler four-cylinder was introduced in 1906.

New employee Edward S, Jordan, who would later become Jeffery&#x27;s secretary and general manager, provided advertising copy such as &quot;The Right Car at the Right Price&quot;, “June Time Is Rambler Time”, and other similarly evocative phrases. By 1906, Rambler was considered an industry leader, with one of the best-equipped automobile factories. Thomas Jeffery was not interested in increasing mass production, however, and settled into a pattern of producing 2,500 Ramblers a year.

In 1910, all Ramblers were now four-cylinder medium-priced cars. While on vacation in 1910, Thomas B. Jeffery died of a heart attack and his son Charles took over the newly incorporated Thomas B. Jeffery Company. Charles increased annual production by about 500 cars and, in 1912, introduced new Ned Jordan model names such as Cross Country, Country Club, Knickerbocker, and Valkyrie. For 1913 the last Rambler branded models were the Cross Country roadster and touring car, an Inside Drive coupe and the Gotham Limousine, priced from US$1,650 to $2,750 (equivalent to between US$ and $ in ). 

In 1914, Charles T. Jeffery, Thomas B. Jeffery&#x27;s son, replaced the Rambler brand name with Jeffery in honor of his now-deceased father.

In 1916, the Thomas B. Jeffery Company was purchased by Charles W. Nash and became Nash Motors Company in 1917. The Jeffery brand name was dropped at the time of the sale. The manufacture of Nash-branded automobiles commenced. In 1937, the concern became the Nash-Kelvinator Corporation through a merger with the major appliance maker.

== Overview of production figures ==
==Rambler 1950–1957==
Under the direction of Charles Nash&#x27;s successor, George W. Mason, Nash-Kelvinator Corporation began the development of a small car that could be produced inexpensively for the post-World War II economy. Both General Motors and Ford had plans to develop smaller-sized cars after the war, but did not realize them. Moreover, steel shortages following the war limited the amount of raw materials that Nash could obtain. Hence, Mason ordered the development of a &quot;compact car&quot; that would have greater appeal to consumers, because the Crosley in production at that time was considered too small to be practical. The new Nash compact featured a unique convertible design. It included many standard features that were typically options on other cars. This approach maximized profits for the company. Nash-Kelvinator trademarked Rambler in 1950, the same nameplate as was used by its predecessor company in the early 1900s.

When introduced, the Rambler was an immediate success for Nash. As the steel quotas related to the Korean War eased, the Rambler line was broadened in its model types, first a station wagon and two-door hardtop (no B-pillar) named &quot;Country Club&quot;, and later a two-door sedan. A further expansion of the line for 1954 included a four-door sedan and station wagon called &quot;Cross Country&quot; on a stretched wheelbase, which proved to be as successful as the first generation of two-door sedan convertibles. The Rambler became the most successful of the early post-Second World War American compacts compared to the Henry J (and rebadged Allstate version), Willys Aero, and Hudson Jet.

The first generation of modern Ramblers carried a modified version of Nash&#x27;s &quot;Airflyte&quot; styling, which included closed wheel openings. While the wheel openings of any car are a major source of wind resistance, the design was rather primarily an engineering design to increase the strength of the car for impact resistance. The engine is positioned between massive inner fender bulges to allow for the skirted front fenders along with a narrow front track to provide a turning circle of . Ramblers continued to use this styling until 1955 when the front wheels were revealed by a periodic design update.

In 1954 the Rambler offered the first combination heating and air conditioning unit available on American cars. The unit could be an add-on or could be installed at the factory for $395, which at that time was about the lowest-cost unit available in an American car.

In 1954, American Motors Corporation (AMC) was formed from the merger of Nash-Kelvinator and the Hudson Motor Car Company. Following the merger, 1955 and 1956 Ramblers were badged as both Nashes and Hudsons, with no visible differences. Rambler became a marque in its own right for the 1957 model year. The Nash and Hudson makes continued as a &quot;senior&quot; model only through 1957, after which all AMC&#x27;s offerings were marketed as Ramblers, except the imported 1958–1962 Metropolitan.

==Rambler 1958–1969==

At the start of the 1960s, George Romney made a marketing decision that more fully unified the Rambler model names under the Rambler brand. In 1962, the Ambassador, a top-trim level model, was officially brought under the Rambler name (it had previously been named the &quot;Ambassador by Rambler&quot;). The former Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V8 were renamed the Rambler Classic. While the top-line models for 1958-1961 were advertised as the &quot;Ambassador V-8 by Rambler&quot;, but on the cars themselves, the badging was &quot;Rambler Ambassador&quot;.

In 1958, AMC re-introduced America&#x27;s first successful compact car, the Rambler American, after a three-year hiatus. This car was essentially the no-frills, economical 1950 Nash Rambler, but slightly restyled and modernized with a new grille and full cut-out wheel openings. The Recession of 1958 hurt all carmakers except AMC, whose economy-oriented Ramblers saw high demand. The American was an instant success and lost sales only after the &quot;Big Three&quot; (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) each introduced compact cars of their own in the 1960s (GM &quot;X&quot; body, Ford Falcon, and Chrysler A platform).

Romney also put into play his plan to slash production costs, which involved more common parts sharing between the Ambassador and Classic models. Beginning in 1962, all &quot;senior&quot; Rambler models would share the same automobile platform with identical wheelbase and body parts. However, the engines, trims, and equipment levels distinguished the Classic from the Ambassador. The Rambler&#x27;s compact size (by U.S. standards) also made it an international competitor, and between 1961 and 1965, AMC opened thirteen foreign assembly plants, from Costa Rica to the Philippines.

In 1963, the entire Rambler line received the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year award. However, Romney&#x27;s departure to become Michigan governor opened the door for his successor, Roy Abernethy, to redirect the company towards a strategy of competing head-to-head with the Big Three (General Motors, Chrysler Corporation, and Ford Motor Company) with a variety of bodies and automobile platforms. This new plan also included marketing the various models apart from the Rambler brand name, which Abernethy thought would be a hindrance in the market segments he hoped to pursue.

One of the first moves in that direction was the development of the 1965 line of Ramblers, which visually split the Classic from the Ambassador while still sharing many parts. Once again, the Ambassador had a unique, extended wheelbase. In addition, AMC introduced the Marlin, a hardtop fastback intended to enter AMC in the youth and personal luxury market segments as well as also positioning it as a &quot;halo&quot; vehicle.

AMC chief stylist Richard Teague introduced a restyled and attractive Rambler American in 1964, which was a sales success. This basic body remained in its original shape through 1969.

Backed by marketing reports, Abernethy next made a persuasive argument to the AMC board that the Rambler name had not only acquired a stodgy image and hindered increasing sales, but that consumers associated it with compact cars. In what hindsight would show to be an ill-conceived decision, American Motors began to phase it out in favor of an AMC marque starting with the 1966 model year as it attempted to become a multiplatform automobile manufacturer.

By 1968, the only vehicle produced by AMC to carry the Rambler marque was the compact Rambler American. Although designed as a &quot;basic&quot; economy car, the American spawned the audacious SC/Rambler, developed with Hurst Performance. While AMC planned to produce only 500 for the 1969 model year, the &quot;Scrambler&quot; proved popular so two more groups of about 500 each were built. All featured the same V8, four-barrel carburetor, and close-ratio four-speed transmission of the AMX, plus Hurst shifter, Twin-Grip (limited slip) differential, and cold air hood.

For the final year in 1969, the &quot;American&quot; line was called Rambler. The 1969 Rambler (and Chevrolet Corvair and Dodge Dart) were the only U.S. compact cars available that year in a two-door hardtop body style; Ford compacts were available only as sedans.

The last U.S.-built Rambler, of over 4.2 million cars that carried the Rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in Kenosha, was produced on 30 June 1969.

==Rambler 1970–1983==

The Rambler marque was continued in all international markets after it was dropped in the United States. AMC vehicles were badged as “Rambler&quot; in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Venezuela, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. In Argentina, a unique model based on the third-generation Rambler American became the IKA Torino in 1967. It was later named the Renault Torino and produced until 1981. The Rambler nameplate was last used on automobiles in 1983 by Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) in Mexico.

==Trademark==
American Motors stopped producing cars using the Rambler trademark in 1970. In 1973, Action Age Incorporated wanted to register &quot;Scrambler&quot; for an off-highway vehicle and, in a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, contended that the trademark Rambler had been abandoned. This registration was opposed by AMC and the court determined that even though the manufacturing of Ramblers ended, the trademark was not abandoned because AMC continued to have commercial activities such as parts with the Rambler name on the boxes as well as franchising dealers that retained Rambler in their name or marketed used cars under the Rambler trademark./

The Rambler trademark registration expired on 12 December 1994, because Chrysler (the company that acquired AMC in 1987) did not file an affidavit of continued use. However, it was claimed by Chrysler as a retro or heritage mark that &quot;had built an affinity and emotional connection with the consumer as a result of the original product that was in the marketplace, and continues to have nostalgia appeal with consumers who are still interested in acquiring products built around the mark’s core values and replicates the markets and the mark itself.&quot; In a 2008 case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, the United States Patent and Trademark Office determined that Chrysler continued to have products licensed in connection with the Rambler mark for automobiles and thus sufficiently related to automobiles so that consumers would ascribe a single source to the products. Chrysler, as the successor company, was able to &quot;prove non-abandonment by demonstrating that there were many Rambler cars (and related supplies) bearing the mark still in use. The board ruled that Chrysler &quot;has priority of use, at the very least with respect to key rings, calendars, decals, specification sheets, and owner&#x27;s manuals, all relating to Rambler automobiles.&quot;

<doc id="176594" wikidata="Q305202" url="?curid=176594" title="Stephen Foster">
<text>Stephen Collins Foster (July 4, 1826January 13, 1864), known as &quot;the father of American music&quot;, was an American composer known primarily for his parlour and folk music during the Romantic period. He wrote more than 200 songs, including &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;, &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot;, &quot;Camptown Races&quot;, &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; (&quot;Swanee River&quot;), &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;, &quot;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair&quot;, &quot;Old Black Joe&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;. Many of his compositions remain popular today.

==Early life==

There are many biographies of Foster, but details differ widely. Among other issues, Foster wrote very little biographical information himself, and his brother Morrison Foster may have destroyed much information that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family.

Foster was born on July 4, 1826, in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania. His parents, William Barclay Foster and Eliza Clayland Tomlinson Foster, were of Ulster Scots and English descent. He had three older sisters and six older brothers. He attended private academies in Allegheny, Athens, and Towanda, Pennsylvania, and received an education in English grammar, diction, the classics, penmanship, Latin, Greek, and mathematics.

Foster taught himself to play the clarinet, guitar, flute, and piano. In 1839, his brother William was serving his apprenticeship as an engineer at Towanda and thought that Stephen would benefit from being under the supervision of Henry Kleber (1816–1897), a German-born music dealer in Pittsburgh. Under Kleber, Stephen was exposed to music composition. Together the pair studied the works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Mendelssohn and Schubert.

The site of the Camptown Races – which would provide both the title and setting for events of one of Foster&#x27;s best-known songs – was located from Athens and from Towanda. Foster&#x27;s education included a brief period at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, now part of Washington &amp; Jefferson College. His tuition was paid, but he had little spending money. He left Canonsburg to visit Pittsburgh with another student and did not return.

==Career==
Foster married Jane Denny McDowell on July 22, 1850, and they visited New York and Baltimore on their honeymoon. Foster then returned to Pennsylvania and wrote most of his best-known songs: &quot;Camptown Races&quot; (1850), &quot;Nelly Bly&quot; (1850), &quot;Ring de Banjo&quot; (1851), &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; (known also as &quot;Swanee River&quot;, 1851), &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; (1853), &quot;Old Dog Tray&quot; (1853), and &quot;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair&quot; (1854), written for his wife Jane.

Many of Foster&#x27;s songs were used in the blackface minstrel shows popular at the time. He sought to &quot;build up taste...among refined people by making words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order&quot;. However, Foster&#x27;s output of minstrel songs declined after the early 1850s, as he turned primarily to parlor music. Many of his songs had Southern themes, yet Foster never lived in the South and visited it only once, during his 1852 honeymoon. Available archival evidence does not suggest that Foster was an abolitionist.

Foster&#x27;s last four years were spent in New York City. There is little information on this period of his life, although family correspondence has been preserved.

==Illness and death==
Foster became sick with a fever in January 1864. Weakened, it is possible he fell in his hotel in the Bowery and cut his neck; he may also have sought to take his own life. His writing partner George Cooper found him still alive but lying in a pool of blood. Foster died in Bellevue Hospital three days later at the age of 37. His leather wallet contained a scrap of paper that simply said, &quot;Dear friends and gentle hearts&quot;, along with 37 cents in Civil War scrip and three pennies.

Other biographers describe different accounts of his death. Historian JoAnne O&#x27;Connell speculates in her biography, &quot;The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster&quot;, that Foster may have killed himself. As O&#x27;Connell and musicologist Ken Emerson have noted, several of the songs Foster wrote during the last years of his life foreshadow his death, such as &quot;The Little Ballad Girl&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me Dear Mother Ere I Die.&quot; Emerson says in his 2010 &quot;Stephen Foster and Co.&quot; that Foster&#x27;s injuries may have been &quot;accidental or self-inflicted&quot;.

The note inside Foster&#x27;s wallet is said to have inspired Bob Hilliard&#x27;s lyric for &quot;Dear Hearts and Gentle People&quot; (1949). Foster was buried in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. After his death, Morrison Foster became his &quot;literary executor&quot;. As such, he answered requests for copies of manuscripts, autographs, and biographical information. After his death, &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;, one of the best-loved of his works, was posthumously published in 1864.

==Music==
Foster grew up in Lawrenceville, now a neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where many European immigrants had settled and were accustomed to hearing the music of the Italian, Scots-Irish, and German residents. He composed his first song when he was 14 and entitled it the &quot;Tioga Waltz&quot;. The first song that he had published was &quot;Open thy Lattice Love&quot; (1844). He wrote songs in support of drinking, such as &quot;My Wife Is a Most Knowing Woman&quot;, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Brown&quot;, and &quot;When the Bowl Goes Round&quot;, while also composing temperance songs such as &quot;Comrades Fill No Glass for Me&quot; or &quot;The Wife&quot;.

Foster also authored many church hymns, although the inclusion of his hymns in hymnals ended by 1910. Some of the hymns are &quot;Seek and ye shall find&quot;, &quot;All around is bright and fair, While we work for Jesus&quot;, and &quot;Blame not those who weep and sigh&quot;. Several rare Civil War-era hymns by Foster were performed by The Old Stoughton Musical Society Chorus, including &quot;The Pure, The Bright, The Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Over The River&quot;, &quot;Give Us This Day&quot;, and &quot;What Shall The Harvest Be?&quot;. He also arranged many works by Mozart, Beethoven, Donizetti, Lanner, Weber and Schubert for flute and guitar.

Foster usually sent his handwritten scores directly to his publishers. The publishers kept the sheet music manuscripts and did not give them to libraries nor return them to his heirs. Some of his original, hand-written scores were bought and put into private collections and the Library of Congress.
===Popular songs===
&quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; is the official state song of Kentucky, adopted by the General Assembly on March 19, 1928.

Foster&#x27;s songs, lyrics, and melodies have often been altered by publishers and performers.

In 1957 Ray Charles released a version of &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; that was titled &quot;Swanee River Rock (Talkin’ ’Bout That River)&quot;, which became his first pop hit that November.

In the 2000s &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, designated the official state song of Florida in 1935, came under attack for what some regarded as offensive terms in the song&#x27;s lyrics. Changes were made to them with the approval of the Stephen Foster Memorial. The modified song was kept as the official state song, while &quot;Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)&quot; was added as the state anthem.

A 1974 published collection, &quot;Stephen Foster Song Book; Original Sheet Music of 40 Songs&quot; (New York : Dover Publications, Inc.,) of Stephen Foster&#x27;s popular songs was edited by musicologist Richard Jackson.

== Legacy ==
===Musical influence===
 Many early filmmakers selected Foster&#x27;s songs for their work because his copyrights had expired and cost them nothing.
* Professor of Folklore and musician John Minton wrote a song titled &quot;Stephen C. Foster&#x27;s Blues&quot;.
* Walt Kelly recorded an a cappella rendition of Foster&#x27;s &quot;Old Dog Tray&quot; on the 1956 album, &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot;. Kelly regularly referenced &quot;Old Dog Tray&quot; as the theme song for his character, Beauregard Hound Dog, from his comic strip, &quot;Pogo&quot;.
* Erika M. Anderson, of the band EMA, refers to Foster&#x27;s &quot;Camptown Races&quot; in the song &quot;California&quot;, from &quot;past Life Martyred Saints&quot; (2011): &quot;I bet my money on the bobtail nag/somebody bet on the bay.&quot;
* The Firesign Theatre makes many references to Foster&#x27;s compositions in their CD, &quot;Boom Dot Bust&quot; (1999, Rhino Records)
* Larry Kirwan of Black 47 mixes the music of Foster with his own in the musical &quot;Hard Times&quot;, which earned a &quot;New York Times&quot; accolade in its original run: &quot;a knockout entertainment&quot;. Kirwan gives a contemporary interpretation of Foster&#x27;s troubled later years and sets it in the tumultuous time of the New York draft riots and the Irish–Negro relations of the period. A revival ran at the Cell Theater in New York in early 2014, and a revised version of the musical called &quot;Paradise Square&quot; opened at Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2018.
* Gordon Lightfoot wrote a song in 1970 titled &quot;Your Love&#x27;s Return (Song for Stephen Foster)&quot;
* Randy Newman&#x27;s 1970 album &quot;12 Songs&quot; contained Newman&#x27;s song &quot;Old Kentucky Home&quot; (originally titled &quot;Turpentine and Dandelion Wine&quot;), which is based on Foster&#x27;s &quot;My Old Kentucky Home, Good-Night!&quot; Newman told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, &quot;It&#x27;s a good song because Stephen Foster wrote the hook, that&#x27;s why.&quot; Under various titles, Newman&#x27;s &quot;Old Kentucky Home&quot; was covered by the Beau Brummels, the Alan Price Set and Johnny Cash.
* Spike Jones recorded a comedy send-up &quot;I Dream of Brownie with the Light Blue Jeans&quot;.
* Humorist Stan Freberg imagined a 1950s style version of Foster&#x27;s music in &quot;Rock Around Stephen Foster&quot; and, with Harry Shearer, had a sketch about Foster having writer&#x27;s block in a bit from his &quot;United States of America&quot; project.
* Songwriter Tom Shaner mentions Stephen Foster meeting up with Eminem&#x27;s alter ego &quot;Slim Shady&quot; on the Bowery in Shaner&#x27;s song &quot;Rock &amp; Roll is A Natural Thing&quot;.
* The music of Stephen Foster was an early influence on the Australian composer Percy Grainger, who stated that hearing &quot;Camptown Races&quot; sung by his mother was one of his earliest musical recollections. He went on to write a piece entitled &quot;Tribute to Foster&quot;, a composition for mixed choir, orchestra, and pitched wine glasses based on the melody of &quot;Camptown Races&quot;.
* Art Garfunkel was cast as Stephen Foster and sang his songs in an elementary school play in Queens, New York 
* Foster&#x27;s name is included in the rapid fire litany of musicians and songs that make up the lyrics of the 1974 pop novelty song &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)&quot; by Reunion.
* Neil Sedaka wrote and recorded a song about Foster and released it on his 1975 album, &quot;The Hungry Years&quot;.
* Alternative country duo The Handsome Family&#x27;s song &quot;Wildebeest&quot;, from their 2013 album &quot;Wilderness&quot;, is about Foster&#x27;s death.
* Squirrel Nut Zippers wrote and recorded a song in 1998 titled &quot;The Ghost of Stephen Foster&quot;.
* Stace England released in April 2024, as part of the group Foster&#x27;s Satchel, a full-length album entitled &quot;Over the River: Stephen Foster Reimagined&quot;.

===Television===
* Two television shows about the life of Foster and his childhood friend (and later wife) Jane MacDowell were produced in Japan, the first in 1979 with 13 episodes, and the second from 1992 to 1993 with 52 episodes; both were titled &quot;Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair&quot; after the song of the same name.
* In the &quot;Honeymooners&quot; episode, &quot;The $99,000 Answer&quot;, Ralph Kramden studies decades&#x27; worth of popular songs for his upcoming appearance on a television game show. Before each song, Ed Norton warms up on the piano by playing the opening to &quot;Swanee River&quot;. On the program, Ralph is asked his first question for just 100 dollars: &quot;Who is the composer of &#x27;Swanee River&#x27;?&quot; Ralph freezes, then nervously responds &quot;Ed Norton?&quot; and loses.
* In a &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot; segment of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, Aladdin finds a lamp with a female genie with light brown hair, who immediately asks, &quot;Are you Stephen Foster?&quot;
* Lucille Ball, in an episode of The Lucy Show, announces that she is about to play a record called &quot;Bing Crosby Sings Stephen Foster.&quot; A Crosby impressionist is heard singing (to the melody of &quot;Camptown Races&quot;) &quot;A-bum-bum-bum-bum bum-bum-bum, Stephen, Foster...&quot;

===Film===
* Three Hollywood films have been made of Foster&#x27;s life: &quot;Harmony Lane&quot; (1935) with Douglass Montgomery, &quot;Swanee River&quot; (1939) with Don Ameche, and &quot;I Dream of Jeanie&quot; (1952), with Bill Shirley. The 1939 production was one of Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s more ambitious efforts, filmed in Technicolor; the other two were low-budget affairs made by B-movie studios.
* In the film &quot;Tombstone&quot; (1993), Billy Clanton (played by Thomas Haden Church) tries to bait Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), who is playing a Chopin nocturne on the piano, by saying, &quot;Is that &#x27;Old Dog Tray&#x27;? That sounds like &#x27;Old Dog Tray&#x27; to me.&quot; When the goad fails, Clanton asks whether Doc knows any other songs, like &quot;&#x27;Camptown Races?&#x27;, &#x27;Oh Susanna&#x27;, &quot;You know, Stephen stinkin&#x27; Foster?!?&quot;
* In the film &quot;A Million Ways to Die in the West&quot;, Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s character, Albert can&#x27;t get Foster&#x27;s song &quot;If You&#x27;ve Only Got a Mustache&quot;, from the previous scene, out of his head. Charlize Theron&#x27;s character suggests singing a different song, to which he replies, &quot;There are only like 3 songs&quot;, and she adds &quot;And they&#x27;re all by Stephen Foster.&quot;
* In the 1949 film &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; the character Jill Young (Terry Moore) is able to calm her pet 12-foot-tall gorilla by whistling or playing &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot;.
*In the movie Frankie and Johnny (1966) starring Elvis Presley - Johnny (Elvis character) talking to Cully (played by Harry Morgan - M*A*S*H) when reviewing a song says &quot;Let&#x27;s hear it Stephen Foster&quot;

===Other events===
* &quot;Stephen Foster! Super Saturday&quot; is a day of thoroughbred racing during the Spring/Summer meet at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. During the call to the post, selections of Stephen Foster songs are played by the track bugler, Steve Buttleman. The day is headlined by the Stephen Foster Handicap, a Grade I dirt race for older horses at 9 furlongs.
* Taylor Mac&#x27;s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music includes a &quot;Father of American Music Smackdown&quot; in hour eight putting Foster&#x27;s more problematic qualities up against the figure of Walt Whitman. 
* 36 U.S.C. §140 designates January 13 as Stephen Foster Memorial Day, a United States National Observance. In 1936, Congress authorized the minting of a silver half dollar in honor of the Cincinnati Musical Center. Foster was featured on the obverse of the coin.
* &quot;Stephen Foster Music Camp&quot; is a summer music camp held on EKU&#x27;s campus of Richmond, Kentucky. The camp offers piano courses, choir, band, and orchestra ensembles.

===Art===

* A public sculpture by Giuseppe Moretti honoring Foster and commemorating his song &quot;Old Uncle Ned&quot; sat in close proximity to the Stephen Foster Memorial until 2018. The statue was removed following complaints about the banjo-playing slave seated next to Foster.
* In Alms Park in Cincinnati, overlooking the Ohio River, there is a seated statue of him.
* The Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx, overlooking the Harlem River, has a bronze bust of him by artist Walker Hancock. Added in 1940, he is among only 98 honorees from 15 classes of distinguished men and women.
* In My Old Kentucky Home State Park in Bardstown, Kentucky, a musical, called &quot;The Stephen Foster Story&quot; has been performed since 1958. There is also a statue of him next to the Federal Hill mansion, where he visited relatives and which is the inspiration for &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. A painting by Howard Chandler Christy entitled, &quot;Stephen Foster and the Angel of Genius&quot; is on display in the park&#x27;s art collection. The painting inspired Florence Foster Jenkins to author a tableau in which she personally plays the role of the angel depicted in Christy&#x27;s painting. The scene was featured in the film &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot; in 2016.

==Accolades and honors==

Foster is honored on the University of Pittsburgh campus with the Stephen Foster Memorial, a landmark building that houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum, the Center for American Music, as well as two theaters: the Charity Randall Theatre and Henry Heymann Theatre, both performance spaces for Pitt&#x27;s Department of Theater Arts. It is the largest repository for original Stephen Foster compositions, recordings, and other memorabilia his songs have inspired worldwide.

Two state parks are named in Foster&#x27;s honor: the Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park in White Springs, Florida, and Stephen C. Foster State Park in Georgia. Both parks are on the Suwannee River. Stephen Foster Lake at Mt. Pisgah State Park in Pennsylvania is named after him.

One state park is named in honor of Foster&#x27;s songs, My Old Kentucky Home State Park, a historic mansion formerly named Federal Hill, located in Bardstown, Kentucky, where Foster is said to have been an occasional visitor according to his brother, Morrison Foster. The park dedicated a bronze statue in honor of Stephen&#x27;s work.

The Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh) Historical Society, together with the Allegheny Cemetery Historical Association, hosts the annual Stephen Foster Music and Heritage Festival (Doo Dah Days!). Held the first weekend of July, Doo Dah Days! celebrates the life and music of one of the most influential songwriters in America&#x27;s history. His home in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, still remains on Penn Avenue nearby the Stephen Foster Community Center.

==Statue controversy and later views==
A 1900 statue of Foster by Giuseppe Moretti was located in Schenley Plaza, in Pittsburgh, from 1940 until 2018. On the unanimous recommendation of the Pittsburgh Art Commission, the statue was removed on April 26, 2018. Its new home has not yet been determined. It has a long reputation as the most controversial public art in Pittsburgh &quot;for its depiction of an African-American banjo player at the feet of the seated composer. Critics say the statue glorifies white appropriation of black culture and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist.&quot; A city-appointed Task Force on Women in Public Art called for the statue to be replaced with one honoring an African American woman with ties to the Pittsburgh community. The Task Force held a series of community forums in Pittsburgh to collect public feedback on the statue replacement and circulated an online form which allowed the public to vote for one of seven previously selected candidates or write in an alternate suggestion. However, the Task Force on Women in Public Art and the Pittsburgh Art Commission have not reached an agreement as to who will be commemorated or if the statue will stay in the Schenley Plaza location.

The musicologist Ken Emerson has suggested that some of Foster&#x27;s songs are &quot;a source of racial embarrassment and infuriation.&quot;

<text>Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm is a amusement park in Buena Park, California, United States, owned and operated by Six Flags. In March 2015, it was ranked as the twelfth-most-visited theme park in North America, while averaging approximately 4 million visitors per year. The park features over 40 rides, including roller coasters, family rides, dark rides, and water rides.

Walter and Cordelia Knott first settled in Buena Park in 1920. The park began as a roadside berry stand run by Walter Knott along State Route 39 in California. By the 1940s, a restaurant, several shops, and other attractions had been constructed on the property to entertain a growing number of visitors, including a replica ghost town. The site continued its transformation into a modern amusement park over the next two decades, and an admission charge was added in 1968. In 1997, the park was sold to Cedar Fair for $300 million.

==History==
===Origin===

The park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning in 1923, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In June 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later named &quot;Mrs. Knott&#x27;s Chicken Dinner Restaurant.&quot; The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. Ghost Town was Walter Knott&#x27;s tribute to the pioneers, which included his own grandparents who came to California in a covered wagon from Texas in 1868 (when his mother was about four years old). The idea of an amusement park picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a &quot;summer-long county fair.&quot;

Paul von Klieben was Walter Knott&#x27;s key employee in the creation of the Ghost Town at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm and the restoration of the ghost town of Calico, California. In 1941, he joined Knott&#x27;s as a staff artist, then served as art director there from 1943 to 1953. He traveled to ghost towns in the West, conducted research, and designed most of the Ghost Town section of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. He created concept art for most of the buildings that were built there. He also drew up floor plans, oversaw the construction of buildings, and even spent some time painting concrete to look like natural rock. His Old West paintings and murals adorned the walls of many structures in the park, and a number of them still do. His art was also used extensively in Knott&#x27;s newspapers, menus, brochures, catalogs and other publications.

In 1956, Walter Knott arranged with Marion Speer to bring his Western Trails Museum collection to Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. Speer had been an enthusiastic supporter of Walter Knott&#x27;s efforts to create Ghost Town, and had written articles for Knott&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Ghost Town News.&quot; In 1956, twenty years after creating his museum, Marion Speer (at age 72) donated the carefully cataloged collection of 30,000 items to Knott&#x27;s in return for Knott&#x27;s housing it, displaying it and naming Speer as curator. Speer continued in that position until he retired in 1969 at the age of 84.
The museum was once housed in a building (which has since been razed) at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm between Jeffries Barn (now known as the Wilderness Dance Hall) and the schoolhouse. The Western Trails Museum at Knott&#x27;s is now just south of the saloon in Ghost Town.

The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there. According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense:

In the late 1960s, a brick wall with barbed wire embedded into the top was constructed around &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and for the first time, in 1968, an admission price was required to get into that section of the park (ostensibly to keep out the &quot;hippies&quot; and local long-haired youth from freely &quot;hanging out&quot; in the park that were, on occasion, causing problems and degrading the Knott&#x27;s &quot;family&quot; image). The entrance price originally being set at $1 for adults and 25¢ for children. Previous to this, entry was free and the cost was based on purchasing a ticket for each ride, using the A-E ticketing system similar to that of Disneyland. The Calico Log Ride (the original name of the Timber Mountain Log Ride) opened in 1969. Also during this period, an attempt to create a monorail system between Knott&#x27;s and Disneyland was reportedly in the works for many years, however, project construction never began due to costs and legal issues obtaining needed property and gaining necessary right-of-way access.

When Cordelia Knott died on April 12, 1974, Walter turned his attention toward political causes. The Roaring Twenties rethemed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, and Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales. Then with the northward expansion of a 1920s-era Knott&#x27;s Airfield-themed area featuring the Cloud 9 Dance Hall, Sky Cabin/Sky Jump and Motorcycle Chase steeplechase roller coaster above the electric guided rail Gasoline Alley car ride.

The Sky Tower with the illuminated &quot;K&quot; in logo script at the top was built to support two attractions, the Sky Jump, operated from 1976 to 1999, and the Sky Cabin. The Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, twelve arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. Its ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. It is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25+ mph or rain it is closed. When built, the tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)

The Motorcycle Chase, a modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike-themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together. One or two riders straddled each &quot;Indian motorcycle&quot; attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in &quot;the road&quot; and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guide rail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value. Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be rethemed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles themed to look like soap box racers, each seating two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close-fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980. Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed in 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.

On December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott&#x27;s as a family business for another fourteen years.

In the 1980s, Knott&#x27;s built the Calico Barn Dance featured Bobbi &amp; Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; era. The &quot;Calico Barn Dance&quot; was featured in Knott&#x27;s TV commercials.
During the 1980s, Knott&#x27;s met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions: Kingdom of the Dinosaurs, a primeval retheme of Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales), in 1987 and Bigfoot Rapids in 1988, a whitewater river rafting ride as the centerpiece of the new themed area Wild Water Wilderness.

The Boomerang roller coaster replaced Corkscrew in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and from through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.

The &quot;Mystery Lodge&quot; (1994), inspired by General Motors &quot;Spirit Lodge&quot; pavilion, was a live show augmented with Pepper&#x27;s ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia. Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in Alert Bay, then guests &quot;move inside&quot; the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.

The Jaguar! was opened on June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma&#x27;s Revenge.

===New owners===
In the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses.

In 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Inc, which later resold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008. In 2024, Smuckers discontinued sale of the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm jams in grocery stores.

On December 29, 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney&#x27;s America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear that most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.

In the late 1990s, Cedar Fair also acquired the Buena Park Hotel, located at the northwest corner of Grand and Crescent avenues. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm Resort Hotel.

===Post-Cedar Fair acquisition===


Since being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of several large roller coasters and the addition of a record-breaking Shoot-the-Chutes ride named Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed. Also, in 2013, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm announced that one of the most popular rides at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a significant five-month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.

On May 25, 2013, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of the former Perilous Plunge, including a wild mouse called Coast Rider, a scrambler flat ride called Pacific Scrambler, and Surfside Gliders. All three were constructed in the Boardwalk section of the park. An old bridge that connected the exit of Coast Rider and the Boardwalk became the entrance to Surfside Gliders and Pacific Scrambler. Following the 2013 season, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm removed Windseeker and moved it to Worlds of Fun, where it reopened in 2014. For the 2014 season, the historical Calico Mine Ride underwent a major refurbishment completed in six months.

During the fall of 2019, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm announced the return of Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales as an interactive 4D dark ride as part of the park&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2020 with the name Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair. However, the park was indefinitely shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of its operating day on March 13, 2020. Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales and other planned changes to the park were postponed to 2021. In June 2020, Knott&#x27;s Marketplace reopened with health guidelines in place. The following month, the park introduced &quot;Taste of Calico&quot;, an outdoor food festival on weekends located in the Ghost Town section of the park. The event evolved over the season, becoming &quot;Taste of Knott&#x27;s&quot; when it expanded into Fiesta Village and the Boardwalk, &quot;Taste of Fall-o-ween&quot; during the fall season, and &quot;Taste of Merry Farm&quot; for the Christmas holiday season which was canceled in December 2020 due to the regional stay at home order issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Amusement Today recognized the &quot;Taste Of&quot; events in its annual Golden Ticket Awards, awarding the park under the category &quot;Industry Leader: Amusement/Theme Park&quot; for its innovative approach.

Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm returned to normal operation on May 6, 2021, including the debut of the delayed Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales attraction originally planned for 2020. On July 1, 2024, Cedar Fair merged with Six Flags, and the combined Six Flags Entertainment Corporation took over Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, making them part of the same company as longtime rival Six Flags Magic Mountain. Cedar Fair still has controlling shares of the company.

==Annual park events==
The park&#x27;s annual &quot;Knott&#x27;s Scary Farm&quot; has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD &quot;Season of Screams.&quot; Initially, fake corpses and other static figures were rented from a Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott&#x27;s, decided that this wasn&#x27;t enough. He dressed up in a gorilla suit and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly. During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a &quot;haunted house&quot; style attraction in the form of mazes and &quot;scare zones&quot; in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scattered—often hidden out of view—throughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the Green Witch, which was portrayed by Charlene Parker from 1983 to 2017, the longest of any performer. Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park&#x27;s new owners due to their wanting a more family-friendly appeal. She returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event then again featured in her nightly show from 2014 to 2017. During October, Knott&#x27;s Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm&#x27;s fiscal year.

&quot;Season of Screams&quot; is a DVD produced by an independent company that traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.

&quot;Winter Coaster Solace&quot; is an event that takes place on the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide &quot;solace&quot; to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind-the-scenes tours of the rides.

A Christmas event known as &quot;Knott&#x27;s Merry Farm&quot; also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcraft exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was created by Gary Salisbury in the fall of 1985.

Praise has been a Christian-themed celebration presented for many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

A boysenberry festival is held at Knott&#x27;s that has food and drink prepared in a variety of ways with boysenberries. There are also special shows and music for the multi-week event.

==Areas and attractions==

The park consists of four themed areas:
* Ghost Town
* Fiesta Village
* The Boardwalk
* Camp Snoopy

===Ghost Town===
Ghost Town is based on the ghost town of Calico, California and other real ghost towns in the Western United States. Walter Knott inherited his uncle&#x27;s silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee.

Craftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glassblower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow-gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.

The Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre is an old-fashioned theater in Ghost Town. It only hosts two seasonal entertainments—during &quot;Knott&#x27;s Merry Farm&quot;, which includes two small productions: &quot;Marley&#x27;s Wings&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, for the 2021 season, and &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; and &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; for the 2022 season, and as well as a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, a Knott&#x27;s Merry Farm Christmas skit with singing, those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. The Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean&#x27;s combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical &quot;genuine illegal hitchin&#x27;&quot; alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.

The park formerly featured a 5th area. Formerly known as Wild Water Wilderness, now part of Ghost Town, the area features two major rides: the Pony Express, a horse-themed family roller coaster installed in 2008 and Calico River Rapids, which opened in 1988 and was refurbished with a new theme for the 2019 season. Nearby Pony Express is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.

Western Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Calico River Rapids (formerly Bigfoot Rapids), still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand-powered horse-drawn fire engine to a miniature replica of a borax hauling &quot;Twenty Mule Team&quot; and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.

A common misconception is that at Knott&#x27;s the terms &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Calico&quot; are interchangeable, but that is not the case. Walter Knott explained that he built Ghost Town as a composite to represent ghost towns throughout the West, rather than as a replica of any one particular ghost town. The Calico Saloon was not named &quot;Ghost Town&quot; because it is supposedly located in Calico. Rather, it was named for the tradition of lining Gold-Rush-era buildings with red calico fabric. Also, the Ghost Town &amp; Calico Railroad was named because &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Calico&quot; are two separate places. Walter Knott always referred to the Old West section of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm as &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, not &quot;Calico.&quot;

Some parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.


===Fiesta Village===
Fiesta Village was built in 1969 under the pretense of a Mexican theme. It was built to pay tribute to California&#x27;s Spanish and Mexican heritage. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho&#x27;s Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and themed rides like La Revolución, Jaguar!, and MonteZOOMa: The Forbidden Fortress, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.


===The Boardwalk===
Boardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a three-point challenge, baseball, and test your strength. Hawkers pitch a variety of traditional games as well, such as water racers, bucket toss, whack a mole, and ping pong toss. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge – one of Knott&#x27;s major thrill rides – closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. The boardwalk reopened a year later with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the place of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster was repainted in green and yellow. Boomerang was removed in 2017 to make way for HangTime.

At the south end of the boardwalk is the family interactive dark ride: Knott&#x27;s Bear-y Tales: Return to the Fair. The world&#x27;s largest Johnny Rockets restaurant is located at Knott&#x27;s Boardwalk, featuring over of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests. Also located in The Boardwalk is the 2000-seat Walter Knott Theatre hosting seasonal offerings, notably the ice-skating show &quot;Snoopy&#x27;s Night Before Christmas&quot;, with several different ice shows in the past, one of which, &quot;Merry Christmas Snoopy!&quot; relocated to California&#x27;s Great America, another Cedar Fair park. It was renamed in 2020 from the Charles M. Schulz Theater to the Walter Knott Theater, as part of a refurbishment of the exterior for the park&#x27;s 100th anniversary, which also included new LED signage to the theater&#x27;s marquee.

===Camp Snoopy===

Camp Snoopy is home to the park&#x27;s family and children&#x27;s rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park&#x27;s more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz&#x27; &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at some of Six Flags&#x27;s parks. For guests who cannot ride the park&#x27;s more aggressive and thrilling rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. Except for Sierra Sidewinder, the rides are relatively tame.
Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm also built the Mall of America&#x27;s indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott&#x27;s or Cedar Fair and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.

On November 22, 2013, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy received a makeover for its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm opened up new rides in Camp Snoopy.

The narrow-gauge Beagle Express takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet. As part of the 30th Anniversary makeover, the train ride received a series of Peanuts vignettes (made by Garner Holt Productions) along the track and narration by the character Linus.

Knott&#x27;s has portrait artists, as well as face painters and caricature artists in two different locations in Camp Snoopy operated by Kaman&#x27;s Art Shoppes. Portrait artists have a long history at Knott&#x27;s, dating back to 1951. Claude Bell, who created the concrete characters on the benches at Knott&#x27;s, operated the portrait concession from 1951 to 1986. Bell also sculpted the minuteman statue on display at Independence Hall.


===Indian Trails===
Located next to the &quot;Bottle House&quot; in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance.

===Public area===
Many of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things that would no longer be considered interesting to today&#x27;s audience, or things that were merely decorative. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington&#x27;s Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.

====East property====
The east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott&#x27;s Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complimentary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.

==Former attractions==

===FearVR: 5150 controversy===
For Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm introduced &quot;FearVR: 5150&quot;, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding its perceived negative portrayal of mental illness. The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients. The initial controversy came from the attraction&#x27;s name, with 5150 referring to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150, the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined &quot;a danger to themselves or others&quot;. It also referenced the fact that guests experiencing the attraction had their arms strapped to a chair as part of the experience. The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair&#x27;s use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it &quot;transmogrified into spooky entertainment&quot;. In response, Cedar Fair removed &quot;5150&quot; from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, six days after its debut. A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition&#x27;s organizer stating that Cedar Fair should not be &quot;forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction&quot;.

==Knott&#x27;s Soak City==

Knott&#x27;s Soak City is a water park. It opened on June 17, 2000, as Soak City U.S. It requires separate admission from Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. In addition to the water park across the street from the main theme park, Cedar Fair also formerly owned two other Knott&#x27;s Soak City Parks, in Palm Springs and Chula Vista.

==Private police force==
For much of the park&#x27;s early history, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm had a unique arrangement with the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department where the park&#x27;s security officers were sworn special deputies vested with full police powers. The Security Department, however, did not answer to the county sheriff, but rather to the park&#x27;s Chief of Security (who for many years was Steve Knott, the grandson of Walter Knott). Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm maintained a completely private police force, vested with full police powers, and overseen by park management.

Before the City of Buena Park was incorporated, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm&#x27;s Security Department even provided police services to the nearby unincorporated area that would eventually become known as Buena Park, including writing traffic tickets. Then, in the early days of the incorporated City of Buena Park, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm Security provided vital mutual aid assistance to the Buena Park Police Department (formerly Buena Park Public Safety) during emergencies since Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm&#x27;s 34 sworn Special Deputies outnumbered, and were better equipped than the city&#x27;s four-man Department of Public Safety.

The Orange County Sheriff Department discontinued this arrangement in the late 1980s but Knott&#x27;s still maintains its own private (albeit unsworn) security force, and its &quot;Station-K&quot; public safety radio designation.

==Fast Lane==
Fast Lane is a limited-access line queue system offered for an additional charge at Six Flags amusement parks. Visitors can purchase a wristband that allows them to bypass standard lines in favor of shorter ones at many of the parks&#x27; most popular attractions.

==Food products==
The J.M. Smucker Company continued to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family for several years; however, other products, such as the syrups, were phased out due to low demand.

In November 2013, Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm began selling its &quot;Berry Market&quot; brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all-natural. They are unable to use &quot;Knott&#x27;s&quot; on the label since Smucker&#x27;s owns the rights to the name.

In January 2024, Smucker&#x27;s discontinued the rest of the Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm brand after low sales.

==Public transportation==
Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm can easily be accessed by various public transportation services. Service is available by the Los Angeles Metro, the Orange County Transportation Authority, and Anaheim Resort Transit. Bus routes serving the park include Metro Express Line 460 which provides direct express service between Downtown Los Angeles and Disneyland OCTA bus routes 29, 38 and 529 and Anaheim Resort Transit route 18.

<doc id="176610" wikidata="Q1425792" url="?curid=176610" title="Log flume">
<text>A log flume or lumber flume is a watertight flume constructed to transport lumber and logs down mountainous terrain using flowing water. Flumes replaced horse- or oxen-drawn carriages on dangerous mountain trails in the late 19th century. Logging operations preferred flumes whenever a reliable source of water was available. Flumes were cheaper to build and operate than logging railroads. They could span long distances across chasms with more lightweight trestles.

Flumes remained in widespread use through the early 20th century. The logging truck replaced both the logging railroad and the flume after WWII. Today, log flumes remain in the popular imagination as amusement park rides.

==History==
J. W. Haines built the first successful lumber flume in 1859. The v-shaped trough brought a half-million feet of lumber daily from the eastern Sierra Nevada to the Comstock Lode. The route was between Lake Tahoe and Reno, terminating at the Virginia and Truckee Railroad terminus in Washoe Valley. Soon, log flumes spread across the mountains of the western United States as artificial rivers that brought lumber to market.

== Flume heads ==
Log flumes need a steady supply of water. Often, a log pond or artificial reservoir serves this purpose. The head directs the flow of water into the top of the flume. Flume boxes are built tight with lumber free of knots to prevent leaks. Feeder troughs resupply water on long routes.

Logging flumes were only needed in semi-arid regions without rivers or navigable streams. As a result, water rights were often difficult to secure. Often, flumes moved water from one drainage basin to another, with rights settled in court.

==Flume construction==

Flume routes were surveyed by engineers using the same methods as a railroad survey. However, flumes had several advantages to logging railroads in steep terrain. They could span gulches using much lighter trestles and they took up less space, fitting inside narrower canyons where there wasn’t room for a railroad. The main disadvantage of the light construction was they were damaged more easily by fire, floods, wind, and falling timber. But they could be repaired more cheaply.

Flume sites were mostly in rough, undeveloped wilderness. Unlike railroad construction, this required lumber and supplies to be carried in by hand. Flume boxes and trestles were built onsite. Construction crews included six to eight workers. On trestles, four worked aloft continuously. One low man handled and sent up the lumber.

Working on the flume was a dangerous job. Occupational fatality statistics are unavailable. But reports suggest that falls resulted in many injuries and deaths.

Square lumber was often provided by a temporary, portable sawmill erected at the head of the flume. Other times, round timber trestles of to diameter were cut and finished from along the route.

Some trestles achieved staggering heights to maintain a desirable grade. Three percent was ideal for a straight flume. Sometimes grades of up to 75 percent were used on short stretches. The steeper the grade the more gradual the curves had to be, or else lumber would jam or go over the sides. The maximum curve was 8 degrees.

===Box flumes===

Early logging flumes were square wooden chutes known as box flumes. These were prone to jams that could cause damage and required constant maintenance. They were also costly to build. A square box carries much more water compared to a V-shaped flume. The greater weight of the water required a sturdier structure, especially heavier trestles.

===V-flumes===
In 1867, James W. Haines first built the V-shaped log flumes that allowed a jammed log to free itself as the rising water level in the flume pushed it up. These efficient flumes consisted of two boards, wide and feet long, joined perpendicularly, and came in common use in the western United States during the late 19th century.

Box flumes were not made obsolete. They continued to be built when a large volume of water was desired for a secondary use, such as irrigation. Box flumes were also more capable of handling materials uneven in size and weight simultaneously. Lumber, pulpwood, shingle bolts, and whole logs move at different speeds and were prone to double-up in a V-flume’s low grades and curves. Finally, box flumes could move an unprecedented amount of material, up to a maximum capacity of , or three times as great as the maximum for a V-flume.

==Flume herders==
Proper operation was ensured by &quot;flume herders&quot; who at various locations along the flume checked the flow of lumber and water. On longer flumes, flume herders lived in permanent flume houses along the route. Light signals, and later telephone lines, enabled communication up and down the line.

=== Flume boats ===
On occasion, despite it being exceedingly dangerous, flume herders and others would ride down the flume in small craft or boats, either for inspection or for thrills. Such rides were the precursor of the modern log-ride amusement park attractions.

Every flume boat was one of a kind, but they shared common design characteristics. They were V-shaped to fit the flume trough. An open front allowed water in for stability in the curves. A closed back allowed water to push the craft forward. Flat boards across the top created a platform for passengers and cargo.

Top speed depended on the grade of the flume. Flume boats on the Sanger Lumber Company flume, the &quot;fastest chute in the world&quot;, traveled at . Boats traveled over steep trestles and curves with precipitous drops on either side without brakes or other means to slow the craft. Passengers described the sensation like &quot;rushing through space suspended between earth and sky&quot;.

==Flume terminals==
There are a variety of flume terminals. The kind of terminal depends on the materials the flume transports and its disposal at the end point of a flume.

An elephant terminal splits from a central trunk into many forked branches. From there, logs are diverted into open branches by closing branches not in use. Logs collect at the end of the terminal in a loose pile. Other terminals shoot logs onto rollers that move them onto loading platforms. The water from the flume drives a waterwheel that drives the rollers. This arrangement works well with heavy railroad crossties or mining timbers.

==Longest flumes==
In the late 19th century, three rival California lumber companies built log flumes of unprecedented and nearly identical length. Each served the same purpose: to link their logging operations in the Sierra Nevada to railroad shipping depots in the San Joaquin Valley.
* In 1877, The California Lumber Company completed a flume to connect the mill at Nelder Grove to the shipping depot at Madera.
* In 1890, the Kings River Lumber Company completed the Kings River Flume from the upper Kings River area to Sanger.
* In 1891, the Fresno Flume and Irrigation Company built a flume to connect the sawmill at Shaver Lake with the planing mill and shipping depot at Clovis.

All three were purported to be &quot;world&#x27;s longest flume&quot;. However, some measurements may have been exaggerated or subject to inaccurate surveying methods. Contemporary attempts at confirmation are inconclusive.

Logging trucks started to replace flumes in the 1910s. Trucks offered mobility, lower operating costs, and did not rely on the availability of water. Many of the great flumes fell into disrepair and were salvaged for lumber. By 1984, only one lumber flume was operating in the United States. The Broughton Lumber flume was a V-flume that transported rough-sawn lumber from Willard, Washington to a finishing mill in Hood, just west of the town of Underwood. The flume closed down on December 19, 1986.

<doc id="176611" wikidata="Q4157634" url="?curid=176611" title="Aging of Russia">
<text>Since the early 1990s, social and demographic changes in the Russian Federation, stemming from under the Soviet Union, led the country towards an aging population, often described in media as a &quot;demographic crisis&quot;.

== History ==

=== In the economic sphere ===
The demographic crisis has a positive economic effect on the second stage of the changing age structure of the population (the fraction of the average working-age generation is maximal at a relatively small proportion of younger and older) and a negative economic effect on the third stage of the changing age structure of the population (when the proportion of the older generation is maximal at a relatively small share younger and middle generation). By 2025, Russia will have labor shortages. 
With a reduced fertility rate, the load on the working population increases because each worker has to support more retirees.
==== Demographic aging of the population ====

Russia at the end of the 19th century was a country with a young population: the number of children significantly exceeded the number of the elderly. Up to 1938, the population of the Soviet Union remained &quot;demographically young&quot;, but later, since 1959, began its demographic ageing: the proportion of young age began to decline, and the elderly started to increase, which was the result of lower fertility. This was not unique to Russia, and such issues have been felt in many developed countries and increasingly in many developing countries as well.

Currently, the share of people aged 65 and older in the population of Russia is 13%. According to forecasts of the Russian Academy of Sciences from the early 2000s, in 2016 elderly people aged over 60 would have accounted for 20% of Russians, and children up to 15 years would only have made up 17%. However, in Russia, in contrast to other countries, aging is limited by high mortality among older people.

==== Population trends 2015–present ====
In 2020, over 500,000 deaths were attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the total deaths since its onset to approximately 700,000. Although 2021 was initially projected to have less impact on mortality, death rates still surpassed birth rates. President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s plan to overturn the stagnation was announced in 2017 in response to the downward trend. However the plan only partially helped in their demographic crisis and was hindered by the Pandemic, despite showing signs of recovery.

The natural population declined by 997,000 between October 2020 and September 2021 (the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths over a period). The natural death rate in January 2020, 2021, and 2022 have each been nearly double the natural birth rate.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the demographic crisis in the country has deepened, as the country has reportedly suffered high military fatalities while facing renewed brain drain and human capital flight caused by Western mass-sanctions and boycotts. Many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the 1990s.

In March 2023, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that &quot;Over the past three years the country has lost around 2 million more people than it would ordinarily have done, as a result of war [in Ukraine], disease and exodus.&quot; 

According to Russian economist Alexander Isakov, &quot;Russia’s population has been declining and the war will reduce it further. Reasons? Emigration, lower fertility and war-related casualties.&quot; Russian journalist Andrey Kolesnikov noted that &quot;We are seeing a phenomenon Russia has faced many times: wave after wave of wars and repression that drain away human resources.&quot;

The UN is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue, and if current demographic conditions persist, Russia’s population would be 120 million in fifty years, a decline of about 17%.

In January 2024, the Russian statistics agency Rosstat predicted that Russia’s population could drop to 130 million by 2046. The UN&#x27;s 2024 scenarios projected Russia&#x27;s population to be between 74 million and 112 million in 2100, a decline of 25 to 50%.

==Reactions==
Many Russian politicians have called for the reinstating of the Childless tax in Russia that it used to have from the 1940s until the 1990s, due to declining birth rates.

In August 2022, Russia revived the Soviet-era Mother Heroine award for women with 10 children.

<text>The boysenberry is a cross between the European raspberry (&quot;Rubus idaeus&quot;), European blackberry (&quot;Rubus fruticosus&quot;), American dewberry (&quot;Rubus aboriginum&quot;), and loganberry (&quot;Rubus&quot; × &quot;loganobaccus&quot;).

== Description ==
Boysenberries grow on low, trailing plants. It is a large aggregate fruit with a deep maroon color, weighing and containing large seeds. The fruits are characterized by their soft texture, thin skins, and sweet-tart flavor. Mature fruits leak juice very easily and can start to decay within a few days of harvest.

== Cultivation ==
The exact origins of the boysenberry are unclear, but the most definite records trace the plant as it is known today back to grower Rudolph Boysen, who obtained the dewberry–loganberry parent from the farm of John Lubben.

In the late 1920s, George M. Darrow of the United States Department of Agriculture began tracking down reports of a large, reddish-purple berry that had been grown on Boysen&#x27;s farm in Anaheim, California. Darrow enlisted the help of Walter Knott, another farmer, who was known as a berry expert. Knott had never heard of the new berry, but he agreed to help Darrow in his search.

Darrow and Knott learned that Boysen had abandoned his growing experiments several years earlier and sold his farm. Undaunted by this news, Darrow and Knott headed out to Boysen&#x27;s old farm, on which they found several frail vines surviving in a field choked with weeds. They transplanted the vines to Knott&#x27;s farm in Buena Park, California, where he nurtured them back to fruit-bearing health. Walter Knott was the first to commercially cultivate the berry in Southern California. 

He began selling the berries at his farm stand in 1932 and soon noticed that people kept returning to buy the large, tasty berries. When asked what they were called, Knott said, &quot;Boysenberries&quot;, after their originator. His family&#x27;s small restaurant and pie business eventually grew into Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm.

By 1940, of land in California were dedicated to boysenberries. The number dipped during World War II but peaked again in the 1950s at about , to the point where boysenberry crops exceeded those of the (previously) more common raspberry and blackberry. By the 1960s, the boysenberry began to fall out of favor due to a combination of being difficult to cultivate, susceptible to fungal diseases in coastal growing areas, and too soft and delicate to easily ship without damage, as well as having a short season of availability compared with newer cultivars. In the 1980s, breeding efforts in New Zealand combined cultivars and germplasm from California with Scottish sources to create five new thornless varieties.

As of the early 2000s, fresh boysenberries were generally only grown for market by smaller California farmers and sold from local farm stands and markets. Most commercially grown boysenberries, primarily from Oregon, are processed into other products such as jam, pie, juice, syrup, and ice cream. As of 2016, New Zealand was the world&#x27;s largest producer and exporter of boysenberries.

=== Cultivars ===
Since 2007, a hybrid variety called the &quot;Newberry&quot; or &quot;Ruby Boysen&quot;, was developed to overcome cultivation challenges that led to the decline in boysenberry popularity, and was marketed through farm markets and retailers in California. There is also a hybrid variety with marionberry called &quot;Silvanberry&quot; in Australia. Classed under the blackberry family, Silvanberry plants have many characteristics commonly found among other blackberry varieties. These plants are long living (15 to 20 years) perennials, hardy and cold tolerant, easy to grow, and productive spreaders.

The &#x27;Nectar&#x27; cultivar of boysenberry should not be confused with the nectarberry, &quot;Rubus arcticus&quot;, a plant native to arctic swamps.

<doc id="176614" wikidata="Q502405" url="?curid=176614" title="Amish friendship bread">
<text>Amish friendship bread is a type of bread or cake made from a sourdough starter that is often shared in a manner similar to a chain letter. The starter is a substitute for baking yeast and can be used to make many kinds of yeast-based breads, shared with friends, or frozen for future use. The sweet, cake-like Amish cinnamon bread is a common bread that is made from this starter; it is a simple, stirred quick bread that includes a substantial amount of sugar and vegetable oil, with a mild cinnamon flavor. It has characteristics of both pound cake and coffee cake. The flavor of the finished product can be altered by cinnamon being omitted.

A common recipe using this starter suggests using one cup (240 ml) of it to make bread, keeping one cup to start a new cycle, and giving the remaining three cups to friends. The process of sharing the starter makes it somewhat like a chain letter. One cup of starter makes one standard loaf of bread.

==History==
There is no reason to think that the sweet, cinnamon-flavored bread has any connection to the Amish people, although the name is taken from them. According to Elizabeth Coblentz, a member of the Old Order Amish and the author of the syndicated column &quot;The Amish Cook&quot;,
true Amish friendship bread is &quot;just sourdough bread that is passed around to the sick and needy&quot;.

The recipe for Amish cinnamon bread may have first been posted to the Internet in 1990, but the recipe itself is several decades old. Although the origin of Amish friendship bread is up for debate, it is similar to a cake, called Herman friendship cake, which was developed in Europe. Anne Byrn, who researched hundreds of historical recipes for her book &quot;American Cake&quot;, remembers the friendship bread craze popping up in newspaper columns in the late 1980s, but thinks the recipe can be traced back much further.

==Obtaining starter==

Starter can easily be created from scratch with a package of regular baker&#x27;s yeast and the ingredients that are used to maintain it. Also it is possible to create it in a baker&#x27;s kitchen through natural wild yeasts. Typically, however, a friend shares a cup of the liquid yeast culture with people who would like to make this bread. The starter is typically maintained by adding sugar, flour and milk every few days, although any source of water and food for the yeast will work.

==Controlling the starter cycle==

A common cycle is based on the addition of one cup each of sugar, flour, and milk every five days, with bread baked and extra starter shared every tenth day. The ten-day cycle produces five cups of starter, which must be either used to bake bread, given away, or used to start a new cycle. A common suggestion is to bake one loaf of bread, give away three cups of starter, and to save the remaining one for the next cycle.

It is not necessary to wait the canonical ten days before using one cup of starter: a cup of starter can be used as a yeast substitute at any point. However, using starter on earlier days will result in a smaller quantity of starter at the end of the cycle. To avoid running out of starter, it is normal to feed the starter (add milk, sugar, and flour) before removing a cup for use, and most recipes assume that starter is always fed immediately before being removed. A five-day baking cycle feeds the starter every fifth day and uses the resulting mixture on that day to bake one or two loaves of bread (one cup per loaf). The remaining starter is reserved to begin the next five-day fermentation cycle.

Despite common instructions to the contrary, the starter can be frozen for later use, and the cycle begun anew after thawing. The cycle can also be slowed to about half the normal fermentation rate by refrigerating the starter instead of allowing it to ferment at room temperature. Refrigeration is usually recommended if a few days&#x27; delay is desired.

<text>The Pinner reaction refers to the acid catalysed reaction of a nitrile with an alcohol to form an imino ester salt (alkyl imidate salt); this is sometimes referred to as a Pinner salt.
The reaction is named after Adolf Pinner, who first described it in 1877.
Pinner salts are themselves reactive and undergo additional nucleophilic additions to give various useful products:
* With an excess of alcohol to form an orthoester 
* With ammonia or an amine to form an amidine (di-nitriles may form imidines, for instance succinimidine from succinonitrile)
* With water to form an ester
* With hydrogen sulfide to form a thionoester

Commonly, the Pinner salt itself is not isolated, with the reaction being continued to give the desired functional group (orthoester etc.) in one go. The imidium chloride salts is thermodynamically unstable, and low temperatures help prevent elimination to an amide and alkyl chloride. 

It should be appreciated that the Pinner reaction refers specifically to an acid catalyzed process, but that similar results can often be achieved using base catalysis. The two approaches can be complementary, with nitriles which are unreactive under acid conditions often giving better results in the presence of base, and vice versa. The determining factor is typically how electron-rich or poor the nitrile is. For example: an electron-poor nitrile is a good electrophile (readily susceptible to attack from alkoxides etc.) but a poor nucleophile would typically be easier to protonate than to participate in the reaction and hence would be expected to react more readily under basic rather than acidic conditions.

<text>In many scientific fields, the degrees of freedom of a system is the number of parameters of the system that may vary independently. For example, a point in the plane has two degrees of freedom for translation: its two coordinates; a non-infinitesimal object on the plane might have additional degrees of freedoms related to its orientation.

In mathematics, this notion is formalized as the dimension of a manifold or an algebraic variety. When &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; is used instead of &quot;dimension&quot;, this usually means that the manifold or variety that models the system is only implicitly defined.
See:
* Degrees of freedom (mechanics), number of independent motions that are allowed to the body or, in case of a mechanism made of several bodies, number of possible independent relative motions between the pieces of the mechanism
* Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry), a term used in explaining dependence on parameters, or the dimensions of a phase space
* Degrees of freedom (statistics), the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary
* Degrees of freedom problem, the problem of controlling motor movement given abundant degrees of freedom

<doc id="176627" wikidata="Q1589992" url="?curid=176627" title="Luis Ángel Firpo">
<text>Luis Ángel Firpo (October 11, 1894 – August 7, 1960) was an Argentine boxer. Born in Junín, Argentina, he was nicknamed &quot;The Wild Bull of the Pampas&quot;. He was the first Latin American in history to challenge for the world heavyweight title. His bout against Jess Willard set a world record for boxing attendance at the time. His 1923 heavyweight title fight against Jack Dempsey was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; Fight of the Year for 1923.

Firpo was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the Old Timer category as part of the class of 2024.

==Boxing career==
In 1922 he arrived in the United States. He rose quickly in the Heavyweight rankings by winning all four of his fights that year by knockout. The first three in the United States made him a national hero in Argentina. He returned to his home town Buenos Aires to fight Jim Tracey in front of 20,000 spectators. Firpo won by knockout in the 4th round.
Firpo began 1923 at Madison Square Garden knocking out former title challenger Bill Brennan in the 12th round with a right. Brennan had to be taken to the hospital afterwards for a concussion. &quot;Dempsey never hit me any harder than this fellow,&quot; said Brennan. Adding that he couldn&#x27;t wear his old hat because his head was too swollen.

He followed that with seven more wins in a row, including wins over Jack McAuliffe and former world champion Jess Willard. Willard was 41 at the time, and his age forced the bout to be moved from New York to New Jersey. The event drew enormous interest, as 100,000 fight fans crowded the event with an estimated 25,000 more turned away, an attendance which set a world record for boxing at the time. After a win against Charley Weinert, Luis Firpo was scheduled for a heavyweight title shot against Jack Dempsey.

Firpo was the first Latin American in history to challenge for the world heavyweight title. In anticipation for the Dempsey-Firpo bout, a Firpo sparring session drew a crowd of 12,000. The match was at the Polo Grounds, normal capacity 55,000, but an additional 20,000 seats were constructed bringing the total to 75,000 for the fight, later expanded to 83,000. The police estimated that 150,000 people showed up, including a mass extending a quarter mile in every direction around the arena.
Firpo was floored seven times in the first round of the bout, before he trapped Dempsey against the ropes and launched a combination that sent the champion out of the ring. Dempsey was helped into the ring at the count of nine (in spite of having been seventeen seconds outside the ring; fighters are given a twenty-second count when they are knocked through the ropes). After getting back in the ring Dempsey took 13 consecutive shots from Firpo. In the second round Dempsey rallied and knocked out Firpo. It was named &quot;Ring Magazine&quot; Fight of the Year for 1923.

He returned to Argentina for a period, fighting only 3 official bouts while he planned another return to the United States. Originally planned as a 10 match tour. 80,000 attended his fight against Harry Wills, however he was defeated. He followed that with a loss against Charley Weinert, who Firpo had previously beaten. Both were by newspaper decision.

==Retirement==
Afterwards, Firpo became a car-dealer for Stutz and a rancher.
By 1940 he was ranching on a large scale in Carlos Casares with 8,000 cattle, 4,000 sheep and 400 horses.
He discovered the boxer Abel Cestac in July 1940.
Firpo and Jack Dempsey agreed to jointly manage Cestac, who went on to become the South American heavyweight champion.
On his passing in 1960, Luis Firpo was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. His mausoleum has a statue of him at the front.

==Legacy==

Firpo&#x27;s popularity around Latin America was immeasurable. Years later, C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo, a professional football team in El Salvador was named after him. In addition, various schools, streets, and avenues across Latin America have been named after him.

The painting Dempsey and Firpo by George Bellows has appeared in many films including Goodfellas, and television including The Simpsons with Homer Simpson in the place of Firpo. With some calling it &quot;the most influential sports painting ever.&quot;

In 2003, he was named by &quot;The Ring&quot; as one of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

<text>The Juilliard School ( ) is a private performing arts conservatory in New York City. Founded by Frank Damrosch as the Institute of Musical Art in 1905, the school later added dance and drama programs and became the Juilliard School, named after its principal benefactor Augustus D. Juilliard.

The school is composed of three primary academic divisions: dance, drama, and music, of which the last is the largest and oldest. Juilliard offers degrees for undergraduate and graduate students and liberal arts courses, non-degree diploma programs for professional artists, and musical training for pre-college students. Juilliard has a single campus at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, comprising numerous studio rooms, performance halls, a library with special collections, and a dormitory. It has one of the lowest acceptance rates of schools in the United States. With a total enrollment of about 950 students, Juilliard has several student and faculty ensembles that perform throughout the year, most notably the Juilliard String Quartet.

Juilliard alumni have won 105 Grammy Awards, 62 Tony Awards, 47 Emmy Awards, and 24 Academy Awards, including two alumni with EGOTs. Musicians from Juilliard have pursued careers as international virtuosos and concertmasters of professional symphony orchestras. Its alumni and faculty include more than 16 Pulitzer Prize and 12 National Medal of Arts recipients.

==History==
=== Early years: 1905–1946 ===
In 1905, the Institute of Musical Art (IMA), Juilliard&#x27;s predecessor institution, was founded by Frank Damrosch, a German-American conductor and godson of Franz Liszt, on the premise that the United States did not have a premier music school and too many students were going to Europe to study music. Chartered by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, the institute became one of first endowed music schools in the US, with significant funding provided by philanthropist and banker James Loeb.

Damrosch and Loeb&#x27;s mission was to establish a musical institution with high standards of teaching and learning that would incorporate a unified pedagogy and develop a &quot;true musical culture among all classes&quot;. Accordingly, the school would rely on its endowment to ensure the quality of instruction was independent of students&#x27; financial status.

The Institute of Musical Art opened in the former Lenox Mansion, Fifth Avenue and 12th Street, on October 11, 1905. When the school opened, most teachers were European; however, only Americans were allowed to study at the institute. Although orchestras were exclusively male, women made up most of the student population. The school had 467 students in the first year, but the enrollment soon doubled in size over the following years. Five years after its inception, the institute moved to 120 Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan onto a property purchased from Bloomingdale Insane Asylum near the Columbia University campus.

In 1919, a wealthy textile merchant named Augustus D. Juilliard died and left a vast sum of money for the advancement of music in his will, which set up the Juilliard Musical Foundation (JMF) a year later as one of its primary beneficiaries. Under Eugene Noble as executive secretary, the foundation purchased the Vanderbilt family guesthouse at 49 E. 52nd Street, and established a separate new music school, the Juilliard Graduate School (JGS), in 1924.

After much discussion, the Juilliard School of Music was eventually created in 1926 through a merger of the Institute and the Graduate School. The JGS moved from E 52nd Street to 130 Claremont Avenue next to the IMA in 1931. The two schools had the same board of directors and president but maintained their distinct identities. Columbia University Professor John Erskine became the first president of the two institutions (1928–1937). Frank Damrosch continued as the Institute&#x27;s dean, and the Australian pianist and composer Ernest Hutcheson was appointed dean of the Graduate School. Hutcheson later served as president from 1937 to 1945.

=== Expansion and growth: 1946–1990 ===
Juilliard&#x27;s third president, William Schuman, an American composer and the first Pulitzer Prize for Music winner, led the school from 1945 to 1961 and brought about several significant changes to raise the school&#x27;s academic standards. In 1946, Schuman completely consolidated the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School to form a single institution and created the Juilliard String Quartet as the school&#x27;s main quartet-in-residence. During his tenure, Schuman cut down enrollment by more than half, eliminated the Juilliard Summer School and Music Education Program, and opened Juilliard&#x27;s admission to non-Americans.

Schuman discontinued the Theory Department and initiated a new curriculum called the &quot;Literature and Materials of Music&quot; (L&amp;M), which began in 1947–1948, and was based on the assumption that musical theory education &quot;should transfer theoretical knowledge into practical performance.&quot; Designed for composers to teach, the more practical-orientated curriculum would provide an overview of the &quot;literature of music&quot;. L&amp;M was a reaction against more formal theory and ear training, and as a result did not have a formal structure and allowed for more flexibility.

Schuman established the school&#x27;s Dance Department under Martha Hill&#x27;s direction in 1951, intending that students in the program would receive an education in dance, choreography, and music. The department, later renamed the Dance Division, offered performance opportunities through the Juilliard Dance Theatre (1954–1958) and later the Juilliard Dance Ensemble (founded ), which often collaborated with the Juilliard Orchestra. For many years, the Juilliard Dance Department shared facilities with the School of American Ballet.

In 1957, after two years of deliberation, the Juilliard School of Music board announced that the school would relocate from upper Manhattan to the future Lincoln Center. The Lincoln Center would cover the costs for the construction project, but the school would have to instruct exclusively advanced students, introduce a drama program and cut its Preparatory School. Juilliard&#x27;s new building at Lincoln Center would be designed by Pietro Belluschi with associates Eduardo Catalano and Helge Westermann. The Juilliard School building at Lincoln Center was completed on October 26, 1969, officially opening with a dedication ceremony and concert. With Lincoln Center&#x27;s prestige came a newly elevated status for the Juilliard School.
William Schuman assumed the presidency of Lincoln Center in 1962 and composer Peter Mennin succeeded him. Mennin made substantial changes to the L&amp;M program—ending ear training and music history, adding performances and composition in class, and hiring the well-known pedagogue Renée Longy to teach solfège. Mennin organized several new programs, such as Juilliard&#x27;s Master Class Program and Doctoral Music Program. Under Mennin, Juilliard&#x27;s international reputation grew as several alumni won competitive international competitions. In the 1950s, the school received international attention when alumnus Van Cliburn won the International Tchaikovsky Competition.

In 1968, Mennin hired John Houseman to manage the new Drama Division as director and Michel Saint-Denis as associate director and consultant. The School&#x27;s name was changed to The Juilliard School to reflect its broadened mission to educate musicians, dancers, directors, and actors. The drama department first only trained actors, of which the first class graduated as Group 1 in 1972, but added playwrights and directors programs in the 1990s. Houseman founded The Acting Company in 1972, which allowed Juilliard students to perform and tour throughout the country. Also in 1972, Lila Acheson Wallace donated $5 million to Juilliard, which later named the Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program after her.

=== Modernization: 1990–2020 ===
Juilliard&#x27;s longest-serving president Joseph W. Polisi (1984–2017), helped the school modernize by developing educational outreach, formalizing and expanding its music programs, establishing interdisciplinary programs and reforming the school&#x27;s finances. In 1991, Polisi founded the Music Advancement Program (MAP) to help underrepresented students affected by music education budget cuts throughout public schools in New York. Between 1990 and 1993, individual departments for all instruments and voice were established, the Meredith Wilson Residence Hall was built next to the school, salaries for teachers were increased, and the school hoped to accept fewer people and eventually cut 100 students to allow for more funding. In 2001, the school established a jazz performance training program.

By the end of the 20th century, Juilliard had established itself as a prestigious performing arts school. At the time, graduates comprised approximately 20 percent of the Big Five American Orchestras and half of the New York Philharmonic. Juilliard&#x27;s endowment nearly tripled over the 1980s, reaching a quarter billion in the mid-1990s. Despite high tuition, on average, over 90 percent of accepted students ended up attending the school. In 1999, the Juilliard School was awarded the National Medal of Arts and became the first educational institution to receive the award.

In September 2005, Colin Davis conducted an orchestra that combined students from the Juilliard and London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music at the BBC Proms, and during 2008 the Juilliard Orchestra embarked on a successful tour of China, performing concerts as part of the Cultural Olympiad in Beijing, Suzhou, and Shanghai under the expert leadership of Maestro Xian Zhang.

The school has received various gifts and donations since the 2000s. In 2006, Juilliard obtained a trove of precious music manuscripts from board chair and philanthropist Bruce Kovner that make up the Juilliard Manuscript Collection. Philanthropist James S. Marcus donated $10 million to the school to establish the Ellen and James S. Marcus Institute for Vocal Arts at the school in 2010. In 2014, Kovner gave $60 million for the Kovner Fellowship Program to provide expenses for exceptionally gifted students.
On September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China&#x27;s first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution&#x27;s first such full-scale foray outside the United States. The school opened in 2020 and offers a Master of Music degree program.

In May 2017, retired New York City Ballet principal dancer Damian Woetzel was named president, replacing Joseph W. Polisi. From March 2020 through the spring 2021 semester, the school switched to online classes and suspended live performances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Post-pandemic: 2020–present ===
In June 2021, members of the student group &quot;The Socialist Penguins&quot; organized a protest against rising tuition costs after claiming that they &quot;weren&#x27;t being listened to&quot; when meeting with president and provost about the tuition fees. In September, the school&#x27;s Evening Division was renamed to Juilliard Extension which would broaden to offer programs in person and online. In December of the same year, a $50 million gift was given to the school&#x27;s Music Advancement Program to help students of underrepresented backgrounds.

The Juilliard School occupies a single main building, the Irene Diamond Building, in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, along Broadway and W 65th Street. The Juilliard building contains several large studio rooms and performance venues, such as the Glorya Kaufman Dance Studio, Stephanie P. McClelland Drama Theater, Harold and Mimi Steinberg Drama Studio, the Judith Harris and Tony Woolfson Orchestral Studio, and Edwin and Nancy Marks Jazz Rehearsal Room. Recital halls include the Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Paul Recital Hall, and the Morse Recital Hall. The building also houses the Alice Tully Hall, where the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center performs.

Adjacent to the Juilliard building is the Samuel B. &amp; David Rose Building, which is the home of the school&#x27;s Meredith Willson Residence Hall, named after the composer, conductor and Juilliard alumnus Meredith Willson. The building consists of student dormitories, faculty suites, and studios for visiting artists. and is also home to the School of American Ballet.

==Organization and administration==

Juilliard&#x27;s leadership and administration consist of a board of trustees, executive officers, and senior administrators. The board of trustees includes approximately thirty members, with a chair and two vice-chairs, and is responsible for appointing Juilliard&#x27;s president and managing the school&#x27;s business affairs. Executive offices include the offices of the president and provost. Four administrators serve each as dean and director of the dance, music, drama, and preparatory divisions. There is an additional director for the jazz program. Other academic subdivisions include the Ellen and James S. Marcus Institute for Vocal Arts and Lila Acheson Wallace Library. The vice president holds the position of chief advancement officer and manages the development of the school. Other administrative areas include the chief operating officer and corporate secretary, the public affairs office, and enrollment management and student development.

The Juilliard School has ties with higher education institutions such as Barnard College, Columbia University, and Fordham University and has associations with Nord Anglia Education for primary and secondary education since 2015. The school is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2020.

==Academics==

===Admission===
Juilliard admits both degree program seekers and pre-college division students. The latter enter a conservatory program for younger students to develop their skills; All applicants who wish to enroll in the Music Advancement Program, for the Pre-College Division, must perform an audition in person before members of the faculty and administration and must be between ages 8 and 18.

The Juilliard admissions program comprises several distinct steps. Applicants must submit a complete application, school transcripts, and recommendations; some majors also require that applicants submit prescreening recordings of their work, which are evaluated as part of the application. A limited number of applicants are then invited to a live audition, sometimes with additional callbacks. After auditions, the school invites select applicants to meet with a program administrator.

Admission to the Juilliard School is highly competitive, as it ranks among the most selective schools in the United States. In 2007, the school received 2,138 applications for admission, of which 162 were admitted for a 7.6% acceptance rate. For the fall semester of 2009, the school had an 8.0% acceptance rate. In 2011, the school accepted 5.5% of applicants. For Fall 2012, 2,657 undergraduate applicants were received by the college division and 7.2% were accepted. The 75th percentile accepted into Juilliard in 2012 had a GPA of 3.96 and an SAT score of 1350.

A cross-registration program is available with Columbia University where Juilliard students who are accepted to the program are able to attend Columbia classes, and vice versa. The program is highly selective, admitting 10–12 students from Juilliard per year. Columbia students also have the option of pursuing an accelerated Master of Music degree at Juilliard and obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Barnard or Columbia and an MM from Juilliard in five (or potentially six, for voice majors) years.

===Academic programs===

The school offers courses in dance, drama, and music. All Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s degree programs require credits from Liberal Arts courses, which include seminar classes on writing, literature, history, culture, gender, philosophy, environment, and modern languages.

The Dance Division was established in 1951 by William Schuman with Martha Hill as its director. It offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts or a Diploma. Areas of study include ballet and modern and contemporary dance, with courses ranging from dance technique and performance to dance studies. Since its inception, the dance program has had a strong emphasis not only on performance but also on choreography and collaboration.

The Drama Division was established in 1968 by the actor John Houseman and Michel Saint-Denis. Its acting programs offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts, a Diploma and, beginning in Fall 2012, a Master of Fine Arts. Until 2006, when James Houghton became director of the Drama Division, there was a &quot;cut system&quot; that would remove up to one-third of the second-year class. The Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program, begun in 1993, offers one-year, tuition-free, graduate fellowships; selected students may be offered a second-year extension and receive an Artist Diploma. The Andrew W. Mellon Artist Diploma Program for Theatre Directors was a two-year graduate fellowship that began in 1995 (expanded to three years in 1997); this was discontinued in the fall of 2006.

The Music Division is the largest of the school&#x27;s divisions. Available degrees are Bachelor of Music or Diploma, Master of Music or Graduate Diploma, Artist Diploma and Doctor of Musical Arts. Academic majors are brass, collaborative piano, composition, guitar, harp, historical performance, jazz studies, orchestral conducting, organ, percussion, piano, strings, voice, and woodwinds. The largest music department is Juilliard&#x27;s string department, followed by the piano department. The collaborative piano, historical performance, and orchestral conducting programs are solely at the graduate level; the opera studies and music performance subprograms only offer Artist Diplomas. The Juilliard Vocal Arts department now incorporates the former Juilliard Opera Center.

The school&#x27;s non-degree diploma programs are for specialized training to advance a performer&#x27;s professional career. These include undergraduate and graduate programs in dance, drama, and music. Musicians and performers can also complete Artist Diploma programs in jazz studies, performance, opera, playwriting, and string quartet studies.

===Pre-College Division===
The Pre-College Division teaches students enrolled in elementary, junior high, and high school. The Pre-College Division is conducted every Saturday from September to May in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center.

All students study solfège and music theory in addition to their primary instrument. Vocal majors must also study diction and performance. Similarly, pianists must study piano performance. String, brass and woodwind players, as well as percussionists, also participate in orchestra. The pre-college has two orchestras, the Pre-College Symphony (PCS) and the Pre-College Orchestra (PCO). Placement is by age and students may elect to study conducting, chorus, and chamber music.

The Pre-College Division began as the Preparatory Centers (later the Preparatory Division), part of the Institute of Musical Art since 1916. The Pre-College Division was established in 1969 with Katherine McC. Ellis as its first director. Olegna Fuschi served as director from 1975 to 1988. The Fuschi/Mennin partnership allowed the Pre-College Division to thrive, affording its graduates training at the highest artistic level (with many of the same teachers as the college division), as well as their own commencement ceremony and diplomas. In addition to Fuschi, directors of Juilliard&#x27;s Pre-College Division have included composer Dr. Andrew Thomas. The current director of the Pre-College Division is Yoheved Kaplinsky.

===Center for Innovation in the Arts===
The Center for Innovation in the Arts (CIA), formerly called the Music Technology Center, at the Juilliard School was created in 1993 to provide students with the opportunity to use digital technology in the creation and performance of new music. Since then, the program has expanded to include a wide offering of classes such as, Introduction to Music Technology, Music Production, Film scoring, Computers In Performance and an Independent Study In Composition.

In 2009, the Music Technology Center moved to a new, state of the art facility that includes a mix and record suite and a digital &quot;playroom&quot; for composing and rehearsing with technology. Together with the Willson Theater, the Center for Innovation in the Arts is the home of interdisciplinary and electro-acoustic projects and performances at the Juilliard School.

===Instruments===

The Juilliard School has about 275 pianos, of which 231 are Steinway grand pianos. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of Steinway and Son&#x27;s pianos in the space of concert halls and practice rooms.

Pipe organs at Juilliard include those by Holtkamp (III/57, III/44, II/7), Schoenstein (III/12), Flentrop (II/17), Noack (II/3) and Kuhn (IV/85), which are located in various practice rooms and recital halls.

The strings department allows students to borrow valuable historic stringed instruments for special concerts and competitions. There are more than 200 such stringed instruments, including several by Antonio Stradivari and Giuseppe Guarneri del Gesù.

===Print and digital resources===

The Lila Acheson Wallace Library is the main library at Juilliard that holds study scores, performance and sound recordings, books, and videos. The school&#x27;s archives include manuscript collections with digitized holographs. The library has over 87,000 musical scores and 25,000 sound recordings. The Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections features the Igor and Soulima Stravinsky Collection, the Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale Collection, and the Eugène Ysaÿe Collection.

The school acquired the Juilliard Manuscript Collection in 2006, which includes autograph scores, sketches, composer-emended proofs and first editions of major works by Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, Chopin, Schubert, Liszt, Ravel, Stravinsky, Copland, and other composers of the classical music canon. Many of the manuscripts had been unavailable for generations. Among the items are the printer&#x27;s manuscript of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, complete with Beethoven&#x27;s handwritten amendments, that was used for the first performance in Vienna in 1824; Mozart&#x27;s autograph of the wind parts of the final scene of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;; Beethoven&#x27;s arrangement of his monumental &quot;Große Fuge&quot; for piano four hands; Schumann&#x27;s working draft of his Symphony No. 2; and manuscripts of Brahms&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 and Piano Concerto No. 2. The entire collection has since been digitized and can be viewed online.

===Rankings===

Juilliard consistently ranks as one of the top performing arts schools in the world. Since QS first published its QS World University Rankings for the subject performing arts in 2016, Juilliard held the top spot among academic institution for performing arts for six years. The school dropped its ranking to third place in 2022, falling behind the Royal College of Music and the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna. As part of Juilliard&#x27;s ranking criteria for 2022, the school scored 100 out of 100 for academic reputation and 69.2 for employer reputation for an overall score of 93.8. Juilliard and the Curtis Institute of Music were the only two American conservatories that made the top 10 in the 2022 QS World Rankings in performing arts. In another report, The Hollywood Reporter ranked the school first among drama schools in the world in 2021. According to the Hollywood Reporter&#x27;s 2022 listing of the top-ranked music schools in the world, Juilliard ranked fourth.

==Student life==
===Student body and diversity===
The Juilliard School enrolled 492 full-time undergraduates, 114 part-time undergraduates and 374 graduate students as of the 2019–2020 school year. Women made up 47% of all the students enrolled. The retention rate for that academic year was 94%. That same year, Juilliard awarded 116 Bachelor&#x27;s Degrees and 140 Master&#x27;s Degrees and had a graduation rate of 94%. Of the undergraduate degrees, 87 were in music, 20 in dance, and nine in drama. The school conferred 132 Master of Music Degrees and eight Master of Fine Arts Degrees in drama.

Juilliard has made efforts to diversify its student body and program. In 2001, the conservatory introduced a Jazz Studies Program, which Wynton Marsalis currently directs. The school launched an Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging (EDIB) initiative in 2018, which includes a task force and provides workshops for all faculty and staff. Student Diversity Initiatives provide students forums and activities to educate the community on diversity, internationalism, culture and social justice. In the same year, Alicia Graf Mack, who previously danced with the Dance Theatre of Harlem, became the school&#x27;s first black dance director. The school has recently invested in funding for minority students and schoolchildren to address inequalities. However, some have criticized the school&#x27;s lack of diversity in its faculty and curriculum and focus on primarily Western Classical Music.

===Student organizations===

The Juilliard Black Student Union (JBSU) was founded in the fall of 2016. A group of students established the Alliance for Latin American &amp; Spanish Students (ALAS) in the summer of 2018. The political organization, the Socialist Penguins, was created in 2021 to encourage &quot;anti-capitalist and anti-racist discussions.&quot; Other Juilliard clubs include the Juilliard Chinese Student &amp; Scholars Association (J-CSSA), the Juilliard Christian Fellowship (JCF) and the Juilliard Green Club, among others. Juilliard does not have any fraternities or sororities.

In the 1980s, Juilliard students assembled an ice hockey team called the Fighting Penguins to compete against a faculty team. The naming of the teams became the first usage of the penguin as the school&#x27;s mascot. Later in the 1980s, the school had several running and racing events and a tennis team from the 1970s to 1990s. Today, there is a faculty-staff softball team and the student Juilliard Volleyball Club. However, no varsity teams play for the school.

===Performing ensembles===

The Juilliard School has a variety of ensembles, including chamber music, jazz, orchestras, and vocal/choral groups. Juilliard&#x27;s orchestras include the Juilliard Orchestra, the Juilliard Chamber Orchestra, the Wind Orchestra, the New Juilliard Ensemble, the Juilliard Theatre Orchestra, and the Conductors&#x27; Orchestra. The Axiom Ensemble is a student directed and managed group dedicated to well-known 20th-century works.

Established in 2003, the Juilliard Electric Ensemble allows all students to use multi-media technology to produce and perform works. The ensemble has performed works that incorporate new technology by many contemporary composers.

In addition, Juilliard resident ensembles, which feature faculty members, perform frequently at the school. These groups include the Juilliard String Quartet and the American Brass Quintet, which are American ensembles that perform throughout the United States and abroad.

==Notable people==
===Alumni===

Over the years, Juilliard alumni have contributed significantly to the arts and culture. Collectively, they have won numerous awards nationally and internationally, including more than 300 Grammy, Oscar, Emmy, and Tony Awards. Juilliard alumni include principal players and concertmasters of several symphony orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Berlin Philharmonic. Other graduates have led international careers as soloists, playing with orchestras worldwide. Juilliard alumni are the recipients of over 16 Pulitzer Prizes and 12 National Medals of Arts. Alumni have represented the United States as cultural ambassadors for the arts and include U.N. messengers of peace.

<text>Seahouses is a large village on the North Northumberland coast in England. It is about north of Alnwick, within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Attraction==
Seahouses attracts many visitors, mainly from the north east area. However national and international tourists often come to Seahouses whilst visiting the Northumberland National Park, Northumberland Coast and the Farne Islands. Seahouses also has a working fishing port, which also serves the tourist trade, being the embarkation point for visits to the Farne Islands. From shops in the town and booths along the harbour, several boat companies operate, offering various packages which may include &quot;inter alia&quot; landing on at least one Farne, seeing seals and seabirds, and hearing a commentary on the islands and the Grace Darling story or scuba diving on the many Farne Islands wrecks. Grace Darling&#x27;s brother is buried in the cemetery at North Sunderland. He died in 1903, aged 84. The current Seahouses lifeboat bears the name &quot;Grace Darling&quot;.

The Seahouses Festival is an annual cultural event which began in 1999 as a small sea shanty festival. After a significant European funding grant from the Leader+ programme, in 2005, it has grown into a more broadly based cultural celebration.

 There are claims that kippers were first created in Seahouses in the 1800s, and they are still produced locally to this day.

Between 1898 and 1951, Seahouses was the north-eastern terminus of the North Sunderland Railway. Independent until its final closure, it formed a standard gauge rail link between the village and Chathill Station on the East Coast Main Line. The site of Seahouses station is now the town car park and the trackbed between village and North Sunderland is a public footpath.

==Governance==
Seahouses is within the civil parish of North Sunderland and the Northumberland County Council electoral division of Bamburgh. The parliamentary constituency is North Northumberland, represented by David Smith MP of the Labour Party.

==Religion==
Seahouses is in the archdeaconry of Lindisfarne, in the Diocese of Newcastle.

<text>The Farne Islands are a group of islands off the coast of Northumberland, England. The group has between 15 and 20 islands depending on the level of the tide. They form an archipelago, divided into the Inner and the Outer Group. The main islands in the Inner Group are Inner Farne, Knoxes Reef, the East and West Wideopens (all joined on very low tides), and (somewhat separated) the Megstone; the main islands in the Outer Group are Staple Island, Brownsman, North and South Wamses, Big Harcar, and Longstone. The two groups are separated by Staple Sound. The highest point on Inner Farne is above mean sea level and on Staple Island is .

==History==
===Monks and hermits===
The earliest recorded inhabitants of the Farne Islands were various Culdees, some connected with Lindisfarne. This followed the old Celtic Christian tradition of island hermitages, also found in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.

The islands are first recorded in 651, when they became home to Saint Aidan, followed by Saint Cuthbert. Cuthbert isolated himself on the islands until he was called to the bishopric of Lindisfarne, but after two years, he returned to the solitude of the Inner Farne and died there in 687, when Saint Aethelwold took up residence, instead. Among other acts, Cuthbert introduced special laws in 676 protecting the eider ducks, and other seabirds nesting on the islands; these are thought to be the earliest bird-protection laws anywhere in the world.

The islands were used by hermits intermittently from the seventh century. These included Saint Bartholomew of Farne. The last hermit was Thomas De Melsonby, who died on the islands in 1246.

A formal monastic cell of Benedictine monks was established on the islands &quot;circa&quot; 1255. The cell was dependent on Durham Abbey, now Durham Cathedral. A very small cell, it was usually home to only two monks, although on occasion this rose to as many as six. The cell was dissolved in 1536 as part of King Henry VIII&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Following the dissolution of the monastic cell on the islands, they became the property of the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral, who leased them to various tenants. The islands remained a detached part of County Durham until 1844, when the Counties (Detached Parts) Act transferred them to Northumberland. In 1861, the islands were sold to Charles Thorp, who was at the time Archdeacon of Durham. In 1894, the islands were bought by industrialist William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong. The islands are currently owned by the National Trust.

Remains still exist of the seventh-century anchorite cell used by Saint Aidan and Saint Cuthbert, as do the remains of a 14th-century chapel associated with the cell. Known as St Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel, it is described as a &quot;single-cell building of four bays&quot;. The remains of a second chapel have been incorporated into a later building.

===Grace Darling===
The Farne Islands are associated with the story of Grace Darling and the wreck of the &quot;Forfarshire&quot;. Grace Darling was the daughter of Longstone lighthouse-keeper (one of the islands&#x27; lighthouses), William Darling, and on 7 September 1838, when she was aged 22, with her father she rescued nine people from the wreck of the &quot;Forfarshire&quot; in a strong gale and thick fog, the vessel having run aground on Harcar Rock. The story of the rescue attracted extraordinary attention throughout Britain, and made Grace Darling a heroine who has gone down in British folklore.

===Tourism===
By the eighteenth century, picnics were being held on the Farne Islands. A picnic was held in 1778 on Pinnacle Island by Dr Kayne and his house party which consisted of ten persons and one dog. The picnic was illustrated by S.H.Grimm who made a drawing of the house party and a separate drawing of the accompanying seven servants enjoying a picnic meal. 

==Today==
The islands have no permanent population, but National Trust rangers live on the islands for nine months of the year, maintaining the site and monitoring wildlife. They live in Prior Castell&#x27;s Tower on the Inner Farne (the largest and closest inshore of the islands), Lighthouse Cottage on Inner Farne and the lighthouse cottage on the Brownsman in the outer group. The pele tower was built during the early part of the 1494-1519 tenure of Thomas Castell as Prior of Durham.

===Lighthouses===
 The lighthouse would not have been painted red and white in Grace Darling&#x27;s day.
The first lighthouse was built on the islands in 1773; prior to that, a beacon may have been installed on Prior Castell&#x27;s Tower, permission having first been given for a light on Inner Farne in 1669.

Currently, two lighthouses are operated by Trinity House on the Farne Islands:
* Farne Lighthouse was built in 1811 and originally named Inner Farne Lighthouse.
* Longstone Lighthouse was built in 1826 and originally named Outer Farne Lighthouse.

Former lighthouses on the islands include:

* Farne Island Lighthouse was built in 1673, but never lit; its replacement was built by Captain John Blackett in 1778, itself replaced by Trinity House with the current Farne Lighthouse in 1811. A minor light, called the Low Light, was also established by Trinity House on the north-west of Farne between 1811 and 1910. to aid navigation by lining this light up with the Inner Farne light
* Staple Island Lighthouse was built by Captain Blackett in 1778 and blown down in the Great Storm of 1784; a replacement, built either in the same place or on Brownsman Island, was knocked down by heavy seas in 1800.
* Brownsman Lighthouse, built in 1800, was replaced by Trinity House with a new tower in 1811 and closed in 1826 when Longstone Lighthouse was established.
All the operational lighthouses on the Farnes are now automatic and have no resident keepers, although in former years, they did. The lighthouse is now maintained by Trinity House via its local lighthouse attendant, George Shiel, who provides guided tours inside the lighthouse. Ruins of some of the older lighthouses may be seen, for example on the Brownsman, which has two. Before the lighthouses, beacons were on several of the islands. The prominent white streak on the cliff facing the mainland (see photo) is similar to bird droppings; although many parts of the islands do exhibit this colouring during the breeding season only, in this case it is the result of chalk deposits from the many years of spent calcium carbide from the lighthouse being thrown down the cliff; this calcium carbide was used to generate acetylene, which was used as fuel for the light before electricity came.

==Ecology and natural history==
The Farne Islands are an internationally important wildlife habitat. In summer eider duck, cormorant, shag, fulmar, kittiwake, Arctic tern, common tern, Sandwich tern, guillemot, razorbill, and puffins all breed here, while in late autumn a large colony of grey seals pup on the islands. Summer visitors to Inner Farne are strongly advised to wear hats due to Arctic terns dive bombing to protect their chicks.
Breeding birds on the Farnes (as of 2022; 2021 counts marked *) include:

* Canada goose – 4 pairs
* Mallard – 13 pairs
* Common eider – 417 pairs
* Red-breasted merganser – 1 pair*
* Oystercatcher – 17 pairs
* Ringed plover – 4 pairs
* Kittiwake – 4,772 pairs
* Black-headed gull – 479 pairs
* Great black-backed gull – 24 pairs
* Herring gull – 1,219 pairs*
* Lesser black-backed gull – 1,088 pairs*
* Sandwich tern – 336 pairs
* Roseate tern – last bred 2015 (1 pair)
* Common tern – 51 pairs
* Arctic tern – 882 pairs
* Guillemot – 59,168 birds
* Razorbill – 523 pairs
* Puffin – 36,211 pairs*
* Fulmar – 271 pairs*
* Cormorant – 98 pairs
* Shag – 437 pairs
* Carrion crow – 1 pair
* Barn swallow – 7 pairs
* Pied wagtail – 4 pairs
* Rock pipit – 11 pairs

A total of 303 bird species have been recorded on the Farnes, including in the 1760s, an example of the now extinct great auk.

On 28–29 May 1979, an Aleutian tern, a rare tern from the Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, visited the Farnes. It was the first, and still the only, member of its species ever seen anywhere in Europe.

A longer-staying unusual visitor was &quot;Elsie&quot; the lesser crested tern, which visited the Farnes every summer from 1984 to 1997; during that period (paired with a male Sandwich tern) she raised several hybrid chicks and attracted several thousand birders keen to see this species in Britain. Lesser crested terns normally nest on islands off the coast of Libya and migrate to West Africa for the winter; &quot;Elsie&quot; is thought to have taken a wrong turn at the Straits of Gibraltar on spring migration.

An Arctic tern from the Farnes, ringed as a chick not yet old enough to fly in summer 1982, reached Melbourne, Australia, in October 1982, a sea journey over in just three months from fledging. This remains one of the longest known distances travelled by any bird.

==Geology==
The Farnes are resistant igneous dolerite outcrops. These would originally have been connected to the mainland and surrounded by areas of less resistant limestone. Through a combination of erosion of the weaker surrounding rock, and sea level rise following the last ice age, the Farnes were left as islands. Because of the way the rock is fissured, dolerite forms strong columns. This gives the islands their steep, in places vertical cliffs, and the sea around the islands is scattered with stacks up to high on Inner Farne and on Staple Island. Many of the small islands are bare rock, but the larger islands have a layer of clay subsoil and peat soil supporting vegetation. The rock strata slope slightly upwards to the south, giving the highest cliffs on the south and some beaches to the north.

One classic view of the Farnes, very popular with photographers, is that from the harbour at Seahouses, but they are closer to the mainland further up the road northwards towards Bamburgh, and excellent views may be seen from here, in the vicinity of the Monks House Rocks, as well as from Bamburgh Castle and beach

==Shipwrecks and diving==
The Farne Islands are popular with bird watchers, and as scuba diving locations, with a variety of sites suitable for all levels of divers, for the seals and wrecks.

Hundreds of ships have been wrecked on the Farnes over the years, providing plenty for wreck divers to explore. Among them are:

===Dive sites and wrecks===
* &quot;Chris Christenson&quot;, a Danish steamer that sank on 16 February 1915, lies close into the reef off the south tip of Longstone, Outer Farnes, in about at ().
* , a German steamship that drove onto Knifestone, Outer Farnes, on 3 September 1921, lies in about at ().
* &quot;Brittania&quot;, a , British cargo/passenger steamship that struck the Callers, Outer Farnes, in thick fog on 25 September 1915 lies between at ().
* &quot;St Andre&quot; was a French steamship carrying pig iron. On 28 October 1908, she hit the Crumstone and floated off to sink finally at Staple Island. She lies in about at ().

Diving at the Farnes is generally possible, regardless of wind direction; shelter is always available somewhere. Some dive locations even provide the opportunity to combine diving and birdwatching, in particular the Pinnacles, where guillemots can be found fishing at safety-stop depth.

== Civil parish ==
Farne Islands was a civil parish, in 1951 the parish had a population of 3. On 1 April 1955 the parish was abolished and merged with North Sunderland.

<text>Hyperion , also known as Saturn VII, is the eighth-largest moon of Saturn. It is distinguished by its highly irregular shape, chaotic rotation, low density, and its unusual sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-rounded moon to be discovered.

== Discovery == 
Hyperion was independently discovered by William Cranch Bond and his son George Phillips Bond in the United States, and William Lassell in the United Kingdom in September 1848.

== Name == 
The moon is named after Titan Hyperion, the god of watchfulness and observation, and the elder brother of Cronus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Saturn). It is also designated &quot;Saturn VII&quot;. The adjectival form of the name is &quot;Hyperionian&quot;.

Hyperion&#x27;s discovery came shortly after John Herschel had suggested names for the seven previously known satellites of Saturn in his 1847 publication &quot;Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;. William Lassell, who saw Hyperion two days after William Bond, had already endorsed Herschel&#x27;s naming scheme and suggested the name Hyperion in accordance with it. He also beat Bond to publication.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Shape ===
Hyperion is one of the largest bodies known to be highly irregularly shaped (non-ellipsoidal, i.e. not in hydrostatic equilibrium) in the Solar System. The only larger moon known to be irregular in shape is Neptune&#x27;s moon Proteus. Hyperion has about 15% of the mass of Mimas, the least massive known ellipsoidal body. The largest crater on Hyperion is approximately in diameter and deep. A possible explanation for the irregular shape is that Hyperion is a fragment of a larger body that was broken up by a large impact in the distant past. A proto-Hyperion could have been in diameter (which ranges from a little below the size of Mimas to a little below the size of Tethys). Over about 1,000 years, ejecta from a presumed Hyperion breakup would have impacted Titan at low speeds, building up volatiles in the atmosphere of Titan.

=== Composition ===

Like most of Saturn&#x27;s moons, Hyperion&#x27;s low density indicates that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn&#x27;s moons, Hyperion has a low albedo (0.2–0.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material. This may be material from Phoebe (which is much darker) that got past Iapetus. Hyperion is redder than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus.

Hyperion has a porosity of about 0.46. Although Hyperion is the eighth-largest moon of Saturn, it is only the ninth-most massive. Phoebe has a smaller radius, but it is more massive than Hyperion and thus denser.

=== Surface features ===

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed through the Saturn system, but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge, but was not able to make out the texture of Hyperion&#x27;s surface. Early images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s first targeted flyby of Hyperion on 25 September 2005 that Hyperion&#x27;s oddness was revealed in full.

Hyperion&#x27;s surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged craters that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus. Scientists attribute Hyperion&#x27;s unusual, sponge-like appearance to the fact that it has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.

The latest analyses of data obtained by &quot;Cassini&quot; during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of it is empty space. It was suggested in July 2007 that this porosity allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock.

=== Static charge ===
Hyperion&#x27;s surface is electrically charged and was the first discovered to be so other than the Moon&#x27;s surface.

== Orbit and rotation ==
The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; images and subsequent ground-based photometry indicated that Hyperion&#x27;s rotation is chaotic, that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable. Its Lyapunov time is around 30 days. Hyperion, together with Pluto&#x27;s moons Nix and Hydra, is among only a few moons in the Solar System known to rotate chaotically, although it is expected to be common in binary asteroids. It is also the only regular planetary natural satellite in the Solar System known to not be tidally locked.

Hyperion is unique among the large moons in that it is very irregularly shaped, has a fairly eccentric orbit, and is near a much larger moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion&#x27;s surface, in contrast to many of Saturn&#x27;s other moons, which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.

== Exploration ==

Hyperion has been imaged several times from moderate distances by the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter. The first close targeted flyby occurred at a distance of on 26 September 2005. &quot;Cassini&quot; made another close approach to Hyperion on 25 August 2011 when it passed from Hyperion, and third close approach was on 16 September 2011, with closest approach of . &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s last flyby was on 31 May 2015 at a distance of about .

<doc id="176645" wikidata="Q3898745" url="?curid=176645" title="Peel tower">
<text>Peel towers (also spelt pele) are small fortified keeps or tower houses, built along the English and Scottish borders in the Scottish Marches and North of England, mainly between the mid-14th century and about 1600. They were free-standing with defence being a prime consideration in their design, although &quot;confirmation of status and prestige&quot; also played a role. Additionally, they functioned as watch-towers, where garrisoned personnel could light signal fires to warn of approaching danger.

The FISH Vocabulary &quot;Monument Types Thesaurus&quot; lists &quot;pele&quot; alongside &quot;bastle&quot;, &quot;fortified manor house&quot; and &quot;tower house&quot; under the broader term &quot;fortified house&quot;. Pevsner defines a peel as simply a stone tower. Outside of this, &quot;peel&quot; or &quot;pele&quot; can also be used in related contexts, for example a &quot;pele&quot; or &quot;barmkin&quot; (in Ireland a bawn) was an enclosure where livestock were herded in times of danger. The rustling of livestock was an inevitable part of Border raids, and often their main purpose. In this usage, the tower usually stood at a corner of the pele. Most pele enclosure walls have not survived, and some towers perhaps never had them. Some, known as a &quot;vicar&#x27;s pele&quot;, housed the local vicar but could also serve as a refuge for the whole community.

== History ==
Peels were built in Scotland, Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, County Durham, the North Riding of Yorkshire, and as far south as Lancashire, in response to the threat of attack from the English, Scots and the Border Reivers of both nationalities.

In Scotland, a line of these towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source, as a response to the dangers of invasion from the Marches. In the upper Tweed valley, going downstream from its source, they were as follows: Fruid, Hawkshaw, Oliver, Polmood, Kingledoors, Mossfennan, Wrae Tower, Quarter, Stanhope, Drumelzier, Tinnies, Dreva, Stobo, Dawyck, Easter Happrew, Lyne, Barnes, Caverhill, Neidpath, Peebles, Horsburgh, Nether Horsburgh Castle, Cardrona, Kirna(Kirnie), Elibank.

By an Act of the Parliament of England in 1455, each of these towers was required to have an iron basket on its summit and a smoke or fire signal, for day or night use, ready at hand. Apart from their primary purpose as a warning system, these towers were also the homes of the lairds and landlords of the area, who dwelt in them with their families and retainers, while their followers lived in simple huts outside the walls. The towers also provided a refuge so that, when cross-border raiding parties arrived, the whole population of a village could take to the tower and wait for the marauders to depart.

== Surviving towers ==

Pele towers can be associated with a church: for example Embleton Tower in Embleton, Northumberland, and another at Church of St Michael, Alnham, are examples of a so-called &#x27;vicar&#x27;s peles&#x27; and the one at Hulne Priory near Alnwick is in the grounds of the priory. Corbridge Vicar&#x27;s Pele in Northumberland has been converted to a small pub. St Michael&#x27;s Church, Burgh by Sands has a heavily fortified tower at the west end and a former vicar&#x27;s pele at the east end. St Cuthbert&#x27;s, Great Salkeld, is another example of a fortified church. Both these Cumbrian churches have yetts or strong internal iron gates to defend their towers against Scottish raiders.

Some peles were converted to castles, such as Penrith Castle. Some towers are now derelict while others have been converted for use in peacetime. Embleton pele tower was part of the former vicarage, now a private home, and that on the Inner Farne is a home to bird wardens. The most obvious conversion needs include access, which would have originally been made intentionally difficult, and the provision of more and larger windows. A pele tower in Hellifield, North Yorkshire featured in an episode of &quot;Grand Designs&quot; showing the conversion from a derelict state to a home and a bed-and-breakfast business. Darnick Tower stands just outside Melrose and is still habitable. It was built in 1425 by the Heiton family from Normandy, and remained the property of the same family until 2016. The Pele Tower in Whittingham, Northumberland was converted to alms houses in 1864, but is now a single dwelling, rentable as holiday accommodation. The lower barrel vaulted chamber and first floor date from c. 1280, the top floor from the Victorian reconstruction.

Canons Ashby House incorporates one of only a few pele towers constructed in the Midlands; it owes its existence to the settlement of Cumbrian sheep farmer, John Dryden, in the county of Northamptonshire.

<text>Hyperion, a Fragment is an abandoned epic poem by 19th-century English Romantic poet John Keats. It was published in &quot;Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems&quot; (1820). It is based on the Titanomachia, and tells of the despair of the Titans after their fall to the Olympians. Keats wrote the poem from late 1818 until the spring of 1819. The poem stops abruptly in the middle of the third book, with close to 900 lines having been completed. He gave it up as having &quot;too many Miltonic inversions.&quot; He was also nursing his younger brother Tom, who died on 1 December 1818 of tuberculosis. 

Keats picked up the ideas again in his unfinished poem &quot;The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream&quot; (1856) published after his death. He attempted to recast the epic by framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding.

These poems were Keats&#x27; final attempt to reconcile his perceived conflict between mortal decay and absolute value.

==Plot==

=== Background ===
The Titans are a pantheon of gods who ruled prior to the Olympians and are now destined to fall. They include Saturn (king of the gods), Ops (Saturn&#x27;s wife), Thea (Hyperion&#x27;s sister), Enceladus (cast as the god of war, though considered a Giant rather than a Titan in Greek mythology), Oceanus (god of the sea), Hyperion (the god of the sun) and Clymene (a young goddess). 

=== Poem ===
The poem opens with Saturn bemoaning the loss of his power, which is being overtaken by Jupiter. Thea leads him to a place where the other Titans sit, similarly miserable, and they discuss whether they should fight back against their conquest by the new gods (the Olympians). Oceanus declares that he is willing to surrender his power to Neptune (the new god of the sea) because Neptune is more beautiful (this is worth bearing in mind in relation to the Romantic idea that beauty is paramount). Clymene describes first hearing the music of Apollo, which she found beautiful to the point of pain (another Romantic idea). Finally, Enceladus makes a speech encouraging the Titans to fight.

Meanwhile, Hyperion&#x27;s palace is described, and we first see Hyperion himself, the only Titan who is still powerful. He is addressed by Uranus (old god of the sky, father of Saturn), who encourages him to go to where Saturn and the other Titans are. We leave the Titans with the arrival of Hyperion, and the scene changes to Apollo (the new sun god, also god of music, civilisation and culture) weeping on the beach. Here Mnemosyne (goddess of memory) encounters him and he explains to her the cause of his tears: he is aware of his divine potential, but as yet unable to fulfill it. By looking into Mnemosyne&#x27;s eyes he receives knowledge which transforms him fully into a god.

The poem as usually printed breaks off at this point, in mid-line, with the word &quot;celestial&quot;. Keats&#x27;s friend Richard Woodhouse, transcribing this poem, completed this line as &quot;Celestial Glory dawn&#x27;d: he was a god!&quot;

==Style==
The language of &quot;Hyperion&quot; is very similar to Milton&#x27;s, in metre and style. However, his characters are quite different. Although Apollo falls into the image of the &quot;Son&quot; from &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and of &quot;Jesus&quot; from &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, he does not directly confront Hyperion as Satan is confronted. Also, the roles are reversed, and Apollo is deemed as the &quot;challenger&quot; to the throne, who wins it by being more &quot;true&quot; and thus, more &quot;beautiful.&quot;

==Extract==
From Book I, lines spoken by the Titan Hyperion:
== Reception ==
The poem and the volume that contained it met positive reception upon publication. As of 2022, it is considered one of the most important works of Romantic poetry.

==Influence==
&quot;Hyperion&quot; has influenced a number of later works:
* Dan Simmons&#x27;s science fiction quartet, the &quot;Hyperion Cantos&quot;.
* The power metal band Keldian referenced the poem in the song &quot;Hyperion&quot; on the album &quot;Journey of Souls&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hyperion (; , &#x27;he who goes before&#x27;) was one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). With his sister, the Titaness Theia, Hyperion fathered Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon) and Eos (Dawn).

Hyperion was, along with his son Helios, a personification of the sun, with the two sometimes identified. John Keats&#x27;s abandoned epic poem &quot;Hyperion&quot; is among the literary works that feature the figure.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Hyperion&quot; means &quot;he that walks on high&quot; or simply &quot;the god above&quot;, often joined with &quot;Helios&quot;. There is a possible attestation of his name in Linear B (Mycenaean Greek) in the lacunose form &quot;]pe-rjo-[&quot; (Linear B: ]-[), found on the KN E 842 tablet (reconstructed &quot;[u]-pe-rjo-[ne]&quot;) though it has been suggested that the name actually reads &quot;Apollo&quot; (&quot;[a]-pe-rjo-[ne]&quot;).

== Mythology ==
Hyperion is one of the twelve or thirteen Titans, the children of Gaia and Uranus. In the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Uranus imprisoned all the children that Gaia bore him, before he was overthrown. According to Apollodorus, Uranus only imprisoned the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes but not the Titans, until Gaia persuaded her six Titan sons to overthrow their father Uranus and &quot;they, all but Ocean, attacked him&quot; as Cronus castrated him. Afterwards, in the words of Hesiod, Hyperion subjected his sister Theia to his love, and fathered three children with her, who became the lights of heaven: Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn). As is the case for most of the Titans, there are no myths or functions for Hyperion. He seems to exist only to provide a father for the three celestial deities. As a Titan, one of the oldest generation of gods, Hyperion was a fitting father for these three sky-gods who, as elements of the natural world, must have been conceived of as having come into being near the beginning of the cosmos.

=== Helios ===
Hyperion and Helios were both sun-gods. Early sources sometimes present the two as distinct personages, with Hyperion being the father of Helios, but sometimes they were apparently identified, with &quot;Hyperion&quot; being simply a title of, or another name for, Helios himself. Hyperion is Helios&#x27; father in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter. But in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and elsewhere in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Helios is also called &quot;Helios Hyperion&quot; with &quot;Hyperion&quot; here being used either as a patronymic or as an other epithet. In the Homeric epics, and in the &quot;Homeric Hymn to Apollo&quot;, besides being called &quot;Helios&quot;, Hyperion is sometimes also called simply &quot;Hyperion&quot;. In later sources the two sun-gods are distinctly father and son. In literature, the sun is often referred to as &quot;Hyperion&#x27;s bright son.&quot;

=== Diodorus Siculus ===
According to the rationalizing historian Diodorus Siculus, Hyperion was the name of the first person to understand the movement of the sun and moon, and their effect on the seasons, and explains that, because of this, he was said to be their &quot;father&quot;:
Of Hyperion we are told that he was the first to understand, by diligent attention and observation, the movement of both the sun and the moon and the other stars, and the seasons as well, in that they are caused by these bodies, and to make these facts known to others; and that for this reason he was called the father of these bodies, since he had begotten, so to speak, the speculation about them and their nature.

Diodorus also recorded an unorthodox version of the myth, in which Hyperion married his sister Basileia and had two children by her, Helios and Selene; their brothers, envious of their happy issue and fearful that Hyperion would divert the royal power to himself, conspired and killed Hyperion along with his two children (which then went on to transform into the Sun and the Moon), leaving Basileia in great distress.

<text>Roll film or rollfilm is any type of spool-wound photographic film protected from white light exposure by a paper backing. The term originated in contrast to sheet film. Confusingly, roll film was originally often referred to as &quot;cartridge&quot; film because of its resemblance to a shotgun cartridge.

The opaque backing paper allows roll film to be loaded in daylight. It is typically printed with frame number markings which can be viewed through a small red window at the rear of the camera. A spool of roll film is usually loaded on one side of the camera and pulled across to an identical take up spool on the other side of the shutter as exposures are made. When the roll is fully exposed, the take up spool is removed for processing and the empty spool on which the film was originally wound is moved to the other side, becoming the take up spool for the next roll of film.

==History==

In 1881 a farmer in Cambria, Wisconsin, Peter Houston, invented the first roll film camera. His younger brother David, filed the patents for various components of Peter&#x27;s camera. 
David Henderson Houston (born June 14, 1841; died May 6, 1906), originally from Cambria, Wisconsin, patented the first holders for flexible roll film. Houston moved to Hunter in Dakota Territory in 1880. He was issued an 1881 patent for a roll film holder which he licensed to George Eastman (it was used in Eastman&#x27;s Kodak 1888 box camera). Houston sold the patent (and an 1886 revision) outright to Eastman for $5000 in 1889. Houston continued developing the camera, creating 21 patents for cameras or camera parts between 1881 and 1902. In 1912 his estate transferred the remainder of his patents to Eastman.

 The most popular roll film format is 120 film, which is used in most medium format cameras and roll film magazines for large-format cameras. Until the 1950s, 120 roll film was, with the smaller 127 film, also used in the simplest of box cameras and other snapshot cameras. The use of roll film in consumer cameras was largely superseded by 135 and 126 cartridges, but 120 and 220 (double length) film are still commonly used in medium format cameras.

==Automatic film speed sensing==
In 1998, Fujifilm introduced a film identification system for 120 and 220 format roll film called &quot;Barcode System&quot; (with logo &quot;|||B&quot;). The barcode encoding the film format and length as well as the film speed and type is located on the sticker between the emulsion carrying film and the backing paper. This 13-bit barcode is optically scanned by newer medium format cameras like the Fujifilm GA645i Professional, GA645Wi Professional, GA645Zi Professional, GX645AF Professional, GX680III Professional and GX680IIIS Professional, the Hasselblad H1, H2, H2F and H3D Model I with HM 16-32, and the Contax 645 AF.

<doc id="176659" wikidata="Q1083872" url="?curid=176659" title="Glorious First of June">
<text>The Glorious First of June (1 June 1794), also known as the Fourth Battle of Ushant, (known in France as the &#x27; or &#x27;) was the first and largest fleet action between the British and French navies during the French Revolutionary Wars.

The action was the culmination of a campaign that had criss-crossed the Bay of Biscay over the previous month in which both sides had captured numerous merchant ships and minor warships and had engaged in two partial, but inconclusive, fleet actions. The British Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe attempted to prevent the passage of a vital French grain convoy from the United States, which was protected by the French Atlantic Fleet, commanded by Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse. The two forces clashed in the Atlantic Ocean, some west of the French island of Ushant on 1 June 1794.

During the battle, Howe defied naval convention by ordering his fleet to turn towards the French and for each of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, and as a result, his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe&#x27;s fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath, both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.

The battle demonstrated a number of the major problems inherent in the French and British navies at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.

== Background ==
Since early 1792 France had been at war with four of its neighbours on two fronts, battling the Habsburg monarchy and Prussia in the Austrian Netherlands, and the Austrians and Piedmontese in Italy. On 2 January 1793, almost one year into the French Revolutionary War, republican-held forts at Brest in Brittany fired on the British brig HMS &quot;Childers&quot;. A few weeks later, following the execution of the imprisoned King Louis XVI, diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February, France declared war on both Britain and the Dutch Republic.

Protected from immediate invasion by the English Channel, Britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the Netherlands for service against the French. Throughout the remainder of 1793, the British and French navies undertook minor operations in Northern waters, the Mediterranean and the West and East Indies, where both nations maintained colonies. The closest the Channel Fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed intercepting the French convoy from the Caribbean, escorted by 15 ships of the line on 2 August. The only major clash was the Siege of Toulon, a confused and bloody affair in which the British force holding the town—alongside Spanish, Sardinian, Austrian and French Royalist troops—had to be evacuated by the Royal Navy to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the French Revolutionary Army. The aftermath of this siege was punctuated by recriminations and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies, eventually resulting in Spain switching allegiance with the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso two years later. Nevertheless, the siege produced one major success: Sir Sidney Smith, with parties of sailors from the retreating British fleet, accomplished the destruction of substantial French naval stores and shipping in Toulon. More might have been achieved had the Spanish raiding parties that accompanied Smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the French fleet.

The situation in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay. In consequence, the French Navy officer corps suffered greatly from the effects of the Reign of Terror, with many experienced sailors being executed, imprisoned or dismissed from the service for perceived disloyalty. The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though; France itself was starving because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention: food produced in France&#x27;s overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the merchantmen would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.

==Fleets==
The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very different stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger (even if more lightly built), and carried a heavier weight of shot. The largest French ships were three-decker first rates, carrying 110 or 120 guns, against 100 guns on the largest British vessels.

===Royal Navy===
Since the Nootka Crisis of 1790, the Royal Navy had been at sea in a state of readiness for over three years. The Navy&#x27;s dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared for conflict. This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill-prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign, which ended in defeat at the Siege of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.

Unfortunately for the British, gathering sufficient manpower was difficult and never satisfactorily accomplished throughout the entire war. The shortage of seamen was such that press gangs were forced to take thousands of men with no experience on the sea, meaning that training and preparing them for naval life would take quite some time. The lack of Royal Marines was even more urgent, and soldiers from the British Army were drafted into the fleet for service at sea. Men of the 2nd. Regiment of Foot – The Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment) and the 29th Regiment of Foot served aboard Royal Navy ships during the campaign; their descendant regiments still maintain the battle honour &quot;1 June 1794&quot;.

Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was possessed of one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, had learned his trade under Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke and fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy&#x27;s arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had dispersed his fleet in three groups. George Montagu, in HMS &quot;Hector&quot;, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS &quot;Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys for the rest of their passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe&#x27;s direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.

===French Navy===
In contrast to their British counterparts, the French Navy was in a state of confusion. Although the quality of the fleet&#x27;s ships was high, the fleet hierarchy was riven by the same crises that had torn through France since the Revolution five years earlier. Consequently, the high standard of ships and ordnance was not matched by that of the available crews, which were largely untrained and inexperienced. With the Terror resulting in the death or dismissal of many senior French sailors and officers, political appointees and conscripts—many of whom had never been to sea at all, let alone in a fighting vessel—filled the Atlantic fleet.

The manpower problem was compounded by the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems came to a head in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship&#x27;s non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. The effect of this purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.
The newly appointed commander of this troubled fleet was Villaret de Joyeuse; although formerly in a junior position, he was known to possess a high degree of tactical ability; he had trained under Admiral Pierre André de Suffren in the Indian Ocean during the American war. However, Villaret&#x27;s attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named Jean-Bon Saint-André. Saint-André&#x27;s job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations. Shortly after his arrival, Saint-André proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation does not appear to have ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-André&#x27;s dispatches to Paris were published regularly in &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot;, and did much to popularise the Navy in France.

The French Atlantic fleet was even more dispersed than the British in the spring of 1794: Rear-Admiral Pierre Vanstabel had been dispatched, with five ships including two of the line, to meet the much-needed French grain convoy off the American eastern seaboard. Rear-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly had sailed from Rochefort with five ships of the line and assorted cruising warships to rendezvous with the convoy in the mid-Atlantic. This left Villaret with 25 ships of the line at Brest to meet the threat posed by the British fleet under Lord Howe.

===Convoy===
By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France&#x27;s colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them. According to contemporary historian William James this conglomeration of ships was said to be over 350 strong, although he disputes this figure, citing the number as 117 (in addition to the French warships).

The convoy had also been augmented by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the Quasi War.

==May 1794==
The French convoy, escorted by Vanstabel, departed America from Virginia on 2 April, and Howe sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May, taking his entire fleet to both escort British convoys to the Western Approaches and intercept the French. Checking that Villaret was still in Brest, Howe spent two weeks searching the Bay of Biscay for the grain convoy, returning to Brest on 18 May to discover that Villaret had sailed the previous day. Returning to sea in search of his opponent, Howe pursued Villaret deep into the Atlantic. Also at sea during this period were the squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British), both of whom had met with some success; Nielly had captured a number of British merchant ships and Montagu had taken several back. Nielly was the first to encounter the grain convoy, deep in the Atlantic in the second week of May. He took it under escort as it moved closer to Europe, while Montagu was searching fruitlessly to the south.

Despite Howe&#x27;s pursuit, the main French sortie found initial success, running into a Dutch convoy and taking 20 ships from it on Villaret&#x27;s first day at sea. For the next week Howe continued to follow the French, seizing and burning a trail of French-held Dutch ships and enemy corvettes. On 25 May Howe spotted a straggler from Villaret&#x27;s fleet and gave chase; &quot;Audacieux&quot; led Howe straight to his opponent&#x27;s location. Having finally found Villaret, on 28 May Howe attacked, using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot;. This first rate was at various times engaged with six British ships and took heavy damage, possibly striking her colours late in the action. As darkness fell the British and French fleets separated, leaving &quot;Révolutionnaire&quot; and her final enemy, HMS &quot;Audacious&quot;, still locked in combat behind them. These two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports. By this stage Villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close, and deliberately took his fleet to the west, hoping to decoy Howe away from the vital convoy.

Taking the bait, the following day Howe attacked again, but his attempt to split the French fleet in half was unsuccessful when his lead ship, HMS &quot;Caesar&quot;, failed to follow orders. Much damage was done to both fleets but the action was inconclusive, and the two forces again separated without having settled the issue. Howe had however gained an important advantage during the engagement by seizing the weather gage, enabling him to further attack Villaret at a time of his choosing. Three French ships were sent back to port with damage, but these losses were offset by reinforcements gained the following day with the arrival of Nielly&#x27;s detached squadron.Battle was postponed during the next two days because of thick fog, but when the haze lifted on 1 June 1794, the battle lines were only 6 miles (10 km) apart and Howe was prepared to force a decisive action.

== First of June ==
Although Howe was in a favourable position, Villaret had not been idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was within a few hours of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position on the weather gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6 km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe&#x27;s formation was deployed in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral&#x27;s commands.The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.

It was normal in fleet actions of the 18th century for the two lines of battle to pass one another sedately, exchanging fire at long ranges and then wearing away, often without either side losing a ship or taking an enemy. In contrast, Howe was counting on the professionalism of his captains and crews combined with the advantage of the weather gage to attack the French directly, driving through their line. However, this time he did not plan to manoeuvre in the way he had during the two previous encounters, each ship following in the wake of that in front to create a new line arrowing through his opponent&#x27;s force (as Rodney had done at the Battle of the Saintes 12 years earlier). Instead, Howe ordered each of his ships to turn individually towards the French line, intending to breach it at every point and rake the French ships at both bow and stern. The British captains would then pull up on the leeward side of their opposite numbers, cutting them off from their retreat downwind, and engage them directly, hopefully forcing each to surrender and consequently destroying the French Atlantic Fleet.

==British break the line==
Within minutes of issuing the signal and turning his flagship HMS &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, Howe&#x27;s plan began to falter. Many of the British captains had either misunderstood or ignored the signal and were hanging back in the original line. Other ships were still struggling with damage from Howe&#x27;s earlier engagements and could not get into action fast enough. The result was a ragged formation tipped by &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; that headed unevenly for Villaret&#x27;s fleet. The French responded by firing on the British ships as they approached, but the lack of training and coordination in the French fleet was obvious; many ships which did obey Howe&#x27;s order and attacked the French directly arrived in action without significant damage.

===Van squadron===
Although &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; pressed on all sail, she was not the first through the enemy line. That distinction belonged to a ship of the van squadron under Admiral Graves: HMS &quot;Defence&quot; under Captain James Gambier, a notoriously dour officer nicknamed &quot;Dismal Jimmy&quot; by his contemporaries. &quot;Defence&quot;, the seventh ship of the British line, successfully cut the French line between its sixth and seventh ships; &quot;Mucius&quot; and &quot;Tourville&quot;. Raking both opponents, &quot;Defence&quot; soon found herself in difficulty due to the failure of those ships behind her to properly follow up. This left her vulnerable to &quot;Mucius&quot;, &quot;Tourville&quot; and the ships following them, with which she began a furious fusillade. However, &quot;Defence&quot; was not the only ship of the van to break the French line; minutes later George Cranfield Berkeley in HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot; executed Howe&#x27;s manoeuvre perfectly, raking and then entangling his ship with &quot;Impétueux&quot;.

In front of &quot;Marlborough&quot; the rest of the van had mixed success. HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and HMS &quot;Leviathan&quot; were both still suffering the effects of their exertions earlier in the week and did not breach the enemy line. Instead they pulled along the near side of &quot;Éole&quot; and &quot;America&quot; respectively and brought them to close gunnery duels. Rear-Admiral Thomas Pasley of &quot;Bellerophon&quot; was an early casualty, losing a leg in the opening exchanges. HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, Graves&#x27;s flagship, was less successful due to a miscalculation of distance that resulted in her pulling up too far from the French line and coming under heavy fire from her opponent &quot;Terrible&quot;. In the time it took to engage &quot;Terrible&quot; more closely, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; suffered a severe pounding and Admiral Graves was badly wounded.

More disturbing to Lord Howe were the actions of HMS &quot;Russell&quot; and HMS &quot;Caesar&quot;. &quot;Russell&#x27;s&quot; captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get to grips with the enemy more closely and allowing her opponent &quot;Téméraire&quot; to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action.There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of &quot;Caesar&quot;, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe&#x27;s signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. &quot;Caesar&quot; did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship &quot;Trajan&quot; but her fire had little effect, while &quot;Trajan&quot; inflicted much damage to &quot;Caesar&#x27;s&quot; rigging and was subsequently able to attack &quot;Bellerophon&quot; as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing at the head of the line.

===Centre===
The centre of the two fleets was divided by two separate squadrons of the British line: the forward division under admirals Benjamin Caldwell and George Bowyer and the rear under Lord Howe. While Howe in &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; was engaging the French closely, his subordinates in the forward division were less active. Instead of moving in on their opposite numbers directly, the forward division sedately closed with the French in line ahead formation, engaging in a long distance duel which did not prevent their opponents from harassing the embattled &quot;Defence&quot; just ahead of them. Of all the ships in this squadron only HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, under Thomas Pakenham, ranged close to the French lines. &quot;Invincible&quot; was badly damaged by her lone charge but managed to engage the larger &quot;Juste&quot;. HMS &quot;Barfleur&quot; under Bowyer did later enter the action, but Bowyer was not present, having lost a leg in the opening exchanges.

Howe and &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; led the fleet by example, sailing directly at the French flagship &quot;Montagne&quot;. Passing between &quot;Montagne&quot; and the next in line &quot;Vengeur du Peuple&quot;, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; raked both and hauled up close to &quot;Montagne&quot; to engage in a close-range artillery battle. As she did so, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; also became briefly entangled with &quot;Jacobin&quot;, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.

To the right of &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, HMS &quot;Brunswick&quot; had initially struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, blocking her view of the eastern half of the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard &quot;Jacobin&quot; and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between &quot;Achille&quot; and &quot;Vengeur du Peuple&quot;. This manoeuvre failed when &quot;Brunswick&#x27;s&quot; anchors became entangled in &quot;Vengeur&#x27;s&quot; rigging. Harvey&#x27;s master asked if &quot;Vengeur&quot; should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied &quot;No; we have got her and we will keep her&quot;. The two ships swung so close to each other that &quot;Brunswick&#x27;s&quot; crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of just a few feet.

Behind this combat, other ships of the centre division struck the French line, HMS &quot;Valiant&quot; under Thomas Pringle passing close to &quot;Patriote&quot; which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion and unable to take their ship into battle. &quot;Valiant&quot; instead turned her attention on &quot;Achille&quot;, which had already been raked by &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Brunswick&quot;, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS &quot;Orion&quot; under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS &quot;Queen&quot; under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, &quot;Queen&quot; suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French &quot;Northumberland&quot;, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. &quot;Queen&quot; was too slow to engage &quot;Northumberland&quot; as closely as &quot;Orion&quot;, and soon fell in with &quot;Jemmapes&quot;, both ships battering each other severely.

===Rear===
Of the British rear ships, only two made a determined effort to break the French line. Admiral Hood&#x27;s flagship HMS &quot;Royal George&quot; pierced it between &quot;Républicain&quot; and &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;, engaging both closely, while HMS &quot;Glory&quot; came through the line behind &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard did not participate in this close combat; HMS &quot;Montagu&quot; fought a long range gunnery duel with &quot;Neptune&quot; which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking &quot;Brunswick&quot;, his brother&#x27;s ship, in the confused action around &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;.

Three other British ships failed to respond to the signal from Howe, including HMS &quot;Alfred&quot; which engaged the French line at extreme range without noticeable effect, and Captain Charles Cotton in HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; who likewise did little until the action was decided, at which point he took the surrender of several already shattered French ships. Finally HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot; under Albemarle Bertie took no part in the initial action at all, standing well away from the British line and failing to engage the enemy despite the signal for close engagement hanging limply from her mainmast. The French rear ships were no less idle, with &quot;Entreprenant&quot; and &quot;Pelletier&quot; firing at any British ships in range but refusing to close or participate in the melees on either side. The French rear ship &quot;Scipion&quot; did not attempt to join the action either, but could not avoid becoming embroiled in the group around &quot;Royal George&quot; and &quot;Républicain&quot; and suffered severe damage.

==Melee==
Within an hour of their opening volleys the British and French lines were hopelessly confused, with three separate engagements being fought within sight of one another. In the van, &quot;Caesar&quot; had finally attempted to join the fight, only to have a vital spar shot away by &quot;Trajan&quot; which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle. &quot;Bellerophon&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot; were in the thick of the action, the outnumbered &quot;Bellerophon&quot; taking serious damage to her rigging. This left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents, of which &quot;Eole&quot; also suffered severely. Captain William Johnstone Hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support; the frigate HMS &quot;Latona&quot; under Captain Edward Thornbrough arrived to provide assistance. Thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the French battleline and opened fire on &quot;Eole&quot;, helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing &quot;Bellerophon&quot; to safety. &quot;Leviathan&quot;, under Lord Hugh Seymour, had been more successful than &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, her gunnery dismasting &quot;America&quot; despite receiving fire from &quot;Eole&quot; and &quot;Trajan&quot; in passing. &quot;Leviathan&quot; only left &quot;America&quot; after a two-hour duel, sailing at 11:50 to join &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; in the centre.

&quot;Russell&quot; had not broken the French line and her opponent &quot;Témeraire&quot; got the better of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with &quot;Trajan&quot; and &quot;Eole&quot;. &quot;Russell&quot; then fired on several passing French ships before joining &quot;Leviathan&quot; in attacking the centre of the French line. &quot;Russell&#x27;s&quot; boats also took the surrender of &quot;America&quot;, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;) &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as &quot;Terrible&quot; fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line on the far side of the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship &quot;Montagne&quot;, which had escaped from &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, and it was &quot;Montagne&quot; which &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by &quot;Valiant&quot;, and beginning a long-range action.

Behind &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was &quot;Marlborough&quot;, inextricably tangled with &quot;Impétueux&quot;. Badly damaged and on the verge of surrender, &quot;Impétueux&quot; was briefly reprieved when &quot;Mucius&quot; appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with &quot;Marlborough&quot; and &quot;Impétueux&quot; losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of &quot;Marlborough&quot; had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS &quot;Aquilon&quot;, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed &quot;Marlborough&quot; out of the line as &quot;Mucius&quot; freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. &quot;Impétueux&quot; was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS &quot;Russell&quot;.

Dismasted, &quot;Defence&quot; was unable to hold any of her various opponents to a protracted duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged &quot;Républicain&quot; moving from the east. Although &quot;Républicain&quot; later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet&#x27;s frigates and was aided by HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot; under Captain William Bentinck. As &quot;Impétueux&quot; passed she fired on &quot;Phaeton&quot;, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. &quot;Invincible&quot;, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;. &quot;Invincible&#x27;s&quot; guns drove &quot;Juste&quot; onto the broadside of &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, where she was forced to surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood in a boat from &quot;Invincible&quot;. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS &quot;Impregnable&quot; lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.

The conflict between &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; and &quot;Montagne&quot; was oddly one-sided, the French flagship failing to make use of her lower-deck guns and consequently suffering extensive damage and casualties. &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; in her turn was damaged by fire from nearby ships and was therefore unable to follow when &quot;Montagne&quot; set her remaining sails and slipped to the north to create a new focal point for the survivors of the French fleet. &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; also took fire during the engagement from HMS &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, under Thomas Mackenzie, which had failed to close with the enemy and instead fired at random into the smoke bank surrounding the flagship. Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas was seriously wounded by this fire. Following &quot;Montagne&quot;&#x27;s escape, &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; engaged &quot;Jacobin&quot; and &quot;Républicain&quot; as they passed, and was successful in forcing the surrender of &quot;Juste&quot;. To the east of &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Brunswick&quot; and &quot;Vengeur du Peuple&quot; continued their bitter combat, locked together and firing main broadsides from point blank range. Captain Harvey of &quot;Brunswick&quot; was mortally wounded early in this action by langrage fire from &quot;Vengeur&quot;, but refused to quit the deck, ordering more fire into his opponent. &quot;Brunswick&quot; also managed to drive &quot;Achille&quot; off from her far side when the French ship attempted to intervene. &quot;Achille&quot;, already damaged, was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered, although her crew rescinded this when it became clear &quot;Brunswick&quot; was in no position to take possession. With her colours rehoisted, &quot;Achille&quot; then made what sail she could in an attempt to join Villaret to the north. It was not until 12:45 that the shattered &quot;Vengeur&quot; and &quot;Brunswick&quot; pulled apart, both largely dismasted and very battered. &quot;Brunswick&quot; was only able to return to the British side of the line after being supported by &quot;Ramillies&quot;, while &quot;Vengeur&quot; was unable to move at all. &quot;Ramillies&quot; took &quot;Vengeur&#x27;s&quot; surrender after a brief cannonade but was unable to board her and instead pursued the fleeing &quot;Achille&quot;, which soon surrendered as well.

To the east, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Queen&quot; forced the surrender of both &quot;Northumberland&quot; and &quot;Jemmappes&quot;, although &quot;Queen&quot; was unable to secure &quot;Jemmappes&quot; and she had to be abandoned later. &quot;Queen&quot; especially was badly damaged and unable to make the British lines again, wallowing between the newly reformed French fleet and the British battleline along with several other shattered ships. &quot;Royal George&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot; had between them disabled &quot;Scipion&quot; and &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; in a bitter exchange, but were also too badly damaged themselves to take possession. All four ships were among those left drifting in the gap between the fleets.

==French recovery==
Villaret in &quot;Montagne&quot;, having successfully broken contact with the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11 ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered &quot;Queen&quot;, Villaret&#x27;s attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret&#x27;s intention, Howe also pulled his ships together to create a new force. His reformed squadron consisted of &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, &quot;Leviathan&quot;, &quot;Barfleur&quot;, and &quot;Thunderer&quot;. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of &quot;Queen&quot;, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own dismasted ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered &quot;Terrible&quot;, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the dismasted &quot;Scipion&quot;, &quot;Mucius&quot;, &quot;Jemmappes&quot;, and &quot;Républicain&quot;—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the dismasted French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.


In fact, the British fleet was unable to pursue Villaret, having only 11 ships still capable of battle to the French 12, and having numerous dismasted ships and prizes to protect. Retiring and regrouping, the British crews set about making hasty repairs and securing their prizes; seven in total, including the badly damaged &quot;Vengeur du Peuple&quot;. &quot;Vengeur&quot; had been holed by cannon firing from &quot;Brunswick&quot; directly through the ship&#x27;s bottom, and after her surrender no British ship had managed to get men aboard. This left &quot;Vengeur&quot;&#x27;s few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could—a task made harder when some of her sailors broke into the spirit room and became drunk. Ultimately the ship&#x27;s pumps became unmanageable, and &quot;Vengeur&quot; began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged &quot;Alfred&quot; and HMS &quot;Culloden&quot;, as well as the services of the cutter HMS &quot;Rattler&quot;, saved any of the &quot;Vengeur&#x27;s&quot; crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of &quot;Rattler&quot; was especially commended for this hazardous work. By 18:15, &quot;Vengeur&quot; was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded, the dead, and the drunk remained aboard. Several sailors are said to have waved the tricolor from the bow of the ship and cried &quot;Vive la Nation, vive la République!&quot;

Having escaped to the east, Villaret made what sail his battered fleet could muster to return to France, and dispatched his frigates in search of the convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements; eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral Pierre-François Cornic Dumoulin, were patrolling near the Ushant headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure their ships and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until 05:00 on 2 June.

Casualties in the battle are notoriously hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (&quot;Scipion&quot;), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither of which can be treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000 captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.

==Convoy arrives==
With a large portion of his fleet no longer battleworthy, Howe was unable to resume his search for the French convoy in the Bay of Biscay. The Admiralty, though unaware of Howe&#x27;s specific circumstances, knew a battle had taken place through the arrival of HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; in Portsmouth, and was preparing a second expedition under George Montagu. Montagu had returned to England after his unsuccessful May cruise, and was refitting in Portsmouth when ordered to sea again. His force of ten ships was intended to both cover Howe&#x27;s withdrawal from Biscay, and find and attack the French grain convoy. Montagu returned to sea on 3 June, and by 8 June was off Ushant searching for signs of either the French or Howe; unknown to him, neither had yet entered European waters. At 15:30 on 8 June Montagu spotted sails, and soon identified them as the enemy. He had located Cornic&#x27;s squadron, which was also patrolling for the convoy and the returning fleets. Montagu gave chase and drove Cornic into Bertheaume Bay, where he blockaded the French squadron overnight, hoping to bring them to action the following day. However, on 9 June, Montagu sighted 19 French ships appearing from the west—the remnants of Villaret&#x27;s fleet. Hastily turning his ships, Montagu sailed south to avoid becoming trapped between two forces which might easily overwhelm him. Villaret and Cornic gave chase for a day before turning east towards the safety of the French ports.

Howe benefited from Montagu&#x27;s withdrawal, as his own battered fleet passed close to the scene of this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town&#x27;s population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy from America finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.
==Aftermath==
Both Britain and France claimed victory in the battle: Britain by virtue of capturing or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining in control of the battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism—the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting.

===France===
In France the revolutionary principles of precluded extensive awards, but Villaret was promoted to vice-admiral on 27 September 1794 and other minor awards were distributed to the admirals of the fleet. In addition the fleet&#x27;s officers took part in a celebratory parade from Brest to Paris, accompanying the recently arrived food supplies. The role of &quot;Vengeur du Peuple&quot; was mythified by Bertrand Barrère, giving birth to an exalted legend. Opinion in France concerning the battle&#x27;s outcome was divided; while many celebrated Saint-André&#x27;s exaggerated accounts of victory in &quot;Le Moniteur&quot;, senior naval officers disagreed. Among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed Admiral Kerguelen. Kerguelen was disgusted by Villaret&#x27;s failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron, and felt that the French fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only Villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of Howe&#x27;s fleet. The French Navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the Battle of La Hogue in 1692.&gt;

Ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20 years earlier.
===Britain===
In Britain, the fleet in Spithead was treated with a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household. Numerous honours were bestowed on the fleet and its commanders. Admiral Howe, already an earl, refused any further elevation, and one of Howe&#x27;s political opponents dissuaded King George III from making him a Knight of the Garter. Vice-Admiral Graves was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Graves, while Vice-Admiral Hood was made Viscount Bridport. Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, Pasley and Curtis (the last-named was promoted from captain on 4 July 1794) were all made baronets, and Bowyer and Pasley also received pensions of £1,000 a year to compensate them for their severe wounds. All first lieutenants were promoted to commander and numerous other officers were promoted in consequence of their actions. The thanks of parliament were unanimously passed to all who fought at the action and various other gifts and awards were distributed among the fleet. A memorial to Captains John Hutt and John Harvey, both of whom had died of their wounds on 30 June, was raised in Westminster Abbey.

There was, however, a bitter consequence of the awards, rooted in Howe&#x27;s official dispatch to the Admiralty concerning the battle, which according to some accounts was actually written by Curtis. Howe had appended a list to his report containing the names of officers whom he believed merited special reward for their part in the battle. The list included Vice-Admirals Graves and Hood, Rear-Admirals Bowyer, Gardner, and Pasley, and Captains Seymour, Pakenham, Cranfield Berkeley, Gambier, John Harvey, Payne, Henry Harvey, Pringle, Duckworth, Elphinstone, Nichols, and Hope. Also mentioned were Lieutenants Monkton and Donnelly. The list had omitted a number of officers who had served in the battle, and the justice of their omission was a highly controversial issue in the Navy.&gt; Rear-Admiral Caldwell was the sole British flag officer present not to receive a hereditary honour, although he was promoted to Vice-Admiral on 4 July (as were Bowyer and Gardner). After studying the ship&#x27;s logs and reports of the battle, the Admiralty minted a medal to be awarded to the living captains on the list only (although Captain William Parker of HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; was awarded one as well). The captains excluded from the list were furious, and the furore from this selective commendation lasted years: in 1795 Vice-Admiral Caldwell quit the service in anger as a result, while Cuthbert Collingwood, flag captain of &quot;Barfleur&quot;, refused all awards for future service until the Glorious First of June medal was presented to him as well. He eventually received it after the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. Over five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Bitterest of all was the whispering campaign directed at Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS &quot;Caesar&quot;. Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe&#x27;s orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy&#x27;s request for an official court-martial to clear his name failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was. Molloy was dismissed from his ship.

Of the captured ships, several were purchased and enjoyed long careers in the Royal Navy, in particular the two 80-gun ships HMS &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;, which was decommissioned in 1802 but not broken up until 1842, and HMS &quot;Juste&quot;, which was a popular command until her decommissioning in 1802 at the Peace of Amiens. Of the four 74-gun prizes, &quot;Achille&quot; and &quot;Northumberland&quot; (both 74s built in the late 1770s) were broken up as unserviceable soon after arrival in Britain, while &quot;Impétueux&quot; was destroyed in a dockyard fire on 24 August 1794 while undergoing repairs. &quot;America&quot;, the final prize, was taken into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;America&quot; but renamed HMS &quot;Impetueux&quot; in July 1795 and remained in service until 1813. The combined prize money for these ships was £201,096 (the equivalent of £ as of 2025), divided among the ships under Lord Howe&#x27;s command.

<doc id="176660" wikidata="Q1146074" url="?curid=176660" title="Medium format">
<text>Medium format has traditionally referred to a film format in photography and the related cameras and equipment that use film. Nowadays, the term applies to film and digital cameras that record images on media larger than the used in 35 mm photography (though not including 127 sizes), but smaller than (which is considered large format photography).

In digital photography, medium format refers either to cameras adapted from medium-format film photography uses or to cameras making use of sensors larger than that of a 35 mm film frame. Some of the benefits of using medium-format digital cameras include higher resolution sensors, better low-light capabilities compared to a traditional 35mm DSLR, and a wider dynamic range.

==Characteristics==
Medium-format cameras made since the 1950s are generally less automated than smaller cameras made at the same time. For example, autofocus became available in consumer 35 mm cameras in 1977, but did not reach medium format until the late 1990s, and has never been available in a consumer large format camera.

The main benefit of medium-format photography is that, because of the larger size of the film or digital sensor (two to six times larger than 35 mm), images of much higher resolution can be produced. This allows for bigger enlargements and smooth gradation without the grain or blur that would characterize similarly enlarged images produced from smaller film formats. The larger size of the film also allows for better control of the depth of field and therefore more photographic creativity.

Cameras with a bellows typically support &#x27;tilt and shift&#x27; of the lens. This permits landscape photography with the appearance of an extremely large depth of field – from closest foreground to the far horizon – to be achieved, by aligning the plane of focus with the subject plane of interest, using the Scheimpflug principle.

Compared with 35 mm, the main drawbacks are accessibility and price. While 35 mm cameras, film, and photo finishing services are generally widely available and cheap, medium format is usually limited to professional photography shops and can be prohibitively expensive. Also, medium-format cameras tend to be bulkier than their 35 mm counterpart.

===Film handling===
The medium-format film is usually roll film, typically allowing 8 to 32 exposures on one roll of film before reloading is needed. This is fewer than 35 mm cartridges, which typically take 12 to 36 pictures on one roll. This is somewhat offset by the fact that most medium-format systems used interchangeable film magazines, thereby allowing photographers to switch rolls quickly, allowing them larger numbers of exposures before needing to load new film or to change the film type. Some companies had bulk film backs that used 70 mm double-perforated film that allowed up to 75 feet of film to be loaded at one time. While rolls of large format film were produced at one time, their use was specialized, typically for aerial cameras installed in military aircraft or printing industry equipment.

Most large format film is sheet film, that is, film where each picture is on a separate piece of film, requiring that the camera be frequently reloaded, usually after every picture, sometimes using magazines of up to five pictures or reduction backs that allow multiple pictures on a single sheet of film. Medium-format sheet film was produced for some cameras, but these cameras tend to be smaller, lighter, and easier to use than large format gear. Sheet film was never commonly used in cameras smaller than medium format.

Film cost per exposure is directly related to the amount of film used, thus, the larger the film size, the more expensive each picture will be. An 8 by 10 in large-format negative is far more expensive than a 6 by 6 cm medium-format picture, which is substantially more expensive than a frame of 35 mm film.

35 mm cartridges are generally easier to load and unload from a camera than medium-format rolls. A 35 mm cartridge is placed inside a camera, and in most motorized cameras this is all that is needed; the camera loads the film and rewinds it into the cartridge for removal. Far fewer medium-format cameras are motorized, and medium-format roll film does not have sprocket holes, so loading often requires that marking on the backing paper of the film be lined up with markings on the camera, and on unloading, the backing paper must be carefully secured to protect the film from light.

===120, 220 and 620 film===

All medium-format cameras mass-produced today (as of 2024) use the 120 film format. Additionally, many are capable of using the 220 film format, effectively doubling the number of frames available with 120 film. Medium-format roll film is still available from specialty shops and photographic laboratories, yet it is not as ubiquitous as 135 (35 mm) film.

The 620 format was introduced by Kodak in 1931 as an alternative to 120. It was discontinued in 1995. The 620 format is essentially the same film on a thinner and narrower all-metal spool. While 620 film is required on a number of old Kodak Brownie cameras, many of these cameras can accommodate the slightly larger 120 rolls/spools. In other situations where the camera cannot accommodate a 120 spool, the 120 film can be rolled onto a 620 spool in a darkroom or changing bag.This film is shot in a variety of aspect ratios, which differ depending on the camera or frame insert used. The most common aspect ratios are 6×6 cm (square/1:1) and 6×4.5 cm (rectangular/4:3). Other frequently used aspect ratios are 6×7 cm, 6×9 cm, and 6×17 cm panoramic. The 6×4.5 cm format is usually referred to as &quot;645&quot;, with many cameras that use this ratio bearing &quot;645&quot; in their product name. Cameras that can switch to different aspect ratios do so by either switching camera backs, by using a frame insert, or by use of special multi-format backs. All of these dimensions are nominal; actual dimensions are a bit different. For example, 6×7 cm might give an image on film that is actually 56×70 mm; this enlarges exactly to fill an 8×10 sheet of paper. Another feature of many medium-format models is the ability to use Polaroid instant film in an interchangeable back. Studio, commercial and architectural photographers value this system for its ability to verify the focus and exposure.

===70 mm film – still versus cine===
For some professional medium-format cameras, those used in school portraiture for example, long-roll film magazines were available. Most of these accommodated rolls of film that were 100 ft (30.5 m) long and 70 mm wide, sometimes with perforations, sometimes without. Some cameras, such as the Hasselblad, could be equipped with film magazines holding 15 foot rolls of double perforated 70 mm film passed between two cassettes. 70 mm was a standard roll film width for many decades, last used as late as the 1960s for 116 and 616 size roll films. It was also used for aerial photo-mapping, and it is still used by large format cinema systems such as IMAX.

70 mm film used in still cameras, like Mamiya and Hasselblad, and 70 mm print film used in IMAX projectors have the same gauge or height as 120 film. With 70 mm cine projector film, the perforations are inset by 2.5 mm to make room for the old-style optical sound tracks; a standard established by Todd-AO in the 1950s. IMAX cameras use 65 mm film, which have perforations and pitch that match-up to the 70 mm film used in IMAX projectors.

==System cameras==
Many professional medium-format cameras are system cameras, which means that they have various interchangeable parts. Like most 35 mm SLRs, these cameras usually support different lenses, but in addition it is also standard for medium-format system cameras to support different winding mechanisms, viewfinders, and camera backs. This flexibility is one of the primary advantages of medium-format photography.

== Digital medium format ==
Digital photography came to the medium-format world with the development of digital camera backs, which can be fitted to many system cameras. Digital backs are a type of camera back that have electronic sensors in them, effectively converting a camera into a digital camera. These backs are used predominantly by professional photographers. As with film, due to the increased size of the imaging chip (up to twice that of a 35 mm film frame, and thus as much as 40 times the size of the chip in a typical pocket point-and-shoot camera) they deliver more pixels than consumer-grade cameras, and have lower noise. Features like fan cooling also improve the image quality of studio models.

This market began in 1992 when Leaf Systems Inc. released their first digital camera back (4 Megapixels), named the &quot;DCB&quot; (often described as &#x27;a brick&#x27;). Initially mounted on Sinar Studio cameras, the camera backs were later moved to medium-format units. By the late 1990s, a number of companies produced digital camera backs of various types.

In the 2000s, the number of vendors of both high-end medium-format camera systems and digital backs began to decrease. The performance of digital SLRs cut into the sale of film-based medium-format systems, while the tremendous development expenses for medium-format digital systems meant that not all vendors could profitably compete. Contax and Bronica ceased production of cameras, Kodak stopped making their DCS series of backs, and camera and back manufacturers began to integrate.

Camera maker Hasselblad merged with digital imaging firm Imacon and partnered with Fuji to design and produce a new line of digital-friendly medium-format cameras, the H-Series. Since the manufacturer plans to sell digital backs integrated with the camera, other makers of digital backs are far less likely to be able to sell backs for this camera.

Camera maker Mamiya developed the 22MP Mamiya ZD in 2004, the first ever medium format DSLR. It also developed a ZD digital back but announced a partnership with back maker Phase One. Camera maker Sinar was taken over in stages by the digital camera back manufacturer and developer Jenoptik, and partnered with Rollei for the development of the Hy6 medium-format camera systems. DHW Fototechnik presented at photokina 2012 an updated version of the Hy6, called the Hy6 Mod2.

The Leaf Aptus 75S digital back offers 33MP resolution, with a shooting speed of 50 frames a minute. In early 2006 Hasselblad (H2D and H3D) and Phase One (P45) released a 39 megapixel back. In 2008, Phase One announced the P65+, a 60 megapixel back, the highest resolution single-shot digital back at that time (2008). Phase One continues to dominate high end non-interpolated imaging with the largest market share. Sinar continues to provide its primary Digital View Camera system while still supporting the HY6 medium format with a new platform independent eSprit 65 LV digital camera back. On 20 September 2010, Leaf released a 80MP digital back, the Aptus-II 12. The Leaf Aptus-II 12&#x27;s sensor size of 53.7 mm × 40.3 mm is 92% of the area of a 56 mm × 41.5 mm standard-sized 6 × 4.5 frame, 69% of a 56 mm × 56 mm square-sized 6 × 6 frame, and 45% of the area of a 56 mm × 84 mm 6 × 9 frame.

Introduced in December 2010, the Pentax 645D is a 40 megapixel medium-format DSLR. The camera has a 44×33 mm image sensor and the raw file is in DNG format. It is the first digital version of the company&#x27;s 645 medium-format camera system and it is compatible with the existing 645 system lenses.

In early 2014, the first Medium format cameras with a CMOS sensor instead of a CCD sensor were introduced by Phase One and Hasselblad. This sensor type gives better image quality mainly in High ISO with a dynamic range of up to 14 f-stops. Phase One and Hasselblad used the same 50MP CMOS sensor made by Sony. Similarly, the Pentax 645Z uses a 51 MP CMOS sensor.

Fujifilm started its GFX series of medium format digital cameras with the introduction of 50MP GFX 50S model released in January 2017, and as of mid 2024 has seven cameras in the GFX lineup, including three 51 MP models and four 102MP models.

== Low-budget medium-format cameras ==

While most professional medium-format cameras are expensive, some cheaper plastic imports, such as the Diana and Holga cameras, are gaining in popularity for their creative potential. In the past, these kinds of cameras have been referred to as toy cameras, but now they are considered a real creative alternative to professional medium-format cameras and are sought after for the unique experimental results they can create. 

Lower cost medium-format cameras like the Diana F+ and Belair X 6-12 are sold through various outlets, including the Austrian Lomography company. In 2007, Lomography brought the 1960s Diana camera back to the market with the Diana F+ camera, a system camera that allows photographers to experiment with interchangeable lenses, flashes, and film backs. These cameras are characterized by their plastic lenses, light leaks that oddly colorize an image, extreme vignetting, and color saturation. While these elements can be considered as flaws to photographers seeking perfect images, many people enjoy the &quot;artistic&quot; results. Because of the popularity of the Lomography photographic style, medium-format photography has seen a resurgence with amateur photographers. 

Twin-lens reflex cameras (TLRs) and folders without the distortion and light leaks can be purchased on the used market in the same price range. The Chinese Seagull TLR and medium-format cameras from the former Soviet Union such as the Russian Lubitel and somewhat better made Ukrainian Kiev-Arsenal 60 and 88 are also available at moderate prices. These cameras can deliver quality images, although the lenses and camera bodies are not at the level of those from Swedish, German, and Japanese manufacturers. Depending on the condition of the camera, they can produce images ranging from the Lomographic style to images closer to their European and Japanese counterparts. In 2008 Lomography also reintroduced the previously discontinued Lubitel with the Lubitel 166+, a recreation of the original 1946 Lubitel camera with some new features including dual-format capability.

Since 2014, Lomography has been producing its medium format version of the Soviet-original Lomo LC-A camera, the Lomo LC-A 120, as compact option for medium format photographers.

Used folding cameras, TLRs, and box cameras are also an inexpensive option to shoot medium format. Many U.S.-made folders, including most of the mass-produced Kodak folders, use the discontinued 620 film requiring the user to respool 120 films or modify the film spool to fit.

== Open source 3D printed cameras ==
There have been several projects to produce open source 3D printed cameras including K-Pan and Dora Goodman Cameras which produces medium format cameras as well as 35mm and large format compatible cameras. Goodman cameras are compatible with Mamiya press lenses and some Mamiya medium format film backs.

<text>Messerschmitt AG () was a German share-ownership limited, aircraft manufacturing corporation named after its chief designer Willy Messerschmitt from mid-July 1938 onwards, and known primarily for its World War II fighter aircraft, in particular the Bf 109 and Me 262. The company survived in the post-war era, undergoing a number of mergers and changing its name from Messerschmitt to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm before being bought by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA, now part of Airbus) in 1989.

==History==
===Background===
In February 1916, the south German engineering company MAN AG and several banks purchased the unprofitable aircraft builder Otto-Flugzeugwerke, starting a new company, &quot;Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG&quot; (abbreviated &quot;B.F.W.&quot;, and meaning approximately &quot;Bavarian Aircraft Factory&quot;). The articles of association were drawn up on 19 and 20 February, and completed on 2 March 1916. Details of the company were recorded in the Commercial Register with an equity capital of RM 1,000,000 on 7 March 1916. 36% of the capital was provided by the Bank für Handel und Industrie, Berlin, 30% by MAN AG and 34% by Hermann Bachstein, Berlin. The first Chairman of the Board of Management was Peter Eberwein, who had previously been employed at Albatros Flugzeugwerke.

Due to the need for immediate aircraft production for the ongoing war, there was no time for development work and BFW manufactured aircraft under licence from Albatros Flugzeugwerke. Within a month of being set up, the company was able to supply aircraft to the war ministries of Prussia and Bavaria. However, major quality problems were encountered at the start. The German air crews frequently complained about the serious defects that appeared in the first machines from BFW. The same thing had happened with the aircraft from the predecessor company run by Gustav Otto. It was only organizational changes and more intensive supervision of the assembly line that succeeded in resolving these problems by the end of 1916. BFW then started turning out over 200 aircraft a month, with their workforce growing to 3,000 and becoming one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Bavaria.

The end of the war hit BFW hard, since military demand for aircraft collapsed. The company&#x27;s management were forced to look for new products with which to maintain their position in the market. Since World War I aircraft were largely built from wood to keep their weight down, BFW was equipped with the very latest joinery plant. The company still held stocks of materials sufficient for about 200 aircraft, and worth 4.7 million reichsmarks. The machinery and the materials were then used for the production of furniture and fitted kitchens. In addition, from 1921 onwards, the company manufactured motorcycles of its own design under the names of Flink and Helios.

In the autumn of 1921, Austrian financier Camillo Castiglioni first announced his interest in purchasing BFW. While most of the shareholders accepted his offer, MAN AG initially held on to its shareholding in BFW, but Castiglioni wanted to acquire all the shares. He was supported in this by BMW&#x27;s Managing Director Franz Josef Popp who, in a letter to the chairman of MAN, described BFW as a &quot;dead factory, which possesses no plant worth mentioning, and consists very largely of dilapidated and unsuitable wooden sheds situated in a town that is extremely unfavorable for industrial activities and whose status continues to give little cause for enthusiasm&quot;. Apparently Popp was still in close contact with Castiglioni and was perhaps even privy to the latter&#x27;s plans for merging BMW with BFW. It was probably in the spring of 1922 that Castiglioni and Popp persuaded MAN to give up its shares in BFW, so that now the company belonged exclusively to Castiglioni. Then, in May of the same year, when the Italian-born investor was able to acquire BMW&#x27;s engine business from Knorr-Bremse AG, nothing more stood in the way of a merger between the aircraft company BFW and the engine builders BMW.

===Reestablishment===
Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW/Bavarian Aircraft Works) was reformed in 1926, in Augsburg, Bavaria, when Udet Flugzeugbau GmbH was changed into a joint-stock company. In the early stages, BMW AG held a stake in this company and was represented by Josef Popp, who held a place on the Supervisory Board.

Willy Messerschmitt joined the company in 1927 as chief designer and engineer and formed a design team.

One of the first designs, the Messerschmitt M20, was a near-catastrophe for the designer and the company. Many of the prototypes crashed, one of them killing Hans Hackmack, a close friend of Erhard Milch, the head of Deutsche Luft Hansa and the German civil aviation authorities. Milch was upset by the lack of response from Messerschmitt and this led to a lifelong hatred towards him. Milch eventually cancelled all contracts with Messerschmitt and forced BFW into bankruptcy in 1931. However, Messerschmitt&#x27;s friendship with Hugo Junkers prevented a stagnation of the careers of him and BFW, which was started again in 1933. Milch still prevented Messerschmitt&#x27;s takeover of the BFW until 1938, hence the designation &quot;Bf&quot; of early Messerschmitt designs.

Messerschmitt promoted a concept he called &quot;light weight construction&quot; in which many typically separate load-bearing parts were merged into a single reinforced firewall, thereby saving weight and improving performance. The first true test of the concept was in the Bf 108 &quot;Taifun&quot; sports aircraft, which would soon be setting all sorts of records. Based on this performance the company was invited to submit a design for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s 1935 fighter contest, winning it with the Bf 109, based on the same construction methods.

From this point on Messerschmitt became a favorite of the Nazi party, as much for his designs as his political abilities and the factory location in southern Germany away from the &quot;clumping&quot; of aviation firms on the northern coast. BFW was reconstituted as &quot;Messerschmitt AG&quot; on 11 July 1938, with Willy Messerschmitt as chairman and managing director. The renaming of BFW resulted in the company&#x27;s RLM designation prefix changing from &quot;Bf&quot; to &quot;Me&quot; for all newer designs that were accepted by the RLM after the acquisition date. Existing types, such as the Bf 109 and 110, retained their earlier designation in official documents, although sometimes the newer designations were used as well, most often by subcontractors, such as Erla Maschinenwerk of Leipzig. In practice, all BFW/Messerschmitt aircraft from the Bf 108 four-seat touring monoplane, to the Bf 163 light observation aircraft (which competed unsuccessfully for the government contract won by the rival Fieseler Fi 156 design) were prefixed &quot;Bf&quot;, all later types with &quot;Me&quot;.

===World War II===

During the war Messerschmitt became a major design supplier, their Bf 109 and Bf 110 forming the vast majority of fighter strength for the first half of the war. Several other designs were also ordered, including the enormous Me 321 &quot;Gigant&quot; transport glider, and its six-engined follow on, the Me 323. However, for the second half of the war, Messerschmitt turned almost entirely to jet-powered designs, producing the world&#x27;s first operational jet fighter, the Me 262 &quot;Schwalbe&quot; (&quot;Swallow&quot;). They also produced the DFS-designed Me 163 &quot;Komet&quot;, the first rocket-powered design to enter service. Messerschmitt relied heavily on slave labour to produce much of the parts needed for these aircraft during the second half of World War II; these parts were assembled in an enormous tunnel system in Sankt Georgen an der Gusen, Austria. Slave labour was provided by inmates of the brutal KZ Gusen I and Gusen II camps, and by inmates from nearby Mauthausen concentration camp, all located near the St. Gorgen quarries. 40,000 inmates from Spain, Italy, Poland, Slovenia, France, Russia, Hungarian Jews and twenty other nationalities were murdered during the production of these aircraft at KZ Gusen. Messerschmitt officials maintained barracks at the concentration camp to oversee the work being done by the inmates. Messerschmitt, and its executive Willy Messerschmitt also occupied the famed Villa Tugendhat in Brno, Czech Republic, designed by Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich in the 1920s; the Messerschmitt aircraft factory office and the Gestapo occupied the property during the war.

Messerschmitt had its share of poor designs as well; the Me 210, designed as a follow-on to the 110, was an aerodynamic disaster that almost led to the forced dissolution of the company. The design problems were eventually addressed in the Me 410 &quot;Hornisse&quot;, but only small numbers were built before all attention turned to the 262. Later in the war, in competition with the Junkers Ju 390 and the unbuilt, February 1943-initiated Heinkel He 277, Messerschmitt also worked on a heavy &quot;Amerika Bomber&quot; design, the Me 264, which flew in prototype form — with three prototype airframes built, the first of which flew in December 1942 — but was too late to see combat.

==Post-war==
For ten years after World War II, the company was not allowed to produce aircraft. One alternative the company came up with was the three-wheeled motorcycle/bubble car or Kabinenroller (cabinscooter) KR175 / KR200, designed by an aircraft engineer, Fritz Fend.

The cars were actually made by Fend&#x27;s own company in the Messerschmitt works at Regensburg, and Willy Messerschmitt had very little to do with the vehicles other than ruling that they carried his name. Production of the KR200 ceased in 1964.

The Messerschmitt factory also produced prefabricated houses, which were designed as &quot;self-building-kits&quot; mainly based on an alloy framework.

===Return to aviation===
On 6 June 1968, Messerschmitt AG merged with the small civil engineering and civil aviation firm Bölkow, becoming Messerschmitt-Bölkow. The following May, the firm acquired Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB). The company then changed its name to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB). In 1989 MBB was taken over by DASA. DASA later operated as &quot;EADS Germany&quot;, which is now Airbus.

<text>In genetics, an operon is a functioning unit of DNA containing a cluster of genes under the control of a single promoter. The genes are transcribed together into an mRNA strand and either translated together in the cytoplasm, or undergo splicing to create monocistronic mRNAs that are translated separately, i.e. several strands of mRNA that each encode a single gene product. The result of this is that the genes contained in the operon are either expressed together or not at all. Several genes must be &quot;co-transcribed&quot; to define an operon.

Originally, operons were thought to exist solely in prokaryotes (which includes organelles like plastids that are derived from bacteria), but their discovery in eukaryotes was shown in the early 1990s, and are considered to be rare. In general, expression of prokaryotic operons leads to the generation of polycistronic mRNAs, while eukaryotic operons lead to monocistronic mRNAs.

Operons are also found in viruses such as bacteriophages. For example, T7 phages have two operons. The first operon codes for various products, including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon. The second operon includes a lysis gene meant to cause the host cell to burst.

== History ==
The term &quot;operon&quot; was first proposed in a short paper in the Proceedings of the French Academy of Science in 1960. From this paper, the so-called general theory of the operon was developed. This theory suggested that in all cases, genes within an operon are negatively controlled by a repressor acting at a single operator located before the first gene. Later, it was discovered that genes could be positively regulated and also regulated at steps that follow transcription initiation. Therefore, it is not possible to talk of a general regulatory mechanism, because different operons have different mechanisms. Today, the operon is simply defined as a cluster of genes transcribed into a single mRNA molecule. Nevertheless, the development of the concept is considered a landmark event in the history of molecular biology. The first operon to be described was the &quot;lac&quot; operon in &quot;E. coli&quot;. The 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was awarded to François Jacob, André Michel Lwoff and Jacques Monod for their discoveries concerning the operon and virus synthesis.

== Overview ==

Operons occur primarily in prokaryotes but also rarely in some eukaryotes, including nematodes such as &quot;C. elegans&quot; and the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. rRNA genes often exist in operons that have been found in a range of eukaryotes including chordates. An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes.5 The regulators of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of the regulators, promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations.

Operons are related to regulons, stimulons and modulons; whereas operons contain a set of genes regulated by the same operator, regulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single regulatory protein, and stimulons contain a set of genes under regulation by a single cell stimulus. According to its authors, the term &quot;operon&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;to operate&quot;.

== As a unit of transcription ==

An operon contains one or more structural genes which are generally transcribed into one polycistronic mRNA (a single mRNA molecule that codes for more than one protein). However, the definition of an operon does not require the mRNA to be polycistronic, though in practice, it usually is. Upstream of the structural genes lies a promoter sequence which provides a site for RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. Close to the promoter lies a section of DNA called an &quot;operator&quot;.

== Operons versus clustering of prokaryotic genes ==
All the structural genes of an operon are turned ON or OFF together, due to a single promoter and operator upstream to them, but sometimes more control over the gene expression is needed. To achieve this aspect, some bacterial genes are located near together, but there is a specific promoter for each of them; this is called gene clustering. Usually these genes encode proteins which will work together in the same pathway, such as a metabolic pathway. Gene clustering helps a prokaryotic cell to produce metabolic enzymes in a correct order.
In one study, it has been posited that in the Asgard (archaea), ribosomal protein coding genes occur in clusters that are less conserved in their organization than in other Archaea; the closer an Asgard (archaea) is to the eukaryotes, the more dispersed is the arrangement of the ribosomal protein coding genes.

== General structure ==

An operon is made up of 3 basic DNA components:

* Promoter – a nucleotide sequence that enables a gene to be transcribed. The promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase, which then initiates transcription. In RNA synthesis, promoters indicate which genes should be used for messenger RNA creation – and, by extension, control which proteins the cell produces.
* Operator – a segment of DNA to which a repressor binds. It is classically defined in the lac operon as a segment between the promoter and the genes of the operon. The main operator (O1) in the &quot;lac&quot; operon is located slightly downstream of the promoter; two additional operators, O2 and O3 are located at -82 and +412, respectively. In the case of a repressor, the repressor protein physically obstructs the RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes.
* Structural genes – the genes that are co-regulated by the operon.

Not always included within the operon, but important in its function is a regulatory gene, a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins. The regulatory gene does not need to be in, adjacent to, or even near the operon to control it.

An inducer (small molecule) can displace a repressor (protein) from the operator site (DNA), resulting in an uninhibited operon.

Alternatively, a corepressor can bind to the repressor to allow its binding to the operator site. A good example of this type of regulation is seen for the trp operon.

== Regulation ==

Control of an operon is a type of gene regulation that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions. Operon regulation can be either negative or positive by induction or repression.

Negative control involves the binding of a repressor to the operator to prevent transcription.

* In &quot;negative inducible operons&quot;, a regulatory repressor protein is normally bound to the operator, which prevents the transcription of the genes on the operon. If an inducer molecule is present, it binds to the repressor and changes its conformation so that it is unable to bind to the operator. This allows for expression of the operon. The &quot;lac&quot; operon is a negatively controlled inducible operon, where the inducer molecule is allolactose.
* In &quot;negative repressible operons&quot;, transcription of the operon normally takes place. Repressor proteins are produced by a regulator gene, but they are unable to bind to the operator in their normal conformation. However, certain molecules called corepressors are bound by the repressor protein, causing a conformational change to the active site. The activated repressor protein binds to the operator and prevents transcription. The &quot;trp&quot; operon, involved in the synthesis of tryptophan (which itself acts as the corepressor), is a negatively controlled repressible operon.

Operons can also be positively controlled. With positive control, an activator protein stimulates transcription by binding to DNA (usually at a site other than the operator).

* In &quot;positive inducible operons&quot;, activator proteins are normally unable to bind to the pertinent DNA. When an inducer is bound by the activator protein, it undergoes a change in conformation so that it can bind to the DNA and activate transcription. Examples of positive inducible operons include the MerR family of transcriptional activators. 
* In &quot;positive repressible operons&quot;, the activator proteins are normally bound to the pertinent DNA segment. However, when an inhibitor is bound by the activator, it is prevented from binding the DNA. This stops activation and transcription of the system.

== The &quot;lac&quot; operon ==

The &quot;lac&quot; operon of the model bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; was the first operon to be discovered and provides a typical example of operon function. It consists of three adjacent structural genes, a promoter, a terminator, and an operator. The &quot;lac&quot; operon is regulated by several factors including the availability of glucose and lactose. It can be activated by allolactose. Lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription. This is an example of the derepressible (from above: negative inducible) model. So it is a negative inducible operon induced by presence of lactose or allolactose.

== The &quot;trp&quot; operon ==

Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues, the trp operon in &quot;E. coli&quot; was the first repressible operon to be discovered. While the lac operon can be activated by a chemical (allolactose), the tryptophan (Trp) operon is inhibited by a chemical (tryptophan). This operon contains five structural genes: trp E, trp D, trp C, trp B, and trp A, which encodes tryptophan synthetase. It also contains a promoter which binds to RNA polymerase and an operator which blocks transcription when bound to the protein synthesized by the repressor gene (trp R) that binds to the operator. In the lac operon, lactose binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from repressing gene transcription, while in the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein and enables it to repress gene transcription. Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation. This is an example of the corepressible model.

== Predicting the number and organization of operons ==

The number and organization of operons has been studied most critically in &quot;E. coli&quot;. As a result, predictions can be made based on an organism&#x27;s genomic sequence.

One prediction method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames as a primary predictor of the number of operons in the genome. The separation merely changes the frame and guarantees that the read through is efficient. Longer stretches exist where operons start and stop, often up to 40–50 bases.

An alternative method to predict operons is based on finding gene clusters where gene order and orientation is conserved in two or more genomes.

Operon prediction is even more accurate if the functional class of the molecules is considered. Bacteria have clustered their reading frames into units, sequestered by co-involvement in protein complexes, common pathways, or shared substrates and transporters. Thus, accurate prediction would involve all of these data, a difficult task indeed.

Pascale Cossart&#x27;s laboratory was the first to experimentally identify all operons of a microorganism, &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;. The 517 polycistronic operons are listed in a 2009 study describing the global changes in transcription that occur in &quot;L. monocytogenes&quot; under different conditions.

<doc id="176672" wikidata="Q494389" url="?curid=176672" title="Polaroid Corporation">
<text>Polaroid Corporation was an American company best known for its instant film and cameras, which now survives as a brand for consumer electronics. The company was founded in 1937 by Edwin H. Land, to exploit the use of his Polaroid polarizing polymer. Land and Polaroid created the first instant camera, the Land Camera, in 1948. 

Land ran the company until 1981. Its peak employment was 21,000 in 1978, and its peak revenue was $3 billion in 1991.

Polaroid Corporation was declared bankrupt in 2001; its brand and assets were sold off. A new Polaroid company formed, and the brand assets changed hands multiple times before being sold to Polish billionaire in 2017. This acquisition allowed Impossible Project, which had started producing instant films for older Polaroid cameras in 2008, to rebrand as Polaroid Originals in 2017, and eventually as Polaroid in 2020. Since the original company&#x27;s downfall, Polaroid-branded products in other fields, such as LCD televisions and DVD players, have been developed and released by various licensees globally.

== History ==

===Founding and success===
 
The original Polaroid Corporation was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Edwin Land and George W. Wheelwright III in 1937. It has been described by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; as a &quot;juggernaut of innovation&quot;, and &quot;the Apple of its time&quot; with a &quot;leader in Edwin Land, a scientist who guided the company as the founding CEO for four decades&quot;. Polaroid’s initial market was in polarized sunglasses — spawned from Land’s self-guided research in light polarization. Land, having completed his freshman year at Harvard University, left to pursue this market, resulting in Polaroid&#x27;s birth. Land later returned to Harvard to continue his research. Polaroid, owning patents to its polarizer technology, got its start by employing polarization in products that included 3-D movies and protective goggles for military dogs. During World War II, Polaroid designed and manufactured numerous products for the armed services including an infrared night viewing device. He led the company as CEO for 43 years. He headed the Polaroid Corporation, developing it from a small research and marketing firm into a well-known high-tech company. Kodak was a customer for some of Land&#x27;s polarizing products. Recognized by most as the father of instant photography, he included all the operations of a darkroom inside the film itself. He gave the first public demonstration of his new Land Camera in February 1947; from then until 1972, the user had to release the film manually, pull a tab, and peel the negative from the finished positive print—the first version to eliminate these intermediate steps was the SX-70 of 1972, which ejected the print automatically. Land was pictured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1972 with the inscription, &quot;A Genius and His Magic Camera&quot;.

In the 1940s, Polaroid purchased the B B Chemical Company building at 784 Memorial Drive in Cambridge, Massachusetts for its headquarters. The landmark Streamline Moderne style structure would be added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1982.

When Kodak announced instant film cameras in 1976, Polaroid announced they were suing them, accusing Kodak of having stolen its patented instant photography process. In the two years that followed the lawsuit, total sales of instant cameras climbed from 7.4 million cameras in 1976 to 10.3 million in 1977 and 14.3 million in 1978. The suit in federal court lasted 10 years. Polaroid asked for $12 billion for infringements of its patents by Kodak. The court ruled in favor of Polaroid and ordered Kodak to cease instant picture production, plus pay Polaroid $909.5 million of the $12 billion it had asked for.

===Decline===
In 1977, Land introduced the Polaroid Instant Home Movie camera named Polavision, based on the Dufaycolor process. However, the product arrived on the market when videotape-based systems were rapidly gaining popularity. Thus it failed to sell well in retail stores and has been described as the swan song for Polaroid. After four decades as chairman, Edwin Land was coerced into resigning and leaving the corporation he had founded. He died in 1991. The &quot;Polavision&quot; debacle eventually caused the company to write off $89 million, including most of the manufactured products. The underlying technology of Polavision was later improved for use in the Polachrome instant slide film system.

William J. McCune Jr was appointed chief executive officer in 1980. He joined the company in 1939, two years after its founding. He led the company until end 1985 when I. M. Booth, 54, was appointed as Polaroid’s chief executive, McCune remained chairman.

In the 1980s, Polaroid tried to reinvent itself without Land at its helm by shifting away from a dependence on consumer photography, a market that was in steady decline. In 1984 Polaroid announced &quot;that it would enter the United States
electronic video market with its own line of Polaroid videotapes.&quot;
Polaroid was forced to make wholesale changes that included having to fire thousands of workers and close many factories. The 1980s saw the advent of new technologies that profoundly changed the world of photography — one-hour color film processing, single-use cameras from competitors, videotape camcorders, and, in the 1990s and 2000s, digital cameras.

The company was in fact one of the early manufacturers of digital cameras, with the PDC-2000 in 1996; however, it failed to capture a large market share in that segment.

It also made 35 mm and multi-format scanners, such as Polaroid SprintScan 4000 35 mm scanner (the first scanner with a 4000 DPI CCD) in 1999, and the Polaroid PrintScan 120 in 2000. The scanners received mixed reviews and saw heavy competition from Nikon and Minolta products. The entire line was discontinued when Polaroid entered bankruptcy in 2001.

Prior to bankruptcy, the company sold its landmark, historic headquarters building and surrounding property to The Bulfinch Companies for $10 million.

=== Bankruptcy (2001) ===
The original Polaroid Corporation filed for federal Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 11, 2001. The outcome was that within ten months, most of the business (including the &quot;Polaroid&quot; name itself and non-bankrupt foreign subsidiaries) had been sold to Bank One&#x27;s One Equity Partners (OEP). OEP Imaging Corporation then changed its name to Polaroid Holding Company (PHC). However, this new company operated using the name of its bankrupt predecessor, Polaroid Corporation.

Significant criticism surrounded this &quot;takeover&quot; because the process left executives of the company with large bonuses, while stockholders, as well as current and retired employees, were left with nothing. The company announced a plan that gave the top 45 executives bonuses just for staying at their jobs. Meanwhile, other employees were restricted from selling their stock before leaving their jobs.

As part of the settlement, the original Polaroid Corporation changed its name to Primary PDC, Inc. Having sold its assets, it was now effectively nothing more than an administrative shell. Primary PDC received approximately 35 percent of the &quot;new&quot; Polaroid, which was to be distributed to its unsecured creditors (including bondholders). , Primary PDC remained in existence under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but conducts no commercial business and has no employees.

Polaroid’s bankruptcy is widely attributed to the failure of senior management — unable to anticipate the impact of digital cameras on its film business. This type of managerial failure is also known as the success trap.

=== Use of Polaroid brand and assets following bankruptcy ===

After the bankruptcy, the Polaroid brand was licensed for use on other products with the assistance of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. In September 2002, World Wide Licenses, a subsidiary of The Character Group plc, was granted the exclusive rights for three years to manufacture and sell digital cameras under the Polaroid brand for distribution internationally. Polaroid branded LCDs and plasma televisions and portable DVD players had also appeared on the market.

On April 27, 2005, Petters Group Worldwide announced its acquisition of PHC. Petters has in the past bought up failed companies with well-known names for the value of those names. The same year, Flextronics purchased Polaroid&#x27;s manufacturing operations and the decision was made to send most of the manufacturing to China. It stopped making Polaroid cameras in 2007 and discontinued the sale of Polaroid film after 2009 to the dismay of loyal consumers. On December 18, 2008, the post-reorganization Polaroid Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota. The bankruptcy filing came shortly after the criminal investigation of its parent company, Petters Group Worldwide, and the parent company founder, Tom Petters.

==== Auction for Polaroid Corporation&#x27;s assets ====
On April 2, 2009, Patriarch Partners won an auction for Polaroid Corporation&#x27;s assets including the company&#x27;s name, intellectual property, and photography collection. Patriarch&#x27;s $59.1 million bid beat bids from PHC Acquisitions, Hilco Consumer Capital Corp and Ritchie Capital.

This led to some very contentious fighting and litigation, and Patriarch wound up walking away in early May 2009, and a joint venture between Gordon Brothers Brands LLC and Hilco Consumer Capital LP picked up the pieces. According to a Reuters report:

The move by New York-based Patriarch, a private-equity firm, [to drop their claim], follows US District Judge James Rosenbaum&#x27;s ruling on Thursday in Minneapolis that putting the purchase on hold during appeal would threaten operations at Polaroid, which is spending its cash at a rate of $3 million a month.

On April 16, 2009, Polaroid won US Bankruptcy Court approval to be sold to a joint venture of Hilco Consumer Capital LP of Toronto and Gordon Brothers Brands LLC of Boston.

Hilco Consumer Capital and Gordon Brothers Brands announced the closing of the purchase of Polaroid Corporation on May 7, 2009, placing Polaroid Corporation in joint holding under a parent company named PLR IP Holdings, LLC. Former executive vice president and general manager – Americas, Scott W. Hardy was named as the new president of Polaroid Corporation and PLR IP Holdings, LLC. The majority of employees remained in their positions at the company&#x27;s Minnetonka, Minnesota headquarters as well as office locations in Boston, New York and Toronto.

On June 19, 2009, the new holding corporation for Polaroid, PLR IP Holdings, LLC announced an exclusive 5-year agreement with Summit Global Group to produce and distribute Polaroid-branded digital still cameras, digital video cameras, digital photo frames and PoGo-branded mobile products. Summit Global Group added several former Polaroid employees to their staff. The company expects the agreement to yield $1.3 billion in retail sales over an unspecified period beginning in 2009.

On January 5, 2010, Polaroid appointed Lady Gaga as &quot;Creative Director&quot; for the company. A press release stated that she would be the &quot;new face&quot; of Polaroid. In a 2014 interview an account supervisor at R&amp;J Public Relations, the PR firm for Polaroid, stated that the company is no longer working with Lady Gaga.

=== 2017-Present: Acquisition by Smołokowski; collaboration with and rebranding of &quot;Impossible&quot; ===
In 2017, the holding corporation for Polaroid, PLR IP Holdings, LLC, was acquired by Polish investor Wiaczesław &quot;Slava&quot; Smołokowski. Smołokowski was already the largest shareholder in the Impossible Project—a company formed to continue production of Polaroid-compatible film after Polaroid themselves left the market—having been persuaded to invest in it by his son Oskar. The acquisition brought both companies under the control of the Smołokowski family.

The Impossible Project (already led by Oskar Smołokowski) was rebranded as &quot;Polaroid Originals&quot;, with the last factory producing Polaroid-compatible instant film cartridges in Enschede, Netherlands being rebranded under the new name later in 2017.

In March 2019, the new polaroid.com website listed instant cameras and supplies made by Polaroid Originals alongside its other products including digital cameras, sunglasses, the Cube action camera, and television units.

March 2020, Polaroid Originals rebranded as simply Polaroid, with the Polaroid Now being the first instant film camera in years to have the Polaroid branding.

==== Efforts to preserve and restore vintage Polaroid camera models ====
Polaroid B.V. and other companies, including MiNT Camera (manufacturer of the reusable MiNT flash bar), refurbish and repair classic Polaroid products, with some companies modifying the hardware itself to add additional functionality. One such modification is the conversion of Polaroid SX-70 camera models to use the more common, and higher-ISO Polaroid 600 film.

==Controversy==
In 1970, Caroline Hunter and her co-worker, future husband Ken Williams, discovered the involvement of their employer, Polaroid, in the South African apartheid system as the producer of the passbook photos used to identify Black individuals in South Africa. To pressure Polaroid to divest from South Africa, Hunter and Williams created the Polaroid Revolutionary Worker Movement (PRWM). Through the PRWM, Hunter and Williams organized a boycott against the corporation. Consequently, Polaroid banned all sales to the government, including the military and police, and promised to raise wages and increase job training at its distributors. The plan did not pacify the PRWM, however, and, in 1971, Hunter testified before the United Nations advocating a boycott of Polaroid products. Polaroid proceeded to fire both Hunter and Williams. As a result of protests, a community group in Boston donated $10,000 it received from Polaroid to South African liberation movements. In 1977, it became public Polaroid film was being sold by the distributor Frank and Hirsch to the South African government for use in the &quot;passbook&quot; in violation of Polaroid&#x27;s policy. This ended Polaroid&#x27;s relationship with its distributor and all direct sales to South Africa.

== Other ventures ==

=== (diskettes)===

In 1985, Polaroid had its own brand of -inch floppy disks, and also a data recovery service. In 1987, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as a major brand. In 1985, &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed it a notch lower in an almost reverse alphabetical list,&quot;&quot; and noted &quot;remember that those companies established their reputations by selling other products, not diskettes.&quot;

By mid 1991, they stopped selling floppy disks. The packaging used both &quot;Polaroid&quot; and &quot;PerfectData&quot; brands

===Corporate sponsorship of motorsports===
In the 1990s, Polaroid was involved in corporate sponsorship of NASCAR. For several years, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of NASCAR&#x27;s 125 mile Featherlite Modified race at Watkins Glen and it was called the &quot;Polaroid 125&quot;. The Polaroid name was also used in sponsorship in the NASCAR Busch Series. In 1992, Polaroid was the principal sponsor of female NASCAR driver Shawna Robinson&#x27;s #25 Oldsmobile in the Busch Series. They continued as her principal sponsor when she moved to the other car numbers in 1993 and 1994.

Polaroid formerly sponsored the Target Chip Ganassi entry of Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s #42 Chevy Impala in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and entries in the IRL Indy Car Series, including the car driven by Dario Franchitti.

The Polaroid name has also been associated with the NOPI drift series. Polaroid was the principal sponsor of the Nissan 350Z driven by Nick Bollea in the 2007 season.

=== Discontinuation and relaunch of Polaroid film ===
On February 8, 2008, Polaroid (under the control of Thomas J. Petters of Petters Group Worldwide) announced that the company has decided to gradually cease production and withdraw from analog instant film products completely in 2008. Since March 2010, instant film materials for vintage Polaroid cameras have again become available on the market, developed and manufactured by a group called The Impossible Project, at the former Polaroid production plant in Enschede, Netherlands.

Austrian photographer Florian Kaps, the owner of the largest online vendor for SX-70 films and organizer of the web-based instant photo gallery Polanoid.net, had bought the approximately 500,000 film packages that were on stock. He teamed with André Bosman, a former head of film production in the large Polaroid film factory at Enschede, designed a plan to redesign the SX-70/600 film system in collaboration with Ilford Photo, and convinced the Polaroid owners to participate. Plans for a relaunch under the Impossible label were announced in January 2009. Buildings in the Enschede plant, which had produced 30 million film packs in 2007 and 24 million in the first half of 2008, were leased to the company created by Kaps, who by May 2009 had raised $2.6 million from friends and family for what he had named The Impossible Project.

On March 22, 2010, Impossible announced the release of two monochromatic films, PX100 and PX600, compatible with SX-70 and 600 type cameras, respectively. Color films were initially released in 2010 for SX-70 type cameras, followed in 2011 with the release of much improved color films for Polaroid 600, SX-70 and Spectra Cameras.

Then Impossible had originally announced a new camera that was going to be styled after older Polaroid models to coincide with the new film. The camera was due to come out before Christmas 2010, but the deadline passed with no new information on the camera. In April 2016, Impossible released the Impossible I-1; however, it was not styled after older Polaroid cameras. It was the first camera to use I-type Film and was backwards compatible with 600 Film due to I-type film being 600 film without a battery. After rebranding to Polaroid Originals, the company released another camera in September 2017 called the OneStep 2. This camera was modeled after the original OneStep with new features as originally planned, though the OneStep 2 uses the same type of film as the Impossible I-1 unlike the OneStep that used SX-70 Film.

On April 28, 2012, the documentary &quot;Time Zero: The Last Year of Polaroid Film&quot;, directed by Grant Hamilton, was released in the U.S. It covers the rise, fall, and grass-roots revival of Polaroid&#x27;s instant film technology.

=== Mobile printers ===
In summer 2008 Polaroid released the PoGo, an instant photo printer producing prints. It uses the Zink (&quot;zero ink&quot;) technology which is similar to dye sublimation but has the dye crystals embedded in the photo paper itself. Models CZA-10011B and CZA-20011B exist (which Polaroid claim to be identical).

In 2009, the CZA-05300B PoGo, a 5 megapixel digital camera integrated with a Zink printer, was released.

In 2011, the company released the Polaroid GL10 Instant Mobile Printer producing 3 by 4 inch prints. The printer, designed by Polaroid and Lady Gaga, allows people to print directly from a mobile phone or digital camera. This product is the first product in the new Polaroid Grey Label line.

=== Digital photography ===
Polaroid released a line of cameras without printers including the t1035, a 10-megapixel digital camera.

In January 2012, Polaroid announced a new &quot;smart camera&quot;, entitled the Polaroid SC1630 smart camera, which is powered by Google Android. The SC1630 is a combination of a camera and a portable media player, that allows users to take photos with a built-in 16 MP HD camera, download apps from Google Play, check their email, and browse the web. The built-in camera allows 3X optical zoom. Other features on the media player include Wi-Fi, touch screen, geotagging, smart albums, and 32 GB of storage via a micro SD card.

In September 2014 Polaroid introduced a $99 action camera named the &quot;Polaroid Cube&quot;, marketed as an alternative to cameras such as the GoPro Hero (which retails for $129), specifically for casual, light users of action camcorders. In 2015 GoPro released the similar GoPro HERO4 Session.

=== Wideblue ===

In March 2006, the specialist design and development department in Polaroid&#x27;s Vale of Leven plant in Scotland was bought out by its management team. Known as Wideblue the company specializes in helping small technology based companies develop products and manufacturing processes.

In 2014 Wideblue was hired to design the Impossible Project mass market instant camera.

<doc id="176673" wikidata="Q1455898" url="?curid=176673" title="Well-posed problem">
<text>In mathematics, a well-posed problem is one for which the following properties hold:
# The problem has a solution
# The solution is unique
# The solution&#x27;s behavior changes continuously with the initial conditions

Examples of archetypal well-posed problems include the Dirichlet problem for Laplace&#x27;s equation, and the heat equation with specified initial conditions. These might be regarded as &#x27;natural&#x27; problems in that there are physical processes modelled by these problems.

Problems that are not well-posed in the sense above are termed ill-posed. A simple example is a global optimization problem, because the location of the optima is generally not a continuous function of the parameters specifying the objective, even when the objective itself is a smooth function of those parameters. Inverse problems are often ill-posed; for example, the inverse heat equation, deducing a previous distribution of temperature from final data, is not well-posed in that the solution is highly sensitive to changes in the final data.

Continuum models must often be discretized in order to obtain a numerical solution. While solutions may be continuous with respect to the initial conditions, they may suffer from numerical instability when solved with finite precision, or with errors in the data.

==Conditioning==
Even if a problem is well-posed, it may still be &quot;ill-conditioned&quot;, meaning that a small error in the initial data can result in much larger errors in the answers. Problems in nonlinear complex systems (so-called chaotic systems) provide well-known examples of instability. An ill-conditioned problem is indicated by a large condition number.

If the problem is well-posed, then it stands a good chance of solution on a computer using a stable algorithm. If it is not well-posed, it needs to be re-formulated for numerical treatment. Typically this involves including additional assumptions, such as smoothness of solution. This process is known as &quot;regularization&quot;. Tikhonov regularization is one of the most commonly used for regularization of linear ill-posed problems.

==Existence of local solutions==
The existence of local solutions is often an important part of the well-posedness problem, and it is the foundation of many estimate methods, for example the energy method below.

There are many results on this topic. For example, the Cauchy–Kowalevski theorem for Cauchy initial value problems essentially states that if the terms in a partial differential equation are all made up of analytic functions and a certain transversality condition is satisfied (the hyperplane or more generally hypersurface where the initial data are posed must be non-characteristic with respect to the partial differential operator), then on certain regions, there necessarily exist solutions which are as well analytic functions. This is a fundamental result in the study of analytic partial differential equations. Surprisingly, the theorem does not hold in the setting of smooth functions; an example discovered by Hans Lewy in 1957 consists of a linear partial differential equation whose coefficients are smooth (i.e., have derivatives of all orders) but not analytic for which no solution exists. So the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem is necessarily limited in its scope to analytic functions.
==Energy method==

The energy method is useful for establishing both uniqueness and continuity with respect to initial conditions (i.e. it does not establish existence).
The method is based upon deriving an upper bound of an energy-like functional for a given problem.

Example:
Consider the diffusion equation on the unit interval with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and suitable initial data formula_1 (e.g. for which formula_2).

formula_3

Multiply the equation formula_4 by formula_5 and integrate in space over the unit interval to obtain

formula_6

This tells us that formula_7 (p-norm) cannot grow in time.
By multiplying by two and integrating in time, from formula_8 up to formula_9, one finds

formula_10

This result is the energy estimate for this problem.

To show uniqueness of solutions, assume there are two distinct solutions to the problem, call them formula_5 and formula_12, each satisfying the same initial data. 
Upon defining formula_13 then, via the linearity of the equations, one finds that formula_14 satisfies

formula_15

Applying the energy estimate tells us formula_16 which implies formula_17 (almost everywhere).

Similarly, to show continuity with respect to initial conditions, assume that formula_5 and formula_12 are solutions corresponding to different initial data formula_20 and formula_21.
Considering formula_13 once more, one finds that formula_14 satisfies the same equations as above but with formula_24. 
This leads to the energy estimate formula_25 which establishes continuity (i.e. as formula_26 and formula_27 become closer, as measured by the formula_28 norm of their difference, then formula_29).

The maximum principle is an alternative approach to establish uniqueness and continuity of solutions with respect to initial conditions for this example.
The existence of solutions to this problem can be established using Fourier series.

== Semi-group theory ==
If it is possible to denote the solution to a Cauchy problem formula_30, where &quot;A&quot; is a linear operator mapping a dense linear subspace &quot;D(A)&quot; of &quot;X&quot; into &quot;X,&quot; with formula_31, where formula_32 is a family of linear operators on &quot;X&quot;, satisfying

* &quot;S(0)=I&quot;
* &quot;S(a+b)=S(a)S(b)=S(b)S(a)&quot; for any &quot;a,b≥0&quot;
* formula_33 is continuous for every &quot;w&quot; in &quot;X&quot;
* formula_34 for every &quot;w&quot; in &quot;X&quot;

then (1) is well-posed.

Hille-Yosida theorem states the criteria on &quot;A&quot; for such a formula_32 to exist.

<text>The Brownie was a series of camera models made by Eastman Kodak and first released in 1900.

It introduced the snapshot to the masses by addressing the cost factor which had meant that amateur photography remained beyond the means of many people; the Pocket Kodak, for example, would cost most families in Britain nearly a whole month&#x27;s wages.

The Brownie was a basic cardboard box camera with a simple convex-concave lens that took -inch square pictures on No. 117 roll film. It was conceived and marketed for sales of Kodak roll films. Because of its simple controls and initial price of US$1 (equivalent to $ in 2025) along with the low price of Kodak roll film and processing, the Brownie camera surpassed its marketing goal.

==Invention and etymology==
The Brownie was invented by Frank A. Brownell for the Eastman Kodak Company. Named after the Brownie characters popularised by the Canadian writer Palmer Cox, the camera was initially aimed at children. More than 150,000 Brownie cameras were shipped in the first year of production, and cost a mere 5 shillings in the United Kingdom. An improved model, called No. 2 Brownie, came in 1901, which produced larger 3.25-by-2.25-inch (1.44:1 aspect ratio) photos, cost $2, and was also a huge success.

Initially marketed to children, with Kodak using them to popularise photography, it achieved broader appeal as people realised that, although very simple in design and operation, the Brownie could produce very good results under the right conditions.

As they were ubiquitous, many iconic shots were taken on Brownies; on 15 April 1912, Bernice Palmer used a Kodak Brownie 2A, Model A to photograph the iceberg that sank RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; as well as survivors hauled aboard RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot;, the ship on which Palmer was travelling. They were also taken to war by soldiers but by World War I the more compact Vest Pocket Kodak Camera as well as Kodak&#x27;s Autographic Camera were the most frequently used.

Another group of people that became posthumously known for their huge photo archive is the Nicholas II of Russia family, especially its four daughters (known as the OTMA sisters). They even managed to make their Brownie models produce many panoramic 4:1 photos (see Gallery).

Having written an article in the 1940s for amateur photographers suggesting an expensive camera was unnecessary for quality photography, &quot;Picture Post&quot; photographer Bert Hardy used a Brownie camera to stage a carefully posed snapshot of 17-year-old Pat Stewart, a Tiller Girls dancer, with her friend, Wendy Clarke, sitting on railings of North Pier, Blackpool, for the cover of &quot;Picture Post&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbesindia-65065/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
The cameras continued to be popular, and spawned many varieties, such as a Boy Scout edition in the 1930s. In 1940, Kodak released the Six-20 Flash Brownie, Kodak&#x27;s first internally synchronized flash camera, using General Electric bulbs. In 1957, Kodak produced the Brownie Starflash, Kodak&#x27;s first camera with a built-in flash.

The Brownie 127 was popular, selling in the millions between 1952 and 1967. It was a bakelite camera with a simple meniscus lens and a curved film plane to compensate for the deficiencies of the lens. Another model was the Brownie Cresta sold between 1955 and 1958. It used 120 film and had a fixed-focus lens.

The last official Brownie camera made was the Brownie II Camera, a 110 cartridge film model produced in Brazil for one year, 1986.

The Kodak Brownie Number 2 is a box camera that was manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company from 1901 to 1935. There were five models, A through F, and it was the first camera to use 120 film. It also came with a viewfinder and a handle. The Brownie Number 2 was made of a choice of three materials: cardboard, costing US$2.00, aluminum, costing US$2.75, and a color model which cost US$2.50. It was a very popular and affordable camera, and many are still in use by film photographers.
