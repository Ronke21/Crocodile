<text>Granular synthesis is a sound synthesis method that operates on the microsound time scale.

It is based on the same principle as sampling. However, the samples are split into small pieces of around 1 to 100 ms in duration. These small pieces are called grains. Multiple grains may be layered on top of each other, and may play at different speeds, phases, volume, and frequency, among other parameters.

At low speeds of playback, the result is a kind of soundscape, often described as a cloud, that is manipulatable in a manner unlike that for natural sound sampling or other synthesis techniques. At high speeds, the result is heard as a note or notes of a novel timbre. By varying the waveform, envelope, duration, spatial position, and density of the grains, many different sounds can be produced.

Both have been used for musical purposes: as sound effects, raw material for further processing by other synthesis or digital signal processing effects, or as complete musical works in their own right. Conventional effects that can be achieved include amplitude modulation and time stretching. More experimentally, stereo or multichannel scattering, random reordering, disintegration and morphing are possible.

== History ==
In 1947, Dennis Gabor introduced the idea that sounds can be represented by a series of elementary &quot;grains,&quot; each grain being a short pulse containing both temporal and frequency information. Greek composer Iannis Xenakis is known as the inventor of the granular synthesis technique, having expanded upon Gabor&#x27;s theoretical foundation.

Curtis Roads was the first to implement granular synthesis on a computer in 1974. 

Twelve years later, in 1986, the Canadian composer Barry Truax implemented real-time versions of this synthesis technique using the DMX-1000 Signal Processing Computer. &quot;Granular synthesis was implemented in different ways by Truax.&quot;

== Microsound == 

This includes all sounds on the time scale shorter than musical notes, the sound object time scale, and longer than the sample time scale. Specifically, this is shorter than one tenth of a second and longer than 10 milliseconds, which includes part of the audio frequency range (20Hz to 20kHz) as well as part of the infrasonic frequency range (below 20Hz, rhythm).

These sounds include transient audio phenomena and are known in acoustics and signal processing by various names including sound particles, quantum acoustics, sonal atom, grain, glisson, grainlet, trainlet, microarc, wavelet, chirplet, &quot;fof&quot;, time-frequency atom, pulsar, impulse, toneburst, tone pip, acoustic pixel, and others. In the frequency domain they may be named kernel, logon, and frame, among others.

Physicist Dennis Gabor was an important pioneer in microsound. Micromontage is musical montage with microsound.

Microtime is the level of &quot;sonic&quot; or aural &quot;syntax&quot; or the &quot;time-varying distribution of...spectral energy&quot;.

<doc id="175827" wikidata="Q309637" url="?curid=175827" title="Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus">
<text>Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus () was a Roman patrician, statesman, and military leader of the early Roman Republic who became a famous model of Roman virtue—particularly civic virtue—by the time of the late Republic.

Modern historians question some particulars of the story of Cincinnatus that was recounted in Livy&quot;&#x27;s History of Rome&quot; and elsewhere, but it is usually accepted that Cincinnatus was a historical figure who served as suffect consul in 460BC and as dictator in 458BC and (possibly) again in 439BC.

The most famous story related to Cincinnatus occurs after his retirement from public service to a simple life of farming. As Roman forces struggled to defeat the Aequi, Cincinnatus was summoned from his plough to assume complete control over the state. After achieving a swift victory in sixteen days, Cincinnatus relinquished power and its privileges, returning to labor on his farm. 

Cincinnatus&#x27;s success and his immediate resignation of near-absolute authority at the end of the crisis (traditionally dated to 458 BC) has often been cited as a model of selfless leadership, civic virtue, and service to the greater good. The story has also been seen as an exemplar of agrarian virtues like humility, modesty, and hard work. Cincinnatus was an opponent of the rights of the plebeians (the common citizens). His son, Caeso Quinctius, caused the plebeians to fall into poverty when he violently opposed their desire to have a written code of equally enforced laws.


==Life==
According to the traditional accounts, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was probably born around 519BC, during the last decade of the Roman Kingdom. He would have been a member of the ancient patrician clan Quinctia, which predated the founding of Rome and was moved to Rome from the Latin city of Alba Longa by Tullus Hostilius. The clan&#x27;s first consul was Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, elected in 471BC. As both Titus and Lucius were recorded as the son and grandson of men named Lucius Quinctius, Titus is sometimes thought to have been Lucius&#x27;s brother. This suggests Lucius was the first of his cognomen &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;the curly haired&quot;. The family was rich.

In the late 460sBC, Rome was fending off raids by the Aequi to their east. Beginning in 462BC, the tribune G. Terentilius Harsa began pressing for codification of the Roman laws to establish a kind of constitution that would check the near-regal power of the patrician consuls. In the years that followed, he and the other plebeians were ignored, fended off, rejected on procedural grounds, and finally beaten and driven from the streets by gangs of patricians and their clients, supposedly including Cincinnatus&#x27;s son Caeso.

The violent resistance of the patricians prompted so much unrest that Appius Herdonius was able to seize the Capitoline Hill and hold it against the city with a gang of outlaws and rebel slaves (in Livy) or with an army of Sabines (in Dionysius). The consul Publius Valerius Poplicola was killed in its recovery in 460BC and Cincinnatus, probably illegally, became the suffect (&quot;replacement&quot;) consul for the remainder of the year. Cincinnatus was himself a violent opponent of the plebs&#x27; proposal, which made no progress during his administration. His son was supposedly driven from town and killed for his murder of a plebeian. Cincinnatus quit the city and retired to an estate he held to the west of the Tiber.

Cincinnatus served as dictator, a king-like figure appointed by the Republic in times of extreme emergency, in 458 or 457BC in order to lead reinforcements to the defense of the Roman army under the consul L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus at Mount Algidus. Many of the details of the story are now assumed to be spurious and some consider the entire military account fictional, believing its parallels with T. Quinctius Cincinnatus&#x27;s 380BC defeat of Praeneste and Fabius the Delayer&#x27;s 217BC rescue of M. Minucius Rufus from Hannibal too great for chance. In one account, Cincinnatus took advantage of his position as dictator to hold a hearing, despite the objections of the tribunes, in which his son&#x27;s accuser Marcus Volscius was charged with perjury, driving him into exile.

During the decemvirate, Cincinnatus ran unsuccessfully for a position in that government in 450BC. Livy noted his involvement in the discussion about opening the consulship to plebeians.

Cincinnatus may have returned to serve as dictator in 439BC to defend Rome against the conspiracy the prefect L. Minucius Augurinus alleged Spurius Maelius was plotting against the Republic. When Spurius Maelius ignored his summons, he was killed by Cincinnatus&#x27;s master of horse and any plot collapsed. Cincinnatus presumably died sometime soon afterwards.

==Legend==

===Son of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus===
In the traditional accounts of the story, Cincinnatus&#x27;s son Caeso was an openly violent opponent of the attempts of the plebeians to enact the Terentilian Law, which sought to codify the Roman legal tradition and circumscribe the authority of the patrician consuls. Caeso would lead gangs to drive the Tribunes of the Plebs from the Forum, disrupting the procedures necessary to approve it. He was brought up on capital charges in 461BC but released on a large bail. A plebeian named Marcus Volscius testified that his brother, while feeble from sickness, had been knocked down and injured by Caeso with such force that he later died. Rather than face his accusers in court, Caeso fled to the Etruscans. He was then condemned to death &quot;in absentia&quot; and his father subjected to a huge punitive fine, forcing him to sell most of his estates and to retire from public life to personally work a small farm (some accounts say Caeso was killed with Poplicola in the recovery of the Capitoline from Herdonius). Modern historians particularly reject the fine as a later invention inserted to explain the dictator&#x27;s supposed poverty and heighten his virtues. Some reject the story in its entirety.

===First dictatorship===

In 458BC, the Aequi to Rome&#x27;s east broke their treaty of the year before and attempted to retake Tusculum (Frascati). The consuls for the year—L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus and G. Nautius Rutilus—led out two armies, one to Tusculum&#x27;s relief and another to strike against the lands of the Aequi and their Sabine allies. Upon reaching Mount Algidus in the Alban Hills, the army under L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus encamped and rested instead of immediately attacking. The Aequi quickly deployed around their position and successfully besieged them, with only five horsemen escaping to tell the Roman Senate what had happened. With the army of the second consul unable to help, the senators fell into a panic and authorized the nomination of a dictator. G. Nautius Rutilus or Horatius Pulvillus named Cincinnatus for a term of six months.

A group of senators was sent to Cincinnatus to inform him of his appointment, finding him ploughing his farm. He asked them, &quot;Is everything all right?&quot; and they replied that they hoped &quot;it might turn out well for both him and his country&quot;, asking that he don his senatorial toga before hearing the Senate&#x27;s mandate. He then called out to his wife Racilia, telling her to bring his toga from their cottage. Once he was properly dressed, the delegation hailed him as a dictator and ordered him to come to the city. He crossed the Tiber in one of the senate&#x27;s boats and was greeted on his return by his three sons and most of the senators. He was given several lictors for protection and enforcement of his orders.

The next morning, Cincinnatus went to the Forum and named Lucius Tarquitius as his master of the horse. He then went to the assembly of the people and ordered every man of military age to appear on the Field of Mars (&quot;Campus Martius&quot;) by the end of the day with twelve times the normal amount of encamping spikes. They then marched to the relief of the consul&#x27;s relieving army. At the Battle of Mount Algidus, they used their spikes to quickly besiege the besieging Aequi. Rather than slaughter them between the two Roman camps, Cincinnatus accepted their pleas for mercy and offered an amnesty provided that three principal offenders were executed, and Gracchus Cloelius and their other leaders be delivered to him in chains. A &quot;yoke&quot; of three spears was then set up and the Aequi made to pass under it as an act of submission, bowing and admitting their defeat. Cincinnatus then disbanded his army and returned to his farm, abandoning his control a mere fifteen days after it had been granted to him.

===Second dictatorship===

On the nomination of his brother or nephew Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus, Cincinnatus came out of retirement for a second term as dictator in 439BC to deal with the feared plot of the wealthy plebeian Spurius Maelius to buy the loyalty of the poor and establish himself as king over Rome. Cincinnatus named C. Servilius Ahala his master of the horse and directed him to bring Spurius Maelius before him. He and the other patricians then garrisoned the Capitoline Hill and other strongholds around the city.
Maelius fended off Ahala&#x27;s officer with a butcher&#x27;s knife and fled into a crowd. Ahala led a band of patricians into the crowd and killed him during his flight. With the crisis resolved, Cincinnatus again resigned his commission, having served 21 days (Ahala was later brought to trial for exceeding his commission and accepted voluntary exile). Various aspects of the story are connected with spurious etiological legends and it may have no more connection to the dictator of 458BC than the fact that the Cincinnatus of 439BC was a member of the same clan.

===Other legends===

Cincinnatus became a legend to the Romans. Twice granted supreme power, he held on to it for not a day longer than absolutely necessary. He consistently demonstrated great honour and integrity. The high esteem in which he was held by the later Romans is sometimes extended to his family. One legend from the end of his life claims a Capitolinus defended one of his sons from a charge of military incompetence by asking the jury who would go to tell the aged Cincinnatus the news in the event of a conviction. The son was said to have been acquitted because the jury could not bring itself to break the old man&#x27;s heart.

==Legacy==

Many Italian cities have plazas, streets, or other locations named after Cincinnatus (). The Cincinnato neighborhood in Anzio, Italy is named in his honor.

The legend of Cincinnatus&#x27;s military victory and subsequent relinquishment of power has continued to inspire admiration. It has also been invoked to honor other political leaders, notably George Washington. Washington&#x27;s relinquishing of control of the Continental Army, refusal to consider establishing a monarchy or assuming monarchical powers, and voluntary retirement after two terms as president to return to his farm at Mount Vernon have made allusions to Cincinnatus common in historical and literary treatments of the era.

The Society of the Cincinnati was established by Henry Knox in 1783 to assist the officers of the Continental Army and Navy and their families, to preserve the ideals of the American Revolution, and to maintain the union of the former colonies. A French Society of the Cincinnati was founded soon afterward by King Louis XVI. Cincinnati, Ohio and Cincinnatus, New York, in the United States, were named in his honor.

Cincinnatus is referenced in Book II, Chapter 1 of Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot;. The protagonist of Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; is named Cincinnatus C.

Whistleblower Edward Snowden used the nickname &quot;Cincinnatus&quot; when first contacting journalist Glenn Greenwald about releasing classified National Security Agency (NSA) documents.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred to Cincinnatus in his farewell speech outside 10 Downing Street in London on 6 September 2022. Some commentators noted that while, as Johnson said, Cincinnatus returned to his plough, he was also later recalled to power.

When, in July 2024, United States President Joe Biden announced that he would not run for re-election, multiple political commentators compared him to Cincinnatus.

<text>Leica Camera AG () is a German company that manufactures cameras, optical lenses, photographic lenses, binoculars, and rifle scopes. The company was founded by Ernst Leitz in 1869 (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar), in Wetzlar, Germany. The name Leica is derived from the first three letters of the founder&#x27;s surname (Leitz) and the first two of the word camera: lei-ca (LEItz CAmera).

In 1986, the Leitz company changed its name to Leica and moved its factory from Wetzlar to the nearby town of Solms.

Leica Camera AG is 55% owned by Austrian investment firm ACM Projektentwicklung GmbH and 45% owned by The Blackstone Group which licenses the Leica brand name from the Danaher Corporation-owned Leica Microsystems GmbH.

== History ==

From the year 1907 to the 1950s, the buildings that formed Leica factory were built on Ernst Leitz Street in Wetzlar, and remained until 1986, when the factory was moved to the city of Solms. The Wetzlar factory was located on the opposite side of the administrative building of 1957 and formed a special urban architecture; it is upstream from the slope of Kalsmunt and forms a structurally attractive graduation from the skyscrapers to the ruins of Kalsmunt Castle.

In the last decades of the 19th century, Ernst Leitz moved its production facilities to the slopes of Kalsmunt with sufficient residential buildings and workshops on the Laufdorfer Weg.

At the turn of the century, the production of optical devices expanded so much that it originated the first skyscrapers in the city of Wetzlar. The oldest part of this row of tall buildings is now hidden by a new building at the Schützenstraße. The first plans of the architect Jean Schmidt in 1907 show a brick building on a stone base, which was covered by a sloping roof and a slate roof. However, in the same year, it was decided to use the new construction of concrete skeletons and a simpler façade design. The four-story building is divided into six groups of windows, each of which has three windows. Narrow wall patterns and lightly embedded parapets summarize the three lowest floors. The fourth floor is visually separated from the lower part of the building by a very distant cornice. On either side of the central building there was a hip roof with high ceilings. The mansard&#x27;s floor expanded as production and workers also increased. Only a few years later, Leitz again demanded the construction of a tall building. After the planning of Jean Schmidt, contractor Robert Schneider built a four-story building in 1911.

The basement building was made of reinforced concrete with brick stairs. Again, the original plan, which provided a horizontal structure of the building through the cornucopia, was abandoned in favor of a simpler façade design. In the ten-axis building, similar to the oldest skyscraper, the lower levels are grouped by pilasters. The space between the two skyscrapers (which originally had been provided with subsequent buildings) had to be closed by another building in the early 1930s. Once again, it was Jean Schmidt, who prepared the plans for a first seven-story skyscraper. The still existing façade drawings show the columns with arches on the ground floor and that are fitted between a long strip of windows with excessive pilasters. The general design shows a mixture of very graphic elements and remains of curved Modernist forms that recall the buildings by Joseph Maria Olbrich at Mathildenhöhe of Darmstadt.

In 1936, the architect presented a completely revised plan. The plan was now made up of eight floors for Leica production. The building was built with a concrete construction modeled from the production halls of Opel in Rüsselsheim, Zeiss in Jena and Wernerwerk in Berlin. It was possible to access all the floors through two stairs.

The government of the city and the district finally approved a construction of eight floors with a loggia-like ninth floor, that later was closed. Due to the urban landscape that characterized the size of the building, the planning of the district government was initially rejected because of a simple and unsatisfactory exterior design. Even so, the building was built in 1938 between the two oldest skyscrapers. In 1950, west of the skyscraper of 1911, a skyscraper of similar construction with nine floors was added.

=== Before WWII ===


The first 35 mm film Leica prototypes were built by Oskar Barnack at Ernst Leitz Optische Werke, Wetzlar, in 1913. Some say the original Leica was intended as a compact camera for landscape photography, particularly during mountain hikes, but other sources indicate the camera was intended for test exposures with 35mm motion picture film. The Leica was the first practical 35 mm camera that used standard cinema 35 mm film. The Leica transports the film horizontally, extending the frame size to 24×36mm with a 2:3 aspect ratio, instead of the 18×24 mm of cinema cameras, which transport the film vertically.

The Leica had several model iterations, and in 1923, Barnack convinced his boss, Ernst Leitz II, to make a preproduction series of 31 cameras for the factory and outside photographers to test. Though the prototypes received mixed reception, Ernst Leitz decided in 1924 to produce the camera. It was an immediate success when introduced at the 1925 Leipzig Spring Fair as the Leica I (for &quot;Leitz camera&quot;). The focal plane shutter has a range from 1/20 to 1/500 second, in addition to a &quot;Z&quot; for &quot;Zeit&quot; (time) position.

Barnack conceived the Leica as a small camera that produced a small negative. To make large photos by enlargement, (the &quot;small negative, large picture&quot; concept) requires that the camera have high quality lenses that could create well-defined negatives. Barnack tried a Zeiss Tessar on his early prototype camera, but because the Tessar was designed for the 18×24 mm cine format, it inadequately covered the Leica&#x27;s 24×36mm negative. Barnack resorted to a Leitz Mikro-Summar 1:4.5/42 mm lens for the prototype, but to achieve resolution necessary for satisfactory enlargement, the 24x36 mm format needed a lens designed specially for it. The first Leica lens was a 50 mm design based on the Cooke triplet of 1893, adapted by Max Berek at Leitz. The lens has five elements in three groups—the third group being three cemented elements—and was initially named the Leitz Anastigmat. Unlike other triplets, the Leitz Anastigmat has the diaphragm between the first and second elements. When the Leica was first vended, this lens was renamed the ELMAX, for E Leitz and Max Berek. By 1925, the Leitz laboratories had produced glasses with improved optical properties, and Professor Berek designed an improved version of the ELMAX named the ELMAR that had four elements in three groups. The third group was simplified to two cemented elements, which was easier and cheaper to make. Professor Berek had two dogs, Hektor and Rex. The first of these, Hektor, gave his name to a series of Leica lenses, and the name of the second appeared in the SummaREX.

In 1930, the &quot;Leica I Schraubgewinde&quot; was first produced. It had an exchangeable lens system based on a 39mm diameter screw thread, often referred to as the Leica Thread Mount or LTM. In addition to the 50 mm normal lens, a 35 mm wide angle and a 135 mm telephoto lens were initially available. During the mid-1930s, a legendary soft-focus lens, the Thambar 90 mm was designed, and made in small numbers between 1935 and 1949, no more than 3000 units. It is now a rare collector&#x27;s item. In 2017, a new version was produced, costing $6,495. A lens from the original series can fetch between $3,000 and $8,000, depending on condition.

The Leica II was first produced in 1932, with a built in rangefinder coupled to the lens focusing mechanism. This model has a separate viewfinder (showing a reduced image) and rangefinder. In 1932, the flange to filmplane was standardised to 28.8mm, first implemented on Leica model C, and the Leica Standard the next year.

The Leica III added slow shutter speeds down to 1 second, and the model IIIa added the 1/1000 second shutter speed. The IIIa is the last model made before Barnack&#x27;s death, and therefore the last model for which he was wholly responsible. Leitz continued to refine the original design through to 1957. The final version, the IIIg, includes a large viewfinder with several framelines. These models all have a functional combination of circular dials and square windows.

Early Leica cameras bear the initials D.R.P., which stands for Deutsches Reichspatent, the name for German patents before May 1945. This is probably a reference to German patent No. 384071 &quot;Rollfilmkamera&quot; granted to Ernst Leitz, Optische Werke in Wetzlar, on November 3, 1923.

The company had always had progressive labor policies which encouraged the retention of skilled workers, many of whom were Jewish. Ernst Leitz II, who began managing the company in 1920, responded to the election of Hitler in 1933 by helping Jews to leave Germany, by &quot;assigning&quot; hundreds (even if they were not actually employees) to overseas sales offices where they were helped to find jobs. The effort intensified after Kristallnacht in 1938, until the borders were closed in September 1939. The extent of what came to be known as the &quot;Leica Freedom Train&quot; only became public after his death, well after the war.

=== After WWII ===

After the war, Leitz continued to produce the late versions of the Leica II and the Leica III through the 1950s. However, in 1954, Leitz introduced the Leica M3, with the new Leica M mount, a bayonet-like lens mount. The new camera also combined the rangefinder and viewfinder into one large, bright viewfinder with a brighter double image in the center. This system also introduced a system of parallax compensation and a new rubberized, reliable, focal-plane shutter. Leica continues to refine this model (the latest versions being the MP and MA, both of which have framelines for 28, 35, 50, 75, 90, and 135 mm lenses, which show automatically upon mounting).

In 1952, Günther Leitz decided to establish Ernst Leitz Canada at Midland, Ontario.

Post-war models bear the initials DBP, standing for Deutsches Bundespatent (Federal German Patent), instead of the DRP (Deutsches Reich patent) found on pre-war models. A number of camera companies have built models based on the Leica rangefinder design. These include the Leotax, Nicca and early Canon models in Japan, the Kardon in USA, the Reid in England and the FED and Zorki in the USSR.

In the 1970s, Walter Mandler introduced computer aided design in optical engineering. 

Until at least the mid-1950s, Leitz offered factory upgrades of earlier Leica cameras to the current model&#x27;s specifications. The upgraded cameras retained their original serial number.

From 1964, Leica produced a series of single-lens reflex cameras, beginning with the Leicaflex, followed by the Leicaflex SL, the Leicaflex SL2, and then the R series from R3 to R7, made in collaboration with the Minolta Corporation. The Leica R8 was entirely designed and manufactured by Leica. The final model was the Leica R9, which could be fitted with the Digital Module back. Leica was slow to produce an auto-exposure model, and never made a Leica R model that included auto-focusing. In 2009 the R-series was discontinued, citing new camera developments that had caused a massive loss of Leica sales.

Conceptually intermediate between the Rangefinder Leicas and the SLR Leicas was the Leica Visoflex System, a mirror reflex box that attached to the lens mount of Leica rangefinders (separate versions were made for the screwmount and M series bodies) and accepted lenses made especially for the Visoflex System. Rather than using the camera&#x27;s rangefinder, focusing was via a groundglass screen. A coupling released both mirror and shutter to make the exposure. Camera rangefinders are inherently limited in their ability to accurately focus long focal-length lenses; the mirror reflex box permitted much longer length lenses. Throughout its history, Leitz has been responsible for numerous optical innovations, such as aspherical production lenses, multicoated lenses, and rare earth lenses.

The earliest Leica reflex housing was the PLOOT (Leitz&#x27;s five letter code for its products), announced in 1935, along with the 200 mm Telyt Lens. This date is significant because it places Leica among the 35 mm SLR pioneers. Until the 1964 introduction of the Leicaflex, the PLOOT and Visoflex were Leica&#x27;s only SLR offerings. A redesigned PLOOT was introduced by Leica in 1951 as the Visoflex I. This was followed by a much more compact Visoflex II in 1960 (which was the only Visoflex version available in both LTM screwmount and M-bayonet), and the Visoflex III with instant-return mirror in 1964. Leica lenses for the Visoflex system included focal lengths of 65, 180 (rare), 200, 280, 400, 560, and 800mm. In addition, the optical groups of many rangefinder lenses could be removed and attached to the Visoflex via a system of adapters. The Visoflex system was discontinued in 1984.
The leica M6, the top model in the company&#x27;s M 35mm rangefinder camera line at the time, served as the model for this one.

Leica offered a wide range of accessories. For instance, LTM (screwmount) lenses could be used on M cameras via an adapter. Similarly, Visoflex lenses could be used on the Leicaflex and R cameras with an adapter. Furthermore, certain LTM and M rangefinder lenses featured removable optical groups that could mount via adapters on the Visoflex system, thus making them usable as rangefinder or SLR lenses for Visoflex-equipped Screwmount and M rangefinder cameras, as well as being usable on Leicaflex and R cameras. Leica also offered focusing systems, such as the Focorapid and Televit, that could replace certain lenses&#x27; helicoid mounts for sports and natural-life telephotography.

=== &#x27;Leitz&#x27; to &#x27;Leica&#x27; ===
In 1986, the Leitz company changed its name to Leica (LEItz CAmera), due to the fame of the Leica tradename. At this time, Leica relocated its factory from Wetzlar (Germany) to the nearby town of Solms (Germany). In 1996, Leica Camera separated from the Leica Group and became a publicly owned company. In 1998, the Leica group was divided into two independent units: Leica Microsystems and Leica Geosystems.

On 1 October 2012, Leica Camera AG was delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange after Lisa Germany Holding GmbH acquired the remaining minority shares stock resulting in the company being owned privately.

On 26 November 2013, Leica Camera AG announced the purchase of Sinar Photography AG, Zurich, the Swiss manufacturer of view cameras.

In May 2014, Leica Camera AG finished building a new factory at Leitz Park 1 in the new industrial part of Wetzlar and relocated back to the city where it started.

In April 2019, a television commercial for Leica titled &quot;The Hunt&quot; was released online. The commercial depicts photojournalists in war-torn and politically unstable environments; one of whom takes a photograph of the Tank Man during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Following censorship of the Leica brand on Sina Weibo, Leica revoked the commercial and sought to distance themselves from it, claiming the company did not sanction its production.

In September 2022, Leica announced Cine 1, a laser projector, for release in 2023. The model is Leica&#x27;s return to digital projectors, which the company produced under the Pradovit brand.

== Notable adherents and photographers ==
Leica cameras are particularly associated with street photography, especially in the latter twentieth century; they were used by photographers such as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Sebastião Salgado.

== Antique trade and collecting ==
Leica cameras, lenses, accessories and sales literature are collectible. There are dozens of Leica books and collector&#x27;s guides, notably the three-volume &quot;Leica, an Illustrated History&quot; by James L. Lager. Early or rare cameras and accessories can sell for very high prices. For instance, an anonymous buyer bought a rare 1923 Leica camera for 2.6 million euros ($2.8 million) at an auction in Vienna. Notably, Leica cameras with military markings are highly valued; this started a market for refurbished Soviet copies with fake markings. 

== Cameras ==
The earliest Leica prototypes were developed by the company Ernst Leitz GmbH during the first years of the 20th century, but marketing did not commence until the mid-1920s. The Leicas were innovative, by orienting the image frame sideways for the 35 mm film as opposed to the cine-camera tradition of across the film strip. The cameras were compact with collapsible lenses, for hiking and biking. The rangefinder feature was added to the Leica II in 1932, and that year both rangefinder and viewfinder cameras became available with interchangeable lenses. In 1933 the Leica III offered slow-speed shutter controls and a fast 1/1000 s shutter speed, and various iterations of the III (a,b,c,d,f,&amp;g) series became the flagship models and best sellers into the late 1950s. Further iterations of models I and II were offered but did not sell well.

Prior to WWII, Leica and competing Contax cameras from Zeiss Ikon were considered to be the finest 35 mm cameras, but post-WWII the companies had competition from Soviet and Japanese copies. During the 1950s Japanese quality and innovation, along with low pricing, devastated the European camera industry. Leica became an expensive type of camera bought largely by professional or serious photographers. However, the advent of reflex camera technology made rangefinders somewhat obsolete, leaving Leica the main product of a diminishing market segment. Leica has remained a notable tradename into the 21st Century.

The original producer of the cameras, Ernst Leitz GmbH, is now three independent companies: Leica Camera AG, Leica Geosystems AG, and Leica Microsystems GmbH, which manufacture cameras, geo survey equipment, and microscopes, respectively. Leica Microsystems GmbH owns the Leica brand and licenses its use to the other two companies. 

== Cooperation ==


During the 2018 Photokina in Cologne, Leica announced that Sigma and Panasonic had become licensed for the L-mount platform. The three companies would form a strategic and technical alliance, yet remain independent.

Leica-branded lenses, such as some Nocticron, Elmarit and Summilux lenses, have been used on many Panasonic (Matsushita) digital cameras (Lumix) and video recorders since 1995. Panasonic/Leica models were the first to incorporate optical image stabilization in their digital cameras. Several Panasonic/Leica lenses have been produced for the Micro Four Thirds mount, including the 12 mm Summilux, 15 mm Summilux and 25 mm Summilux prime lenses, and zooms including a 12–60 mm and 100–400 mm .

Leica and Minolta signed a technical cooperation agreement in June 1972.

* Minolta XE chassis became the basis for the Leica R3 SLR – cooperative development with Copal on the &#x27;Copal-Leitz Square&#x27; electronic shutter module, with advanced gear train and self-timer. 
* Minolta XD chassis and microelectronics became the basis for the Leica R4 SLR.
** Several lenses for the above cameras including the MC/MD 24mm F2.8 (Leica Elmarit-R, glass by Minolta but case Made In Germany); the (1983) MD Zoom 35–70 F3.5 (Vario-Elmar-R); (1978) Minolta MD 75–200 F4.5.
* Leica &#x27;Leitz-Minolta&#x27; CL and CLE (Compact Leica Electronic)
** Minolta co-designed and produced the following lenses for the above cameras: 
*** M-Rokkor 40mm F2 (&quot;Summicron-C&quot; – Made in Germany); 
*** M-Rokkor 90mm F4 &#x27;Made by Leitz in Germany&#x27; (&quot;Elmar-C&quot; – Made in Germany and later in Japan by Minolta). This lens was solely designed by Minolta, being remarkable for one of a few Japanese lenses to be made in Germany. The lens elements were produced by Minolta in Japan. 
*** M-Rokkor 28mm F2.8. This lens is not the same as any of the Leica M 28mm F2.8&#x27;s, being a 7 element, 5 group design while contemporary Leicas were 8e/6g (Elmarit II &#x27;72–&#x27;79 and Elmarit-M III &#x27;79–&#x27;93). The M-Rokkor was sold for about less than half the price – however Modern Photography tests indicated that performance was as good as the Leica equivalent. This is supported by user experiences and modern tests.

In 2020, Leica entered a strategic partnership with Insta360 to help produce the ONE R 1-Inch Edition. Since then, ONE R has been recognised as one of TIME magazine&#x27;s best inventions of 2020.

Since 2016, Leica has established partnership with the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, and Leica cameras will be co-engineered into Huawei smartphones, including the P series and Mate series. The first smartphone to be co-engineered with a Leica camera was the Huawei P9. The partnership ended with the Huawei P50 series in 2021.

In 2021, Leica has established technology partnership with Sharp Corporation, and Leica cameras will be co-engineered into Sharp smartphones for the Japanese market only. The first smartphone to be co-engineered with a Leica camera was the AQUOS R6 with 1-inch-sensor camera. Then Leica with the SoftBank introduced the smartphone Leitz Phone 1 which have same specifications as AQUOS R6 but different design.

In 2022, Leica entered a strategic partnership with Xiaomi to jointly develop Leica cameras to be used in Xiaomi flagship smartphones, succeeding the partnership between Huawei and Leica. The first flagship smartphones under this new partnership were the Xiaomi 12S Ultra and Xiaomi MIX Fold 2, launched in July and August 2022, respectively.

In 2014, to commemorate Leica camera&#x27;s 100th anniversary, they partnered with Swiss watch manufacture Valbray to develop a limited edition chronograph wristwatch with Valbray&#x27;s signature Leica aperture inspired dial.

<doc id="175835" wikidata="Q864844" url="?curid=175835" title="Biot number">
<text>The Biot number (Bi) is a dimensionless quantity used in heat transfer calculations, named for the eighteenth-century French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774–1862). The Biot number is the ratio of the thermal resistance for conduction inside a body to the resistance for convection at the surface of the body. This ratio indicates whether the temperature inside a body varies significantly in space when the body is heated or cooled over time by a heat flux at its surface.

In general, problems involving small Biot numbers (much smaller than 1) are analytically simple, as a result of nearly uniform temperature fields inside the body. Biot numbers of order one or greater indicate more difficult problems with nonuniform temperature fields inside the body. 

The Biot number appears in a number of heat transfer problems, including transient heat conduction and fin heat transfer calculations.

==Definition==
The Biot number is defined as:

:formula_1

where:
* formula_2 is the thermal conductivity of the body [W/(m·K)]
* formula_3 is a convective heat transfer coefficient [W/(m2·K)]
* formula_4 is a characteristic length [m] of the geometry considered.

(The Biot number should not be confused with the Nusselt number, which employs the thermal conductivity of the fluid rather than that of the body.)
The characteristic length in most relevant problems becomes the heat characteristic length, i.e. the ratio between the body volume and the heated (or cooled) surface of the body:
formula_5
Here, the subscript &quot;Q&quot;, for &quot;heat&quot;, is used to denote that the surface to be considered is only the portion of the total surface through which the heat passes. 

The physical significance of Biot number can be understood by imagining the heat flow from a small hot metal sphere suddenly immersed in a pool, to the surrounding fluid. The heat flow experiences two resistances: the first for conduction within the solid metal (which is influenced by both the size and composition of the sphere), and the second for convection at the surface of the sphere. If the thermal resistance of the fluid/sphere interface exceeds that thermal resistance offered by the interior of the metal sphere, the Biot number will be less than one. For systems where it is much less than one, the interior of the sphere may be presumed to be a uniform temperature, although this temperature may be changing with time as heat passes into the sphere from the surface. The equation to describe this change in (relatively uniform) temperature inside the object, is a simple exponential one described by Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.

In contrast, the metal sphere may be large, so that the characteristic length is large and the Biot number is greater than one. Now, thermal gradients within the sphere become important, even though the sphere material is a good conductor. Equivalently, if the sphere is made of a poorly conducting (thermally insulating) material, such as wood or styrofoam, the interior resistance to heat flow will exceed that of convection at the fluid/sphere boundary, even for a much smaller sphere. In this case, again, the Biot number will be greater than one.

==Applications==
The value of the Biot number can indicate the applicability (or inapplicability) of certain methods of solving transient heat transfer problems. For example, a Biot number smaller than about 0.1 implies that heat conduction inside the body offers much lower thermal resistance than the heat convection at the surface, so that temperature gradients are negligible inside of the body (such bodies are sometimes labeled &quot;thermally thin&quot;). In this situation, the simple lumped-capacitance model may be used to evaluate a body&#x27;s transient temperature variation. The opposite is also true: a Biot number greater than about 0.1 indicates that thermal resistance within the body is not negligible, and more complex methods are need in analyzing heat transfer to or from the body (such bodies are sometimes called &quot;thermally thick&quot;). 

=== Heat conduction for finite Biot number===

When the Biot number is greater than 0.1 or so, the heat equation must be solved to determine the time-varying and spatially-nonuniform temperature field within the body. Analytic methods for handling these problems, which may exist for simple geometric shapes and uniform material thermal conductivity, are described in the article on the heat equation. Examples of verified analytic solutions along with precise numerical values are available.
Often such problems are too difficult to be done except numerically, with the use of a computer model of heat transfer.

=== Heat conduction for Bi ≪ 1 ===
As noted, a Biot number smaller than about 0.1 shows that the conduction resistance inside a body is much smaller than heat convection at the surface, so that temperature gradients are negligible inside of the body. In this case, the lumped-capacitance model of transient heat transfer can be used. (A Biot number less than 0.1 generally indicates less than 3% error will be present when using the lumped-capacitance model.)

The simplest type of lumped capacity solution, for a step change in fluid temperature, shows that a body&#x27;s temperature decays exponentially in time (&quot;Newtonian&quot; cooling or heating) because the internal energy of the body is directly proportional to the temperature of the body, and the difference between the body temperature and the fluid temperature is linearly proportional to rate of heat transfer into or out of the body. Combining these relationships with the First law of thermodynamics leads to a simple first-order linear differential equation. The corresponding lumped capacity solution can be written 
:formula_6
in which formula_7 is the thermal time constant of the body, formula_8 is the mass density (kg/m3), and formula_9 is specific heat capacity (J/kg-K).

The study of heat transfer in micro-encapsulated phase-change slurries is an application where the Biot number is useful. For the dispersed phase of the micro-encapsulated phase-change slurry, the micro-encapsulated phase-change material itself, the Biot number is calculated to be below 0.1 and so it can be assumed that thermal gradients within the dispersed phase are negligible.

==Mass transfer analogue==
An analogous version of the Biot number (usually called the &quot;mass transfer Biot number&quot;, or formula_10) is also used in mass diffusion processes:

:formula_11

where:
*formula_12 : convective mass transfer coefficient (analogous to the &quot;h&quot; of the heat transfer problem)
*formula_13 : mass diffusivity (analogous to the &quot;k&quot; of heat transfer problem)
*formula_4 : characteristic length

<text>Garuda Indonesia Airways is the flag carrier of Indonesia, headquartered at Soekarno–Hatta International Airport near Jakarta. A successor of KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf, it is a member of SkyTeam airline alliance and the second-largest airline of Indonesia after Lion Air, operating scheduled flights to a number of destinations across Asia, Europe, and Australia from its hubs, focus cities, as well as other cities for Hajj. It is the only Indonesian airline that flies to European airspace.

At its peak from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, Garuda operated an extensive network of flights all over the world, with regularly scheduled services to Adelaide, Cairo, Fukuoka, Johannesburg, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome, and other cities in Europe, Australia and Asia. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of financial and operational difficulties hit the airline hard, causing it to drastically cut back services. In 2009, the airline undertook a five-year modernization plan known as the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, which overhauled the airline&#x27;s brand, livery, logo and uniforms, as well as acquiring a newer, more modern fleet and facilities and renewing focus on international markets. It earned Garuda awards such as Most Improved Airline, 5-Star Airline, and World&#x27;s Best Cabin Crew by Skytrax. Garuda has since fallen back to financial difficulties exacerbated by dysfunctional management and corruption. However, it has maintained its service and safety standards. The top management was replaced in 2020 and a new restructuring programme is also underway.

Garuda also operated a budget subsidiary, Citilink, that provided low-cost flights to multiple Indonesian destinations and was spun-off in 2012. In November 2018, the airline took over operations as well as financial management of Sriwijaya Air by a cooperation agreement (KSO); the contract expired in December 2019.

==History==
===Beginnings (1949–60s)===
The predecessor to Garuda Indonesia was a KLM subsidiary, KLM Interinsulair Bedrijf (KLM Interinsular Service), which was nationalized in December 1949.

In its current institutional form, Garuda Indonesia had its beginnings in the Indonesian war of independence against the Dutch in the late 1940s, when Garuda flew special transports with a Douglas DC-3. The first aircraft was a DC-3 known as &quot;Seulawah&quot; (Acehnese: &quot;Gold Mountain&quot;, or from Arabic Shalawah, means praise/worship) and was purchased for 120,000 Malayan dollars, which was provided by the people of Aceh (notably local merchants). The first commercial flight from Calcutta to Yangon( then, &quot;Rangoon&quot;) was on 26 January 1949, using a DC-3 Dakota aircraft with the tail number RI 001 and the name Indonesian Airways. 26 January 1949 is generally recognized as the airline&#x27;s founding date.

The name &quot;Garuda&quot; is taken from the Hindu tradition: it is the name of Lord Vishnu&#x27;s mount (&quot;vahana&quot;) and was introduced in 1949. During the Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference at The Hague, from 23 August to 2 November 1949, Indonesian President Sukarno cited a Dutch poem by a renowned Javanese scholar and poet Raden Mas Noto Soeroto: &quot;Ik ben Garuda, Vishnoe&#x27;s vogel, die zijn vleugels uitslaat hoog boven uw eilanden&quot;, which means &quot;I&#x27;m Garuda, Vishnu&#x27;s Bird, that spreads its wings high above the Islands&quot;. The first flight under the name Garuda Indonesian Airways was made with a second DC-3 entering service in 1949. Its first flight under the new name was to pick up Sukarno in Yogyakarta on 28 December.

Throughout the revolution, Garuda supported national interests and often carried diplomats on its flights. The Burmese government helped the airline significantly during its beginnings. The country&#x27;s national airline, Union of Burma Airways, often chartered one of the airline&#x27;s DC-3s for its own flights. Accordingly, upon Garuda&#x27;s formal joint incorporation with KLM on 31 March 1950, the airline gave the Burmese government a DC-3.

By the early and mid-1950s, the airline operated a fleet of 38 aircraft, including 22 DC-3s, 8 Catalina seaplanes, and 8 Convair 240s. In 1956, the airline operated its first flight to Mecca with Convair aircraft, carrying 40 Indonesian pilgrims.

Garuda&#x27;s fleet continued to grow throughout the 1960s, during which the airline continued its expansion. It acquired three Lockheed L-188 Electras in 1961, which supplemented its Convair CV-240 fleet, before taking delivery of its first jet aircraft, the Convair 990 Coronado, in 1963, which allowed it to launch flights to Hong Kong.

In 1965, the airline took delivery of its first Douglas DC-8, and grew beyond the Asian market it was focused on, beginning scheduled flights from Kemayoran Airport to Amsterdam and Frankfurt via Colombo, Bombay, and Prague. Rome and Paris became the airline&#x27;s third and fourth European destinations, with flights stopping in Bombay and Cairo to refuel. Flights to the People&#x27;s Republic of China began that same year, with service to Guangzhou via Phnom Penh, the first Indonesian airline to do so.

===Continued growth (1970s–90s)===
During the early 1970s, Garuda Indonesian Airways took delivery of both the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (first delivered in 1969) and Fokker F28 Fellowship (first delivered in 1971) for its short and medium-haul operations. The airline went on to take delivery of 62 F28s, holding the title of the largest operator of the F28 in the world. In 1976, Garuda took delivery of its first McDonnell Douglas DC-10, giving it the capability to carry more passengers and fly longer flights, and replaced the DC-8 and Convair 990 fleet on flights within Asia and to Europe. The DC-10 became an integral part of the Garuda fleet for the years to come, outlasting the newer McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, before the type was finally retired in 2002. In 1980, the airline took delivery of the first Boeing 747-200, complementing the DC-10 on high-capacity or long-range routes.

On 21 June 1982, Garuda became the launch customer of the Airbus A300 B4-220FFCC, the first variant of the A300 capable of being operated with two pilots instead of three. By 1984, nine of these were in service, supplemented by 8 McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, 24 DC-9s, 45 Fokker F-28s, and 6 Boeing 747-200s. In 1985 under Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta, who had been CEO since 1984, Garuda Indonesian Airways made the controversial decision to hire foreign brand consultants Landor Associates to create a new logo, livery and brand, a project regarded as expensive and unnecessary at the time but later applauded as vital for Garuda&#x27;s reputation and corporate identity as the national airline.
Under Lumenta, Garuda Indonesia also increased the number of flight frequencies and destinations, reduced ticket prices and collaborated with Merpati Nusantara Airlines, introducing flexible tickets valid for both Indonesian airlines.

In 1991, Garuda took delivery of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, which gradually replaced the DC-10 on flights to Europe and allowed the airline to launch flights to Los Angeles via Honolulu. During this time, the airline operated a fleet of the aforementioned MD-11s, DC-10s, 747, Airbus A300 and Boeing 737-400, operating it to destinations throughout Asia, Europe and North America. In 1994, Garuda took delivery of its first Boeing 747-400 aircraft, which became a mainstay of its fleet until 2015, operating hajj flights and high-density short-haul routes, while the delivery of the first Airbus A330-300 in 1996 allowed more flexibility, as it was more fuel-efficient than the three- and four-engine jets. That same year, Garuda placed an order for six Boeing 777 aircraft, due for delivery in 2000, but a new series of challenges and difficulties were about to hit the airline.

===Difficult period (1996–2004)===

The late 1990s and early 2000s proved a turbulent and difficult time for Garuda; accidents in Fukuoka (Flight 865) in 1996 and Medan (Flight 152) in 1997 added to problems caused by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, resulting in a drastic reduction in operations, including termination of service to the Americas and a massive scaling back of its European operations. Largely due to historical links with the Netherlands, Garuda continued to operate flights to Amsterdam after the initial cutbacks. The other European routes continued were Frankfurt and London. However, Garuda attempted to launch its first non-stop flight from Jakarta to Europe with a Jakarta to Frankfurt service, continuing on to London and back on October 28, 2001, as Garuda Indonesia Flights 970 and 971, the route was short-lived and the route was axed in early 2002 due to the effect of tourism caused by the attacks in the US on September 11 the previous year, along with the ditching of Garuda Flight 421 earlier that year. Finally, both routes returned back to one stop services until they were discontinued in 2003, with the Amsterdam route discontinued the following year on the 28 October 2004. The situation was exacerbated by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., the Bali bombings, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, and the SARS scare, all of which contributed to a downturn in air travel and Indonesian tourism. Shortly after, its earlier order for the Boeing 777 was deferred, and so was an order for 18 Boeing 737-800s to replace its ageing 737 Classic fleet. By 2005, Garuda had largely recovered from its economic problems, swapping its order for six Boeing 777-200ERs for 10 Boeing 787-8 Dreamliners in 2005, but its operational problems remained.

===Munir murder (2004–2006)===
On 7 September 2004, Garuda&#x27;s reputation suffered further damage when human rights activist Munir Said Thalib, travelling to Amsterdam via Singapore on Garuda Indonesia Flight 974, was assassinated by off-duty pilot Pollycarpus Priyanto, who slipped arsenic into his drink sometime before the departure of the flight&#x27;s second leg to Amsterdam. Munir was reported to have felt unwell several hours after departure from Singapore, during which time he was checked on by a doctor who happened to be on board and moved to the business class cabin to sleep. He died about two hours before arrival in Amsterdam, sparking an international controversy, during which time Priyanto, CEO Indra Setiawan, and deputy Rohainil Aini were all convicted of his murder, although it has been alleged it was under orders from the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency (Badan Intelijen Negara). The airline was found negligent in failing to perform an emergency landing and was ordered to pay compensation to Munir&#x27;s widow, but failed to do so.

===European ban (2007–2009)===
In June 2007, the EU banned Garuda Indonesia and all other Indonesian airlines, from flying into any European countries, following the crash of Flight 200 earlier that year. With the support of the international aviation industry for all Indonesian airlines, the EU promised to review its ban and sent a team of experts, led by the European Commission&#x27;s Air Safety Administrator Federico Grandini to Indonesia to consider lifting the ban. In August 2007, Indonesia&#x27;s transportation minister announced that the EU would lift its ban hopefully sometime in October, saying that the ban was attributed to communication breakdown between the two parties and that discussions were in progress.

In November 2007, Garuda announced its intention to fly to Amsterdam from Jakarta and Denpasar with either Airbus A330 or Boeing 777 aircraft if the EU lifted its ban. On 28 November 2007, the EU said that the safety reforms already undertaken were a step in the right direction for the EU to consider lifting the ban, but still did not satisfy the EU&#x27;s aviation safety standards, and thus did not lift its ban. The ban was lifted in July 2009, after which Garuda began evaluating service to Amsterdam and other European destinations, as well as the United States.

===Developments after the lifting of ban (2009–2020)===
Following the lifting of the EU ban against Garuda Indonesia and three other Indonesian carriers which were Lion air etc, the airline announced in July 2009 an aggressive five-year expansion plan known as the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. The plan involved an image overhaul, including changing the airline&#x27;s livery, staff uniform and logo, and nearly doubling the size of its fleet from 62 to 116. The &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; also plans to boost annual passenger numbers to 27.6 million in the same period, up from 10.1 million at the time of program launch through increasing domestic and international destinations from 41 to 62. Route expansions included Amsterdam, with a stopover in Dubai, in 2010. As of 2014, Garuda flies to Amsterdam non-stop five times a week using a Boeing 777-300ER with continuing service to London, with the sixth weekly service to be added by the end of 2015. Other European and American cities such as Frankfurt, Paris, Rome, Madrid and Los Angeles are being considered for reopening.

As part of the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, the airline refreshed its logo and redesigned its livery in 2009, more than 20 years after the last update. New uniforms were introduced in 2010. In 2010, the airline placed a firm order for six additional Airbus A330s at the 2010 Farnborough Airshow, while it opened a new hub at Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar, South Sulawesi to increase services to the eastern part of Indonesia on 1 June 2011, its third after Jakarta and Denpasar.
In 2013, Garuda&#x27;s won the Skytrax World&#x27;s Best Cabin Crew Awards, and in 2018, Garuda&#x27;s won the awards again for the fifth consecutive year.
During this period, the airline also added additional frequencies to many of its international routes, including to Singapore, Bangkok, Beijing and Shanghai from Jakarta, while it also added capacity to Denpasar-Seoul.

At the Paris Air Show 2011, Garuda Indonesia announced a firm order of 25 Airbus A320s with an option for another 25. All 25 Airbus A320s are to be used by their subsidiary, Citilink The airline&#x27;s earlier order for the Boeing 787, made in 2005, was changed once more, due to the delays in the 787&#x27;s entry into service. Garuda opted to sign for 10 Boeing 777-300ERs instead, which it would take delivery of in 2013 to use on long-haul flights to Europe, and medium-haul flights within Asia, such as to Japan, China, Singapore and Saudi Arabia, as well as short-haul domestic routes between Jakarta and Denpasar.

The airline made its debut on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in February 2011, with the government of Indonesia retaining a majority of the shares. PT Trans Airways bought 10.9% stake of Garuda Indonesia unsold IPO shares from underwriters on 27 April 2012. The transaction was valued at Rp 1.53 trillion ($166.8 million).
In late 2014, the airline became one of seven airlines to earn the prestigious 5-star rating from Skytrax, marking the end of the five-year &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; program. Following this announcement, Emirsyah Satar, who had been CEO for the past nine years, announced his resignation and retirement and promoted former Citilink chief Arif Wibowo as his successor.

Following Wibowo&#x27;s promotion, he began a &quot;Quick Wins&quot; cost-cutting drive to cut down on losses while boosting revenue through various measures, including cancelling unprofitable routes and increasing staff efficiency. Despite this, Wibowo remained committed to continuing the airline&#x27;s international expansion, particularly once market conditions, such as the weakening rupiah, improved. This was reaffirmed following the airline&#x27;s announcement of its intent to order 90 new aircraft, from both Boeing and Airbus, worth $20 billion at list prices at the 2015 Paris Air Show. Wibowo retired from his position in 2017, replaced by Pahala Nugraha Mansury the same year before being replaced by I Gusti Ngurah Askhara Danadiputra, otherwise known as Ari Askhara in 2018.

During Ari Askhara&#x27;s leadership, Garuda introduced live acoustic concerts on domestic flights, which led to criticism. as well as reopening the London route from Denpasar, with transit in Medan&#x27;s Kualanamu International Airport. It also hit with three high-profile scandals.

In April 2019, Chairal Tanjung and Dony Oskaria, Independent Commissioners of the airline called out that Garuda&#x27;s 2018 Annual Report was not under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, thus deciding not to sign the report. Both Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Authority found various violations inside the report as both Independent Commissioners told the public, which led to both regulators imposing a penalty to the airline and auditors involved.

On 13 July 2019, travel reviewer and YouTuber Rius Vernandes shared a picture of a hand-written menu during his flight from Sydney to Jakarta, which led to Garuda&#x27;s management reporting him to the police followed by the airline issuing a regulation prohibiting selfies on the plane and a lawsuit prompted by the Garuda&#x27;s workers&#x27; association also known as SEKARGA. Both Garuda&#x27;s and SEKARGA&#x27;s actions were panned and criticized by worldwide netizens. Through mediation, Rius and Garuda settled, and SEKARGA pulled the lawsuit on 19 July 2019.

==== Controversy during the leadership of Ari Askhara ====
On 5 December 2019, Ari Askhara was fired from his position for smuggling a classic Harley-Davidson motorcycle and Brompton folded bicycle. The motorcycle and bicycle were found by the Soekarno–Hatta International Airport&#x27;s Customs and Excise team inside a recently-delivered Airbus A330-900 aircraft. It was revealed that Ari Askhara and other directors had been implementing various policies that harmed Garuda flight attendants, such as mutation without explanation, additional flight hours, and discrimination between employees. These policies were subsequently revoked.

A year later in December 2020, it was revealed through Twitter that many Garuda flight attendants had been victims of sexual harassment and coercion to prostitution during Ari&#x27;s leadership, with many attendants confirming that VP Cabin Attendant Roni Eka Mirsa was the pimp for the prostitution circle. Police responded by investigating the whistleblower in the case for defamation after a report was filed by an air hostess who was allegedly the mistress of various executives at state-owned enterprises. She later dropped the complaint. State-owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir said that he would consider dismissing executives of state-owned enterprises if their female employees have faced sexual harassment.

=== COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023) ===
On 14 May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on aviation and airlines, Garuda Indonesia furloughed 800 of its staff for at least three months. In June, it laid off 180 contracted pilots. The airline implemented face masks for crew members following health regulations to prevent the spread of the disease. On 16 June 2020, after some passengers complained that they could not see the flight attendants&#x27; faces, Garuda president director Irfan Setiaputra said the airline was planning to replace face masks with face shields for its cabin crew. Three days later, in response to public criticism of the plan, he said Garuda&#x27;s flight attendants would not stop using face masks.

=== Financial trouble ===
Due to the prolonged pandemic, Garuda Indonesia experienced problems in operations, management, and funding. Its debt became arisen and unpaid, and the corporation is currently on the verge of bankruptcy and future closure by the government. In the effort to save the airline, Garuda has cut around 30 percent of its workforce, reducing its staff to 5,400 from 7,861. Garuda claims that its board of directors and its commissioners have taken a pay cut as well.

At the end of 2021, Garuda reported a debt of $9.8 billion to more than 800 creditors, complicating efforts for out-of-court settlement attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic, where Garuda&#x27;s income dropped by 70 percent. As the future replacement of Garuda Indonesia in case the corporation is deemed beyond saving, the government prepared Pelita Air Service, a cargo airline currently owned by Pertamina, to be the successor of Garuda Indonesia as the new flag carrier of Indonesia.

In May 2022, Garuda appeared in court for its attempts to reschedule its debts. Garuda filed for a 30-day delay in the proceedings, which is granted by the court. This was the second extension given by the court, as the original court date was in March 2022.

In April 2022, the Sixth Committee of Indonesia&#x27;s People Representative Council and Erick Thohir, Indonesia&#x27;s Minister of State Owned Enterprises, decided to execute a scheme to save the ailing airline.

In June 2022, during Garuda&#x27;s attempt to delay payment of its debts, Garuda announced that its debt was $8.3 billion, where its biggest debtors were Airbus SE and Pertamina. If the delay to pay its debts was accepted by its creditors, Garuda promised that it would be profitable in three years. Garuda will also seek funding of $1.3 billion through global bonds and issuance of new stocks. On 17 June 2022, Garuda&#x27;s creditors voted to accept Garuda&#x27;s debt restructuring, saving the company from bankruptcy. Boeing did not join the debt restructuring process because Garuda stated that its amount of debt to Boeing was not verified yet, and Garuda stated that if Boeing did not confirm its debt to Boeing in 30 days after the debt restructuring, Garuda&#x27;s debt to Boeing could be removed. On 20 June 2022, Garuda&#x27;s debt restructuring was put on hold because two of the lessors did not agree with the debt restructuring, and a new court date was set on 27 June.

In September 2022, Garuda Indonesia filed for US Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection.

=== Corruption case ===
On 22 June 2022, the Attorney General&#x27;s Office of Indonesia said it was finishing its investigation of corruption in the purchase of CRJ-1000 and ATR72-600 aircraft. Setijo Awibowo, the Vice President of Strategic Management, Agus Wahjudo, the Executive Project Manager of Aircraft Delivery and ex-vice President of Treasury Management Albert Burhan are suspects in the case. Emirsyah Satar, the CEO during the alleged corruption, has been arrested for another corruption case. The loss for Indonesia is reported to be US$609 million.

===Branding and livery===

Since its establishment, Garuda Indonesia has changed its branding and livery multiple times.

==== Original livery ====
During the airline&#x27;s early years, Garuda&#x27;s colour scheme was a simple &quot;Indonesian Airways&quot; logotype with blue lines running along the fuselage and the Indonesian flag on the horizontal stabilizer.

==== 1950-1961 ====
During the airline&#x27;s early years, Garuda&#x27;s colour scheme was a simple &quot;Garuda Indonesian Airways&quot; logotype with red lines running along the fuselage and the Indonesian flag on the horizontal stabilizer.

==== 1960s rebranding ====
In the 1960s, Garuda introduced a red and white colour scheme following the Indonesian national identity and the Indonesian flag. Also during this period, the airline introduced a bird logo: a triangle-stylized eagle-like Garuda with a red and white shield. The logo was painted on the vertical stabiliser of Garuda&#x27;s aircraft from 1961 to 1969.

==== 1969 rebranding ====
In 1969, a logotype with a unique font replaced the triangular eagle as Garuda&#x27;s corporate identity, along with a new color scheme consisting of a red and orange &quot;hockey stick&quot; line running along the aircraft&#x27;s windows and vertical stabilizer. This livery was used from 1969 to 1985.

==== 1985 rebranding ====
In 1985, Garuda underwent a complete branding makeover, changing its name into &quot;Garuda Indonesia&quot; along with its livery, logo and logotype. The new branding and livery were created by Landor Associates who also created the new logo: the Garuda symbol with five bent lines forming its wings. The color scheme was changed to a deep royal blue and aqua color, said to be inspired by the nature of Indonesia that was dominated by tropical greenery and seas when viewed from the air. The nationalistic red and white color scheme was no longer used.

==== 2009 rebranding ====
In 2009, a new branding initiative was launched through a new image, developed once again by brand consultant Landor Associates: a new spin of the idea called &quot;nature&#x27;s wing&quot;. Garuda has since replaced the old logo painted on its aircraft&#x27;s vertical stabilizers with this new &quot;nature&#x27;s wing&quot; graphic of blue and aqua shades. The &quot;nature&#x27;s wing&quot; graphic was inspired by the wings of tropical birds as well as the ripples of waves upon the water. The bird symbol designed by Landor 24 years earlier is still maintained as Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s logo, with minor changes, while the logotype now uses a font similar to Myriad Pro.

==== Special liveries ====
To celebrate its 62 years of service, on 26 January 2011, Garuda Indonesia painted 2 of its Boeing 737-800s with retro liveries the airline used in the 1960s and 1970s.

To raise awareness on wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, Garuda Indonesia painted five of their aircraft with a surgical mask tied to its nose, with the words &quot;&quot;Ayo pakai masker&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;Please wear masks,&quot; introduced on 1 October 2020. This is part of Indonesia&#x27;s governmental responses to the pandemic, however, the design itself is from an ongoing competition Garuda launched called &quot;Fly Your Design Through The Sky&quot;, asking people to design masks to be painted in one of their planes.

===Head office===
Garuda Indonesia has its head office at Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia, near Cengkareng and near Jakarta. The head office is the Garuda Indonesia Management Building, located within the Garuda Indonesia City Center. The about head office facility is on a plot of land. As of 2009, the head office houses the Garuda management and about 1,000 employees from various units. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono opened the current Garuda head office in 2009. The previous head office was located in the city center of Jakarta, in Central Jakarta.

===Privatization===
Garuda Indonesia had announced that its subsidiary GMF AeroAsia would be listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2008. However, due to the financial crisis of 2008, GMF delayed IPO until 2009. The Ministry of State-Owned Companies (Kementrian BUMN) had also announced a plan to privatize Garuda, which opened the possibility of offering its shares publicly.
Garuda Indonesia aimed to list on 11 February 2011, for an initial public offering. The Government of Indonesia confirmed the IPO price of Garuda Indonesia at Rp.750 per share and also cut the offering size to 6.3 billion shares only from 9.362 billion planned before.

===Subsidiaries===
Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s subsidiaries include:
In September 2019, Garuda Indonesia launched the grandchildren of company, PT Garuda Tauberes Indonesia application. The company is engaged in logistics orders, both for couriers, air cargo gateways and payments through the e-commerce application platform Tauberes. The concept carried is smart logistic services. In addition, four new grandchildren of the company have also been established. The four companies are PT Garuda Daya Pratama Sejahtera, PT Garuda Indonesia Air Charter. Then followed, PT Garuda Ilmu Terapan Cakrawala, and PT Garuda Energi Logistik dan Komersial.
===Cooperation===
On 18 August 2018, Garuda Indonesia signed an MoU agreement with the cargo airline Jayawijaya Dirgantara relating to the distribution of cargo from Jayapura to Wamena.

==Destinations==


Garuda Indonesia operates flights to 96 airport destinations (72 domestic and 24 international) in 12 countries (including Indonesia), with approximately 500 daily departures from its hubs at Jakarta, Denpasar, Makassar and Medan The airline serves 3 continents (Asia, Australia and Europe) with its fleet of 140 aircraft, to destinations such as Singapore, Shanghai–Pudong, Tokyo–Haneda, Tokyo–Narita, Amsterdam, Sydney, Melbourne, Doha, Guangzhou, Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi, Seoul–Incheon, Jeddah, Medina, Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur–International. Although it has rapidly expanded its route network since the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; began in 2009, Garuda still does not fly to several major cities, such as Manila and Ho Chi Minh City. Despite repeatedly stating its intention to fly to Manila, Garuda has not given a time frame.

On 13 October 2009, Garuda announced it would resume flights to Europe for the first time since its removal from the E.U. blacklist. It commenced flights between Jakarta and Amsterdam in June 2010, initially with a refuelling stop in Dubai. On 2 December 2012, after agreeing to a codeshare agreement with Etihad Airways, Garuda changed the refueling stop to Abu Dhabi. After the delivery of its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in 2013, the airline removed the Abu Dhabi refueling stop, and commenced non-stop service to Amsterdam, as the longest flight Garuda operated, and consequently ending flights to Abu Dhabi, leaving Etihad as the sole operator between Jakarta and Abu Dhabi. On 8 September that year, the airline extended its Amsterdam flight with continuing service to London Gatwick.

In 2011, Garuda flew 17.1 million passengers, up 39% from the previous year, while the total revenue jumped 38% to Rp27.1 trillion ($2.95 billion). The composition of passengers on domestic and international routes was 81% versus 19% respectively.

On 31 March 2016, Garuda Indonesia inaugurated its first flight from Singapore Changi Airport to London Heathrow, using a Boeing 777-300ER.

In mid-2016, Garuda announced its intention to resume service to Mumbai from Jakarta. This service is opened on 12 December 2016 via Bangkok using Boeing 737-800 NG.

On 12 September 2016, Garuda Indonesia announced its intention to resume service to Los Angeles via Tokyo–Narita using a Boeing 777-300ER from Jakarta after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted a Category 1 rating to Indonesia. The flight was slated to start in November 2017. The last time Los Angeles was served was in 1998. As of 2019, however, the plan is yet to be realized and has most likely been shelved as the Government of Japan has yet to approve fifth freedom rights to Garuda.

In February 2017, Garuda Indonesia announced that the airline will resume flights to Dubai and Moscow using the wide-body Airbus A330-200. This flight is planned to be resumed in 2018, although as of 2019 has not been realized.

In August 2018, Garuda Indonesia announced that the airline would end flights to London Heathrow by October, although it then resumed flights in December with a dual-class Boeing 777-300ER in the same year. 2019 marked further adjustments to Garuda&#x27;s flight to London Heathrow as the airline announced a Jakarta-London Heathrow, London Heathrow-Denpasar routing.

===Codeshare agreements and alliances===

Codesharing has allowed Garuda Indonesia to expand services into Western Europe and the Middle East. In 2009, Garuda Indonesia expressed an interest in joining the SkyTeam airline alliance, which would make it the second airline in Southeast Asia to participate after Vietnam Airlines. Membership would open SkyTeam&#x27;s network to Indonesian, Australian, and New Zealand markets, which it lacked connectivity to. In December 2009, three SkyTeam members – Korean Air, KLM, and Delta Air Lines (China Airlines joined as fourth member to support Garuda after its 2011 SkyTeam inclusion) – committed to supporting Garuda Indonesia to join SkyTeam. This made Garuda Indonesia eligible to apply for membership in the alliance. On 23 November 2010, Garuda Indonesia signed an agreement to join SkyTeam. However instead of the usual 18–24 months to complete membership formalities, shortcomings with its IT system delayed Garuda&#x27;s entry. After a 40-month process, the airline eventually became the 20th member of the alliance on 5 March 2014, two years after the original target date.

* On 19 June 2007, Garuda Indonesia and Hainan Airlines began codesharing to strengthen both airlines&#x27; marketing positions in Indonesia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In this agreement, Garuda Indonesia will be the operating partner on the Jakarta-Beijing (vv) service, flying five times a week using a new A330-200.
* An interline agreement between Garuda Indonesia and Australian airline Virgin Blue was confirmed in November 2007. This facilitates travel for passengers connecting from a Virgin Australia domestic flight to a Garuda Indonesia international service departing from either Sydney, Melbourne or Perth.
* In June 2008, it was announced that Garuda Indonesia would increase services between Australia and Bali. From 25 June, Garuda Indonesia added an extra flight between Darwin and Denpasar, bringing the total number of services to three per week. Additionally, a fourth flight from Melbourne to Denpasar began on 22 July. On 2 September, another extra service departed from Melbourne to bring the total number of weekly flights to five and a sixth flight left from Sydney. This extra capacity was in response to an increase in the number of Australians who travelled to Bali in the first quarter of 2008, marking a resurgence in Balinese tourism, which was hit hard by the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings.
* In August 2008, a codeshare agreement between Singapore Airlines and the airline on the route between Singapore and Denpasar was established. Singapore Airlines is the operating carrier.
* A partnership agreement with Etihad Airways was announced on 16 October 2012. The partnership includes a codeshare agreement for a total of 36 flights between the two airlines; subject to Government Regulatory Approval. Reciprocal Frequent Flyer programmes were also part of the agreement, allowing passengers to earn miles flying both Garuda Indonesia and Etihad Airways. Garuda Indonesia subsequently shifted its Dubai operations to Abu Dhabi to complement the agreement.
* During the APEC summit on 7 October 2013, a codeshare agreement between Garuda Indonesia and Aeroméxico was announced, allowing passengers to travel from Jakarta to Mexico City via Tokyo and vice versa. Under the codeshare agreement, Aeromexico would place its flight numbers on Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s Jakarta-Tokyo flights while Garuda Indonesia would place its flight numbers on Aeromexico&#x27;s Tokyo-Mexico City flights.
* On 19 November 2013, a codeshare agreement was announced between Garuda Indonesia and Jet Airways of India. Under the codeshare agreement, Jet Airways would place its flight numbers on Garuda Indonesia flights between Jakarta and Singapore while Garuda Indonesia would place its flight numbers on Jet Airways flights between Singapore and Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. The two airlines also announced a reciprocal Frequent Flyer programme partnership, allowing passengers to earn miles flying both Garuda Indonesia and Jet Airways.
* On 19 December 2013, Garuda Indonesia and Japan&#x27;s All Nippon Airways announced a partnership agreement encompassing codeshare flights as well as reciprocal Frequent Flyer programmes. Under the codeshare agreement, ANA passengers arriving in Jakarta would be able to transfer to 10 destinations in Indonesia on board Garuda Indonesia flights, while Garuda Indonesia passengers arriving in Tokyo or Osaka would be able to transfer to 11 destinations in Japan on board ANA flights.
* On 6 February 2024, Garuda Indonesia and Qatar Airways launched the fourth Jakarta-Doha daily flight starting 2 April 2024, to add to three daily flights already served by Qatar Airways. This will be codeshare flights operated by Garuda Indonesia with its Boeing 777-300ERs.

===&quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Explore-jet&quot; sub-brands===
As Indonesia&#x27;s flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia tries to connect many parts of Indonesia to support the government&#x27;s &quot;Indonesian Interconnectivity&quot; program. But Garuda&#x27;s fleet of Boeing 737-800s cannot reach many remote and smaller airports, because of the lack of airport infrastructure in smaller cities and remote areas, such as insufficient runway length.

In line with its &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; plan, Garuda ordered brand-new Bombardier CRJ1000 and ATR 72 to reach smaller airports from Garuda&#x27;s hubs like Ngurah Rai International Airport, Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, and Kualanamu International Airport. On 25 November 2013, Garuda launched its new sub-brands &quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Explore-jet&quot;, for servicing &quot;perintis&quot; (&quot;pioneer&quot;) lines traditionally served by (dormant) Merpati Nusantara Airlines and its competitor Wings Air.

In 2022, due to the corruption scandal surrounding Bombardier CRJ1000 and ATR 72 fleet procurement back in 2013, and the company&#x27;s worsened financial condition during the COVID-19 pandemic forced the grounding of these two types of aircraft fleets. Currently, most of the fleets have been returned to the lessor or transferred to its subsidiary Citilink, which also means the end of the &quot;Explore&quot; and &quot;Explore-jet&quot; sub-brands.

===SkyTeam===

On 5 March 2014, Garuda Indonesia officially joined the SkyTeam alliance and became its 20th member. The inclusion of Garuda Indonesia adds 40 new destinations to SkyTeam&#x27;s global network and strengthens the alliance presence in Southeast Asia and Australia. To commemorate the event, the airline repainted an Airbus A330-300, a Boeing 737-800, and a Bombardier CRJ1000 with SkyTeam livery. In addition to repainted aircraft, a Boeing 777-300ER was delivered with SkyTeam livery. With the arrival of Garuda Indonesia to SkyTeam, a variety of facilities are given as including SkyPriority, as well as changing its current frequent flyer membership into GarudaMiles. In addition, Garuda is connected with 140 new destinations and also teamed up with the world&#x27;s major airlines, such as Aeroflot, Aeroméxico, Air France, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, KLM, Korean Air, and Saudia.

==Fleet==
The Boeing customer code for Garuda Indonesia is U3, which appears on its aircraft designations as an infix, such as 737-8U3, 777-3U3ER, and 747-2U3B.

Garuda uses the Boeing 777-300ER on high-density medium and long-haul routes. The Airbus A330 and Boeing 747-400 fleet is primarily used on most medium-haul routes from Jakarta and Denpasar, as well as for Umrah and Hajj flights. The Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft are used on most domestic and regional routes. Meanwhile, the Bombardier CRJ1000 is used to fly to airports incapable of handling the newer 737-800, replacing the Boeing 737 Classic. The ATR 72-600 turboprop entered service at the end of 2013, serving new inter-island routes to airports in the middle and eastern parts of Indonesia that cannot handle jet aircraft.

At the Paris Air Show in 2015, Garuda Indonesia signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) to purchase 80 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus (30 737 MAX, 20 787 Dreamliner, 30 A350 XWB) worth $20 billion at list prices Garuda also signed a LoI for 14 Airbus A330-900s aircraft (including seven cancellations from existing A330-300 order), first reported during the Singapore Airshow 2016, confirming the order on 19 April 2016.

On 5 October 2017, Garuda operated its last Boeing 747 service after the last aircraft touched down in Makassar from Medina, a returning Haji flight. It was then ferried to Jakarta the following day for retirement.

In January 2019, CEO Ari Askhara stated that the airline was considering and negotiating with lessors for a switch of 34 out of the remaining 49 Boeing 737 MAXes on order to the larger MAX 10 variant, as the airline was planning to resume 737 MAX deliveries by 2020. In March 2019, the airline decided to cancel its outstanding orders for 49 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, citing a loss of passenger confidence in the type after the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In November 2020, the airline clarified that their order for Boeing 737 MAX is not cancelled yet, and talks are still ongoing with Boeing concerning the order.

===Immigration On-Board (IoB)===
Immigration on Board (IoB) was a special service created by Garuda Indonesia to provide more convenience for passengers travelling to Indonesia. With this service, in cooperation with the Directorate General of Immigration, an agency under the Indonesian Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Garuda Indonesia passengers on certain long-haul flights could complete their immigration process on-board before landing and disembarking.

By using this service, Garuda Indonesia passengers did not have to queue at the immigration counter upon arrival at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar or Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. The service was stopped since 2014.

===Ticketing===

A Jakarta-based 24-hour call center is available for local customer access where payment can be made by credit cards, internet/mobile banking or transfers via ATM. Recently online booking from their website is also possible with payment being made online with credit cards from select countries.

In April 2011, Garuda Indonesia announced plans to develop online sales. Garuda Indonesia had cooperated with Visa and MasterCard to develop an online credit card payment system, allowing customers to use PayPal. Debit card payments may be processed with Bank Mandiri, BCA or BII.

==Frequent-flyer program==
Garuda Frequent Flyer, Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s frequent-flyer program was launched in September 1999.
In 2005, Garuda Indonesia relaunched its &quot;Garuda Frequent Flyer&quot; (GFF) with a new look, benefits and services. The new program allows members to earn miles on domestic and international flights and has four tiers of membership covering GFF Junior, Blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum status levels. In June 2011 Garuda Indonesia launched a joint frequent flyer program with Korean Air. Members of the Garuda Frequent Flyer (GFF) program and Korean Air&#x27;s SkyPass program will benefit from the cooperation by accruing mileage for flying both Korean Air and Garuda or any Garuda–Korean Air codeshare flights.

From 27 March 2014, due to joining SkyTeam, Garuda Indonesia announced that Garuda Frequent Flyer renamed as GarudaMiles. In 2017, Citilink&#x27;s frequent-flyer program, Supergreen, merged with GarudaMiles, dubbed &#x27;Supergreen GarudaMiles&#x27;, before merging fully with GarudaMiles. Now, GarudaMiles serves as Garuda Indonesia and Citilink&#x27;s frequent-flyer program.

As of 2019, besides Garuda, Citilink, and SkyTeam members (with the exception of Alitalia, as currently, Garuda can only earn miles from Alitalia flights), GarudaMiles members can earn and spend their miles with Etihad Airways and All Nippon Airways. GarudaMiles members previously able to earn and spend miles with India&#x27;s Jet Airways before Jet&#x27;s demise in 2019.

==Sponsorships==
Garuda Indonesia was the official sponsor of the 2011 Southeast Asian Games. Garuda Indonesia also supports the &quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; tourism campaign by placing the &quot;Wonderful Indonesia&quot; logo in their promotional materials as well as on the hulls of their aircraft.

In July 2012, Garuda Indonesia signed a three-year sponsorship deal with Premier League club Liverpool FC. The agreement gives Garuda Indonesia the right to be the Official Partner of Liverpool Football Club and the Official Global Airline Partner of Liverpool Football Club. In addition, a six-minute advertisement video of Garuda Indonesia will be broadcast during matches held at the Liverpool FC home ground, Anfield, for the 2012–2014 season.

This collaboration with Liverpool will give Garuda Indonesia media &quot; exposure &quot; to increase brand awareness in the international market more effectively with more maximal benefits, given the &quot; brand &quot; Garuda Indonesia will get a higher frequency of delivery with a longer broadcast duration. In 2013, Liverpool toured Asia with one of the countries the goal was Indonesia. Through the tour visit, it is expected that this visit will improve the quality of football matches in Indonesia.

To support the visit target of 20 million tourists in 2019, Garuda Indonesia will increase the number of aircraft fleets that have been installed with the &#x27;Wonderful Indonesia&#x27; logo on their aircraft starting this year. Business Director of Garuda Indonesia, Handayani at the Tourism Ministry&#x27;s End-of-Year Press Conference at Sapta Pesona Building, Ministry of Tourism Office of the Republic of Indonesia, Jakarta said, in February 2016 there will be at least five additional Garuda Indonesia aircraft that have the Wonderful Indonesia logo as a form of cooperation between Garuda Indonesia and the Ministry of Tourism. &quot;Hopefully it can support Indonesia&#x27;s tourism,&quot; said Handayani. Also, Garuda Indonesia will provide tourism support in the form of developing flight routes by strengthening flight routes that are superior in the tourism sector, such as Labuan Bajo, Lombok, and Wakatobi.

==Market share==
For most of modern Indonesian history, Garuda Indonesia has dominated the Indonesian air travel market share. However, started in 2000, Lion Air started to grow and become a serious rival in domestic air travel in Indonesia. By the time the COVID-19 pandemic was still underway in mid-2021, Lion Air still held the majority of Indonesia&#x27;s domestic air travel market share by 29.7%, while Garuda Indonesia came in fourth with a 10.5% share. Citilink came in second with a market share of 22.6%, followed by Lion&#x27;s full-service subsidiary Batik (8.9%). Lion Air&#x27;s regional flight service Wings Air holds a 7.9% share. Indonesia AirAsia, a unit of the Malaysian budget airline, had a 1.9% market share.

Overall, the Indonesian domestic air travel business is overwhelmingly ruled by two groups; Lion Air group and Garuda Indonesia group. In 2021, Lion Air group accounted for 59.4% of the market share, while Garuda Indonesia group had a 33.1% market share.

For international routes, Garuda Indonesia has identified four airlines that became the benchmark to improve their service and to compete to be the world&#x27;s best airline. The serious rivals for Garuda Indonesia&#x27;s international routes are Singapore Airlines, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Cathay Pacific.

<doc id="175838" wikidata="Q3484782" url="?curid=175838" title="Divine simplicity">
<text>In classical theistic and monotheistic theology, the doctrine of divine simplicity says that God is simple (without parts).
God exists as one unified entity, with no distinct attributes; God&#x27;s existence is identical to God&#x27;s essence.

==Overview==

The being of God is identical to the &quot;attributes&quot; of God. Characteristics such as omnipresence, goodness, truth and eternity are identical to God&#x27;s being, not qualities that make up that being as a collection or abstract entities inherent to God as in a substance; in God, essence and existence are the same.

Simplicity denies any physical or metaphysical composition in the divine being. God is the divine nature itself, with no accidents (unnecessary properties) accruing to his nature. There are no real divisions or distinctions of this nature; the entirety of God is whatever is attributed to him. God does not &quot;have&quot; goodness, but &quot;is&quot; goodness; God does not existence, but &quot;is&quot; existence. According to Thomas Aquinas, God is God&#x27;s existence and God&#x27;s essence is God&#x27;s existence. Divine simplicity is the hallmark of God&#x27;s transcendence of all else, ensuring that the divine nature is beyond the reach of ordinary categories and distinctions (or, at least, their ordinary application). &quot;Simplicity in this way confers a unique ontological status that many philosophers find highly peculiar.&quot; When it comes to God&#x27;s essential nature or attributes, there are no parts or accidents; this is not to be confused with God&#x27;s accidental or contingent relation to the world (God&#x27;s non-essential or contingent properties, not God&#x27;s nature).

Varieties of this doctrine exist among Jewish, Christian, and Muslim philosophical theologians, especially during the height of scholasticism. Its origins may be traced back to ancient Greek thought, finding apotheosis in Plotinus&#x27; &quot;Enneads&quot; as the Simplex.

== History ==
Views similar to divine simplicity were held by philosophers such as Plato, Thales and Anaximenes. Classical statements about divine simplicity can be found in Augustine, Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. In early Christianity, Philo of Alexandria said that the belief of God as utterly simple was widely held. One of the earliest mentions of divine simplicity in Christian theology is by Irenaeus (130). Early Christian theology viewed simplicity as necessary for preserving God&#x27;s transcendence; Athenagoras of Athens, in the second century, said that God is indivisible and unchangeable. Clement of Alexandria, Basil, and Cyril saw simplicity as preserving the transcendence and perfection of God.

==Jewish thought==
Maimonides, in &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;, said:
According to Maimonides, there can be no plurality of faculties, moral dispositions, or essential attributes in God. To say that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good is to introduce plurality, if these qualities are separate attributes. Maimonides concluded that it is untrue to say that God&#x27;s power is greater than ours, that God&#x27;s life is more permanent than ours, or God&#x27;s knowledge is broader than ours. He believed that statements such as &quot;God lives&quot; or &quot;God is powerful&quot; are nonsense if they are interpreted normally, but they can be understood if analyzed as disguised negations. Maimonides also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity; God is neither this nor that, and verbal expression fails us. Citing Psalm 65, he concluded that the highest form of praise of God is silence.

For others, the axiom of divine unity (&quot;Shema&quot;) forms the understanding of divine simplicity. Bahya ibn Paquda (&quot;Duties of the Heart&quot; 1:8) points out that God&#x27;s oneness is &quot;true oneness&quot; (האחד האמת), as opposed to &quot;circumstantial oneness&quot; (האחד המקרי). He develops this idea to show that an entity that is truly one must be free of properties, indescribable, and unlike anything else. Such an entity would not be subject to change, utterly independent, and the root of everything.

The implication of either approach is so strong that the two concepts are often presented as synonymous: &quot;God is not two or more entities, but a single entity of oneness even more single and unique than any single thing in creation ... He cannot be sub-divided into different partstherefore, He can&#x27;t be anything other than one. It is a positive commandment to know this, for it is written (Deuteronomy 6:4) &#x27; ... the Lord is our God, the Lord is one.

Despite its apparent simplicity, this concept raises a number of difficulties. Since God&#x27;s simplicity does not allow for any structureeven conceptuallydivine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy:
* God is absolutely simple, containing no element of form or structure.
* God&#x27;s essence contains every possible element of perfection.

This paradox is articulated by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in &quot;Derech Hashem&quot;, who describes the dichotomy as arising from the inability to comprehend absolute unity:
==Christian thought==
Simplicity (or metaphysical, absolute simplicity) states that the characteristics of God are not parts of God which make up God. God is simple; God is those characteristics. God does not &quot;have&quot; goodness, but &quot;is&quot; goodness; God does not existence, but existence. According to Thomas Aquinas, God is God&#x27;s existence and God&#x27;s essence is God&#x27;s existence. God is goodness, which is his nature, which is his essence, which is his existence. William F. Vallicella says, &quot;To say that God lacks metaphysical parts is to say &quot;inter alia&quot; that God is free of matter-form composition, potency-act composition, and existence-essence composition. There is also no real distinction between God as a subject of his attributes and his attributes.&quot; God exhausts what it means to be God and, in principle, there cannot be more than one God. Divine simplicity is fundamentally about God&#x27;s attributes: his nature or essence. The doctrine does not state that God cannot have the &quot;property&quot; of creating a universe.

John Duns Scotus has a more moderate view of metaphysical simplicity than Aquinas. According to Duns Scotus, there is a formal distinction between God&#x27;s attributes. This distinction is not conceptual or metaphysical. The formal distinction is logical; omnipotence is not logically equivalent to omniscience. Duns Scotus affirms that God&#x27;s nature is not composed of metaphysical properties or parts.

Yann Schmitt says,
The notion of &quot;de re&quot; is contrasted with &quot;de dicto&quot;. &quot;De dicto&quot; concerns a proposition about what is said, and &quot;de re&quot; concerns the thing (or being). A formal distinction exists between the attribute of omnipotence and the attribute of omniscience because omnipotence and omniscience are inseparable for an omnipotent being (God); omnipotence and omniscience do not have the same definition, and the distinction between them exists &quot;de re&quot; (not conceptually or propositionally&quot;de dicto&quot;). A formal distinction is a logical distinction. The upshot for Scotus is that omnipotence and omniscience are logically distinct for God, who does not have the metaphysical properties (or attributes) of omnipotence or omniscience; metaphysically speaking, God omnipotence and omniscient.

Spatial simplicity is endorsed by most traditional Christian theists, who do not consider God a physical object. Temporal simplicity is endorsed by many theists, but is controversial among Christian theologians. Thomas V. Morris controversially describes property simplicity as the property of having no properties.

In the medieval era, theologians and philosophers held a view known as &quot;constituent ontology&quot; wherein natures were constituents of things. According to Aquinas, an individual nature was more like a concrete object than an abstract object. One person&#x27;s humanity was not the same as another person&#x27;s humanity; each had human nature, individuated by the matter (&quot;materia signata&quot;) from which each person was composed. For entities which are immaterial (such as angels), there is no matter to individuate their nature; each one is its nature. Each angel is one of a kind, although this claim was controversial.

Theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity distinguish modes of divine simplicity by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it. In quantitative or spatial terms, God is simpleas opposed to being made up of piecesand present in entirety everywhere if, in fact, present anywhere. In terms of essence, God is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter, body and soul, or mind and act. If distinctions are made between God&#x27;s attributes, they are distinctions of the &quot;modes&quot; of God&#x27;s being rather than real or essential divisions. In terms of subjects and accidents (as in the phrase &quot;goodness of God&quot;), divine simplicity allows for a conceptual distinction between the person of God and the personal attribute of goodness but disallows that God&#x27;s identity (or &quot;character&quot;) is dependent on goodness. According to the doctrine, it is impossible to consider the goodness in which God participates separately from the goodness which God is.

Aquinas says that as creatures, our concepts are drawn from the creation (the assumption of empiricism); according to divine simplicity, God&#x27;s attributes can only be spoken of by analogy since the properties of any created thing differ from its being. Divine simplicity was affirmed at the Fourth Lateran Council and First Vatican Council and is accepted in some form by most Christians.

===Criticism===
The concept of divine simplicity as espoused by Thomas Aquinas, was condemned, alongside Thomism in general, in a Patriarchal Synod of 1368 organised by the Patriarch of Constantinople Philotheos I, which also canonized Gregory Palamas &amp; re-affirmed the decision of the ninth ecumenical council on Palamas&#x27; teachings of the distinction between God&#x27;s essence &amp; energies being the dogma for the Eastern Orthodox Church. 

Absolute (Thomistic) divine simplicity has been criticized by a number of Christian theologians, including John S. Feinberg, Thomas Morris, William Lane Craig, and Alvin Plantinga; in his essay &quot;Does God Have a Nature?&quot;, Plantinga calls it &quot;a dark saying indeed&quot;. Plantinga presents three arguments against Thomistic divine simplicity. Concepts can apply univocally to God, even if language to describe God is limited, fragmentary, halting, and inchoate. In the concept of something like being a horse, for something to be a horse is known; the concept applies to an object if the object is a horse. If no concepts apply to God, it is confusing to say that there is such a person as God; God does not have properties such as wisdom, creation and omnipotence, and would not have any properties for which there are concepts. God would not have properties such as existence or self-identification. If God transcends human experience, nothing can be said univocally about God; such a claim presupposes knowledge, transcending human experience, which applies to God. One reply to this objection is to distinguish equivocal language and analogical language; the former lacks a univocal element, but the latter has an element of univocal language.

The claim that God can only be described analogically is, according to Plantinga, a double-edged sword. If univocal language cannot be used to describe God and argue against simplicity, it cannot be used in arguments for Thomistic divine simplicity. If the usual modes of inference in reasoning about God cannot be used, it cannot be argued that God is not distinct from his properties. Plantinga concludes, &quot;This way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for God&#x27;s greatness and majesty and augustness, but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence.&quot; Edward Feser has responded to Plantinga. Feser says that Plantinga is attacking a strawman when he says that proponents of analogical (religious) language are committed to the view that the language of God is metaphorical and not literal; metaphorical language differs from analogical language, so Plantinga is conflating analogy with metaphor.

Plantinga presents three criticisms of metaphysical simplicity, saying that it is difficult to grasp the doctrine and difficult to see why anyone would accept it. According to the Thomist doctrine of simplicity states, all abstract objects are identical with God&#x27;s essence and, hence, God himself. Plantinga says that this clashes with the fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey, and both are distinct from God and his essence. One response to this objection is to note a distinction between properties and predicates. A second response notes that supporters of divine simplicity do not think of God&#x27;s nature as exemplifying abstract objects that are independent of God.

Plantinga says that if abstract objects that are identical with God are restricted to the properties God exemplifies, the doctrine remains problematic. Metaphysical simplicity states that God has no accidental (contingent) properties, it seems that God has accidental properties such as having created Adam and knowing that Adam sinned. Some of God&#x27;s characteristics characterize him in every possible world, and others do not. Plantinga also says that the conflation of God&#x27;s actuality with his potentiality is problematic. As it seems that there are characteristics God has but could have lacked, it also seems that God lacks characteristics he could have had. God has not created all the persons he will create; there is at least one individual essence that God does not now have, but will have. If so, God has potentiality with respect to that characteristic. Feser notes that someone who holds to divine simplicity does not have to hold to this view; one can think that God has &quot;Cambridge&quot; properties, which are properties in a loose sense (such as the &quot;property&quot; of being a husband or creating a universe).

Plantinga&#x27;s third critique challenges the heart of simplicity. Metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition; there is no complexity of properties in God, and he is identical with his nature and each of his properties. According to Plantinga, this view has two difficulties. If God is identical with each of his properties, each of his properties is identical with each of his other properties; God has only one property. This flies in the face of the idea that God has power and mercy, neither of which is identical with the other. If God is identical with his properties and each of God&#x27;s properties is a property, God is a property and has one property: himself. However, properties do not cause anything; no property could have created the world, and no property could know anything. If God is a property, he is an abstract object with no power, life, love, or awareness. Feser notes that this objection assumes a Platonist metaphysics about abstract objects. Supporters of divine simplicity do not think of God as a Platonic-abstract property or impersonal; God is personal, personhood, and intelligent. God does not only have the concrete property of divine simplicity; for God, God is God&#x27;s essential &quot;properties&quot; (attributes). A distinction exists between properties and predicates, so humans distinguish power from mercy; in divine simplicity, power and mercy are the same things in God. Vallicella responds to Plantinga by arguing that Plantinga&#x27;s objections assume a non-constituent ontology and are unconvincing. In his 1983 review of &quot;Does God Have a Nature?&quot;, Alfred J. Freddoso wrote that Plantinga&#x27;s critique lacks the depth of analysis to propose jettisoning the theological basis of divine simplicity laid in Christian thought by Augustine, Anselm, Bonaventure, Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham, and others.

William Lane Craig calls the Thomistic view of property simplicity &quot;philosophically and theologically unacceptable&quot;, also objecting to divine simplicity. According to the doctrine, God is similar in all possible worlds. Since the statement &quot;God knows x&quot; is equivalent to &quot;x is true&quot;, it is inexplicable why those worlds vary if, in every one, God knows, loves, and wills the same things. Feser responded to Craig&#x27;s objections to divine simplicity. Morris calls it is an idea whose implications are difficult to defend, and whose advantages can be had in other ways. It is an idea whose motivation, under close scrutiny, unconvincing. John S. Feinberg writes, &quot;These philosophical problems plus the biblical considerations raised earlier lead me to conclude that simplicity is not one of the divine attributes. This doesn&#x27;t mean that God has physical parts, but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine.&quot; Jordan Barrett responded to the claim that divine simplicity is not biblical.

Jeffrey Brower and Michael Bergmann present a truthmaker defense of divine simplicity. Saying &quot;God is omnibenevolent&quot; means that &quot;God is his omnibenevolence&quot;; God is not identical to a property of omnibenevolence; he is identical to God&#x27;s goodness, and identical to himself. Vallicella says, &quot;Accordingly, to say that God is identical to his omniscience is just to say that God is identical to the truthmaker of &#x27;God is omniscient&#x27;. And that amounts to saying that God is identical to God. In this way, one avoids the absurdity of saying that God is identical to a property. What God is identical to is not the property of omniscience but the referent of &#x27;God&#x27;s omniscience,&#x27; which turns out to be God himself. And similarly for the rest of God&#x27;s intrinsic and essential attributes.&quot; Another truthmaker theory posits a moderate version of divine simplicity between absolute divine simplicity (God is not composed of metaphysical parts) and minimal divine simplicity (God is not composed of spatial, temporal or material parts). The deadlock of absolute divine simplicity. According to this view, God would not be composed but would be complex. Yann says, &quot;The minimal truthmaker requirement can then be assumed without any contradiction with divine simplicity. &lt;God is good&gt; is true in virtue of the perfection of God, that is God&#x27;s goodness. &lt;God is omniscient&gt; is true in virtue of another perfection of God, God&#x27;s omniscience. We do not have to say that God is identical with His goodness or His omniscience.&quot;

=== Scriptural arguments ===
Writers such as Herman Bavinck and Louis Berkhof have argued that the doctrine of divine simplicity is affirmed by the Epistle of John, since its author seems to identify God with love and light. Advocates of the doctrine have also argued that it is affirmed by Old Testament passages such as Exodus 3:14 (identifying God as &quot;being&quot;), Deuteronomy 6:4 (seen as affirming the oneness of God) and Jeremiah 23:6, identifying God with righteousness. Critics of the doctrine say that it is unlikely that the biblical authors had metaphysics in mind in the verses used, and the lack of explicit verses on the doctrine argues against it. Theologians such as Charles Caldwell Ryrie have argued that divine simplicity underscores the scriptural view of God&#x27;s self-existence.

==Islamic thought==

Views of divine simplicity were championed by the Mu&#x27;tazili, which resulted in an apophatic theology. By postulating a distinction between existence and essence for all created beings, which was perceived to be uniquely absent in God, Al-Farabi established another model of divine simplicity. Ibn Sinā supported and elaborated this position; Al-Ghazali contested this identification of divine essence and existence, but saw divine attributes and acts as enveloped in (and indistinct from) the divine essence. This view of divine simplicity was shared with critics of Muslim philosophical writers such as Ibn Taymiyyah.

<doc id="175841" wikidata="Q547376" url="?curid=175841" title="Bumper cars">
<text>Bumper cars or dodgems are the generic names for a type of flat amusement ride consisting of multiple small electrically powered cars which draw power from the floor or ceiling, and which are turned on and off remotely by an operator. They are also known as bumping cars, dodging cars and dashing cars. The first patent for them was filed in 1921.

==Design==
The metal floor is usually set up as a rectangular or oval track, and graphite is sprinkled on the floor to decrease friction. A rubber bumper surrounds each vehicle, and drivers either ram or dodge each other as they travel. The controls are usually an accelerator and a steering wheel. The cars can be made to go backwards by turning the steering wheel far enough in either direction, necessary in the frequent pile-ups that occur.

===Power source===

The cars are commonly powered by one of three methods. The oldest and most common method, the overhead system (OHS), uses a conductive floor and ceiling with opposing power polarities. Contacts under the vehicle touch the floor while a pole-mounted contact shoe touches the ceiling, forming a complete circuit.

A newer method, the floor pick-up (FPU) system, uses alternating strips of metal across the floor separated by insulating spacers, and no ceiling grid. The strips carry the supply current, and the cars are large enough so that the vehicle covers at least two strips at all times. An array of brushes under each car makes random contact with the strips, and the voltage polarity on each contact is arranged to always provide a correct and complete circuit to operate the vehicle.

A third method is used on &quot;Quantum&quot;-class cruise ships, where bumper cars run on electric batteries. This avoids the conductive floor/ceiling of the traditional bumper car setup, allowing the SeaPlex venue to be convertible from a bumper car ride to a multipurpose gym (basketball court). The disadvantage is that these ships&#x27; bumper cars take several hours to recharge.

==Bumping==
Although the idea of the ride is to bump other cars, safety-conscious (or at least litigation-conscious) owners sometimes put up signs reading &quot;This way around&quot; and &quot;No (head on) bumping&quot;. Depending on the level of enforcement by operators, these rules are often ignored by bumper car riders, especially younger children and teenagers.

==History==

In the early 1920s, a patent was granted to Max Stoehrer and his son Harold for an &quot;Amusement Apparatus&quot; which became the basis for their Dodgem cars. They deliberately equipped their device with &quot;novel instrumentalities to render their manipulation and control difficult and uncertain by the occupant-operator.&quot; They asserted that &quot;in the hands of an unskilled operator,&quot; a &quot;plurality of independently manipulated [...] cars&quot; would &quot;follow a promiscuous, irregular, and undefined path over the floor or other area, to not only produce various sensations during the travel of the vehicle but to collide with other cars as well as with portions of the platform provided for that purpose.&quot;

During their heyday, from the late 1920s to 1950s, two major US bumper cars brands were Dodgem by Stoehrer and the Auto-Skooter by Lusse Brothers, owned by Joseph and Robert &quot;Ray&quot; Lusse. Lusse Brothers built the first fiberglass body in 1959, in part due to the survival of Chevrolet Corvette bodies over the previous six years. After getting permission from Chevrolet, then subsequently buying the actual Corvette chevrons from local Philadelphia dealers, those were attached to the nose of their product for 1959. In the mid-1960s, Disneyland introduced hovercraft-based bumper cars called Flying Saucers, which worked on the same principle as an air hockey game; however, the ride was a mechanical failure and closed after a few years.

==Notable examples==
The largest operating bumper car floor currently operating in the United States is at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois. Called the Rue Le Dodge (renamed Rue Le Morgue during Fright Fest in the fall), it is by or a total of . A replica of the ride was built at California&#x27;s Great America in Santa Clara; in 2005, however, a concrete island was added to the middle of the floor to promote one-way traffic, reducing the floor area. Six Flags Great Adventure&#x27;s Autobahn is the largest bumper car floor, but it has not operated since 2008.

<doc id="175847" wikidata="Q128976" url="?curid=175847" title="Alec Douglas-Home">
<text>Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel ( ; 2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995), known as Lord Dunglass from 1918 to 1951 and the Earl of Home from 1951 to 1963, was a British statesman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964. He was the last prime minister to hold office while being a member of the House of Lords, before renouncing his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two stints as Foreign Secretary than on his brief premiership.

Within six years of first entering the House of Commons in 1931, Douglas-Home (then called by the courtesy title Lord Dunglass) became a parliamentary aide to Neville Chamberlain, witnessing first-hand Chamberlain&#x27;s efforts as prime minister to preserve peace through appeasement in the two years before the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1940 Douglas-Home was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis and was immobilised for two years. By the later stages of the war he had recovered enough to resume his political career, but he lost his seat in the general election of 1945. He regained it in 1950, but the following year he left the Commons when, on the death of his father, he inherited the earldom of Home and thereby became a member of the House of Lords. Under the premierships of Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan he was appointed to a series of increasingly senior posts, including Leader of the House of Lords and Foreign Secretary. In the latter post, which he held from 1960 to 1963, he supported United States resolve in the Cuban Missile Crisis and in August 1963 was the United Kingdom&#x27;s signatory to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

In October 1963 Macmillan was taken ill and resigned as prime minister. Home was chosen to succeed him. By the 1960s it had become generally considered unacceptable for a prime minister to sit in the House of Lords; Home renounced his earldom and successfully stood for election to the House of Commons. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two of Macmillan&#x27;s cabinet ministers refused to take office under him. He was criticised by the Labour Party as an aristocrat, out of touch with the problems of ordinary families, and he came over stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with the Labour leader, Harold Wilson. The Conservative Party, in power since 1951, had lost standing as a result of the Profumo affair, a 1963 sex scandal involving a defence minister, and at the time of Home&#x27;s appointment as prime minister it seemed headed for heavy electoral defeat. Home&#x27;s premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance, bringing costs down for the consumer against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.

After a narrow defeat in the general election of 1964, Douglas-Home resigned the leadership of his party, after having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader. From 1970 to 1974 he was in the cabinet of Edward Heath as Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; this was an expanded version of the post of Foreign Secretary, which he had held earlier. After the defeat of the Heath government in 1974, he returned to the House of Lords as a life peer, and retired from front-line politics.

==Early life and education==
Douglas-Home was born on 2 July 1903 at 28 South Street in Mayfair, London, the first of seven children of Lord Dunglass (the eldest son of the 12th Earl of Home) and of his wife, the Lady Lilian Lambton (daughter of the 4th Earl of Durham). The boy&#x27;s first name was customarily abbreviated to &quot;Alec&quot;. Among the couple&#x27;s younger children was the playwright William Douglas-Home.

In 1918 the 12th Earl of Home died; Dunglass succeeded him in the earldom, and the courtesy title passed to his son, Alec Douglas-Home, who was styled Lord Dunglass until 1951. The young Lord Dunglass was educated at Ludgrove School, followed by Eton College. At Eton his contemporaries included Cyril Connolly, who later described him as:

After Eton, Dunglass went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated with a third-class honours BA degree in Modern History in 1925.

Dunglass was a talented sportsman. In addition to representing Eton at fives, he was a capable cricketer at school, club and county level, and was unique among British prime ministers in having played first-class cricket. Coached by George Hirst, he became in &quot;Wisden&quot;&#x27;s phrase &quot;a useful member of the Eton XI&quot; that included Percy Lawrie and Gubby Allen. Wisden observed, &quot;In the rain-affected Eton-Harrow match of 1922 he scored 66, despite being hindered by a saturated outfield, and then took 4 for 37 with his medium-paced out-swingers&quot;. At first-class level he represented the Oxford University Cricket Club, Middlesex County Cricket Club and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Between 1924 and 1927 he played ten first-class matches, scoring 147 runs at an average of 16.33 with a best score of 37 not out. As a bowler he took 12 wickets at an average of 30.25 with a best of 3 for 43. Three of his first-class games were internationals against Argentina on the MCC &quot;representative&quot; tour of South America in 1926–27.

Dunglass began serving in the Territorial Army in 1924 as a lieutenant in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry, and was promoted to captain in 1928.

==Member of Parliament (1931–1937)==
=== Election to Parliament ===
The courtesy title Lord Dunglass did not carry with it membership of the House of Lords, and Dunglass was eligible to seek election to the House of Commons. Unlike many aristocratic families, the Douglas-Homes had little history of political service. Uniquely in the family the 11th earl, Dunglass&#x27;s great-grandfather, had held government office, as Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in Wellington&#x27;s 1828–1830 government. Dunglass&#x27;s father stood, reluctantly and unsuccessfully, for Parliament before succeeding to the earldom.

Dunglass had shown little interest in politics while at Eton or Oxford. He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful about the prospect of life as a country gentleman: &quot;I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn&#x27;t going to be enough.&quot; His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become prime minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: &quot;I went into politics because I felt that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so&quot;. His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated &quot;a property-owning democracy&quot;, based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton&#x27;s view that &quot;what everybody owns nobody owns&quot;.

With Skelton&#x27;s support Dunglass secured the Unionist candidacy at Coatbridge for the 1929 general election. It was not a seat that the Unionists expected to win, and he lost to his Labour opponent with 9,210 votes to Labour&#x27;s 16,879. It was, however, valuable experience for Dunglass, who was of a gentle and uncombative disposition and not a natural orator; he began to learn how to deal with hostile audiences and get his message across. When a coalition &quot;National Government&quot; was formed in 1931 to deal with a financial crisis Dunglass was adopted as the pro-coalition Unionist candidate for Lanark. The electorate of the area was mixed, and the constituency was not seen as a safe seat for any party; at the 1929 election Labour had captured it from the Unionists. However, with the pro-coalition Liberal party supporting him instead of fielding their own candidate, Dunglass easily beat the Labour candidate.

=== House of Commons ===
Membership of the new House of Commons was overwhelmingly made up of pro-coalition MPs, and there was therefore a large number of eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton&#x27;s phrase, &quot;it would have been easy for Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in backbench obscurity.&quot; However, Skelton, appointed as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office, offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second. He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject of economic policy, advocating a cautiously protectionist approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour&#x27;s objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff &quot;stimulates employment and gives work [and] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit.&quot;

During four years as Skelton&#x27;s aide Dunglass was part of a team working on a wide range of issues, from medical services in rural Scotland to land settlements, fisheries, education, and industry. Dunglass was appointed official PPS to Anthony Muirhead, junior minister at the Ministry of Labour, in 1935, and less than a year later became PPS to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain.

== Wartime career (1937–1945) ==
===Chamberlain and war===
By the time of Dunglass&#x27;s appointment Chamberlain was generally seen as the heir to the premiership, and in 1937 the incumbent, Stanley Baldwin, retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He retained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer D. R. Thorpe as &quot;the right-hand man ... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain&quot;, and by Dutton as &quot;liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [keeping] his master informed of the mood on the government&#x27;s back benches.&quot; This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof; Douglas Hurd wrote that he &quot;lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues – a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance.&quot; Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: &quot;I liked him, and I think he liked me. But if one went in at the end of the day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask &#x27;What do you want?&#x27; He was a very difficult man to get to know.&quot;

As Chamberlain&#x27;s aide Dunglass witnessed at first-hand the Prime Minister&#x27;s attempts to prevent a second world war through appeasement of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany. When Chamberlain had his final meeting with Hitler at Munich in September 1938, Dunglass accompanied him. Having gained a short-lived extension of peace by acceding to Hitler&#x27;s territorial demands at the expense of Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain was welcomed back to London by cheering crowds. Ignoring Dunglass&#x27;s urging he made an uncharacteristically grandiloquent speech, claiming to have brought back &quot;Peace with Honour&quot; and promising &quot;peace for our time&quot;. These words were to haunt him when Hitler&#x27;s continued aggression made war unavoidable less than a year later. Chamberlain remained prime minister from the outbreak of war in September 1939 until May 1940, when, in Dunglass&#x27;s words, &quot;he could no longer command support of a majority in the Conservative party&quot;. After a vote in the Commons, in which the government&#x27;s majority fell from more than 200 to 81, Chamberlain made way for Winston Churchill. He accepted the non-departmental post of Lord President of the Council in the new coalition government; Dunglass remained as his PPS, having earlier declined the offer of a ministerial post as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office. Although Chamberlain&#x27;s reputation never recovered from Munich, and his supporters such as R. A. Butler suffered throughout their later careers from the &quot;appeasement&quot; tag, Dunglass largely escaped blame. Nevertheless, Dunglass firmly maintained all his life that the Munich agreement had been vital to the survival of Britain and the defeat of Nazi Germany by giving the UK an extra year to prepare for a war that it could not have contested in 1938. Within months of his leaving the premiership Chamberlain&#x27;s health began to fail; he resigned from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940.

=== Military service and backbench MP===
Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent medical examination revealed that Dunglass had a hole in his spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient&#x27;s shin.
For all of Dunglass&#x27;s humour and patience, the following two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept flat on his back for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support of his wife and family, as he later confessed, &quot;I often felt that I would be better dead&quot;. Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile for the first time since the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler.

In July 1943 Dunglass attended the House of Commons for the first time since 1940, and began to make a reputation as a backbench member, particularly for his expertise in the field of foreign affairs. He foresaw a post-imperial future for Britain and emphasised the need for strong European ties after the war. In 1944, with the war now turning in the Allies&#x27; favour, Dunglass spoke eloquently about the importance of resisting the Soviet Union&#x27;s ambition to dominate eastern Europe. His boldness in publicly urging Churchill not to give in to Joseph Stalin was widely remarked upon; many, including Churchill himself, observed that some of those once associated with appeasement were determined that it should not be repeated in the face of Russian aggression. Labour left the wartime coalition in May 1945 and Churchill formed a caretaker Conservative government, pending a general election in July. Dunglass was appointed to his first ministerial post: Anthony Eden remained in charge of the Foreign Office, and Dunglass was appointed as one of his two Under-secretaries of State.

==Postwar career (1950–1960)==
=== Re-election to Parliament and peerage ===
In 1950, Clement Attlee, the Labour prime minister, called a general election. Dunglass was invited to stand once again as Unionist candidate for Lanark. Having been disgusted at personal attacks during the 1945 campaign by Tom Steele, his Labour opponent, Dunglass did not scruple to remind the voters of Lanark that Steele had warmly thanked the Communist Party and its members for helping him take the seat from the Unionists. By 1950, with the Cold War at its height, Steele&#x27;s association with the communists was a crucial electoral liability. Dunglass regained the seat with one of the smallest majorities in any British constituency: 19,890 to Labour&#x27;s 19,205. Labour narrowly won the general election, with a majority of five.
In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting the title of Earl of Home together with the extensive family estates, including the Hirsel, the Douglas-Homes&#x27; principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, but it was still pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951. The Unionists held Lanark, and the national result gave the Conservatives under Churchill a small but working majority of seventeen.

=== Minister for Scotland ===
Home was appointed to the new post of Minister of State at the Scottish Office, a middle-ranking position, senior to Under-secretary but junior to James Stuart, the Secretary of State, who was a member of the cabinet. Stuart, previously an influential chief whip, was a confidant of Churchill, and possibly the most powerful Scottish Secretary in any government. Thorpe writes that Home owed his appointment to Stuart&#x27;s advocacy rather than to any great enthusiasm on the Prime Minister&#x27;s part (Churchill referred to him as &quot;Home sweet Home&quot;). In addition to his ministerial position Home was appointed to membership of the Privy Council (PC), an honour granted only selectively to ministers below cabinet rank.
Throughout Churchill&#x27;s second term as prime minister (1951–1955) Home remained at the Scottish Office, although both Eden at the Foreign Office and Lord Salisbury at the Commonwealth Relations Office invited him to join their ministerial teams. Among the Scottish matters with which he dealt were hydro-electric projects, hill farming, sea transport, road transport, forestry, and the welfare of crofters in the Highlands and the Western Isles. These matters went largely unreported in the British press, but the question of the royal cypher on Post Office pillar boxes became front-page news. Because Elizabeth I of England was never queen of Scotland, some nationalists maintained when Elizabeth II came to the British throne in 1952 that in Scotland she should be styled &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;. Churchill said in the House of Commons that considering the &quot;greatness and splendour of Scotland&quot;, and the contribution of the Scots to British and world history, &quot;they ought to keep their silliest people in order&quot;. Home nevertheless arranged that in Scotland new pillar boxes were decorated with the royal crown instead of the full cypher.

=== Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs ===
==== Eden government: 1955–1957 ====
When Eden succeeded Churchill as prime minister in 1955 he promoted Home to the cabinet as Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. At the time of this appointment Home had not been to any of the countries within his ministerial remit, and he quickly arranged to visit Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. He had to deal with the sensitive subject of immigration from and between Commonwealth countries, where a delicate balance had to be struck between resistance in some quarters in Britain and Australia to non-white immigration on the one hand, and on the other the danger of sanctions in India and Pakistan against British commercial interests if discriminatory policies were pursued. In most respects, when Home took up the appointment it seemed to be a relatively uneventful period in the history of the Commonwealth. The upheaval of Indian independence in 1947 was well in the past, and the wave of decolonising of the 1960s was yet to come. However, it fell to Home to maintain Commonwealth unity during the Suez Crisis in 1956, described by Dutton as &quot;the most divisive in its history to date&quot;. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa backed the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt to regain control of the Suez Canal. Canada, Ceylon, India and Pakistan opposed it.

There appeared to be a real danger that Ceylon, India and, particularly, Pakistan might leave the Commonwealth. Home was firm in his support of the invasion, but used his contacts with Jawaharlal Nehru, V. K. Krishna Menon, Nan Pandit and others to try to prevent the Commonwealth from breaking up. His relationship with Eden was supportive and relaxed; he felt able, as others did not, to warn Eden of unease about Suez both internationally and among some members of the cabinet. Eden dismissed the latter as the &quot;weak sisters&quot;; the most prominent was Butler, whose perceived hesitancy over Suez on top of his support for appeasement of Hitler damaged his standing within the Conservative party. When the invasion was abandoned under pressure from the US in November 1956, Home worked with the dissenting members of the Commonwealth to build the organisation into what Hurd calls &quot;a modern multiracial Commonwealth&quot; (notwithstanding the Commonwealth was already multiracial.)

====Macmillan&#x27;s government: 1957–1960 ====
Eden resigned in January 1957. In 1955 he had been the obvious successor to Churchill, but this time there was no clear heir apparent. Leaders of the Conservative party were not elected by ballot of MPs or party members, but emerged after informal soundings within the party, known as &quot;the customary processes of consultation&quot;. The chief whip, Edward Heath, canvassed the views of backbench Conservative MPs, and two senior Conservative peers, the Lord President of the Council, Lord Salisbury, and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Kilmuir, saw members of the cabinet individually to ascertain their preferences. Only one cabinet colleague supported Butler; the rest, including Home, opted for Macmillan. Churchill, whom the Queen consulted, did the same. Macmillan was appointed prime minister on 10 January 1957.

In the new government Home remained at the Commonwealth Relations Office. Much of his time was spent on matters relating to Africa, where the futures of Bechuanaland and the Central African Federation needed to be agreed. Among other matters in which he was involved were the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, assisted emigration from Britain to Australia, and relations with Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus. The last unexpectedly led to an enhanced cabinet role for Home. Makarios, leader of the militant anti-British and pro-Greek movement, was detained in exile in the Seychelles. Macmillan, with the agreement of Home and most of the cabinet, decided that this imprisonment was doing more harm than good to Britain&#x27;s position in Cyprus, and ordered Makarios&#x27;s release. Lord Salisbury strongly dissented from the decision and resigned from the cabinet in March 1957. Macmillan added Salisbury&#x27;s responsibilities to Home&#x27;s existing duties, making him Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords. The first of these posts was largely honorific, but the leadership of the Lords put Home in charge of getting the government&#x27;s business through the upper house, and brought him nearer to the centre of power. In Hurd&#x27;s phrase, &quot;By the imperceptible process characteristic of British politics he found himself month by month, without any particular manoeuvre on his part, becoming an indispensable figure in the government.&quot;
Home was generally warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, and there were few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod&#x27;s prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959 to 1961, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain&#x27;s colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.

Macleod wished to push ahead with majority rule and independence; Home believed in a more gradual approach to independence, accommodating both white minority and black majority opinions and interests. Macleod disagreed with those who warned that precipitate independence would lead the newly independent nations into &quot;trouble, strife, poverty, dictatorship&quot; and other evils. His reply was, &quot;Would you want the Romans to have stayed on in Britain?&quot; He threatened to resign unless he was allowed to release the leading Nyasaland activist Hastings Banda from prison, a move that Home and others thought unwise and liable to provoke distrust of Britain among the white minority in the federation. Macleod had his way, but by that time Home was no longer at the Commonwealth Relations Office.

==Foreign Secretary (1960–1963)==
=== Appointment ===
In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, insisted on retiring. Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat-Amory that the best successor at the Treasury would be the current Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd. In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an expectation that the Foreign Secretary would be a member of the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–1940; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.
After discussions with Lloyd and senior civil servants, Macmillan took the unprecedented step of appointing two Foreign Office cabinet ministers: Home, as Foreign Secretary, in the Lords, and Edward Heath, as Lord Privy Seal and deputy Foreign Secretary, in the Commons. With British application for admission to the European Economic Community (EEC) pending, Heath was given particular responsibility for the EEC negotiations as well as for speaking in the Commons on foreign affairs in general.

==== Objection at appointment ====
The opposition Labour party protested at Home&#x27;s appointment; its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, said that it was &quot;constitutionally objectionable&quot; for a peer to be in charge of the Foreign Office. Macmillan responded that an accident of birth should not be allowed to deny him the services of &quot;the best man for the job – the man I want at my side&quot;. Hurd comments, &quot;Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when Margaret Thatcher appointed another peer, Lord Carrington, to the same post)&quot;. The Home–Heath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages – Home an Edwardian aristocrat and Heath a lower-middle class meritocrat raised in the inter-war years – the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan&#x27;s ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath&#x27;s hands.

=== Cold War ===

Home&#x27;s attention was mainly concentrated on the Cold War, where his forcefully expressed anti-communist beliefs were tempered by a pragmatic approach to dealing with the Soviet Union. His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, &quot;The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a &quot;casus belli&quot; for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin and that is what we must maintain.&quot; The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed &quot;all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth.&quot; An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.

The following year the Cuban Missile Crisis threatened to turn the Cold War into a nuclear one. Soviet nuclear missiles were brought to Cuba, provocatively close to the US. The American president, John F Kennedy, insisted that they must be removed, and many thought that the world was on the brink of catastrophe with nuclear exchanges between the two super-powers. Despite a public image of unflappable calm, Macmillan was by nature nervous and highly strung. During the missile crisis, Home, whose calm was genuine and innate, strengthened the Prime Minister&#x27;s resolve, and encouraged him to back up Kennedy&#x27;s defiance of Soviet threats of nuclear attack. The Lord Chancellor (Lord Dilhorne), the Attorney General (Sir John Hobson) and the Solicitor General, (Sir Peter Rawlinson) privately gave Home their opinion that the American blockade of Cuba was a breach of international law, but he continued to advocate a policy of strong support for Kennedy. When Khrushchev backed down and removed the Soviet missiles from Cuba, Home commented:
=== Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ===
The principal landmark of Home&#x27;s term as Foreign Secretary was also in the sphere of east–west relations: the negotiation and signature of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. He got on well with his American and Soviet counterparts, Rusk and Andrei Gromyko. The latter wrote that whenever he met Home there were &quot;no sudden, still less brilliant, breakthroughs&quot; but &quot;each meeting left a civilised impression that made the next meeting easier.&quot; Gromyko concluded that Home added sharpness to British foreign policy. Gromyko, Home and Rusk signed the treaty in Moscow on 5 August 1963. After the fear provoked internationally by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ban on nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water was widely welcomed as a step towards ending the cold war. For the British government the good news from Moscow was doubly welcome for drawing attention away from the Profumo affair, a sexual scandal involving a senior minister, which had left Macmillan&#x27;s government looking vulnerable.

===Successor to Macmillan===

In October 1963, just before the Conservative party&#x27;s annual conference, Macmillan was taken ill with a prostatic obstruction. The condition was at first thought more serious than it turned out to be, and he announced that he would resign as prime minister as soon as a successor was appointed. Three senior politicians were considered likely successors, Butler (First Secretary of State), Reginald Maudling (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Lord Hailsham (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords). &quot;The Times&quot; summed up their support:

In the same article, Home was mentioned in passing as &quot;a fourth hypothetical candidate&quot; on whom the party could compromise if necessary.

It was assumed in the &quot;Times&quot; article, and by other commentators, that if Hailsham (or Home) was a candidate he would have to renounce his peerage. This had been made possible for the first time by recent legislation. The last British prime minister to sit in the House of Lords was the third Marquess of Salisbury in 1902. By 1923, having to choose between Baldwin and Lord Curzon, George V decided that &quot;the requirements of the present times&quot; obliged him to appoint a prime minister from the Commons. His private secretary recorded that the King &quot;believed he would not be fulfilling his trust were he now to make his selection of Prime Minister from the House of Lords&quot;. Similarly, after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain in 1940 there were two likely successors, Churchill and Halifax, but the latter ruled himself out for the premiership on the grounds that his membership of the House of Lords disqualified him. In 1963, therefore, it was well established that the Prime Minister should be a member of the House of Commons. On 10 October Hailsham announced his intention to renounce his viscountcy.
The &quot;customary processes&quot; once again took place. The usual privacy of the consultations was made impossible because they took place during the party conference, and the potential successors made their bids very publicly. Butler had the advantage of giving the party leader&#x27;s keynote address to the conference in Macmillan&#x27;s absence, but was widely thought to have wasted the opportunity by delivering an uninspiring speech. Hailsham put off many potential backers by his extrovert, and some thought vulgar, campaigning. Maudling, like Butler, made a speech that failed to impress the conference. Senior Conservative figures such as Lord Woolton and Selwyn Lloyd urged Home to make himself available for consideration.

Having ruled himself out of the race when the news of Macmillan&#x27;s illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by changing his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He let it be known that if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from Lord Harlech, the British ambassador to the US, that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as prime minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.

Butler, by contrast, was seen as on the liberal wing of the Conservatives, and his election as leader might split the party. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, conducted a poll of cabinet members, and reported to Macmillan that taking account of first and second preferences there were ten votes for Home, four for Maudling, three for Butler and two for Hailsham.

The appointment of a prime minister remained part of the royal prerogative, on which the monarch had no constitutional duty to consult an outgoing prime minister. Nevertheless, Macmillan advised the Queen that he considered Home the right choice. Little of this was known beyond the senior ranks of the party and the royal secretariat. On 18 October &quot;The Times&quot; ran the headline, &quot;The Queen May Send for Mr. Butler Today&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Financial Times&quot; also predicted that Butler was about to be appointed. The Queen sent for Home the same day. Aware of the divisions within the governing party, she did not appoint him prime minister, but invited him to see whether he was able to form a government.
Home&#x27;s cabinet colleagues Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod, who disapproved of his candidacy, made a last-minute effort to prevent him from taking office by trying to persuade Butler and the other candidates not to take posts in a Home cabinet. Butler, however, believed it to be his duty to serve in the cabinet; he refused to have any part in the conspiracy, and accepted the post of Foreign Secretary. The other candidates followed Butler&#x27;s lead and only Powell and Macleod held out and refused office under Home. Macleod commented, &quot;One does not expect to have many people with one in the last ditch&quot;. On 19 October Home was able to return to Buckingham Palace to kiss hands as prime minister. The press was not only wrong-footed by the appointment, but generally highly critical. The pro-Labour &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; said on its front page:

&quot;The Times&quot;, generally pro-Conservative, had backed Butler, and called it &quot;prodigal&quot; of the party to pass over his many talents. The paper praised Home as &quot;an outstandingly successful Foreign Secretary&quot;, but doubted his grasp of domestic affairs, his modernising instincts and his suitability &quot;to carry the Conservative Party through a fierce and probably dirty campaign&quot; at the general election due within a year. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, liberal in its political outlook, remarked that Home &quot;does not look like the man to impart force and purpose to his Cabinet and the country&quot; and suggested that he seemed too frail politically to be even a stop-gap. &quot;The Observer&quot;, another liberal-minded paper, said, &quot;The overwhelming – and damaging – impression left by the events of the last two weeks is that the Tories have been forced to settle for a second-best. ... The calmness and steadiness which made him a good Foreign Secretary, particularly at times of crisis like Berlin and Cuba, may also be a liability.&quot;

In January 1964, and in the absence of any other information, Macleod now editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, used the pretext of a review of a book by Randolph Churchill to publicise his own different and very detailed version of the leadership election. He described the &quot;soundings&quot; of five Tory grandees, four of whom, like Home and Macmillan had been to school at Eton, as a stitch up by an Etonian &#x27;magic circle.&#x27; The article received wide publicity convincing Anthony Howard, who later declared himself &quot;deeply affronted ...and never more affronted than when Alec Douglas-Home became leader of the Conservative Party.&quot;

==Prime Minister (1963–1964)==
On 23 October 1963, four days after becoming prime minister, Home disclaimed his earldom and associated lesser peerages. Having been made a Knight of the Order of the Thistle (KT) in 1962, he was known after stepping down from the Lords as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The safe Unionist seat of Kinross and West Perthshire was vacant, and Douglas-Home was adopted as his party&#x27;s candidate. Parliament was due to meet on 24 October after the summer recess, but its return was postponed until 12 November pending the by-election. For twenty days Douglas-Home was prime minister while a member of neither house of Parliament, a situation without modern precedent. He won the by-election with a majority of 9,328; the Liberal candidate was in second place and Labour in third.

The Parliamentary leader of the opposition Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new prime minister as &quot;an elegant anachronism&quot;. He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home&#x27;s background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how &quot;a scion of an effete establishment&quot; could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: &quot;This is the counter-revolution ... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!&quot; Douglas-Home dismissed this as populist anti-elitism, and observed, &quot;I suppose Mr Wilson, when you come to think of it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson.&quot; He called Wilson &quot;this slick salesman of synthetic science&quot; and the Labour party &quot;the only relic of class consciousness in the country&quot;. The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that &quot;The Labour Party is not interested in the fact that the new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom – he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us.&quot;

Douglas-Home inherited from Macmillan a government widely perceived as in decline; Hurd wrote that it was &quot;becalmed in a sea of satire and scandal.&quot; Douglas-Home was the target of satirists on BBC television and in &quot;Private Eye&quot; magazine. &quot;Private Eye&quot; persistently referred to him as &quot;Baillie Vass&quot;, in allusion to a Scottish bailie. Unlike Wilson, Douglas-Home was not at ease on television, and came across as less spontaneous than his opponent.
In international affairs, the most dramatic event during Douglas-Home&#x27;s premiership was the assassination of John F. Kennedy, which happened about a month after the start of his tenure. Douglas-Home broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement on the question of British trade with Cuba. Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.

In Britain there was economic prosperity; exports &quot;zoomed&quot;, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, and the economy was growing at an annual rate of four per cent. Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: &quot;The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible.&quot; On another occasion he said, &quot;When I have to read economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself.&quot; He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home&#x27;s premiership, the abolition of resale price maintenance.

The Resale Prices Bill was introduced to deny manufacturers and suppliers the power to stipulate the prices at which their goods must be sold by the retailer. At the time, up to forty per cent of goods sold in Britain were subject to such price fixing, to the detriment of competition and to the disadvantage of the consumer. Douglas-Home, less instinctively liberal on economic matters than Heath, would probably not have sponsored such a proposal unprompted, but he gave Heath his backing, in the face of opposition from some cabinet colleagues, including Butler, Hailsham and Lloyd, and a substantial number of Conservative backbenchers. They believed the change would benefit supermarkets and other large retailers at the expense of proprietors of small shops. The government was forced to make concessions to avoid defeat. Retail price maintenance would continue to be legal for some goods; these included books, on which it remained in force until market forces led to its abandonment in 1995. Manufacturers and suppliers would also be permitted to refuse to supply any retailer who sold their goods at less than cost price, as a loss leader. The bill had a difficult Parliamentary passage during which the Labour party generally abstained, leaving the Conservatives to vote for or against their own government. The bill received the royal assent in July 1964, but did not become operative until 1965, by which time Douglas-Home, Heath and their colleagues were out of office.

A plot to kidnap Douglas-Home in April 1964 was foiled by the Prime Minister himself. Two left-wing students from the University of Aberdeen followed him to the house of John and Priscilla Buchan, where he was staying. He was alone at the time and answered the door, where the students told him that they planned to kidnap him. He responded, &quot;I suppose you realise if you do, the Conservatives will win the election by 200 or 300.&quot; He gave his intending abductors some beer, and they abandoned their plot.
The term of the Parliament elected in 1959 was due to expire in October 1964. Parliament was dissolved on 25 September and following three weeks of campaigning the 1964 general election took place on 15 October. Douglas-Home&#x27;s speeches dealt with the future of the nuclear deterrent, while fears of Britain&#x27;s relative decline in the world, reflected in chronic balance of payment problems, helped the Labour Party&#x27;s case. The Conservatives under Douglas-Home did much better than widely predicted, but Labour under Wilson won with a narrow majority. Labour won 317 seats, the Conservatives 304 and the Liberals 9.

==In Opposition (1964–1970)==
As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell to rejoin the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general election Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home to hand over the leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.
Determined that the party should abandon the &quot;customary processes of consultation&quot;, which had caused such rancour when he was appointed in 1963, Douglas-Home set up an orderly process of secret balloting by Conservative MPs for the election of his immediate and future successors as party leader. In the interests of impartiality the ballot was organised by the 1922 Committee, the backbench Conservative MPs. Douglas-Home announced his resignation as Conservative leader on 22 July 1965. Three candidates stood in the 1965 Conservative Party leadership election: Heath, Maudling and Powell. Heath won with 150 votes (one of them cast by Douglas-Home) to 133 for Maudling and 15 for Powell.

Douglas-Home accepted the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath&#x27;s shadow cabinet. Many expected this to be a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home&#x27;s retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in British foreign relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn, later known as Tony Benn, for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on the right wing of the Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.

In 1966 Douglas-Home became president of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was then the governing body of English and world cricket. The presidency had generally been a largely ceremonial position, but Douglas-Home became embroiled in two controversies, one of them with international implications. This was the so-called &quot;D&#x27;Oliveira affair&quot;, in which the inclusion of a non-white player in the England team to tour South Africa led to the cancellation of the tour by the apartheid regime in Pretoria. In his account of the affair, the political journalist Peter Oborne criticises Douglas-Home for his vacillating attitude towards South African prime minister John Vorster with whom, says Oborne, &quot;he was no more robust than Chamberlain had been with Hitler thirty years earlier&quot;. Douglas-Home&#x27;s advice to the MCC committee not to press the South Africans for advance assurances on D&#x27;Oliveira&#x27;s acceptability, and his optimistic assurances that all would be well, became a matter of much criticism from a group of MCC members led by the Rev David Sheppard. The second controversy was not one of race but of social class. Brian Close was dropped as England captain in favour of Colin Cowdrey. Close was dropped after using delaying tactics when captaining Yorkshire in a county match, but the move was widely seen as biased towards cricketers from the old amateur tradition, which had officially ended in 1963.

Wilson&#x27;s small majority after the 1964 general election had made the transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath&#x27;s team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room for members of the next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd&#x27;s responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.

Douglas-Home received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1966.

==Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (1970–1974)==

Heath invited Douglas-Home to join the cabinet, taking charge of Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. In earlier centuries it had not been exceptional for a former prime minister to serve in the cabinet of a successor, and even in the previous fifty years Arthur Balfour, Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald and Neville Chamberlain had done so. Until 2023, Douglas-Home would be the most recent former prime minister to be appointed to a ministerial post. Of Balfour&#x27;s appointment to Asquith&#x27;s cabinet in 1916, Lord Rosebery, who had been prime minister in 1894–95, said that having an ex-premier in the cabinet was &quot;a fleeting and dangerous luxury&quot;. Thorpe writes that Heath&#x27;s appointment of Douglas-Home &quot;was not a luxury but an essential buttress to his administration&quot;.

The Wilson government had merged the Colonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office in 1966 into the Commonwealth Office, which, two years later, was merged with the Foreign Office, to form the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Heath appointed Douglas-Home to head the department, with, once again, a second cabinet minister, this time Anthony Barber, principally responsible, as Heath had been in the 1960s, for negotiations on Britain&#x27;s joining the EEC. This time, both ministers were in the Commons; Barber&#x27;s cabinet post was officially Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Within weeks of the election Barber was moved from the FCO to the Treasury to take over as chancellor from Iain Macleod, who died suddenly on 20 July. Though they had never enjoyed an easy relationship, Douglas-Home recognised his colleague&#x27;s stature, and felt his loss politically as well as personally. Some commentators have maintained that Macleod&#x27;s death and replacement by the less substantial figure of Barber fatally undermined the economic success of the Heath government.

Barber was replaced at the FCO by Geoffrey Rippon, who handled the day-to-day negotiations, under the direction of Heath. Douglas-Home, as before, concentrated on east–west and Commonwealth matters. He was in agreement with Heath&#x27;s policy on the EEC, and did much to persuade doubters on the right wing of the Conservative party of the desirability of Britain&#x27;s entry. Hurd writes:

In east–west relations, Douglas-Home continued his policy of keeping the Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no satisfactory results from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities of the KGB in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government&#x27;s approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.

In negotiations on the future of Rhodesia Douglas-Home was less successful. He was instrumental in persuading the rebel leader, Ian Smith, to accept proposals for a transition to African majority rule. Douglas-Home set up an independent commission chaired by a senior British judge, Lord Pearce, to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion in Rhodesia. After extensive fieldwork throughout Rhodesia, the commission reported, &quot;We are satisfied on our evidence that the proposals are acceptable to the great majority of Europeans. We are equally satisfied ... that the majority of Africans rejected the proposals. In our opinion the people of Rhodesia as a whole do not regard the proposals as acceptable as a basis for independence.&quot; To Douglas-Home&#x27;s disappointment there was no resolution, and Rhodesia remained a rebel regime long after he left office.

==Retirement (1974–1995)==

At the February 1974 general election the Heath government was narrowly defeated. Douglas-Home, then aged 70, stepped down at the second election of that year, called in October by the minority Labour government in the hope of winning a working majority. He returned to the House of Lords at the end of 1974 when he accepted a life peerage, becoming known as &quot;Baron Home of the Hirsel, of Coldstream in the County of Berwick&quot;.

Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of I Zingari, the nomadic cricket team. In retirement he published three books: &quot;The Way The Wind Blows&quot; (1976), described by Hurd as &quot;a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights&quot;, &quot;Border Reflections&quot; (1979), and his correspondence with his grandson Matthew Darby, &quot;Letters to a Grandson&quot; (1983). In the 1980s Home increasingly spent his time in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that &quot;there was no sudden moment when he abandoned politics&quot;, rather that &quot;his interventions became fewer and fewer&quot;. His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd&#x27;s proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: &quot;After such a lapse of time justice might not be seen to be done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred so long ago. It was too late to reopen the issue.&quot; His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked after the death of his wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage.

==Personal life==
In 1936 Douglas-Home married Elizabeth Alington; her father, Cyril Alington, had been Douglas&#x27; headmaster at Eton, and was from 1933 Dean of Durham. The service was at Durham Cathedral, conducted by Alington together with William Temple, Archbishop of York and Hensley Henson, Bishop of Durham. In addition to the large number of aristocratic guests, the household and estate staffs of the Douglas-Home properties at Douglas Castle and the Hirsel were invited. There were four children of the marriage: Caroline, Meriel, Diana and David. The latter was Home&#x27;s heir, who became the 15th Earl of Home in 1995.

Douglas-Home died at the Hirsel in October 1995 when he was 92, four months after the death of his parliamentary opponent Harold Wilson. Home was buried in Lennel churchyard, Coldstream.

==Reputation==

Home&#x27;s premiership was short and not conspicuous for radical innovation. Hurd remarks, &quot;He was not capable of Macmillan&#x27;s flights of imagination&quot;, but he was an effective practical politician. At the Commonwealth Relations Office and the Foreign Office he played an important role in helping to manage Britain&#x27;s transition from imperial power to European partner. Both Thorpe and Hurd quote a memo that Macmillan wrote in 1963, intended to help the Queen choose his successor:
Douglas Hurd, once Home&#x27;s private secretary, and many years later his successor (after seven intermediate holders of the post) as Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, wrote this personal comment: &quot;The three most courteous men I knew in politics were Lord Home, King Hussein of Jordan, and President Nelson Mandela. All three had ease of birth, in the sense that they never needed to worry about who they themselves were and so had more time to concern themselves with the feelings of others.&quot;

Although some in the Conservative party agreed with Wilson (and Jo Grimond, the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 election if Butler had been prime minister, &quot;The Times&quot; observed, &quot;it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [Home] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement.&quot; Looking back across Home&#x27;s career, &quot;The Times&quot; considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: &quot;He brought to the office ... his capacity for straight talking, for toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted as a lack of sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect.&quot;

<text>Quiriguá () is an ancient Maya archaeological site in the department of Izabal in south-eastern Guatemala. It is a medium-sized site covering approximately along the lower Motagua River, with the ceremonial center about from the north bank. During the Maya Classic Period (AD 200–900), Quiriguá was situated at the juncture of several important trade routes. The site was occupied by 200, construction on the acropolis had begun by about 550, and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th century. All construction had halted by about 850, except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early Postclassic (&quot;c&quot;. 900 – &quot;c&quot;. 1200). Quiriguá shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of Copán, with whose history it is closely entwined.

Quiriguá&#x27;s rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat&#x27;s military victory over Copán in 738. When the greatest king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil or &quot;18-Rabbit&quot;, was defeated, he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quiriguá. Before this, Quiriguá had been a vassal state of Copán, but it maintained its independence afterwards. The ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá is quite modest, but the site&#x27;s importance lies in its wealth of sculpture, including the tallest stone monumental sculpture ever erected in the New World. Because of its historical importance, the site of Quiriguá was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1981.

==Name and location==

The archaeological site of Quiriguá is named after the nearby village of the same name, and is located a little over northeast of Guatemala City; it lies in the municipality of Los Amates in the department of Izabal and has an elevation of above mean sea level.

Positioned on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Motagua River, Quiriguá is situated at the point where the valley broadens into a flood plain, which has exposed the site to periodic flooding over the centuries. Although the river passed close to the site during the period of the city&#x27;s occupation, it has since changed course and now flows south of the ceremonial centre. Quiriguá is north of Copán, and is located north-west of the international border with Honduras.

The local bedrock is a hard red sandstone, which the inhabitants used in the construction of monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.

==Population==
Although the Quiriguá elite were clearly Maya in ethnicity, the site lies on the southern periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with ethnic Maya in a minority. The majority of the population belonged ethnically to the less complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 1200–1600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square mile) in central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.

The population levels of the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although it was never a heavily populated site. In the 9th century there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the abandonment of the city.

==Economy==
The Motagua River flows down from the western Guatemalan highlands, and Quiriguá was ideally positioned to control the trade of uncut jade, the majority of which was found in the middle reaches of the Motagua Valley, as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as cacao, which was produced as a local cash crop. Although cacao was produced for trade, maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the Maya diet. In addition, maize probably formed an important component in the site&#x27;s tribute payments to its overlords at Copán, a city that was exhausting its own local resources. Although little jade has been recovered from the site, there is evidence for trade in obsidian originating from the Ixtepeque source situated near the upper reaches of the Motagua.

In the Classic Period, the location of the site would have placed Quiriguá on a crossroads between the trading route from the highlands to the Caribbean coast and the route from Copán to the major cities of the Petén Basin.

==Known rulers==

As recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at Quiriguá, all dates are AD. Maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number (&quot;&quot;hel&quot;-number&quot; or count, named after its main glyph) that are believed to specify the position of that ruler in the sequence of dynastic succession to the rulership of the site. Thus a &quot;hel&quot;-number of five indicates the ruler was fifth in the line of dynastic succession.

==History==

===Early history===
There is evidence that Quiriguá was occupied as early as the Late Preclassic (400 BC – AD 200). Although no structures have been securely dated to this period, a number of Late Preclassic artifacts have been recovered, including 63 figurines and a chert blade. Early Classic ceramics from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands. These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards.

A combination of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal, Copán and Quiriguá, together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of Tikal as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region. The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426, in the Early Classic (&quot;c&quot;. 200 – &quot;c&quot;. 600); according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites, on 5 September of that year K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; was enthroned as king of Copán. Just three days later he installed &quot;Tok Casper&quot;, the first known king of Quiriguá, upon the throne. From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour, and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and, indirectly, of Tikal. During the next few centuries, about which little is known, the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor. It is recorded that a stela, as yet undiscovered, was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K&#x27;inich, the second king of Quiriguá. An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán, demonstrating Quiriguá&#x27;s continued status as a vassal of that city. A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá, but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult.

There are close parallels between the 5th-century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and Uaxactun in the northern Petén, a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century. The similarities show that Quiriguá remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network.

===Hiatus and recovery===

Quiriguá suffered a hiatus from the turn of the 6th century that lasted through to the middle of the 7th century. This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal&#x27;s defeat by Calakmul. There is evidence that Quiriguá suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period, as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument 26, characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors. No monuments were erected during this hiatus, which lasted from 495 to 653.

In the 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried the surface of the site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, and it was one of the site&#x27;s smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.

A revival can be identified by the dedication of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K&#x27;awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site&#x27;s first ballcourt.

===Apogee===
Quiriguá traditionally had been subordinate to its southern neighbour, Copán, and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, king of Copán, installed K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá&#x27;s throne as his vassal. As early as 734, however, K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as &quot;k&#x27;ul ahaw&quot;, holy lord, instead of using the lesser term &quot;ahaw&quot;, subordinate lord; at the same time he began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph. These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance.

Indeed, this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger struggle between the two Maya &quot;superpowers&quot;, the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul. In 736, only two years later, K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K&#x27;awiil, the high king of distant Calakmul, while Copán was one of Tikal&#x27;s oldest allies. The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant, falling between the accession of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quiriguá as a vassal of Copán and the outright rebellion that was to follow. This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quiriguá&#x27;s rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley. It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne, since Quiriguá experienced rapid growth soon after, suggesting that Quiriguá already was receiving external support.

In 738 the interlinked fortunes of Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, who had installed him on his throne in 725. This coup does not seem to have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán&#x27;s patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.

The captured lord was taken back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual. The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south-eastern Maya region. After this, Quiriguá engaged in a major monument-building programme, closely mimicking the sculptural style of Copán, possibly using captured Copán sculptors to carry out the work. The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738, although Quiriguá was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2,000.

In the Late Classic (&quot;c&quot;. 600 – &quot;c&quot;. 900), alliance with Calakmul frequently was associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.

In 718, the city of Xkuy – an as yet undiscovered site – was attacked and burned by Copán under the leadership of king Uaxaclajuun Ub&#x27;aah K&#x27;awiil. After the king of Copán was sacrificed in 738, Xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of Quiriguá and in 762 K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat supervised the accession of &quot;Sunraiser Jaguar&quot; to the subservient city&#x27;s throne.

K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who had so dramatically changed the destiny of his city, died on 27 July 785. Zoomorph G is his memorial stone and it describes how he was buried 10 days later in the &quot;13 Kawak House&quot;, a building that has not been identified. The great king was succeeded by &quot;Sky Xul&quot;, a king whose name has not been properly identified. &quot;Sky Xul&quot; became the reigning lord of Quiriguá 78 days after the death of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, who is thought to have been his father. His reign lasted from 10 to 15 years and was a period of continued activity. In most of the Maya region cities already were suffering terminal decline, engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse, but in Quiriguá &quot;Sky Xul&quot; dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two altars, considered marvels of Maya stoneworking. &quot;Sky Xul&quot; died some time between 795 and 800.

===Decline and collapse===
Little is known of &quot;Jade Sky&quot;, who succeeded &quot;Sky Xul&quot; and was the last recorded ruler of Quiriguá. The city&#x27;s power already was waning, as evidenced by the two stunted stelae erected during his reign, which indicate that the kingdom no longer had access to the kind of resources needed to produce monuments of a similar quality to those of his predecessors. &quot;Jade Sky&quot; did build two of the largest structures in the acropolis, however.

Quiriguá apparently retained its independence from Copán and continued to flourish until the beginning of the 9th century. Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810, when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a &quot;k&#x27;atun&quot;-ending ritual. However, 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá, although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre. After this, Quiriguá falls into silence, engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse – it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment.

===Postclassic===
In the early Postclassic Period (&quot;c&quot;. 900 – &quot;c&quot;. 1200), Quiriguá was occupied by peoples closely linked to the Caribbean coastal areas of the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize, perhaps due to Chontal Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucatán coast and the Motagua Valley. During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex. Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining chacmool sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucatán, artifacts that demonstrate a close link with the distant city of Chichen Itza. Some copper bells and ornaments were recovered from Quiriguá, they are among the earliest finds of metal artifacts in the Maya area. They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic (&quot;c&quot;. 800 – &quot;c&quot;. 950) or the Early Postclassic.

===Modern history===
The first European visitor to publish an account of Quiriguá was English architect and artist Frederick Catherwood, who reached the ruins in 1840. The previous landowner, by the surname of Payés, had related the existence of the ruins to his sons and to Carlos Meiney, a Jamaican Englishman resident in Guatemala. The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés&#x27; sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá. Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood&#x27;s visit in John Lloyd Stephens&#x27;s book &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan&quot; in 1841. Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves. A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Karl Scherzer.

Explorer and archaeologist Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá for three days in 1881; they were the first pre-Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology. He was able to return on three further occasions, the last being in 1894, and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them. He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments, carried out some minor excavations, made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum, with casts being transferred to the British Museum.

In 1910, the United Fruit Company bought Quiriguá and all the land for a great distance around the site for banana production; they set aside around the ceremonial centre as an archaeological park, leaving an island of jungle among the plantations. More archaeological work was carried out from 1910 to 1914 by Edgar Lee Hewett and Sylvanus Morley for the School of American Archaeology in Santa Fe. Duplicates of the stelae of Quiriguá made from Hewett&#x27;s plaster casts of the originals were exhibited at the Panama–California Exposition in San Diego, California, in 1915. The casts are still on display at the San Diego Museum of Us in their &quot;Maya: Heart of Sky, Heart of Earth&quot; exhibition. The Carnegie Institution conducted several intermittent projects at Quiriguá from 1915 through 1934. Aldous Huxley, writing after visiting the site in the early 1930s, noted that Quiriguá&#x27;s stelae commemorated &quot;man&#x27;s triumph over time and matter and the triumph of time and matter over man.&quot; Quiriguá was among the first Maya archaeological sites to be studied intensively, although little restoration was carried out and the ruins once again became overgrown with jungle.

Quiriguá was declared a National Monument in 1970 under Ministerial Accord 1210, this was followed on 19 June 1974 by its declaration as an Archaeological Park under Governmental Accord 35-74.

From 1974 through 1979, an extensive archaeological project was conducted at Quiriguá sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania, the National Geographic Society, and the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia. Directed by Robert Sharer and William R. Coe, the project excavated the acropolis, cleaned the monuments, and studied outlying groups. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981, and in 1999 UNESCO approved one-off funding of US$27,248 for &quot;emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of the archaeological site of Quiriguá&quot;. One of the site&#x27;s stelae is depicted on the Guatemalan 10 centavo coin.

The area included within the Archaeological Park of Quiriguá has been developed for tourism with the construction of a car park, site museum, and sanitation facilities and is open to the public on a daily basis.

==The site==

===Architecture===
After Quiriguá&#x27;s pivotal victory over Copán in 738, K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of Copán itself. Thus, the acropolis, palace, and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza. The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas, the northernmost is the Great Plaza. This plaza measures from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region. At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza, surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis. The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself. The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace. A number of ceramic-lined wells have been excavated close to the site core, these were all built in the 8th century and although some continued in use into the 9th century, none are known to have been built that late.
*1A-1 is an enormous platform forming the northern part of the Great Plaza. It measures and rises above the level of the southern part of the plaza. It forms the northern portion of the Great Plaza, being built by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat when he extended the plaza northward. The platform was built from river cobbles and was paved with stone slabs. Platform 1A-1 supported the stelae A, C, D, E and F and Zoomorph B. The platform was built in two phases over about 20 years.
*1A-3 is a large mound marking the northern edge of the Great Plaza. It originally measured and was high. A wide stairway climbed the southern face of the structure from the plaza. The structure was later extended to the north but this second phase of construction was never finished.
*The acropolis is the largest architectural complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned. The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes. The acropolis complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of corbel arches, but none are still standing.
*1B-sub.1 is also known as the K&#x27;inich Ahau Wall. It was a free-standing wall over long and thick, it stood on top of the western platform of the acropolis. The western side of the wall overlooked the river and bore five alternating mosaic masks representing solar deities and serpents with human arms. These masks were supported by a frieze consisting of two concentric ovals flanked by serpent heads. The wall was completed around 750, during the reign of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat.
*1B-sub.4 Excavations at the acropolis discovered a completely buried ballcourt under the structures on the western side of the Acropolis Plaza, a rare example of a ballcourt having been built over by subsequent construction, in this case by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. This was the first ballcourt at the site and dates to the middle of the 7th century. It was built with blocks of rhyolite. This ballcourt is a close copy of the ballcourts at Copán, being built in the same style, to the same dimensions, and with the same orientation. The ballcourt was buried when K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat built the massive western platform to restrict access to the acropolis.
*1B-1 is a structure which forms the southern limit of the Acropolis Plaza, a broad stairway leads down to the plaza from the northern side of the building. The lower walls of the structure are still standing and it has three entrances, each of which opens onto a small chamber. Each of the three chambers has a hieroglyphic step on the back wall leading to another small chamber. Originally the building had an external band of hieroglyphs. Both the exterior and internal glyphs bear the last known date recorded at Quiriguá, falling in June 810. This building was built during the reign of &quot;Jade Sky&quot;.
*1B-2 also lies south of the Acropolis Plaza, in the southwest corner. It is smaller than structure 1B-1, which it adjoins, and its lower walls also are still standing. It was a small residential building that was elaborately decorated with sculptured stonework. This structure was probably the residence of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat.
*1B-3 and 1B-4 are structures on the west side of the Acropolis Plaza, only the lower walls remain. Between these two structures is an older free-standing wall. This wall has a westward facing mosaic frieze that bears damaged and now headless depictions of Kinich Ahau, the sun god.
*1B-5 lies to the north of the Acropolis Plaza, at the south-eastern corner of the Ballcourt Plaza. This structure was accessed via a broad stairway from the Acropolis Plaza to the south, which rises to a single entrance opening onto seven interconnected chambers. This is the largest building at Quiriguá and its walls are still standing. It was built during the reign of &quot;Jade Sky&quot;.
*1B-6 lies to the east of the Acropolis Plaza and contained an ancestral shrine, reflecting a long established tradition first seen at Tikal. Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of schist, which contained an elite burial. The remains probably belonged to a male, the teeth were inlaid with jade, and a bead of the same material had been placed in the mouth. Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic.
*1B-7 is a ballcourt, built by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat to replace the ballcourt buried under his expansion of the acropolis. The ballcourt lies in the Ballcourt Plaza, to which it gives its name, to the northwest of the acropolis. The ballcourt has an east–west orientation that is unusual in the Maya region, where ballcourts traditionally are aligned north–south.
*3C-1 is a broad earthen platform on the valley floor, it dates to the middle of the Classic Period and is one of the earlier constructions at the site, parts of it continuing in use after a catastrophic flood.
*3C-7 is a group dating to the Early Classic. It is on the floodplain some distance to the north of the acropolis.
*3C-8 is another Early Classic group located to the north of the acropolis.
*Locus 011 and Locus 057 may have been watchposts, they were situated at the points where the Quiriguá and the Jubuco rivers entered the Motagua Valley and may have been used to control passing traffic on these routes. Locus 057 was situated on one of the most probable routes to Copán and may have been a watchpost to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat.
*Locus 122 and Locus 123 are groups located on the floodplain south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a pyramidal mound and a NE–SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which reason it is presumed to date from that period.

Groups A, B and C lie at a distance of from the site core.
*Group A is a hilltop complex roughly dating to the early Classic Period. A stela found in this group dates to 493.
*Group B, also known as Group 7A-1, is to the north of the site core. It is the location of the badly eroded Stela S, which was moved here from the Great Plaza in ancient times.
*Group C has an unsculptured stela.

===Monuments===
The monuments at Quiriguá include unusually large stelae elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone, brought from quarries away. The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low-relief sculptures enhanced by three-dimensional faces, in contrast with the contemporary two-dimensional sculpture of the Petén region. After the defeat and execution of the king of Copán in 738, the sculptural style of Quiriguá closely resembled that of its former overlord. The enormous stelae at Quirigá originally would have been visible from the Motagua River, which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza, announcing the new-found power of the city to passing traders. The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions. A characteristic of these texts is the use of full-figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of Maya script are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the deities. However, by the latter part of the 8th century Quiriguá had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite mythological animals bearing elements of toads, jaguars, crocodiles, and birds of prey; these sculptures are referred to as &quot;zoomorphs&quot; and were completed by two later kings after the death of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785.

There also are various altars and sculptures used as decoration in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff compared to the naturalistic grace of the art of some other Maya sites. Traces of red pigment have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.
*Stela A was erected in 775 by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Stela A and Stela C form a pair and were both dedicated on 29 December 775.
*Zoomorph B was dedicated in 780 by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it is a multi-ton boulder sculptured into a half-crocodile half-mountain beast. The hieroglyphic text on this monument consists entirely of full-figure glyphs. Traces of red pigment have been found on this zoomorph, which is long. A dedication cache was found buried in a pit under Zoomorph B, it included seven flint blades between in length.
*Stela C was erected in 775 by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The hieroglyphic text contains references to 455 and Tutuum Yohl K&#x27;inich, an early king. The stela also bears a reference to the date 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahaw 8 Kumk&#x27;u (13 August 3114 BC). This date is recorded throughout the entire Maya area as the beginning of the current creation, when the deities were placed in order. Stela C forms a pair with Stela A and was dedicated on the same date.
*Stela D dates to 766, during the reign of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. It is distinguished by the relatively rare, extravagant, full-figure anthropomorphic versions of Maya hieroglyphics on the upper parts of its sides, which are particularly well preserved. Stela D is roughly in height.
*Stela E stands in the northern half of the Great Plaza. This stela was dedicated on 24 January 771 by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its total shaft measures in height, including the buried portion holding it in place, which measures just under . This enormous monolith is the largest stone ever quarried by the ancient Maya and weighs approximately 65 tons, it may even be the largest free-standing worked monolith in the New World. In 1917 this stela, already tilting away from vertical, finally fell over completely after heavy rains, although it remained unbroken. In 1934 an attempt was made to raise the stela using a winch and steel cables, during which the cables snapped and the monolith fell and was broken into two pieces, which have since been joined back together using concrete. This stela bears portraits of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its front and back.
*Stela F is an enormous high monolith carved from sandstone. It bears representations of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its north and south sides and hieroglyphic inscriptions on its east and west sides. It dates to 761 and when it was raised it was the tallest monument ever erected by the Maya; it was only surpassed when Stela E was erected 10 years later.
*Zoomorph G is the memorial monument to K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, dedicated during the reign of &quot;Sky Xul&quot;. It shows the face of the dead king emerging from the maw of an enormous jaguar. The text of this monument describes the death and burial of Quiriguá&#x27;s greatest king.
*Stela H dates to 751, during the reign of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Its glyphs are arranged in a rare mat pattern, copied from Copán. The stela is executed in the wrap-around style. A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt, buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.
*Stela J was erected by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 756 and is carved in the wrap-around style. It stands high and is located in the southern part of the Great Plaza. The dedicatory cache consisted of a house-shaped clay box with unknown contents.
*Altar L is fairly crudely worked and dates to 653. The text bears the name of king K&#x27;awiil Yopaat and also mentions &quot;Smoke Imix&quot;, the 12th king of Copán. The altar is a rhyolite disk in diameter and thick. The sculptural style of this altar is unique, and shows affinities with the distant site of Caracol in Belize.
*Altar M this modest monument is the earliest known monument dedicated by K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat. The importance of this monument lies in its text, in which this preeminent king of Quiriguá claimed the title of &quot;k&#x27;uhul ajaw&quot;, holy lord, and began his bid for independence from Copán. This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15 September 734 and has the form of a monstrous head, possibly that of a crocodilian.
*Altar N is another small rhyolite sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has the form of a turtle shell with a skeletal head with a mirror on its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other. This is a representation of the bicephalic deity Pawatun (God N), a prominent underworld deity.
*Zoomorph O is a crocodile-mountain hybrid monster, dedicated in 790 by king &quot;Sky Xul&quot;. It is accompanied by an altar depicting a lightning god. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt itself.
*Zoomorph P (which explorer Maudslay nicknamed &quot;The Great Turtle&quot;) was dedicated in 795 by &quot;Sky Xul&quot; and is a masterpiece of Mesoamerican art. It weighs around 20 tons. On one side it depicts a larger-than-life portrait of &quot;Sky Xul&quot; himself seated cross-legged in the open jaws of an enormous crocodile-mountain hybrid monster. The design of this zoomorph is incredibly intricate and the whole monument is covered with skilfully executed sculpture. It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza, just south of the ballcourt. Zoomorph P is accompanied by an altar depicting an unidentified deity leaping from a split in the earth. A hieroglyphic text on the zoomorph describes the founding of Quiriguá under the supervision of the king of Copán. Traces of red pigment have been found on this monument, suggesting that it was originally painted red.
*Altar Q and Altar R are two small rhyolite disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4. Together with a third stone they would have marked the central axis of the ballcourt. They both bear seated cross-legged figures carved in shallow relief.
*Stela S is the earliest surviving monument of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat, it dates to 746. It was originally located in the northern half of the Great Plaza but was moved to an outlying group in ancient times. It is heavily eroded, some of the damage may have been inflicted by the process of moving it. It was fashioned from sandstone and bears the figure of K&#x27;ak&#x27; Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the front, the other three sides being covered by hieroglyphic text. Unfortunately, due to the heavy erosion most of the text is illegible. Stela S is high (not including the part of the stela buried in the ground) and the dimensions of the base are by , making it the earliest of the huge stelae that were to characterise Quiriguá, although it is significantly smaller than those that were to follow.
*Stela T was dedicated in 692 by an unknown ruler. It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure. The stela is conservative in style, being similar to the much older Stela U.
*Stela U comes from Group A and bears a heavily eroded portrait of a king in wrap-around style (extending over three sides of the stela). This style originated in Tikal and indicates contact with the central Petén region. This stela has an identifiable date, corresponding to 18 April 480, and a reference to a ritual taking place that was supervised by the king of Copán. This stela is carved from schist and is broken in two pieces, being snapped off at the knees – apparently deliberately during an attack by unknown enemies. It was originally in height.
*Monument 25 is a plain round column carved from schist. It is about long and in diameter. It was found in Locus 011.
*Monument 26 is a stela in wrap-around style found close to structure 3C-1. A date corresponding to 493 is contained in the hieroglyphic text on its back, this text mentions the third and fourth rulers of Quiriguá but their names are currently unreadable. It is carved from schist and was originally high but the stela was broken in ancient times, apparently deliberately. It was broken off at the knees and the left eye of the ruler&#x27;s portrait was scratched away, damage characteristic of that inflicted by invading warriors. Only two pieces have been recovered, an upper section measuring and a lower section measuring .
*Monument 29 and Monument 30 are heavily eroded columnar sculptures fashioned from schist, each measuring a little over in length. They were found together in a modern drainage ditch to the north and northwest of the ceremonial centre of Quiriguá. They apparently were sculptures of anthropomorphs or monkeys standing on pedestals with their hands clasped on their chests. It is thought on stylistic grounds that these two monuments date to the Late Preclassic.

<doc id="175850" wikidata="Q1929042" url="?curid=175850" title="Michael Rennie">
<text>Michael Rennie (born Eric Alexander Rennie; 25 August 1909 – 10 June 1971) was a British film, television and stage actor, who had leading roles in a number of Hollywood films, including his portrayal of the space visitor Klaatu in the science fiction film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951). In a career spanning more than 30 years, Rennie appeared in more than 50 films and in several American television series.

Under three years after leaving Hollywood, he journeyed to his mother’s home in Harrogate, Yorkshire, following the death of his brother. There, he died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm on 10 June 1971.

==Early years and career==
Rennie was born in Idle near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the second son of a Scottish wool mill owner, James Rennie, and his English wife Amelia (née Dobby). He had an elder brother William, younger brother Gordon and sister Edith. The Rennie business had operated for over 150 years, and the family was relatively well off. He was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge.

He went to work at the family mill in Bradford, but did not enjoy it. He worked in a number of occupations, including a stint as a car salesman, and sweeping floors in his uncle&#x27;s steel ropes factory. He eventually decided (at the time of his 26th birthday, in 1935) on a career as an actor. He retained his surname but adopted Michael as his professional name. He cited Ronald Colman as his role model.

===Early British films===
The 6&#x27; 4&quot; tall Rennie attracted the interest of a casting director at Gaumont British, who took him on as an extra. Rennie said entering the film industry at this level was a deliberate strategy, so he could learn how pictures were made. Head of production Michael Balcon said Rennie was taken on &quot;because he was good-looking and athletic. He knew nothing of acting, but was given a contract to play small parts and to work as stand-in for players such as Robert Young and John Loder.&quot;

Rennie&#x27;s first screen acting was an uncredited bit part in the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936), standing in for Robert Young. Balcon says he saw Rennie act in a scene in &quot;East Meets West&quot; (1936) and fired him immediately afterwards. Balcon wrote &quot;I had seen the rushes of that day&#x27;s filming and had at once decided that Rennie was far too inexperienced to justify big screen parts.&quot;

The 1937 screen test, which exists in the British Film Institute (BFI) archives under the title &quot;Marguerite Allan and Michael Rennie Screen Test&quot;, did not lead to a film career for either performer.

Balcon says Rennie &quot;took his setback well, left the studios, and went off to learn his job in repertory.&quot; Rennie worked mostly in Yorkshire, eventually becoming a star with the York Repertory Company. Among his roles were as Professor Henry Higgins in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.

He also played other bit parts and minor unbilled roles in other films, including &quot;The Man Who Could Work Miracles&quot; (1936), &quot;Conquest of the Air&quot; (1937), &quot;The Squeaker&quot; (1937), &quot;Gangway&quot; (1937), &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938), &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; (1938), &quot;This Man in Paris&quot; (1939) &amp; &quot;The Briggs Family&quot; (1940). He later said he strove to perfect a &quot;mid-Atlantic accent&quot; that could easily be understood by American as well as British audiences which resulted in people thinking he was Canadian.

==World War II==
===Rising fame===
Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe on 1 September 1939, Rennie began to receive offers for larger film roles, including &quot;This Man Is Dangerous&quot; (1940), &quot;Dangerous Moonlight&quot; (1941) and &quot;Pimpernel Smith&quot; (1941). Rennie auditioned again for Michael Balcon, now head of Ealing Studios, and was cast in &quot;Ships with Wings&quot;.

While that film was being prepared, Rennie continued repertory work and accepted a one-line role in George Formby&#x27;s &quot;Turned Out Nice Again&quot;. Balcon says Rennie &quot;declared that he enjoyed it as he was playing a motor salesman, and this reminded him of the days when he tried to sell cars – without securing a single buyer.&quot;

Rennie had his first big film role in the suspense drama &quot;Tower of Terror&quot; (1941). This starred Wilfrid Lawson in the lead role as a crazed Dutch lighthouse keeper in the German-occupied Netherlands, while the second-billed Rennie and third-billed Movita had the romantic leads. In a 1951 interview Rennie said this was his worst part.

Michael Balcon also used him in &quot;The Big Blockade&quot; (1942). He was called a &quot;rapidly rising newcomer&quot;. Another profile referred to him as an &quot;athletic, Gable-ish young man.&quot;

===War service===
Rennie enlisted in the RAF Volunteer Reserve on 27 May 1941. &quot;There has been a pause in Rennie&#x27;s film career&quot;, wrote Balcon in 1942. &quot;But there will be parts awaiting him when the war is over&quot;.

He was officially discharged on 4 August 1942, and then on the following day, he was commissioned &quot;for the emergency&quot; as pilot officer number 127347 on probation in the General Duties Branch of the RAFVR. On 5 February 1943, he was promoted to flying officer on probation. He resigned his commission on 1 May 1944 (not discharged on disability, as the studio publicity stated).

Rennie had carried out his basic training near Torquay in Devon, after which he was sent to the United States for fighter pilot training under the Arnold Plan. In this programme, pilots of the RAF were trained by United States Army Air Forces instructors. One of his fellow students was RAF Sergeant Jack Morton, who told an anecdote about when he and Rennie were in the same class:
==Film stardom==
===&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;===
With the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Rennie was given his first film break, when cast alongside Margaret Lockwood, then at the peak of her popularity, in the musical &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot; (1945), directed by Val Guest for Gainsborough Studios. Rennie was billed below Lockwood and Vic Oliver, given an &quot;introducing&quot; credit, but his character was the actual protagonist of the film. The movie was not a large hit but Rennie received excellent notices, including a review from the US trade paper &quot;Variety&quot; which said his performance made the film &quot;noteworthy&quot; and that he was &quot;likely Hollywood material... the best bet in the way of a new male star to have come out of a British studio in many years. Rennie not only has a lot on the ball as a straight lead, he knows the value of visual tricks. Femmes will go for him in a big way.&quot;

He followed this in another movie with Lockwood at Gainsborough, the sensual costume adventure &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945). Rennie was the fifth lead, beneath Lockwood, James Mason, Patricia Roc and Griffith Jones, but it was a good part as the one true love of Lockwood&#x27;s character. It was an excellent project to be associated with, the year&#x27;s biggest box-office hit, subsequently ninth out of the ten highest-grossing British films of all time.

Rennie&#x27;s prestige was also raised when he was given a single prominent scene as a commander of Roman centurions in Gabriel Pascal&#x27;s production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (also 1945), starring Vivien Leigh and Claude Rains. The film&#x27;s expense caused it to lose a large amount of money, despite its being highly successful at the box office, particularly in the U.S.

Rennie was now established as a leading actor. One report called him &quot;the bobbysoxers&#x27; dark idol... Gainsborough&#x27;s 1945 discovery.&quot; He was mobbed by female fans on a personal appearance tour.

Gainsborough teamed him with one of their biggest female stars, Phyllis Calvert, in the melodrama &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; (1947).

===Maurice Ostrer===
In July 1946 it was announced Rennie had signed a five-year contract with Maurice Ostrer&#x27;s new company, Premiere Productions, worth £300,000 – making him the highest paid film star in Britain. Rennie&#x27;s first film under a new contract was &quot;White Cradle Inn&quot; (1947), shot in Switzerland with Madeleine Carroll. Rennie had been &quot;loaned out&quot; to another company to make it but then he made his first film for Ostrer at Premiere, &quot;The Idol of Paris&quot; (1948). The film did so badly that Ostrer left the film industry.

Rennie made films for independent producers and his career momentum began to fade: &quot;Uneasy Terms&quot; (1948); &quot;Golden Madonna&quot; (1949) (again with Calvert); and two comedies for Val Guest: &quot;Miss Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Body Said No!&quot; (1950). He had what may be considered Rennie&#x27;s only role as one of two central characters in a fully-fledged love story in the 47-minute episode &quot;Sanatorium&quot;, the longest of the Somerset Maugham tales constituting the omnibus film &quot;Trio&quot; (1950); the 40-year-old Rennie and the 20-year-old Jean Simmons play patients and doomed lovers in the title institution, which caters to victims of tuberculosis.

==Hollywood career==
===20th Century Fox===
Rennie was one of several English actors cast in the 20th Century Fox medieval adventure story &quot;The Black Rose&quot; (1950), shot in England starring Tyrone Power and Orson Welles. Rennie was specifically cast as the 13th-century King Edward I, whose 6&#x27; 2&quot; (1.88 m) frame gave origin to his historical nickname &quot;Longshanks&quot;. He was fifth-billed after Cécile Aubry and Jack Hawkins. Rennie became good friends with Power, who spoke well of the actor to Fox executives.

Rennie&#x27;s performance impressed Fox&#x27;s studio head, Darryl F. Zanuck, who offered him a role in a film shot in Canada, &quot;The 13th Letter&quot; (1951). Directed by Otto Preminger, it was a remake of the French film &quot;Le Corbeau&quot; (&quot;The Raven&quot;, 1943), with the setting changed to the Canadian province of Quebec.

Fox was so pleased with Rennie&#x27;s work that it offered him a seven-year contract in November 1950.

===&quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;===

After Claude Rains turned down the role, Rennie received top billing in his next film, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (also 1951), the first postwar, large-budget, &quot;A&quot; science-fiction film. It was a serious, high-minded exploration of mid-20th century suspicion and paranoia, combined with a philosophical overview of humanity&#x27;s coming place in the larger universe. Rennie said director Robert Wise told him to do the role &quot;with dignity but not with superiority&quot;. (The story was later dramatised in 1954 on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, with Rennie and Billy Gray recreating their original film roles. Seven years later, on 3 March 1962, when &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; made its television premiere on NBC&#x27;s &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, Rennie appeared in a two-minute introductory prologue before the start of the film.)

Rennie went on to support Power in &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget You&quot; (1951) then had good roles in the ensemble drama &quot;Phone Call from a Stranger&quot; (1952) (where he played an American) and in the wartime spy thriller, &quot;5 Fingers&quot; (1952), as the agent who tracks down James Mason&#x27;s spy. He did some narration for &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; (1951) and would provide voiceovers for several Fox films, such as &quot;Pony Soldier&quot; (1952), &quot;Titanic&quot; (1953), &quot;The Desert Rats&quot; (1953) and &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954).

===&quot;Les Misérables&quot;===
Buoyed by the strong critical reception and profitability of &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, Fox assigned much of the credit to the central performance of Rennie. Convinced that it had a potential leading man under contract, the studio decided to produce a new version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1952) as a vehicle for him. The film was directed by Lewis Milestone, known for his early sound version of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. Rennie&#x27;s performance was respectfully, but not enthusiastically, received by the critics. Ultimately, &quot;Les Misérables&quot; returned an extremely modest profit and put an end to any further attempts to promote the 43-year-old Rennie as a potential star. This caused the studio to cancel a project he was attached to in 1952 — &quot;Arms of Venus&quot;.

He was, however, launched on a thriving career as a top supporting actor at Fox, often playing figures of authority, such as doctors or military officers.

===Supporting actor at Fox===
Rennie was second-billed in &quot;Sailor of the King&quot; (also known as &quot;Single-Handed&quot;, 1953), playing an admiral, as supporting actor to Jeffrey Hunter. He was leading man to Jeanne Crain in a thriller, &quot;Dangerous Crossing&quot; (1953), which re-used sets and props from &quot;Titanic&quot; (also 1953), for which Rennie spoke the closing narration. He had a showy role as Saint Peter in &quot;The Robe&quot; (1953), the first movie in CinemaScope and the biggest hit of the year. The star was Richard Burton, who had essentially taken Rennie&#x27;s place on the Fox lot as their &quot;resident British star&quot;.

Rennie supported Tyrone Power once more in &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; (1954), as a brigadier in British India, then he played his first villain for Fox, an evil Khan in the &quot;eastern&quot;, &quot;Princess of the Nile&quot; (1954), opposite Jeffrey Hunter. He reprised his role as Peter in &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; (1954) and was lent out for &quot;Mambo&quot; (1954).

In &quot;Désirée&quot; (1954), Rennie played the future Charles XIV John of Sweden opposite Marlon Brando as Napoleon Bonaparte. The film was popular although not as highly regarded as other Brando films from this time. &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; (1955), was another hit, with Rennie as the head of British police in Hong Kong supporting Clark Gable and Susan Hayward.

On TV he played the attorney in an adaptation of &quot;The Letter&quot; (1955) with John Mills. He also received good reviews for his performance as an art dealer in &quot;A Man of Taste&quot; (1955) for &quot;Climax&quot; with Zsa Zsa Gabor. Rennie enjoyed live TV. &quot;You have greater performances as opposed to those in a filmed series&quot;, he said. &quot;You are able to build and sustain a role in live TV whereas you have the problem of cutting, stopping and starting in a filmed show.&quot;

Based on the positive reaction to his two turns as the Apostle Peter, Fox assigned him another third-billed, top-tier role as a stalwart man of God, Franciscan friar Junípero Serra, who, between 1749 and his death in 1784, founded missions in Alta California. The film was &quot;Seven Cities of Gold&quot; (1955), with Richard Egan and Anthony Quinn.

His next film was &quot;The Rains of Ranchipur&quot; (1955), assigned him fifth billing after the lead romantic teaming of Lana Turner and Richard Burton. As Turner&#x27;s character&#x27;s cuckolded husband, Lord Esketh, Rennie maintained his typical dignity and stiff upper lip. He supported Ginger Rogers in &quot;Teenage Rebel&quot; (1956) and had a good role as the man murdered by James Mason in &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957), Darryl Zanuck&#x27;s popular melodrama. His contract with Fox then wound up.

==Post-20th Century-Fox==
Rennie began his freelancing career supporting Cornel Wilde in &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot; (1957) at Paramount. He returned to Britain to play the lead in a war film &quot;Battle of the V-1&quot; (1958). He was going to co-produce and star in a war film for Eros Films about bomb disposal experts, &quot;Getaway&quot;, but it was not made.

Scheduling conflicts meant he missed out on a role in &quot;The Vikings&quot; (1958), being replaced by James Donald.

He had top billing in a mountaineering film for Disney, &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot; (1959), although he was really the support for James MacArthur.

Irwin Allen gave him a leading part at Fox, casting him as adventurer Lord John Roxton in an adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960), a tale of a jungle expedition that finds prehistoric monsters in South America; the film also starred Claude Rains, Jill St. John and Richard Haydn. Then, no longer bound by the no-television clause in his studio contract, he began his association with the medium.

===&quot;The Third Man&quot; and &quot;Mary Mary&quot;===
Rennie became a familiar face on television, taking the role of Harry Lime in &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1959–65), an Anglo-American syndicated television series very loosely derived from the film. It ran for several years but the schedule meant Rennie had plenty of time off to work on other projects. &quot;Every scene of every show I do for money&quot;, he said.

At the start of the 1960s, Michael Rennie made his only Broadway appearance in &quot;Mary, Mary&quot; playing Dirk Winsten, a jaded film star. After two previews, the sophisticated five-character marital comedy written by Jean Kerr and directed by Joseph Anthony opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre on 8 March 1961. It ran for a very successful 1,572 performances, closing at the Morosco Theatre on 12 December 1964. Rennie stayed with the production less than five months and was replaced by Michael Wilding in July 1961.

When Warner Bros. cast the film version in early 1963, Rennie, along with leading man Barry Nelson and supporting actor Hiram Sherman (who joined the play two years after the opening in the part first played by John Cromwell), were the only Broadway cast members to carry over. Debbie Reynolds was given the title role created by Barbara Bel Geddes, and Warner&#x27;s contract player Diane McBain, whom the studio saw as a potential star of the future, took over &quot;the socialite part&quot; essayed by Betsy von Furstenberg. Mervyn LeRoy produced and directed the film, which opened at Radio City Music Hall on 25 October 1963.

Rennie was cast in a lead role in the comedy play &quot;Any Wednesday&quot; but left the project during out of town try outs. He was replaced by Don Porter and the play was a huge success.

==Later career==
During the 1960s, Rennie made guest appearances on such series as &quot;The Barbara Stanwyck Show&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot; (a portrayal of a doomed pilot in the two-part episode &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;); &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;; &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (one of four actors in four consecutive episodes substituting for series star Raymond Burr, who was recovering from surgery); &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (a 90-minute colour episode as an English big game hunter). He played in &quot;The Great Adventure,&quot; an anthology series about remarkable events in American history, he portrayed Confederate president Jefferson Davis. He played &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Sound of Wings&quot; and &quot;First in War, First in Peace&quot;; &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (another two-part episode). He played an all-powerful alien zookeeper in &quot;The Keeper.&quot; He worked one last time with his &quot;Third Man&quot; co-star Jonathan Harris; &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; as Captain Smith of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, in the series&#x27; premiere episode. He played in &quot;Batman&quot; (as the villainous Sandman, in league with Julie Newmar&#x27;s Catwoman). He was in three episodes of &quot;The Invaders&quot; (as a malign variation of the Klaatu persona, culminating in a parallel plot also involving an assembly of world leaders). He was in an episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; (&quot;Lana&quot;). He was in two episodes of &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;; and was a &quot;THRUSH&quot; agent in an episode of &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1967 TV series) (&quot;The Thrush Roulette Affair&quot;/Barnaby Partridge).

===Final films===
Rennie&#x27;s later films included &quot;Ride Beyond Vengeance&quot; (1966), &quot;Cyborg 2087&quot; (1967) and the all-star &quot;Hotel&quot; (1967).

He completed what amounted to guest roles in two films, &quot;The Power&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; as Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark (both 1968), before moving to Switzerland in the latter part of that year. His final seven feature films were filmed in Britain (&quot;Subterfuge&quot; (1968)), Italy (&quot;Death on the Run&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Young, the Evil and the Savage&quot; (1968)) and Spain (&quot;Giugno &#x27;44 – Sbarcheremo in Normandia&quot; AKA &quot;Seven into Hell&quot; (1968), &quot;The Battle of El Alamein&quot; (1969) as General Bernard Law Montgomery and &quot;Los Monstruos del Terror&quot;, also known as &quot;Dracula vs. Frankenstein&quot; (1970), then the Philippines (&quot;Surabaya Conspiracy&quot; AKA &quot;Stoney&quot; (1969)).

==Personal life==
Rennie was married twice: first to Joan England, from 1938 to 1945, then to actress Margaret (Maggie) McGrath from 1947 to 1960; their son, David Rennie, is an English circuit judge in Lewes, Sussex, England. Both marriages ended in divorce. During the divorce hearing with his second wife, she fainted on the stand during cross-examination. Rennie revealed he had been separated from her since November 1953. (Her mother had been murdered in 1954.)

He had a son, John Marshall, with his longtime friend and mistress, Renée (née Gilbert), whose later married name was Taylor. Renée was the sister of the British film director Lewis Gilbert. During the war years, they lived coincidentally in flats in the White House in Albany Street near Regent&#x27;s Park in London, (now a hotel). The White House was a favourite location to live during the war years. It was built in the shape of a white cross and was such a good navigation mark for the Luftwaffe that it was rumoured that there were standing orders to avoid bombing it, hence its popularity with celebrities and the wealthy.

Although Rennie offered to accept paternity on discovering the news of her pregnancy, Renée refused, as she was unwilling to jeopardise his growing success as a romantic lead in major feature films. However, Rennie kept a watchful eye on John Marshall over the years, even after his marriage to Maggie McGrath, and both families remained in constant touch until Rennie&#x27;s death. In fact Renée and Maggie lived for many years in the 1970s and 1980s within 200 yards of each other in Barnes and were close friends. Both Michael Rennie and his sister Bunny were very fond of Renée&#x27;s family. Coincidentally the British Film Institute&#x27;s database lists Rennie as also having a son, John M. Taylor, who is described as &quot;a producer.&quot; John Marshall Rennie used the pseudonym &quot;Taylor&quot; during his long career in the industry to avoid accusations of nepotism.

Michael Rennie was also briefly engaged to Mary Gardner, the former wife of Hollywood director Otto Preminger. In 1959, Preminger was divorcing Mary and claimed Rennie was having an affair with her.

In 1958, Rennie said he earned $117,000 a year which provided him with $36,000 net.
===Death===
Within three years of leaving Hollywood, he journeyed to his mother&#x27;s home in Harrogate, Yorkshire. It was there that he died on 10 June 1971. He was buried in Harlow Hill Cemetery in Harrogate. His death was attributed to &quot;natural causes&quot;.

<text>Brain is the industry standard name for a computer virus that was released in its first form on 19 January 1986, and is considered to be the first computer virus for the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) and compatibles.

== Description ==
Brain affects the PC by replacing the boot sector of a floppy disk with a copy of the virus. The real boot sector is moved to another sector and marked as bad. Infected disks usually have five kilobytes of bad sectors. The disk label is usually changed to ©Brain, and the following text can be seen in infected boot sectors:
:Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986 Amjads (pvt) Ltd VIRUS_SHOE RECORD V9.0 Dedicated to the dynamic memories of millions of viruses who are no longer with us today - Thanks GOODNESS!!! BEWARE OF THE er..VIRUS : this program is catching program follows after these ...$#@%$@!!
There are many minor and major variations to that version of the text. The virus slows down the floppy disk drive and makes seven kilobytes of memory unavailable to DOS. Brain was written by Amjad Farooq Alvi, who at the time lived in Chah Miran, near Lahore Railway Station, in Lahore, Pakistan. The Alvi brothers told &quot;Time&quot; magazine they had written it to protect their medical software from illegal copying, and it was supposed to target copyright infringement only. The cryptic message &quot;Welcome to the Dungeon&quot;, a safeguard and reference to an early programming forum on Dungeon BBS, appeared after a year because the brothers licensed a beta version of the code. The brothers could not be contacted to receive the final release of this version of the program.

Brain lacks code for dealing with hard disk partitioning, and avoids infecting hard disks by checking the most significant bit of the BIOS drive number being accessed. Brain does not infect the disk if the bit is set, unlike other viruses at the time, which paid no attention to disk partitioning and consequently destroyed data stored on hard disks by treating them in the same way as floppy disks. Brain often went undetected, partially due to this deliberate non-destructiveness, especially when the user paid little to no attention to the low speed of floppy disk access.

The virus came complete with address and three phone numbers, and a message that told the user that their machine was infected and to call them for inoculation:
:

This program was originally used to track a heart monitoring program for the IBM PC, and people were distributing illicit copies of the disks. This tracking program was supposed to stop and track illegal copies of the disk, however the program also sometimes used the last five kilobytes on an Apple floppy, making additional saves to the disk by other programs impossible.

== Author response ==
When the brothers began to receive a large number of phone calls from people in the United Kingdom, the United States, and elsewhere, demanding that they disinfect their machines, they were stunned and tried to explain to the outraged callers that their motivation had not been malicious. Their phone lines were overloaded. The brothers, with another brother, Shahid Farooq Alvi, continued business in Pakistan, as Brain NET Internet service providers with a company called Brain Telecommunication Limited.

In 2011, 25 years after Brain was released, Mikko Hyppönen of F-Secure went to Pakistan to interview Amjad for a documentary. Being inspired by this documentary and its widespread popularity, a group of Pakistani bloggers interviewed Amjad, under the banner of Bloggerine.

<doc id="175854" wikidata="Q230958" url="?curid=175854" title="Merle Oberon">
<text>Merle Oberon (born Estelle Merle O&#x27;Brien Thompson; 19 February 191123 November 1979) was a British actress. She gained recognition for portraying Anne Boleyn in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933) and saw further success with her role in &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934). She later travelled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn, including &quot;Folies Bergère de Paris&quot; (1935), &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (1935), &quot;These Three&quot; (1936), &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; (1938), and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939). Her performance as Kitty Vane in &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Oberon&#x27;s other notable roles included &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945), &quot;Berlin Express&quot; (1948), and &quot;Désirée&quot; (1954). A traffic collision in 1937 caused facial injuries that nearly ended her career, but she recovered and remained active in film and television until 1973.

==Early life==
Estelle Merle O&#x27;Brien Thompson was born in Bombay, British India, on 19 February 1911. She was given the nickname &quot;Queenie&quot; in honour of Queen Mary, who visited India along with King George V in 1911.

===Parentage===
For most of her life, Oberon concealed the truth about her parentage by claiming that she had been born in Tasmania, Australia, and that her birth records had been destroyed in a fire.

She was raised as the daughter of Arthur Terrence O&#x27;Brien Thompson, a Welsh mechanical engineer from Darlington who worked in Indian Railways, and his wife, Charlotte Selby (whose full name was Constance Charlotte Thompson, according to her 1937 obituary), a Burgher (&quot;part Māori&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vanityfair/last-tycoon&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) from British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Oberon&#x27;s birth certificate lists her biological mother as &quot;Constance Thompson&quot;, which could have referred to Charlotte Selby or her then-12-year-old daughter, Constance Selby. It is theorized that Constance became pregnant as a result of rape by her stepfather, Arthur Thompson, with Charlotte raising Oberon as Constance&#x27;s half-sister to avoid scandal. Charlotte herself had given birth to Constance at the age of 14 after being raped by Henry Alfred Selby, the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. In their 1983 biography of Oberon, Charles Higham and Roy Moseley also wrote that Selby had Māori ancestry, though the Iwi (Maori tribe) was not known.

Constance eventually married Alexander Soares and had four other children: Edna, Douglas, Harry, and Stanislaus (Stan). Edna and Douglas moved to the UK at an early age. Stanislaus, who lived in Surrey, British Columbia, was the only child to retain his father&#x27;s surname of Soares. Harry eventually moved to Toronto, Canada, retaining Charlotte’s maiden name, Selby. After locating Oberon&#x27;s birth certificate in Indian government records in Bombay, Harry attempted to visit her in Los Angeles, only for Oberon to refuse any meeting. Harry withheld the possibility of him being Oberon&#x27;s half-brother instead of her nephew from Oberon&#x27;s biographer, Charles Higham. He only disclosed the information to Maree Delofski, producer of the 2002 ABC Australia documentary &quot;The Trouble with Merle&quot;, which investigated the conflicting versions of Oberon&#x27;s origin.

===Youth===
In 1914, when Merle was 3, Arthur Thompson joined the British Army and later died of pneumonia on the Western Front during the Battle of the Somme. Merle and Charlotte led an impoverished existence in shabby flats in Bombay for a few years before moving in 1917 to Calcutta (now Kolkata). Oberon attended La Martinière Calcutta for Girls, one of the best private schools in Calcutta, as a charity student. There, she was constantly teased by the majority European students for her mixed ethnicity, which led her her to quit school and receive lessons at home.

Oberon first performed with the Calcutta Amateur Dramatic Society. She was also completely enamoured with films and enjoyed going out to nightclubs. Indian journalist Sunanda K. Datta-Ray said that Merle worked as a telephone operator in Calcutta under the name Queenie Thomson, and won a contest at Firpo&#x27;s Restaurant there, before the outset of her film career.

At Firpo&#x27;s in 1928, aged 18, Oberon met a former actor, Colonel Ben Finney, and dated him; however, when he saw Charlotte one night at her flat, he realized Oberon was of mixed ancestry and ended the relationship. However, Finney promised to introduce her to Rex Ingram of Victorine Studios (whom he had known through his relationship with the late Barbara La Marr), if she were prepared to travel to France, which she readily did. After packing all their belongings and moving to France, Oberon and her mother found that their supposed benefactor avoided them, although he had left a good word for Oberon with Ingram at the studios in Nice. Ingram appreciated Oberon&#x27;s exotic appearance and quickly hired her to be an extra in a party scene in a film named &quot;The Three Passions&quot;.

==Acting career==

===Early roles===
Oberon arrived in England for the first time in 1928, aged 17. She worked as a club hostess under the name Queenie O&#x27;Brien and played in minor and unbilled roles in various films. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t dance or sing or write or paint. The only possible opening seemed to be in some line in which I could use my face. This was, in fact, no better than a hundred other faces, but it did possess a fortunately photogenic quality,&quot; she told a journalist at &quot;Film Weekly&quot; in 1939. 
===Alexander Korda and British stardom===
Her film career received a major boost when director Alexander Korda took an interest and gave her a small but prominent role, under the name Merle Oberon, as Anne Boleyn in &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933) opposite Charles Laughton. The film became a major success and she was then given leading roles in other productions, starting with &quot;The Battle&quot; (1934) opposite Charles Boyer, and &quot;The Broken Melody&quot; (1934).

Oberon then made two more films for Korda: &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot; (1934) with Douglas Fairbanks was a disappointment but &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1934) with Leslie Howard, who became her lover for a while, was a huge hit.

===Hollywood and Sam Goldwyn===
Oberon&#x27;s career benefited from her relationship with, and later marriage to, Korda. He sold &quot;shares&quot; of her contract to producer Samuel Goldwyn and she moved to Hollywood. Her &quot;mother&quot; stayed behind in England. Oberon&#x27;s career there began with &quot;Folies Bergère de Paris&quot; (1935) with Maurice Chevalier.

Goldwyn put her in &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (1935), which earned her a sole Academy Award for Best Actress nomination, then &quot;These Three&quot; (1936) for William Wyler and &quot;Beloved Enemy&quot; (1936). The latter co-starred David Niven with whom Oberon had a serious romance, and according to one biographer even wanted to marry him, but he was not faithful to her.

She was selected to star in Korda&#x27;s 1937 film, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, as Messalina, but her injuries in a car crash resulted in the film being abandoned. While in England she co-starred against Laurence Olivier in the Korda comedy &quot;The Divorce of Lady X&quot; (1938).

Back in Hollywood, Oberon appeared opposite Gary Cooper in &quot;The Cowboy and the Lady&quot; (1938) and then played Cathy in the highly acclaimed film &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (opposite Laurence Olivier; 1939).

In England Oberon made &quot;Over the Moon&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Lion Has Wings&quot; (1940) for Korda.

According to &quot;Princess Merle&quot;, the biography written by Charles Higham with Roy Moseley, Oberon suffered damage to her complexion in 1940 from a combination of cosmetic poisoning and an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs. Alexander Korda sent her to a skin specialist in New York City, where she underwent several dermabrasion procedures. The results were only partially successful; her face had become noticeably pitted and indented unless concealed by makeup.

Oberon starred in &quot;Til We Meet Again&quot; (1940) and &quot;Affectionately Yours&quot; (1941) for Warner Bros, then &quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot; (1941) for Ernst Lubitsch. Korda financed &quot;Lydia&quot; (1941). None of these films was particularly successful at the box office. Oberon was one of many stars to make cameos in &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943) and &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943). She made &quot;First Comes Courage&quot; (1943) at Columbia and played the female lead in &quot;The Lodger&quot; (1944), a popular noir. Also admired was &quot;Dark Waters&quot; (1944).

Oberon had a big hit with &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945), in which she played the French writer George Sand. However she was in a series of unsuccessful films at Universal: &quot;This Love of Ours&quot; (1946), &quot;Night in Paradise&quot; (1946), and &quot;Temptation&quot; (1946). She made some films for RKO, &quot;Night Song&quot; (1948), and &quot;Berlin Express&quot; (1948).

===Later career===
In France, Oberon appeared in &quot;Pardon My French&quot; (1951) then she did &quot;24 Hours of a Woman&#x27;s Life&quot; (1952) in England and &quot;All Is Possible in Granada&quot; (1954). Back in Hollywood she played the Empress Joséphine in &quot;Désirée&quot; (1954) and had a cameo in &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954). She had the lead in a noir, &quot;The Price of Fear&quot; (1956).

Oberon came out of retirement sporadically to appear in films such as &quot;Of Love and Desire&quot; (1963) and &quot;Hotel&quot; (1967).

Her last movie was &quot;Interval&quot; (1973).

==Personal life==

Charlotte Selby, Oberon’s possible birth grandmother, raised Oberon as her daughter until her death in 1937. In 1949, Oberon commissioned paintings of Charlotte based on an old photograph (but depicting Charlotte with lighter skin), which hung in all her homes until Oberon&#x27;s own death in 1979.

===Relationships and marriages===
Oberon married director Alexander Korda in 1939. While married, she had a brief affair in 1941 with Richard Hillary, an RAF fighter pilot who had been badly burned in the Battle of Britain. They met while he was on a goodwill tour of the United States. He later wrote the best-selling autobiography, &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;. 

Oberon became Lady Korda when her husband was knighted in 1942 by King George VI for his contribution to the war effort. At the time, the couple was based at Hills House in Denham, England. She divorced him in 1945 to marry the American cinematographer Lucien Ballard. Ballard devised a special camera light for her, to obscure on film her facial scars suffered in the 1937 accident. The light became known as the &quot;Obie&quot;. She and Ballard divorced in 1949.

Oberon married Italian-born industrialist Bruno Pagliai in 1957, adopted two children with him and lived in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. While married to Pagliai, she had an affair with model Mike Edwards, who was 33 years her junior. In 1973, Oberon met then 36-year-old Dutch actor Robert Wolders while they filmed &quot;Interval&quot;. Oberon divorced Pagliai and married Wolders, who was 25 years her junior, in 1975.

===Disputed birthplace===
To avoid prejudice over her mixed background, Oberon created a &quot;cover story&quot; of being born and raised in Tasmania, Australia, and her birth records being destroyed in a fire. The story eventually unravelled after her death. Oberon is known to have been to Australia only twice. Her first visit was in 1965, on a film promotion. Another visit, to Hobart, was scheduled, but after journalists in Sydney pressed her for details of her early life, she became ill and shortly afterwards left for Mexico.

In 1978, the year before her death, she agreed to visit Hobart for a Lord Mayoral reception. The Lord Mayor of Hobart became aware shortly before the reception that there was no proof she had been born in Tasmania, but went ahead with the celebration to avoid embarrassment. Shortly after arriving at the reception, Oberon, to the disappointment of many, denied she had been born in Tasmania. She then excused herself claiming illness, and was unavailable to answer questions about her background. On the way to the reception, she had told her driver that as a child she was on a ship with her father, who became ill when it was passing Hobart. They were taken ashore so he could be treated, thereby spending some of her early years on the island. During her Hobart stay, she remained in her hotel, gave no other interviews, and did not visit the theatre named in her honour.

==Death==
Oberon retired after &quot;Interval&quot; and moved with Wolders to Malibu, California, where she died in 1979, aged 68, after suffering a stroke. Her body was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Tributes and legacy==
Despite hiding her mixed heritage throughout her career, Oberon is regarded by some as the first Asian nominee in the Best Actress category and the first Asian individual overall to ever receive an Oscar nomination. In 2023, discussion around Oberon&#x27;s nomination status resurfaced after Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh was nominated for and subsequently won the Best Actress award for her performance in &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;. News outlets such as &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; opted to describe Yeoh as &quot;the first self-identified Asian actress&quot; while making note of Oberon passing as white.

For her contributions to film, Oberon received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6274 Hollywood Boulevard, on February 8, 1960.

Michael Korda, nephew of Alexander Korda, published a roman à clef about Oberon after her death titled &quot;Queenie&quot; in 1985, which was adapted into a 1987 television miniseries starring Mia Sara, Kirk Douglas, Sarah Miles, Claire Bloom, Leigh Lawson, and Joss Ackland.

F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; was made into a television series with Jennifer Beals playing Margo Taft, a character created for the TV series and based on Oberon.

New Zealand author Witi Ihimaera used Oberon&#x27;s hidden South Asian and alleged Māori heritage as the inspiration for the novel &quot;White Lies&quot;, which was turned into the 2013 movie &quot;White Lies&quot;.

British author Lindsay Ashford, publishing under the pen name Lindsay Jayne Ashford, wrote the 2017 historical fiction novel &quot;Whisper of the Moon Moth&quot; based on Oberon. The novel is a fictionalised retelling of Oberon&#x27;s early life, rise to Hollywood stardom, and turbulent personal life.

<text>Karl Otto Lagerfeld (; 10 September 1933 – 19 February 2019) was a German fashion designer, photographer, and creative director.

Lagerfeld began his career in fashion in the 1950s, working for several top fashion houses including Balmain, Patou, and Chloé before joining Chanel in 1983. As the creative director of Chanel from 1983 until his death, he oversaw every aspect of the fashion house&#x27;s creative output, from designing collections to photographing advertising campaigns and arranging store displays. He was instrumental in revitalizing the Chanel brand, helping it regain its position as one of the top fashion houses in the world. He was also creative director of the Italian fur and leather goods fashion house Fendi, as well as his own eponymous fashion label. Throughout his career, he collaborated on numerous fashion, design, and art-related projects, and his photography was exhibited in galleries and collected in published volumes.

Lagerfeld was recognised for his signature white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high-starched detachable collars.

==Early life==
Karl Otto Lagerfeld was born in Hamburg on 10 September 1933 to Elisabeth (née Bahlmann) and Otto Lagerfeld. His father, coming from a family of wealthy wine-merchants, was a prosperous businessman and polyglot, speaking nine languages; his father owned an import company (Lagerfeld &amp; Co.) specialising in evaporated milk, leading him to work with the American dairy company Carnation. During his travels, his father was present during the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, escaping unharmed. A fluent speaker of Russian, his father had even attempted to gain citizenship into the country at the start of World War I, leading to an accusation of espionage and a three-year prison term in Vladivostok, eventually returning to Germany after the Russian Revolution in 1917. His maternal grandfather, Karl Bahlmann, was a local politician for the Catholic Centre Party. His family belonged to the Old Catholic Church. When Lagerfeld&#x27;s mother met his father, she was a lingerie saleswoman from Berlin. His parents married in 1930.

Lagerfeld was known to misrepresent his birth year, claiming to be younger than his actual age and misrepresenting his parents&#x27; background. For example, he claimed that he was born in 1938 to &quot;Elisabeth of Germany&quot; and Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt from Sweden. These claims have been conclusively proven to be false, as his father was from Hamburg and spent his entire life in Germany, with no Swedish connection. There is also no evidence his mother, Elisabeth Bahlmann, the daughter of a middle-class local politician, called herself &quot;Elisabeth of Germany&quot;. He was known to insist that no one knew his real birthdate. In an interview on French television in February 2009, Lagerfeld said he was &quot;born neither in 1933 nor 1938&quot;.

In April 2013, he finally declared he was born in 1935. A birth announcement was, however, published by his parents in 1933, and the baptismal register in Hamburg also lists him as born in that year, showing he was born on 10 September 1933. &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; published his baptismal records in 2008 and interviewed his teacher and a classmate, who both confirmed he actually was born in 1933. Later, his death record confirmed the same. Despite that, Karl Lagerfeld announced publicly he was celebrating his &quot;70th birthday&quot; on 10 September 2008, despite actually turning 75.

His older sister, Martha Christiane &quot;Christel&quot;, was born in 1931. Lagerfeld had an older half-sister, Theodora Dorothea &quot;Thea&quot;, from his father&#x27;s first marriage. His family name has been spelled both Lagerfeldt (with a &quot;t&quot;) and Lagerfeld. Like his father, he used the spelling Lagerfeld, considering it to &quot;sound more commercial&quot;.

His family was mainly shielded from the deprivations of World War II due to his father being a member of the Nazi party and his business interests in Germany through the firm Glücksklee-Milch GmbH.

As a child, he showed great interest in the visual arts, and former schoolmates recalled he was always making sketches &quot;no matter what we were doing in class&quot;. Lagerfeld told interviewers he learned much more by constantly visiting the Kunsthalle Hamburg museum than he ever did in school.

==Career==
===Early career, Chloé, and Fendi (1954–1982)===
In 1954, Lagerfeld submitted a dress design to the International Wool Secretariat&#x27;s design competition. His submitted entry presaged the chemise dresses which would be introduced by Givenchy and Balenciaga three years later. In 1955, Lagerfeld entered another IWS competition and won in the coat category. He also befriended another winner, Yves Saint Laurent, and was soon after hired by Pierre Balmain who was a judge for the competition. He worked as Balmain&#x27;s assistant, and later apprentice, for three years.

In 1957, Lagerfeld became the artistic director for Jean Patou. He left Jean Patou in 1962, to become a freelance designer, one of the first designers to do so. In the 1960s, he freelanced for brands including Charles Jourdan, Chloé, Krizia, Valentino, and for the Rome-based fashion house Tiziani. In 1965, he was hired by Fendi to modernize their fur line. The fashion editor of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Alexander Fury, wrote in 2015 that Lagerfeld&#x27;s designs for Fendi were innovative and proved groundbreaking within the industry. These included the introduction of less expensive furs such as rabbit and squirrel pelts into high fashion, and launching a ready-to-wear line. He also designed the brand&#x27;s double F logo. Lagerfeld remained with Fendi Rome until his death.

In 1966, Lagerfeld became a designer for Chloé working alongside Gaby Aghion, and in 1974 he became the sole designer for the brand. In the 1970s, Lagerfeld&#x27;s work for Chloé made him one of the most prominent designers in the world, often vying with Yves Saint Laurent for most influential. After a period in the early seventies when he toyed with styles from the 1930s, &#x27;40s, and &#x27;50s, in 1974 he contributed to the burgeoning Big Look or Soft Look by eliminating linings, padding, and even hemming from voluminous, thin-fabric garments, even from fur in his work for Fendi at the time, to enable an unencumbered, comfortable, layered style which would dominate the high fashion of the middle of the decade.

After refining this style and saying that to go back to linings and stiff structure would be regressive, he did a complete about-face in 1978 and joined other designers in showing the heavily constructed, huge-shouldered, more restrictive looks that would dominate the 1980s. He presented such an exaggerated retro 1940s–50s silhouette – immense shoulder pads; severe, stiffly constructed suits with padded lampshade peplums; padded busts and hips; impractically tight skirts; awkwardly high spike heels; hats; gloves; even boned corsets – that his work did not look out of place alongside similar retro fare from Thierry Mugler of the period.

During both these phases, his mid-seventies Soft Look phase and his late seventies-eighties big-shoulders phase, his love of the eighteenth century was frequently on display. For instance, his Fall 1977 collection, one of the most celebrated of the seventies Soft Look era, included lace trim, headwear, and thigh-high boots in styles from the 1700s, while his Fall 1979 collection, one of the most influential of the early years of the big-shoulder era, contained millinery that recalled Napoleonic bicornes, along with button-sided spats/leggings that looked somewhat like military accoutrements from the same period.

Lagerfeld continued producing outfits in the shoulder pads-tight skirts-stiletto heels direction into the eighties, joining other similar designers in shortening the skirts of the look even as high as mini length, though his hemlines could also range as low as the ankle. Alongside these styles, he also showed softer, more comfortable clothing, particularly in 1981–&#x27;82, when a brief revival of somewhat mid-seventies-looking long dirndl skirts and shawls appeared on runways and Lagerfeld touted the gossamer weightlessness he had perfected in the seventies, although he did like to place corsets and girdles over it by that time. The variety of lengths and trouser shapes he presented during this period kept him in line with modern women&#x27;s needs.

===International fame with Chanel (1982–2000)===

In the 1980s, Lagerfeld was hired by Chanel, which was considered a &quot;near-dead brand&quot; at the time since the death of designer Coco Chanel a decade prior. Taking over the couture there in 1983, Lagerfeld brought life back into the company, making it a huge success by revamping its ready-to-wear fashion line. Lagerfeld integrated the interlocked &quot;CC&quot; monogram of Coco Chanel into a style pattern for the House of Chanel.

Lagerfeld also changed the Chanel silhouette that had prevailed since the early 1960s, making it more eighties by padding the shoulder, shortening and tightening the skirt, raising the heel, and enlarging or miniaturizing the jewelry and purses, all controversial moves, especially the short skirts, as Mlle. Chanel had always disapproved of above-the-knee skirts. This new direction was actually initiated the year before Lagerfeld took the helm, 1982, when a design team led by Hervé Léger, a Lagerfeld protegé, operated at the house. Lagerfeld is suspected of having influenced Léger&#x27;s changes.

In 1984, a year after his start at Chanel, Lagerfeld began his own eponymous &quot;Karl Lagerfeld&quot; brand with a focus on ready-to-wear clothing. The brand was established to channel &quot;intellectual sexiness&quot;. Lagerfeld had signed an agreement with Bidermann Industries USA, giving them ownership and licensing rights to fashion labels he produced. Lagerfeld ended the agreement with Bidermann in 1989. That same year, Lagerfeld launched two Karl Lagerfeld brand menswear lines. The Lagerfeld label was then purchased by the Cora Revillon Group, which had previously reached an agreement to manufacture and market Karl Lagerfeld-branded products.

In 1992, Dunhill Holdings—part of the Vendôme Luxury Group—acquired the Karl Lagerfeld brand from Cora-Revillon for an estimated $30 million. The acquisition was part of the agreement the company made with Lagerfeld for him to return to designing for the fashion house Chloé. Vendôme retained ownership of the brand for five years, until 1997, when it sold the brand back to Lagerfeld for a &quot;symbolic one franc&quot;, following the end of his contract with Chloé. Lagerfeld stated that Vendôme &quot;had not hired the right people to manage it.&quot;

Lagerfeld flourished in the plethora of historical revivals of the eighties, from the shoulder-padded 1940s–50s revivals beginning in 1978 and continuing through the eighties, to the 1950s pouf skirts, 1860s crinolines, and hoops of the mid-eighties, now often showgirl-short. Lagerfeld participated in it all, for both his namesake line and Chanel. In 1986, he marked the move away from broad shoulders by removing pads from the shoulders and placing them visibly on the outside of the hips.

===Later career (2001–2019)===
====Fashion====

In December 2006, Lagerfeld announced the launch of a new collection for men and women dubbed K Karl Lagerfeld, which included fitted T-shirts and a wide range of jeans. In September 2010, the Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Lagerfeld with an award created for him, The Couture Council Fashion Visionary Award, at a benefit luncheon at Avery Fisher Hall, in New York City. In November 2010, Lagerfeld and Swedish crystal manufacturer Orrefors announced a collaboration to design a crystal art collection. The first collection was launched in spring 2011, called Orrefors by Karl Lagerfeld.

In 2012 Lagerfeld released his photo-book &quot;The Little Black Jacket&quot; which featured entertainers, models, and friends of his. In 2014, Palm Beach Modern Auctions announced that many of Lagerfeld&#x27;s early sketches for the House of Tiziani in Rome would be sold.

Because his designs changed depending on which fashion house he was working for, designers such as Anna Sui and Clare Waight Keller praised his &quot;chameleon-like versatility&quot;. In November 2015, Karl Lagerfeld was presented with the Outstanding Achievement Award at the British Fashion Awards. Anna Wintour, Editor in Chief of American &quot;Vogue&quot;, presented the award.

=====Collaborations=====
Karl Lagerfeld was well known for his collaborations with brands and individuals. Some of his notable collaborations during the 2000s and 2010s include the following:

*In 2002, Lagerfeld asked Renzo Rosso, the founder of Diesel, to collaborate with him on a special denim collection for the Lagerfeld Gallery brand. The collection, Lagerfeld Gallery by Diesel, was designed by Lagerfeld and produced by Diesel and then sold in highly limited editions at the Lagerfeld Galleries in Paris and Monaco and at the Diesel Denim Galleries in New York and Tokyo.
*In 2004, Lagerfeld designed a capsule collection for Swedish fashion chain H&amp;M, marking the first time a designer had collaborated with the brand. &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; wrote that the collaboration &quot;had a seismic effect on the entire fashion system: breaking down barriers between luxury and mass; democratizing design in a new way, and foreshadowing an era of rampant collaborations, drops and pop-up concepts.&quot;
*In 2010, Lagerfeld collaborated with Coca-Cola on a limited-edition collection of Coca-Cola Light bottles in France. Lagerfeld also shot an ad campaign for the company featuring Coco Rocha and Baptiste Giabiconi. The redesigned bottles featured a vivid pink cap and a black graphic of Lagerfeld&#x27;s silhouette. Coca-Cola released another set of Lagerfeld-designed bottles in 2011.
*In 2012, Lagerfeld collaborated with Japanese cosmetics brand Shu Uemura on a holiday makeup collection. Lagerfeld worked closely with the brand&#x27;s shu artistic director, Kakuyasu Uchiide, to develop the line.
*In 2014, Lagerfeld collaborated with Mattel on a &quot;Barbie Lagerfeld&quot; doll that included fingerless gloves and a tailored black jacket.
*In 2016, Lagerfeld collaborated with Faber-Castell on the &quot;Karlbox&quot;, a collection of fine artist tools.
*In 2017, Lagerfeld collaborated with the shoe brand Vans on a collection that included sneakers, jackets, hats, and backpacks. The next year he created a similar capsule collection for Puma. The line included Suede sneakers inspired by Lagerfeld&#x27;s personal style.
*Lagerfeld was a collector of Christofle silverware, and in 2018 he collaborated with the brand on a limited-edition cutlery set. Lagerfeld had previously collaborated on a collection of crystal glasses with Orrefors.

=====Awards=====
In September 2010, the Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Lagerfeld with an award created for him, The Couture Council Fashion Visionary Award, at a benefit luncheon at Avery Fisher Hall, in New York City.

In November 2015, Karl Lagerfeld was presented with the Outstanding Achievement Award at the British Fashion Awards. Anna Wintour, Editor in Chief of American &quot;Vogue&quot;, presented the award. In 2017 he received the John B. Fairchild Award from WWD.

=== Final collection ===
The final Chanel collection completed before his death had an Alpine theme of après-ski clothing. As Lagerfeld requested not to have any type of funeral, the show only included a moment of silence in his honor and chairs emblazoned with his image next to Coco Chanel with the saying &quot;the beat goes on&quot;. Although Lagerfeld shunned any emotional reactions around the idea of his death, some models could be seen crying on the runway, as well as audience members.

===Other media===
Lagerfeld took up photography in 1987 after being frustrated with images done for Chanel press kits. Chanel&#x27;s then-image director, Éric Pfrunder, encouraged Lagerfeld to redo them himself, and photography became one of the passions of Lagerfeld&#x27;s life outside of design. He went on to shoot commercial fashion campaigns, editorial shots for magazines like &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, as well as architectural and landscape work. &quot;I&#x27;m an illustrator with a camera&quot;, Lagerfeld told &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; at a 2010 exhibition of his work at the Maison européenne de la photographie.

In 1994, German publishing house Steidl published &quot;Off the Record&quot;, a collection of Lagerfeld&#x27;s photography. The publishing house went on to release dozens of collections of his work, including &quot;The Little Black Jacket&quot; in 2012, which featured 113 portraits of models and entertainers wearing the book&#x27;s eponymous article, and &quot;Karl Lagerfeld: Casa Malaparte&quot; in 2015, which documented the Italian Modernist architectural monument.

Lagerfeld and investments enterprise Dubai Infinity Holdings (DIH) signed a deal to design limited edition homes on the island of Isla Moda. A feature-length documentary film on the designer, &quot;Lagerfeld Confidential&quot;, was made by Rodolphe Marconi in 2007. Later that year, Lagerfeld assumed the role of the host of the fictional radio station K109 in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; and its DLCs &quot;The Lost &amp; Damned&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot;.

In 2008, he created a teddy bear in his likeness that was produced by Steiff in an edition of 2,500 that sold for $1,500. and has been immortalized in many forms, which include pins, shirts, dolls, and more. In 2009, Tra Tutti began selling Karl Lagermouse and Karl Lagerfelt, which are mini-Lagerfelds in the forms of mice and finger puppets, respectively. That same year, he had a guest voice role in the French animated film &quot;Totally Spies! The Movie&quot;.

In 1996, the Zürich-based Galerie Gmurzynska began exhibiting Lagerfeld&#x27;s photography. In 1999, Lagerfeld opened 7L, a bookshop in Paris that specializes in photography collections and visual arts books. In 2000, he launched a publishing imprint, Editions 7L, in collaboration with Steidl. The imprint released books on fashion and photography and also republished rare and out-of-print books. The 7L bookshop was reconceptualized after Lagerfeld&#x27;s death as a space for cultural events.

In 2010, the Maison Européenne de la Photographie assembled the largest-ever exhibit of Lagerfeld&#x27;s photography. The show featured selections from his commercial work for Chanel, his celebrity portraits for Vogue and other magazines, and his more abstract landscapes and architectural pieces, including a 2007 series titled &quot;Another Side of Versailles.&quot;

Later in life, Lagerfeld realized one of his boyhood ambitions by becoming a professional caricaturist; from 2013, his political cartoons were regularly published in the German newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;.

In 2013, he directed &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot;, a short film starring Keira Knightley as Coco Chanel and Clotilde Hesme as her aunt, Adrienne. In June 2016, it was announced that Lagerfeld would design the two residential lobbies of the Estates at Acqualina, a residential development in Miami&#x27;s Sunny Isles Beach.

In 2016, Palazzo Pitti hosted another exhibition of Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s photography that included portraits and photos from fashion shoots, all inspired by classical mythology.

In October 2018, Lagerfeld in collaboration with Carpenters Workshop Gallery launched an art collection of functional sculptures titled Architectures. Sculptures were made of Arabescato Fantastico, a rare vibrant white marble with dark gray veins and black Nero Marquina marble with milky veins. Inspired by antiquity and referred to as modern mythology the ensemble consists of gueridons, tables, lamps, consoles, fountains and mirrors.

In 2019, following the news of Lagerfeld&#x27;s death, Galerie Gmurzynska mounted a retrospective exhibition highlighting the past three decades of his work.

==Personal life==
Lagerfeld was recognized for his signature white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high, starched detachable collars.

He had an 18-year relationship with French aristocrat and socialite Jacques de Bascher (1951–1989), though Lagerfeld said that the relationship never was sexual. &quot;I infinitely loved that boy&quot;, Lagerfeld reportedly said of de Bascher, &quot;but I had no physical contact with him. Of course, I was seduced by his physical charm&quot;. de Bascher had an affair with the couturier Yves Saint Laurent; subsequently, Saint Laurent&#x27;s business partner and former lover Pierre Bergé accused Lagerfeld of being behind a gambit to destabilize the rival fashion house. de Bascher died of AIDS in 1989 while Lagerfeld stayed on a bed at his bedside in his hospital room during the final stages of his illness. After Lagerfeld&#x27;s death, tabloids reported that he was to be cremated and his ashes mixed with those of de Bascher, which Lagerfeld kept in an urn, or with those of his mother.

Lagerfeld lived in numerous homes over the years: an apartment in the Rue de l&#x27;Université in Paris, decorated in the Art Deco style (1970s); the 18th-century Chateau de Penhoët in Brittany, decorated in the Rococo style (1970s to 2000); an apartment in Monte Carlo decorated until 2000 in 1980s Memphis style (from the early 1980s); the Villa Jako in Blankenese in Hamburg, decorated in the Art Deco style (mid-1990s to 2000); the Villa La Vigie in France (the 1990s to 2000), a 17th-century mansion (&quot;hôtel particulier&quot;) in the Rue de l&#x27;Université in Paris, decorated in the Rococo and other styles (1980s to the 2000s); an apartment in Manhattan, although he never moved into or decorated it (2006 to 2012); the summer villa El Horria in Biarritz, decorated in the modern style (1990s–2006); and a house dating from the 1840s in Vermont (from the 2000s). From 2007, Lagerfeld owned an 1820s house in Paris in Quai Voltaire decorated in modern and Art Deco style.

A spread with pictures inside Lagerfeld&#x27;s apartments in Paris and Monaco was published in &quot;Vogue&quot;. He also revealed his vast collection of Suzanne Belperron&#x27;s pins and brooches. He used the color of one of her blue chalcedony rings as the starting point for the Chanel spring/summer 2012 collection.

Lagerfeld owned a red point Birman cat named Choupette, which, in June 2013, he indicated he would marry, if it were legal. According to reports, the designer included the feline in his will from 2015, and designated 1.5 million dollars for its care and maintenance.

===Weight loss===
Lagerfeld lost in 2001. He explained: &quot;I suddenly wanted to dress differently, to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane... But these fashions, modeled by very, very slim boys - and not men my age - required me to lose at least 40 kg. It took me exactly 13 months&quot;. The diet was created specially for him by Jean-Claude Houdret, which led to a book called &quot;The Karl Lagerfeld Diet&quot;. He promoted it on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and other television shows.

===Book collecting===
Lagerfeld was a passionate book collector and amassed one of the largest personal libraries in the world. According to the Rare Book Hub, he was quoted as saying: &quot;Today, I only collect books; there is no room left for something else. If you go to my house, I&#x27;ll have you walk around the books. I ended up with a library of 300,000. It&#x27;s a lot for an individual&quot;.

===Death, tributes, and retrospectives===
After health complications in January 2019, Lagerfeld was admitted to the American Hospital of Paris in Parisian suburb Neuilly-sur-Seine on 18 February. He died there the following morning from complications of prostate cancer. He requested no formal funeral, with plans for cremation and ashes spread at secret locations alongside his mother as well as his late partner, Jacques de Bascher.

Lagerfeld was memorialized on 20 June 2019 at the Grand Palais with &quot;Karl For Ever&quot;, a celebration of the designer&#x27;s life, which featured a career retrospective highlighting his tenures at Chloé, Fendi, and Chanel, along with his work for his eponymous Karl Lagerfeld brand. The 90-minute tribute was attended by 2,500 guests. Nearly 60 gigantic portraits were on view within the pavilion, which has hosted many Chanel runway collections. The ceremony also included readings and musical performances by Tilda Swinton, Cara Delevingne, Helen Mirren, Pharrell Williams, and Lang Lang. The production was staged by theater and opera director Robert Carsen.

The exhibition “Lagerfeld: The Chanel Shows” of Simon Procter was shown in London, Paris, Dubai, Boca Raton and Miami.

In February 2020 Eden Gallery honored Lagerfeld with an exhibition in which explored sculptures and paintings inspired by his work.

==== The White Shirt Project ====
In July 2019 the house of Karl Lagerfeld announced the development of &quot;The White Shirt Project&quot;. In homage to its eponymous founder, the project celebrated the late designer&#x27;s legacy with a collection of reimagined, iconic white shirts.

Lagerfeld once said: &quot;If you ask me what I&#x27;d most like to have invented in fashion, I&#x27;d say the white shirt. For me, the white shirt is the basis of everything. Everything else comes after.&quot;

The global project was curated by Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s then Style Advisor Carine Roitfeld and featured designs from Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss, Tommy Hilfiger, Diane Kruger, Takashi Murakami, Amber Valletta, and British street artist Endless, amongst others. A White Shirt tribute event at Paris Fashion Week featured Anna Wintour, Kaia Gerber, and Karlie Kloss.

Seven was Lagerfeld&#x27;s favorite number, and as such, seven of the final designs were replicated 77 times and sold for €777 each, with proceeds benefiting a French charity affiliated with Paris Descartes University.

==== Metropolitan Museum of Art 2023 Costume Institute Exhibition and Met Gala ====
The Metropolitan Museum of Art honored the designer with a retrospective of his work with Balmain, Patou, Chloe, Fendi, Chanel, and his eponymous line. The posthumous exhibition, &quot;Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty&quot; spanned Lagerfeld&#x27;s six-decade career and included more than 150 objects.

Chanel, Fendi, Condé Nast, and Lagerfeld&#x27;s own fashion brand provided support for the exhibition and the accompanying 2023 Met Gala. The 2023 fête was co-chaired by Michaela Coel, Penélope Cruz, Roger Federer, Dua Lipa, and Condé Nast Global Chief Content Officer, Anna Wintour. Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando designed the exhibit. Curator Andrew Bolton expounded on the exhibition&#x27;s inspiration in the April 2023 issue of &quot;Architectural Digest&quot;. Bolton explained that the tribute would focus largely on Lagerfeld&#x27;s design process, specifically his sketches, and would showcase both the literal lines of Lagerfeld&#x27;s drawings as well as the sartorial lines or silhouettes of his works.

== Controversies ==

There was much controversy from Lagerfeld&#x27;s use of a verse from the Quran in his spring 1994 couture collection for Chanel, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house. The controversy erupted after the 1994 couture show in Paris when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the government of Lagerfeld&#x27;s homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem.

Lagerfeld was a supporter of the use of fur in fashion, although he himself did not wear fur and hardly ate meat. In a BBC interview in 2009, he claimed that hunters &quot;make a living having learnt nothing else than hunting, killing those beasts who would kill us if they could&quot; and said: &quot;In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for shoes and clothes and even handbags, the discussion of fur is childish&quot;. Spokespersons for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) called Lagerfeld &quot;a fashion dinosaur who is as out of step as his furs are out of style&quot;, and &quot;particularly delusional with his kill-or-be-killed mentality. When was the last time a person&#x27;s life was threatened by a mink or rabbit?&quot; In 2001, he was the target of a pieing at a fashion premiere at Lincoln Center in New York City. However, the tofu pies hurled by animal rights activists in protest against his use of fur within his collections went astray, instead hitting Calvin Klein. A PETA spokesperson described the hit on Klein as &quot;friendly fire&quot;, calling Klein, who does not use fur, &quot;a great friend to the animals&quot; and Lagerfeld a &quot;designer dinosaur&quot;, who continues to use fur in his collections. In 2010, after Lagerfeld used fake fur in his 2010 Chanel collection, PETA&#x27;s website claimed: &quot;It&#x27;s the triumph of fake fur ... because fake fur changed so much and became so great now that you can hardly see a difference&quot;.

Lagerfeld in 2009 joined critics of supermodel Heidi Klum, following German designer Wolfgang Joop&#x27;s remarks about Klum, who had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. Joop described Klum as being &quot;no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust&quot;. Lagerfeld commented that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum, as she had never worked in Paris, and that she was insignificant in the world of high fashion, being &quot;more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion&quot;. He created an international furore on 9 February 2012, when he called the singer Adele &quot;a little too fat&quot;. Adele responded that she is like the majority of women, and she is very proud of that fact. Lagerfeld later caused another controversy, on 31 July 2012, when he criticised Pippa Middleton, the sister of Catherine, Princess of Wales, for her looks.

His caricature drawing &quot;Harvey Schweinstein&quot;, that shows film producer Harvey Weinstein as a pig, was criticised as antisemitic and dehumanizing. He sparked controversy by criticizing German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#x27;s immigration policy during the European migrant crisis by saying, &quot;You cannot kill millions of Jews and then take in millions of their worst enemies afterwards, even if there are decades [between the events]&quot;, and by accusing her to have thereby caused the rise of the party Alternative for Germany (AfD). In May 2018, during an interview with French newspaper &quot;Le Point&quot;, Lagerfeld mentioned that he was contemplating giving up his German citizenship due to the one million Muslim immigrants that had been accepted into Germany by Merkel, a decision to which he attributed the increase in neo-Nazism in the country.

In a 2019 interview with French magazine &quot;Numéro,&quot; Lagerfeld dismissed the #MeToo movement and stated, &quot;If you don&#x27;t want your pants pulled about, don&#x27;t become a model. Join a nunnery, there&#x27;ll always be a place for you in the convent&quot;. He also criticized newly instated regulations in photo studios and modeling agencies enacted to protect young models, stating that they were &quot;too much&quot; and as a designer, &quot;you can&#x27;t do anything&quot;. Lagerfeld also defended stylist Karl Templer, who was accused of sexual misconduct and stated that although he could not stand Harvey Weinstein, his distaste for him was of a professional nature.

Lagerfeld said in 2007 that his controversial persona was an act.

<text>John Edward McGee Jr. (born October 19, 1969) is an American television personality, writer and self-proclaimed psychic medium.

After writing his first book on the subject in 1998, Edward became a well-known (and controversial) figure in the United States with his shows broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel premiering in July 2000 along with broadcasting on We TV since May 2006.

==Biography==
Edward (born in Glen Cove, New York) is the only son of an Irish-American police officer and an Italian-American working mother. He was raised Roman Catholic and although he later stopped practicing, he stated that he has never stopped feeling connected to God and his Catholic roots. Edward was quoted saying, &quot;This is something that is driven by a belief in God. It&#x27;s the energy from that force that I think allows us to create &quot;this&quot; energy.&quot;

According to Edward, when he was 15 and &quot;a huge doubter&quot; (in psychic abilities), he was read by a New Jersey woman who convinced him that he could become a medium.

&quot;She told me things that there is no way she could have known. And the first part of the reading was that this was the path that I was supposed to be on and that I was supposed to be a teacher and help people and – I thought she was nuts.&quot;
Later, Edward worked as a phlebotomist while pursuing a degree in health care administration at Long Island University. He met his wife, Sandra McGee, when he was a student in a dance studio, and he became a ballroom dancing instructor. He and his wife have a son and a daughter; their second child, Olivia, is an actress.

==Television shows==
Edward published his first book, &quot;One Last Time&quot;, in 1998. His related appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; later in the year prompted enough phone calls to overload the show&#x27;s switchboard. The next year, Edward had a show of his own.

===&quot;Crossing Over with John Edward&quot;===
From 2001 to 2004, Edward was the producer and host of the show &quot;Crossing Over with John Edward&quot;, which has been syndicated and was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and on Living TV in the UK. In &quot;Crossing Over&quot;, Edward gave psychic readings to audience members.

====Show format====
Readings in &quot;Crossing Over&quot; involve Edward questioning audience members with what is presented as information being supposedly &quot;communicated&quot; by deceased friends and relatives. Edward says he receives images and clues from &quot;the other side&quot; which the audience must try to interpret. The audience is not supposed to supply Edward with any prior information about themselves, their family or whom they are trying to connect with &quot;on the other side&quot;, aside from questionnaires filled out prior to taping. Audience members respond to Edward&#x27;s statements and questions, adding any details they feel are appropriate. The show often employs a split screen, the view of a reading without sound on one half of the screen while on the other half the subjects of the reading are shown in a later interview as they discuss their experiences. A voiceover by Edward is also implemented at times, sharing further insights.

In other instances, Edward conducted private sessions away from the studio audience. The subjects of these segments later spoke in greater detail about the situation that led to their reading with Edward and the effect the reading had on their lives. Periodically, segments revisit people who have previously appeared on the show.

====9/11 special====
Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Edward began filming at least one special in which he met with some relatives of the victims, with the intention of communicating with those who were killed. According to Edward&#x27;s autobiography, he did not know that the producers had chosen the victims&#x27; families to appear on the show. The trade magazine &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; sent a story, &quot;&#x27;Psychic&#x27; Plans WTC Victims Show&quot;, on the daily subscription-fax sent to news media and TV station executives on October 25, 2001.

Steve Rosenberg, president of domestic television at Studios USA, the company that distributes Edward&#x27;s program, had tentatively scheduled the program(s) to be broadcast during the November sweeps period, but news of the taping sparked a national outcry. Both the Sci Fi Channel and the &quot;Crossing Over with John Edward&quot; production office were flooded with phone calls and e-mails, some expressing outrage at the exploitation of the national tragedy, others at what they perceived as extreme tastelessness in search of ratings. Rosenberg initially ignored the criticism, insisting the programming would go on as scheduled, but within hours he terminated his plans.

===&quot;John Edward Cross Country&quot;===
Edward&#x27;s next show, &quot;John Edward Cross Country&quot;, was broadcast on from March 2006 to late 2008. In each episode, after a reading, Edward is filmed visiting the person or people whose reading was televised, along with their families, to see how the experience had changed their lives.

During the first season of &quot;Cross Country&quot;, Edward traveled across the US, giving readings to large audiences in public venues. In subsequent seasons, the show has been broadcast from a set similar to that used for &quot;Crossing Over&quot;.

==International appearances==
Edward&#x27;s tours outside the US have included performances in Canada, Australia, the UK, and Ireland. In response to the announcement of his 2019 Australian tour, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published an article by Peter FitzSimons which called Edward a fraud.

==Veracity of abilities==
Critics of Edward assert that he performs the mentalist techniques of hot reading and cold reading, in which one respectively uses prior knowledge or a wide array of quick and sometimes general guesses to create the impression of psychic ability. Choosing the first reading from a two-hour tape of edited shows as a sample, illusionist and skeptic James Randi found that just 3 of 23 statements made by Edward were confirmed as correct by the audience member being read, and the three statements that were correct were also trivial and nondescript.

In October 2007, Edward appeared on &quot;Headline Prime&quot;, hosted by Glenn Beck. When asked if he would take &quot;the Amazing Randi&#x27;s&quot; challenge, Edward responded, &quot;It&#x27;s funny. I was on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; once, and they asked me the same question. And I made a joke [then], and I&#x27;ll say the same thing here: why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who&#x27;s got an adjective as a first name?&quot; Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.

In another incident, Edward was said to have used foreknowledge to hot read in an interview on the television show &quot;Dateline&quot;. James Underdown of the Independent Investigative Group (IIG) attended a &quot;Crossing Over&quot; show in November 2002 and said &quot;there were no indications of anyone I saw collecting information... none of his readings contained the kind of specific information that would raise an eyebrow of suspicion. ... John Edward was a bad cold reader. He, too, struggled to get hits, and in one attempt shot off nearly 40 guesses before finding any significant targets.&quot;

Underdown also claimed that Edward&#x27;s apparent accuracy on television may be inflated by the editing process. After watching the broadcast version of the show he had attended and recorded, Underdown attributed a great deal of Edward&#x27;s accuracy on television to editing and wrote, &quot;Edward&#x27;s editor fine-tuned many of the dead-ends out of a reading riddled with misses.&quot; In 2002, Edward said, &quot;People are in the studio for eight hours, and we have to edit the show for time, not content. We don&#x27;t try to hide the &#x27;misses&#x27;.&quot;
Edward has denied ever using hot or cold reading techniques.

In a 2019 segment of &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot;, Edward and other prominent TV psychics were featured. Several clips of Edward attempting cold reading and failing to get &quot;hits&quot; were included, as well as a clip of Edward telling an audience member, &quot;I can only tell you what they&#x27;re showing me, and if he&#x27;s calling your mother a bitch, I&#x27;m gonna pass that on.&quot; John Oliver criticized the predatory nature of the psychic industry, as well as the media for promoting psychics, because this convinces viewers that psychic powers are real, and so enables neighborhood psychics to prey on grieving families. Oliver said &quot;...when psychic abilities are presented as authentic, it emboldens a vast underworld of unscrupulous vultures, more than happy to make money by offering an open line to the afterlife, as well as many other bullshit services.&quot;

==Appearances in the media==
Edward has appeared or been mentioned in many television shows, including ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch,&quot; &quot;The Crier Report&quot;, &quot;Dateline&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, HBO&#x27;s &quot;America Undercover&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis &amp; Kelly&quot;, &quot;Maury&quot;, &quot;Oprah&quot;, &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot;, &quot;The 7pm Project&quot;, &quot;The Tony Danza Show&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Keeping up with the Kardashians&quot;, &quot;Kourtney and Kim Take New York&quot; and &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;. as well as in the &quot;Law and Order&quot; season 14 episode &quot;Compassion&quot;.

The adult animated TV series &quot;South Park&quot; featured Edward in the episode &quot;The Biggest Douche in the Universe&quot;. The series&#x27; co-creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, credit James Randi for Stan&#x27;s explanation of cold reading.

<text>A plasma display panel is a type of flat-panel display that uses small cells containing plasma: ionized gas that responds to electric fields. Plasma televisions were the first large (over 32 inches/81 cm diagonal) flat-panel displays to be released to the public.

Until about 2007, plasma displays were commonly used in large televisions. By 2013, they had lost nearly all market share due to competition from low-cost liquid crystal displays (LCD)s. Manufacturing of plasma displays for the United States retail market ended in 2014, and manufacturing for the Chinese market ended in 2016. Plasma displays are obsolete, having been superseded in most if not all aspects by OLED displays.

Competing display technologies include cathode-ray tube (CRT), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), CRT projectors, AMLCD, Digital Light Processing DLP, SED-tv, LED display, field emission display (FED), and quantum dot display (QLED).

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Kálmán Tihanyi, a Hungarian engineer, described a proposed flat-panel plasma display system in a 1936 paper.

The first practical plasma video display was co-invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign by Donald Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and graduate student Robert Willson for the PLATO computer system. The goal was to create a display that had inherent memory to reduce the cost of the terminals. The original neon orange monochrome Digivue display panels built by glass producer Owens-Illinois were very popular in the early 1970s because they were rugged and needed neither memory nor circuitry to refresh the images. A long period of sales decline occurred in the late 1970s because semiconductor memory made CRT displays cheaper than the $2500 USD PLATO plasma displays. Nevertheless, the plasma displays&#x27; relatively large screen size and 1 inch (25.4 mm) thickness made them suitable for high-profile placement in lobbies and stock exchanges.

Burroughs Corporation, a maker of adding machines and computers, developed the Panaplex display in the early 1970s. The Panaplex display, generically referred to as a gas-discharge or gas-plasma display, uses the same technology as later plasma video displays, but began life as a seven-segment display for use in adding machines. They became popular for their bright orange luminous look and found nearly ubiquitous use throughout the late 1970s and into the 1990s in cash registers, calculators, pinball machines, aircraft avionics such as radios, navigational instruments, and stormscopes; test equipment such as frequency counters and multimeters; and generally anything that previously used nixie tube or numitron displays with a high digit-count. These displays were eventually replaced by LEDs because of their low current-draw and module-flexibility, but are still found in some applications where their high brightness is desired, such as pinball machines and avionics.

=== 1980s ===
In 1983, IBM introduced a orange-on-black monochrome display (Model 3290 Information Panel) which was able to show up to four simultaneous IBM 3270 terminal sessions. By the end of the decade, orange monochrome plasma displays were used in a number of high-end AC-powered portable computers, such as the Ericsson Portable PC (the first use of such a display in 1985), the Compaq Portable 386 (1987) and the IBM P75 (1990). Plasma displays had a better contrast ratio, viewability angle, and less motion blur than the LCDs that were available at the time, and were used until the introduction of active-matrix color LCD displays in 1992.

Due to heavy competition from monochrome LCDs used in laptops and the high costs of plasma display technology, in 1987 IBM planned to shut down its factory in Kingston, New York, the largest plasma plant in the world, in favor of manufacturing mainframe computers, which would have left development to Japanese companies. Dr. Larry F. Weber, a University of Illinois ECE PhD (in plasma display research) and staff scientist working at CERL (home of the PLATO System), co-founded Plasmaco with Stephen Globus and IBM plant manager James Kehoe, and bought the plant from IBM for US$50,000. Weber stayed in Urbana as CTO until 1990, then moved to upstate New York to work at Plasmaco.

=== 1990s ===

In 1992, Fujitsu introduced the world&#x27;s first full-color display. It was based on technology created at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories.

In 1994, Weber demonstrated a color plasma display at an industry convention in San Jose. Panasonic Corporation began a joint development project with Plasmaco, which led in 1996 to the purchase of Plasmaco, its color AC technology, and its American factory for US$26 million.

In 1995, Fujitsu introduced the first plasma display panel; it had 852×480 resolution and was progressively scanned. Two years later, Philips introduced at CES and CeBIT the first large commercially available flat-panel TV, using the Fujitsu panels. Philips had plans to sell it for 70,000 french francs. It was released as the Philips 42PW9962. It was available at four Sears locations in the US for $14,999, including in-home installation. Pioneer and Fujitsu also began selling plasma televisions that year, and other manufacturers followed. By the year 2000 prices had dropped to $10,000.

=== 2000s ===
In the year 2000, the first 60-inch (152-cm) plasma display was developed by Plasmaco. Panasonic was also reported to have developed a process to make plasma displays using ordinary window glass instead of the much more expensive &quot;high strain point&quot; glass. High strain point glass is made similarly to conventional float glass, but it is more heat resistant, deforming at higher temperatures. High strain point glass is normally necessary because plasma displays have to be baked during manufacture to dry the rare-earth phosphors after they are applied to the display. However, high strain point glass may be less scratch resistant.

Until the early 2000s, plasma displays were the most popular choice for HDTV flat-panel display as they had many benefits over LCDs. Beyond plasma&#x27;s deeper blacks, increased contrast, faster response time, greater color spectrum, and wider viewing angle; they were also much bigger than LCDs, and it was believed that LCDs were suited only to smaller sized televisions. Plasma had overtaken rear-projection systems in 2005.

However, improvements in LCD fabrication narrowed the technological gap. The increased size, lower weight, falling prices, and often lower electrical power consumption of LCDs made them competitive with plasma television sets. In 2006, LCD prices started to fall rapidly and their screen sizes increased, although plasma televisions maintained a slight edge in picture quality and a price advantage for sets at the critical 42&quot; size and larger. By late 2006, several vendors were offering 42&quot; LCDs, albeit at a premium price, encroaching upon plasma&#x27;s only stronghold. More decisively, LCDs offered higher resolutions and true 1080p support, while plasmas were stuck at 720p, which made up for the price difference.

In late 2006, analysts noted that LCDs had overtaken plasmas, particularly in the and above segment where plasma had previously gained market share. Another industry trend was the consolidation of plasma display manufacturers, with around 50 brands available but only five manufacturers. In the first quarter of 2008, a comparison of worldwide TV sales broke down to 22.1 million for direct-view CRT, 21.1 million for LCD, 2.8 million for plasma, and 0.1 million for rear projection.

When the sales figures for the 2007 Christmas season were finally tallied, analysts were surprised to find that not only had LCD outsold plasma, but CRTs as well, during the same period. This development drove competing large-screen systems from the market almost overnight. The February 2009 announcement that Pioneer Electronics was ending production of plasma screens was widely considered the tipping point in the technology&#x27;s history as well.

Screen sizes have increased since the introduction of plasma displays. The largest plasma video display in the world at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, was a unit manufactured by Matsushita Electric Industrial (Panasonic) standing tall by wide.

=== 2010s ===

At the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Panasonic introduced their 152&quot; 2160p 3D plasma. In 2010, Panasonic shipped 19.1 million plasma TV panels.

In 2010, the shipments of plasma TVs reached 18.2 million units globally. Since that time, shipments of plasma TVs have declined substantially. This decline has been attributed to the competition from liquid crystal (LCD) televisions, whose prices have fallen more rapidly than those of the plasma TVs. In late 2013, Panasonic announced that they would stop producing plasma TVs from March 2014 onwards. In 2014, LG and Samsung discontinued plasma TV production as well, effectively killing the technology, probably because of lowering demand.

== Design ==

A panel of a plasma display typically comprises millions of tiny compartments in between two panels of glass. These compartments, or &quot;bulbs&quot; or &quot;cells&quot;, hold a mixture of noble gases and a minuscule amount of another gas (e.g., mercury vapor). Just as in the fluorescent lamps over an office desk, when a high voltage is applied across the cell, the gas in the cells forms a plasma. With flow of electricity (electrons), some of the electrons strike mercury particles as the electrons move through the plasma, momentarily increasing the energy level of the atom until the excess energy is shed. Mercury sheds the energy as ultraviolet (UV) photons. The UV photons then strike phosphor that is painted on the inside of the cell. When the UV photon strikes a phosphor molecule, it momentarily raises the energy level of an outer orbit electron in the phosphor molecule, moving the electron from a stable to an unstable state; the electron then sheds the excess energy as a photon at a lower energy level than UV light; the lower energy photons are mostly in the infrared range but about 40% are in the visible light range. Thus the input energy is converted to mostly infrared but also as visible light. The screen heats up to between during operation. Depending on the phosphors used, different colors of visible light can be achieved. Each pixel in a plasma display is made up of three cells comprising the primary colors of visible light. Varying the voltage of the signals to the cells thus allows different perceived colors.

The long electrodes are stripes of electrically conducting material that also lies between the glass plates in front of and behind the cells. The &quot;address electrodes&quot; sit behind the cells, along the rear glass plate, and can be opaque. The transparent display electrodes are mounted in front of the cell, along the front glass plate. As can be seen in the illustration, the electrodes are covered by an insulating protective layer. A magnesium oxide layer may be present to protect the dielectric layer and to emit secondary electrons.

Control circuitry charges the electrodes that cross paths at a cell, creating a voltage difference between front and back. Some of the atoms in the gas of a cell then lose electrons and become ionized, which creates an electrically conducting plasma of atoms, free electrons, and ions. The collisions of the flowing electrons in the plasma with the inert gas atoms leads to light emission; such light-emitting plasmas are known as glow discharges.

In a monochrome plasma panel, the gas is mostly neon, and the color is the characteristic orange of a neon-filled lamp (or sign). Once a glow discharge has been initiated in a cell, it can be maintained by applying a low-level voltage between all the horizontal and vertical electrodes–even after the ionizing voltage is removed. To erase a cell all voltage is removed from a pair of electrodes. This type of panel has inherent memory. A small amount of nitrogen is added to the neon to increase hysteresis and thus help with the memory effect. Plasma panels may be built without nitrogen gas, using xenon, neon, argon, and helium instead with mercury being used in some early displays. In color panels, the back of each cell is coated with a phosphor. The ultraviolet photons emitted by the plasma excite these phosphors, which give off visible light with colors determined by the phosphor materials. This aspect is comparable to fluorescent lamps and to the neon signs that use colored phosphors.

Every pixel is made up of three separate subpixel cells, each with different colored phosphors. One subpixel has a red light phosphor, one subpixel has a green light phosphor and one subpixel has a blue light phosphor. These colors blend together to create the overall color of the pixel, the same as a triad of a shadow mask CRT or color LCD. Plasma panels use pulse-width modulation (PWM) to control brightness: by varying the pulses of current flowing through the different cells thousands of times per second, the control system can increase or decrease the intensity of each subpixel color to create billions of different combinations of red, green and blue. In this way, the control system can produce most of the visible colors. Plasma displays use the same phosphors as CRTs, which accounts for the extremely accurate color reproduction when viewing television or computer video images (which use an RGB color system designed for CRT displays).

To produce light, the cells need to be driven at a relatively high voltage (~300 volts) and the pressure of the gases inside the cell needs to be low (~500 torr).

Plasma displays have a wide color gamut and can be produced in fairly large sizes—up to diagonally. They had a very low luminance &quot;dark-room&quot; black level compared with the lighter grey of the unilluminated parts of an LCD screen. (As plasma panels are locally lit and do not require a back light, blacks are blacker on plasma and grayer on LCDs.) LED-backlit LCD televisions have been developed to reduce this distinction. The display panel itself is about thick, generally allowing the device&#x27;s total thickness (including electronics) to be less than . Power consumption varies greatly with picture content, with bright scenes drawing significantly more power than darker ones – this is also true for CRTs as well as modern LCDs where LED backlight brightness is adjusted dynamically. The plasma that illuminates the screen can reach a temperature of at least . Typical power consumption is 400 watts for a screen. Most screens are set to &quot;vivid&quot; mode by default in the factory (which maximizes the brightness and raises the contrast so the image on the screen looks good under the extremely bright lights that are common in big box stores), which draws at least twice the power (around 500–700 watts) of a &quot;home&quot; setting of less extreme brightness. The lifetime of the latest generation of plasma displays is estimated at 100,000 hours (11 years) of actual display time, or 27 years at 10 hours per day. This is the estimated time over which maximum picture brightness degrades to half the original value.

Plasma screens are made out of glass, which may result in glare on the screen from nearby light sources. Plasma display panels cannot be economically manufactured in screen sizes smaller than . Although a few companies have been able to make plasma enhanced-definition televisions (EDTV) this small, even fewer have made 32-inch (81-cm) plasma HDTVs. With the trend toward large-screen television technology, the 32-inch (81-cm) screen size was rapidly disappearing by mid-2009. Though considered bulky and thick compared with their LCD counterparts, some sets such as Panasonic&#x27;s Z1 and Samsung&#x27;s B860 series are as slim as thick making them comparable to LCDs in this respect. Plasma displays are generally heavier than LCD and may require more careful handling, such as being kept upright.

Plasma displays use more electrical power, on average, than an LCD TV using a LED backlight. Older CCFL backlights for LCD panels used quite a bit more power, and older plasma TVs used quite a bit more power than recent models.

Plasma displays do not work as well at high altitudes above due to pressure differential between the gases inside the screen and the air pressure at altitude. It may cause a buzzing noise. Manufacturers rate their screens to indicate the altitude parameters.

For those who wish to listen to AM radio, or are amateur radio operators (hams) or shortwave listeners (SWL), the radio frequency interference (RFI) from these devices can be irritating or disabling.

In their heyday, they were less expensive for the buyer per square inch than LCD, particularly when considering equivalent performance.

Plasma displays have wider viewing angles than those of LCD; images do not suffer from degradation at less than straight ahead angles like LCDs. LCDs using IPS technology have the widest angles, but they do not equal the range of plasma primarily due to &quot;IPS glow&quot;, a generally whitish haze that appears due to the nature of the IPS pixel design.

Plasma displays have less visible motion blur, thanks in large part to very high refresh rates and a faster response time, contributing to superior performance when displaying content with significant amounts of rapid motion such as auto racing, hockey, baseball, etc.

Plasma displays have superior uniformity to LCD panel backlights, which nearly always produce uneven brightness levels, although this is not always noticeable. High-end computer monitors have technologies to try to compensate for the uniformity problem.

=== Contrast ratio ===

Contrast ratio is the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of an image, measured in discrete steps, at any given moment. Generally, the higher the contrast ratio, the more realistic the image is (though the &quot;realism&quot; of an image depends on many factors including color accuracy, luminance linearity, and spatial linearity). Contrast ratios for plasma displays are often advertised as high as 5,000,000:1. On the surface, this is a significant advantage of plasma over most other current display technologies, a notable exception being organic light-emitting diode. Although there are no industry-wide guidelines for reporting contrast ratio, most manufacturers follow either the ANSI standard or perform a full-on-full-off test. The ANSI standard uses a checkered test pattern whereby the darkest blacks and the lightest whites are simultaneously measured, yielding the most accurate &quot;real-world&quot; ratings. In contrast, a full-on-full-off test measures the ratio using a pure black screen and a pure white screen, which gives higher values but does not represent a typical viewing scenario. Some displays, using many different technologies, have some &quot;leakage&quot; of light, through either optical or electronic means, from lit pixels to adjacent pixels so that dark pixels that are near bright ones appear less dark than they do during a full-off display. Manufacturers can further artificially improve the reported contrast ratio by increasing the contrast and brightness settings to achieve the highest test values. However, a contrast ratio generated by this method is misleading, as content would be essentially unwatchable at such settings.

Each cell on a plasma display must be precharged before it is lit, otherwise the cell would not respond quickly enough. Precharging normally increases power consumption, so energy recovery mechanisms may be in place to avoid an increase in power consumption. This precharging means the cells cannot achieve a true black, whereas an LED backlit LCD panel can actually turn off parts of the backlight, in &quot;spots&quot; or &quot;patches&quot; (this technique, however, does not prevent the large accumulated passive light of adjacent lamps, and the reflection media, from returning values from within the panel). Some manufacturers have reduced the precharge and the associated background glow, to the point where black levels on modern plasmas are starting to become close to some high-end CRTs Sony and Mitsubishi produced ten years before the comparable plasma displays. With an LCD, black pixels are generated by a light polarization method; many panels are unable to completely block the underlying backlight. More recent LCD panels using LED illumination can automatically reduce the backlighting on darker scenes, though this method cannot be used in high-contrast scenes, leaving some light showing from black parts of an image with bright parts, such as (at the extreme) a solid black screen with one fine intense bright line. This is called a &quot;halo&quot; effect which has been minimized on newer LED-backlit LCDs with local dimming. Edgelit models cannot compete with this as the light is reflected via a light guide to distribute the light behind the panel.

Plasma displays are capable of producing deeper blacks than LCD allowing for a superior contrast ratio.

Earlier generation displays (circa 2006 and prior) had phosphors that lost luminosity over time, resulting in gradual decline of absolute image brightness. Newer models have advertised lifespans exceeding 100,000 hours (11 years), far longer than older CRTs.

=== Screen burn-in ===

Image burn-in occurs on CRTs and plasma panels when the same picture is displayed for long periods. This causes the phosphors to overheat, losing some of their luminosity and producing a &quot;shadow&quot; image that is visible with the power off. Burn-in is especially a problem on plasma panels because they run hotter than CRTs. Early plasma televisions were plagued by burn-in, making it impossible to use video games or anything else that displayed static images.

Plasma displays also exhibit another image retention issue which is sometimes confused with screen burn-in damage. In this mode, when a group of pixels are run at high brightness (when displaying white, for example) for an extended period, a charge build-up in the pixel structure occurs and a ghost image can be seen. However, unlike burn-in, this charge build-up is transient and self-corrects after the image condition that caused the effect has been removed and a long enough period has passed (with the display either off or on).

Plasma manufacturers have tried various ways of reducing burn-in such as using gray pillarboxes, pixel orbiters and image washing routines. Recent models have a pixel orbiter that moves the entire picture slower than is noticeable to the human eye, which reduces the effect of burn-in but does not prevent it. None to date have eliminated the problem and all plasma manufacturers continue to exclude burn-in from their warranties.

=== Screen resolution ===
Fixed-pixel displays such as plasma TVs scale the video image of each incoming signal to the native resolution of the display panel. The most common native resolutions for plasma display panels are 852×480 (EDTV), 1,366×768 and 1920×1080 (HDTV). As a result, picture quality varies depending on the performance of the video scaling processor and the upscaling and downscaling algorithms used by each display manufacturer.

Early plasma televisions were enhanced-definition (ED) with a native resolution of 840×480 (discontinued) or 852×480 and down-scaled their incoming high-definition video signals to match their native display resolutions.

The following ED resolutions were common prior to the introduction of HD displays, but have long been phased out in favor of HD displays, as well as because the overall pixel count in ED displays is lower than the pixel count on SD PAL displays (852×480 vs 720×576, respectively).

* 840×480p
* 852×480p

Early high-definition (HD) plasma displays had a resolution of 1024x1024 and were alternate lighting of surfaces (ALiS) panels made by Fujitsu and Hitachi. These were interlaced displays, with non-square pixels.

Later HDTV plasma televisions usually have a resolution of 1,024×768 found on many 42-inch (107-cm) plasma screens, 1280×768 and 1,366×768 found on 50 in, 60 in, and 65 in plasma screens, or 1920×1080 found on plasma screen sizes from 42 to 103 inches (107-262 cm). These displays are usually progressive displays, with non-square pixels, and will up-scale and de-interlace their incoming standard-definition signals to match their native display resolutions. 1024×768 resolution requires that 720p content be downscaled in one direction and upscaled in the other.

<doc id="175863" wikidata="Q160448" url="?curid=175863" title="László Moholy-Nagy">
<text>László Moholy-Nagy (; ; born László Weisz; July 20, 1895 – November 24, 1946) was a Hungarian painter and photographer as well as a professor in the Bauhaus school. He was highly influenced by constructivism and a strong advocate of the integration of technology and industry into the arts. The art critic Peter Schjeldahl called him &quot;relentlessly experimental&quot; because of his pioneering work in painting, drawing, photography, collage, sculpture, film, theater, and writing.

He also worked collaboratively with other artists, including his first wife Lucia Moholy, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Herbert Bayer. His largest accomplishment may be the Institute of Design in Chicago, which survives today as part of the Illinois Institute of Technology, and art historian Elizabeth Siegel called &quot;his overarching work of art&quot;. He also wrote books and articles advocating a utopian type of high modernism.

==Early life and education (1895–1922)==
Moholy-Nagy was born László Weisz in Bácsborsód (Hungary) to a Jewish family. His mother&#x27;s second cousin was the conductor Sir Georg Solti. László was the middle child of three surviving sons, but the family was soon abandoned by the father, Lipót Weisz.

The remainder of the family took protection and support from the maternal uncle, Gusztáv Nagy. The uncle was a lawyer, and sponsored the education of László and his younger brother, Ákos. In turn, Moholy-Nagy took the Magyar surname of his mentor. Later, he added &quot;Moholy&quot; to his surname, after the name of the town of Mohol (now part of Serbia) where he spent part of his boyhood in the family home nearby.

Moholy-Nagy attended a gymnasium school in the city of Szeged, which was the second-largest city in the country. Initially he wanted to become a writer or poet, and in 1911 some of his poems were published in local daily newspapers. Starting in 1913, he studied law at the University of Budapest.

In 1915 during World War I, he enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian army as an artillery officer. In service, he also made crayon sketches, watercolors, and writings to document his wartime experiences. He was injured on the Russian Front during the Kerensky offensive of July 1917, and convalesced in Budapest. While on leave and during convalescence, Moholy-Nagy became involved first with the journal &quot;Jelenkor&quot; (&quot;The Present Age&quot;), edited by Hevesy, and then with the &quot;Activist&quot; circle around Lajos Kassák&#x27;s journal &quot;Ma&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;).

After his discharge from the military in October 1918, Moholy-Nagy abandoned his law studies and attended the private art school of the Hungarian Fauve artist Róbert Berény. In 1918, he formally converted to the Hungarian Reformed Church; his godfather was his Roman Catholic university friend, the art critic Iván Hevesy. He was a supporter of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, declared early in 1919, though he assumed no official role in it.

After the defeat of the Communist regime in August, he withdrew to Szeged. An exhibition of his work was held there, before he left for Vienna around November 1919.

Moholy-Nagy moved to Berlin early in 1920, where he met photographer and writer Lucia Schulz; they married the next year.

In 1922, at a joint exhibition with fellow Hungarian Peter Laszlo Peri at &quot;Der Sturm&quot;, he met Walter Gropius. That summer, he vacationed on the Rhone with Lucia, who introduced him to making photograms on light-sensitized paper. He also began sketching ideas for what would become his most well-known sculpture, the &quot;Light-Space Modulator&quot;.

==Bauhaus years (1923–1928)==

In 1923, Moholy-Nagy was invited by Walter Gropius to teach at the Bauhaus in Weimar, Germany. He took over Johannes Itten&#x27;s role co-teaching the Bauhaus foundation course with Josef Albers, and also replaced Paul Klee as Head of the Metal Workshop. This effectively marked the end of the school&#x27;s expressionistic leanings and moved it closer towards its original aims as a school of design and industrial integration. The Bauhaus became known for the versatility of its artists, and Moholy-Nagy was no exception. Throughout his career, he became proficient and innovative in the fields of photography, typography, sculpture, painting, printmaking, film-making, and industrial design.

One of his main focuses was photography; starting in 1922, he had been initially guided by the technical expertise of his first wife and collaborator Lucia Moholy. In his books &quot;Malerei, Photographie, Film&quot; (1925) and &quot;The New Vision, from Material to Architecture&quot; (1932), he coined the term Neues Sehen (New Vision) for his belief that the camera could create a whole new way of seeing the outside world that the human eye could not. This theory encapsulated his approach to his art and teaching.

Moholy-Nagy was the first interwar artist to suggest the use of scientific equipment such as the telescope, microscope, and radiography in the making of art. With Lucia, he experimented with the photogram; the process of exposing light-sensitive paper with objects laid upon it. His teaching practice covered a diverse range of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, photomontage, and metalworking.

==Depression era (1929–1937)==

Moholy-Nagy left the Bauhaus in 1928 and established his own design studio in Berlin. Marianne Brandt took over his role as Head of the Metal Workshop. He separated from his first wife Lucia in 1929.

An iconic achievement was Moholy-Nagy&#x27;s construction of the &quot;Lichtrequisit einer elektrischen Bühne&quot; (Light Prop for an Electric Stage) (1928–1930), a device with moving parts designed to have light projected through it to create shifting light reflections and shadows on nearby surfaces. It was made with the help of the Hungarian architect Istvan Seboek for the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition held in Paris during the summer of 1930; it was later dubbed the &quot;Light-Space Modulator&quot; and was seen as a pioneer achievement of kinetic sculpture using industrial materials like reflective metals and Plexiglas. Given his interest in the light patterns it produced more than its appearance when viewed directly, it might more accurately be seen as one of the earliest examples of Light art. This was a form that he continued to develop in the 1940s in the United States, in &quot;Space Modulator&quot; (1939–1945)&quot;, Papmac&quot; (1943), and &quot;B-10 Space Modulator&quot; (1942).

Moholy-Nagy was photography editor of the Dutch avant-garde magazine &quot;International Revue i 10&quot; from 1927 to 1929. He designed stage sets for successful and controversial operatic and theatrical productions, designed exhibitions and books, created ad campaigns, wrote articles, and made films. His studio employed artists and designers such as Istvan Seboek, György Kepes, and Andor Weininger.

In the summer of 1931 Moholy-Nagy travelled to Finland with his then girlfriend actress Ellen Frank (sister-in-law of Walter Gropius), as a guest of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. During the trip, Moholy-Nagy visited the Holy Cross Church in Hattula, and in 1933 he would name his first daughter Hattula.

Also in 1931 he met actress and scriptwriter Sibylle Pietzsch. They married in 1932 and had two daughters, Hattula (born 1933), and Claudia (1936–1971). Sibyl collaborated with her husband to make &quot;Ein Lichtspiel: schwarz weiss grau&quot; (&quot;A Lightplay: Black White Gray&quot;), a now-classic film based on the &quot;Light-Space Modulator&quot;. She would also work with him on the films &quot;Gypsies&quot; and &quot;Berlin Still Life&quot;, and would remain with him for the rest of his life, later becoming an art and architectural historian.

After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, as a foreign citizen, he was no longer allowed to work there. He worked in 1934 in the Netherlands (doing mostly commercial work) before moving with his family to London in 1935.

In England, Moholy-Nagy formed part of the circle of émigré artists and intellectuals who based themselves in Hampstead. Moholy-Nagy lived in the Isokon building with Walter Gropius for eight months and then settled in Golders Green. Gropius and Moholy-Nagy planned to establish an English version of the Bauhaus but could not secure backing, and then Moholy-Nagy was turned down for a teaching job at the Royal College of Art.

Moholy-Nagy earned a living in London by taking on various commercial design jobs, including work for Imperial Airways and a shop display for men&#x27;s underwear. György Kepes worked with him on various commercial assignments.

He photographed contemporary architecture for the &quot;Architectural Review&quot; where the assistant editor was John Betjeman who commissioned Moholy-Nagy to make documentary photographs to illustrate his book &quot;An Oxford University Chest&quot;. He was commissioned to make the films &quot;Lobsters&quot; (1935) and &quot;New Architecture and the London Zoo&quot; (1936). He began to experiment with painting on transparent plastics, such as Perspex.

In 1936, he was commissioned by fellow Hungarian film producer Alexander Korda to design special effects for the now-classic film &quot;Things to Come&quot;, based on the novel by H. G. Wells. Working at Denham Studios, Moholy-Nagy created kinetic sculptures and abstract light effects, but they were mostly unused by the film&#x27;s director. At the invitation of Leslie Martin, he gave a lecture to the architecture school of Hull School of Art.

In 1937 his artworks were included in the infamous &quot;Degenerate art&quot; exhibition held by Nazi Germany in Munich.

==Chicago years (1937–1946)==

In 1937, on the recommendation of Walter Gropius, and at the invitation of Walter Paepcke, the Chairman of the Container Corporation of America, Moholy-Nagy moved to Chicago to become the director of the New Bauhaus. The philosophy of the school was basically unchanged from that of the original, and its headquarters was the Prairie Avenue mansion that architect Richard Morris Hunt had designed for department store magnate Marshall Field.

However, the school lost the financial backing of its supporters after only a single academic year, and it closed in 1938. Moholy-Nagy resumed doing commercial design work, which he continued to do for the rest of his life. Moholy-Nagy was also the Art Advisor for the mail-order house of Spiegel in Chicago.

Paepcke continued to support the artist, and in 1939 Moholy-Nagy opened the School of Design in Chicago. He also started making static and mobile sculptures in transparent plastic, often accented with chromed metal.

In 1940, the summer session of the School of Design was held at Mills College in Oakland, California. In 1942, he taught a summer course at the Women&#x27;s Teachers College in Denton, Texas.

In 1943, Moholy-Nagy began work on an account of his efforts to develop the curriculum of the School of Design. It would be posthumously published in his 1947 book &quot;Vision in Motion&quot;, in collaboration with his art historian wife Sibyl.

In 1944, the School of Design in Chicago became the Institute of Design, and in 1949 it would become a part of Illinois Institute of Technology, the first institution in the United States to offer a PhD in design.

Moholy-Nagy was diagnosed with leukemia in 1945. He became a naturalized American citizen in April 1946. He continued to produce artworks in multiple media, to teach, and to attend conferences until he died of the disease in Chicago on November 24, 1946. He was buried at Graceland Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The software company Laszlo Systems (developers of the open source programming language OpenLaszlo) was named in part to honor Moholy-Nagy. Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest is named in his honor. In 1998 a Tribute Marker from the City of Chicago was installed.

In the autumn of 2003, the Moholy-Nagy Foundation, Inc. was established as a source of information about Moholy-Nagy&#x27;s life and works. In 2016, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York exhibited a retrospective of Moholy-Nagy&#x27;s work that included painting, film, photography, and sculpture.

In 2019, a documentary film The New Bauhaus directed by Alysa Nahmias was released. The film centers on Moholy-Nagy&#x27;s life and legacy in Chicago, featuring his daughter Hattula Moholy-Nagy, grandsons Andreas Hug and Daniel Hug, curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist, and artists Jan Tichy, Barbara Kasten, Barbara Crane, Kenneth Josephson, Debbie Millman, and Olafur Eliasson.

Moholy-Nagy was a partial inspiration for the character of László Tóth in Brady Corbet&#x27;s film The Brutalist.

<doc id="175864" wikidata="Q295717" url="?curid=175864" title="Vernon L. Smith">
<text>Vernon Lomax Smith (born January 1, 1927) is an American economist who is currently a professor of economics and law at Chapman University. He was formerly the McLellan/Regent’s Professor of Economics at the University of Arizona, a professor of economics and law at George Mason University, and a board member of the Mercatus Center. Along with Daniel Kahneman, Smith won the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his contributions to behavioral economics and his work in the field of experimental economics, which helped establish “laboratory experiments as a tool in empirical economic analysis, especially in the study of alternative market mechanisms”.

Smith is the founder and president of the International Foundation for Research in Experimental Economics (IFREEE), a member of the Independent Institute’s board of advisors, and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington D.C. He was elected a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1987, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995. In 2004, Smith was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Universidad Francisco Marroquín, where the Vernon Smith Center for Experimental Economics Research is named for him. He was also a founding board member of the Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University. As of 2023, Smith also sits on the Advisory Board of the Madden Center for Value Creation at Florida Atlantic University.

==Early life and education==
Smith was born in Wichita, Kansas, where he attended Wichita North High School and Friends University. Grover Bougher, Vernon&#x27;s mother&#x27;s first husband, who worked as a fireman on the Santa Fe railroad, died in an accident. The life insurance money provided by the Santa Fe railroad was invested in a farm which became the sole means of survival for Vernon&#x27;s family during the tough years of the Great Depression. His future interests were influenced by his childhood at the farm.

Smith received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from Caltech in 1949, an M.A. in economics from the University of Kansas in 1952, and his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1955. His Ph.D. thesis title was &quot;A theoretical and empirical inquiry into the economic replacement of capital equipment&quot;.

==Academic career==
Smith&#x27;s first teaching post was at the Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, which he held from 1955 until 1967, attaining the rank of full professor.

Smith also taught as a visiting associate professor at Stanford University (1961–1962) and there made contact with Sidney Siegel, who was also doing work in experimental economics. Smith moved with his family to Massachusetts and got a position first at Brown University (1967–1968) and then at the University of Massachusetts (1968–1972). Smith also received appointments at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1972–1973) and Caltech (1973–1975).

Much of the research that earned Smith the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was conducted at the University of Arizona between 1976 and 2001. In 2001, Smith left Arizona for George Mason University. From 2003 to 2006, he held the Rasmuson Chair of Economics at the University of Alaska Anchorage. In 2008, Smith founded the Economic Science Institute at Chapman University in Orange, California.

Smith has served on the board of editors of the &quot;American Economic Review&quot;, the &quot;Cato Journal&quot;, &quot;Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Economic Theory&quot;, &quot;Economic Design&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Economic Methodology&quot;. He also served as an expert for the Copenhagen Consensus.

===Academic work===
Smith began his work in experimental economics at Purdue University. As Smith describes it:

In framing the experiment, Smith varied certain institutional parameters seen in the first classroom economics experiments as conducted by Edward Chamberlin: in particular, he ran the experiments for several trading periods, to give the student subjects time to train.

At Caltech, Charles Plott encouraged Smith to formalize the methodology of experimental economics, which he did in two articles. In 1976, &quot;Experimental Economics: Induced Value Theory&quot; was published in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; (AER). It was the first articulation of the principle behind economic experiments. Six years later, these principles were expanded in &quot;Microeconomic Systems as an Experimental Science,&quot; also in the AER. This paper adapts the principles of mechanism design, a microeconomic system developed by Leonid Hurwicz, to the development of economic experiments. In Hurwicz&#x27;s formulation, a microeconomic system consists of an economic environment, an economic institution (or economic mechanism), and an economic outcome. The economic environment is simply the preferences of the people in the economy and the production capabilities of the firms in the economy. The key insight in this formulation is that the economic outcome can be affected by the economic institution. The mechanism design provides a formal means for tests of the performance of an economic institution, and experimental economics, as developed by Smith, provided a means for formal empirical assessment of the performance of economic institutions. The second main contribution of the paper is to the technique of induced values, the method used in controlled laboratory experiments in economics, political science, and psychology, which allows experimental economists to create a replica of a market in a laboratory. Subjects in an experiment are told that they can produce a &quot;commodity&quot; at a cost and then sell it to buyers. The seller earns the difference between the price received and its cost. Buyers are told that the commodity has a value to them when they consume it, and they earn the difference between the value of the commodity to them and its price. Using the technique, Smith and his coauthors have examined the performance of alternative trading mechanisms in resource allocation.

In February 2011, Smith participated in the &quot;Visiting Scholars Series&quot; at the Nicholas Academic Centers in Santa Ana, California, conducted in collaboration with Chapman University. Smith and his colleague Bart Wilson conducted experiments designed to expose high school students from underserved neighborhoods to market dynamics and how concepts such as altruism influence economic behavior.

Smith has authored or coauthored articles and books on capital theory, finance, natural resource economics and experimental economics. He was also one of the first to propose the combinatorial auction design, with Stephen J. Rassenti and Robert L. Bulfin in 1982.

In January 2009, Smith signed a public petition opposing the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In a 2010 Econ Journal Watch study, Smith was found to be one of the most active petition-signers among US economists.

The Vernon Smith Prize for the Advancement of Austrian Economics is named after him and is sponsored by the European Center of Austrian Economics.

Vernon Smith is renowned for his seminal contributions to the elucidation of spontaneous order within the field of economics. He posits spontaneous order as the organic emergence of structure and coherence from apparent disorder, a phenomenon ubiquitously observed in both social and economic contexts. Smith has expounded upon the notion of spontaneous order in the context of his pedagogical endeavors as well. In his instructive course titled &quot;Spontaneous Order and the Law&quot; at the Fowler School of Law, Chapman University, he illuminates how social norms and legal frameworks emerge organically through human interaction, gradually coalescing from apparent chaos into structured societal systems.

In recent years, Vernon L. Smith’s research has expanded to include the study of Neuroeconomics as seen in Law &amp; Neuroeconomics Smith (2000), where he integrates economic theory with neuroscience to understand decision-making processes. Vernon Smith’s work in this area has led to new insights into how brain activity influences economic decisions. Additionally, he has been instrumental in promoting the use of experimental methods in economics education, advocating for a hands-on approach to learning economic concepts. Some of these contributions were used in Neuroeconomics Lab books published by Academic Press (2014).

== Personal life ==
In February 2005, Smith publicly attributed features of his personality to Asperger syndrome after a process of self-diagnosis.

<doc id="175865" wikidata="Q359667" url="?curid=175865" title="Active-matrix liquid-crystal display">
<text>An active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) is an extremely common type of liquid-crystal display (LCD). Having supplanted passive-matrix LCDs in general use, in common vernacular, an active-matrix LCD is also simply referred to as a LCD. As of 2025, the term &quot;AMLCD&quot; is uncommon as a matter of technical jargon; instead, due to their ubiquity, different &quot;types&quot; of active-matrix liquid crystal displays are usually specified — TFT LCD, IPS LCD, MicroLED, and QLED are but just a few examples.

Various types of AMLCDs are used as flat-panel displays in many different applications, including televisions, computer monitors, in-vehicle infotainment systems, notebook computers, tablet computers and smartphones. AMLCDs are a relatively mature technology, and desirable in the above applications due in part to their low weight, flexibility, thinness, luminous efficacy, pixel density, image quality, range of possible color gamuts, and quick response times.

In comparison to other contemporaneous display technologies, most AMLCD technologies struggle with contrast. Because an AMLCD requires a backlight, one typically cannot display true black — instead, dark gray is shown.

Among other reasons, due to their smaller size, lower power consumption, lower toxicity, and higher overall brightness, AMLCDs produced since the late 2000s use LED backlights instead of CCFLs.

The utilization of LED backlighting enables some AMLCDs (mostly televisions) to employ methods like localized dimming to increase their perceived contrast ratio. When the display&#x27;s controller detects darkness in the frame or GOP being displayed, groups of LEDs comprising the display&#x27;s backlight are dimmed at the corresponding physical location (the number of localized dimming zones the display provides is typically in the hundreds but varies heavily, typically increasing proportionally to the display&#x27;s MSRP). Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for localized dimming to cause portions of the image (for example, subtitles during a dark scene) to be incorrectly and undesirably dimmed to a level where the image is not clearly visible. Displays where localized dimming cannot be disabled are therefore unsuitable for applications like non-linear editing or color grading, where color accuracy and correct gamma are required.

The issue is very well-known, having plagued AMLCDs for decades. Amongst other technologies, it contributed to the development of MicroLED displays, a type of AMLCD. A MicroLED display uses one LED per pixel as its backlight, so a MicroLED display is capable of displaying black by simply turning the relevant LED off — rendering the corresponding pixel completely dark. However, as of February 2025, MicroLED displays have not been widely adopted and are considerably more expensive than other AMLCD displays.

The concept of active-matrix LCDs was proposed by Bernard J. Lechner at the RCA Laboratories in 1968. The first functional AMLCD with thin-film transistors was made by T. Peter Brody, Fang-Chen Luo and their team at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1972. However, it took years of additional research and development by others to launch successful products.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;active matrix&quot; was coined by T. Peter Brody in 1975.

==Introduction==

The most common type of AMLCD contains, besides the polarizing sheets and cells of liquid crystal, a matrix of thin-film transistors to make a thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display. These devices store the electrical state of each pixel on the display while all the other pixels are being updated. This method provides a much brighter, sharper display than a passive matrix of the same size. An important specification for these displays is their viewing angle.

Thin-film transistors are usually used for constructing an active matrix so that the two terms are often interchanged, even though a thin-film transistor is just one component in an active matrix and some active-matrix designs have used other components such as diodes. Whereas a passive matrix display uses a simple conductive grid to apply a voltage to the liquid crystals in the target area, an active-matrix display uses a grid of transistors and capacitors with the ability to hold a charge for a limited period of time. Because of the switching action of transistors, only the desired pixel receives a charge, and the pixel acts as a capacitor to hold the charge until the next refresh cycle, improving image quality over a passive matrix. This is a special version of a sample-and-hold circuit.

<text>Adam Henryk Małysz (; born 3 December 1977) is a Polish former ski jumper and rally driver. He competed in ski jumping from 1995 to 2011 and is one of the most successful athletes in the history of the sport. His many accomplishments include four World Cup titles (a male record shared with Matti Nykänen), four individual Winter Olympic medals, four individual World Championship gold medals (an all-time record), 39 individual World Cup competition wins, 96 World Cup podiums (individual and team), and being the first male ski jumper to win three consecutive World Cup titles. He is also a winner of the Four Hills Tournament, the only three-time winner of the Nordic Tournament, and a former ski flying world record holder.

After retiring from ski jumping, Małysz competed in the Dakar Rally in 2012, 2013 and 2014 finishing 37th, 15th and 13th respectively.

In 2018-2022 period he was a director-coordinator of ski jumping and Nordic combined at the Polish Ski Federation. On 25 June 2022, he was elected CEO of Polish Ski Federation.

==Ski jumping career==
Małysz began his senior-level ski jumping career on 4 January 1995, finishing seventeenth at the third event of the Four Hills Tournament in Innsbruck. In his first two World Cup seasons, he was moderately successful, winning in Oslo on 17 March 1996; in Sapporo on 18 January 1997; and in Hakuba on 26 January. His breakthrough season came in 2000–01, when he won the Four Hills Tournament and ended Martin Schmitt&#x27;s long run of success dating back to 1998–99. Małysz went on to dominate the season by reeling off five consecutive individual victories in Innsbruck, Bischofshofen, both ski flying competitions in Harrachov, and Park City. Further success came at the 2001 World Championships, in which he won a gold medal on the individual normal hill and silver on the individual large hill. He finished the season by a landslide points margin with three more consecutive wins in Falun, Trondheim and Oslo to claim his first Nordic Tournament title.

The 2001–02 season saw Małysz pick up where he left off, as he never once lost the lead in the World Cup standings. A streak of five wins by a highly motivated Sven Hannawald in December 2001 through January 2002 looked to threaten Małysz&#x27;s run, but burnout prematurely ended Hannawald&#x27;s challenge. Małysz picked up one last win of the season in Zakopane to the delight of his Polish fans, thereafter finishing consistently on the podium to claim his second World Cup title by a comfortable points margin. He also won silver on the individual large hill and bronze on the individual normal hill at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Park City.

Małysz faced stiff competition in defence of his World Cup title throughout the 2002–03 season. Despite second place at the season-opener in Kuusamo, he failed to win a competition for nearly four months. The lead of the overall standings changed hands several times until the final month of the season, by which time Małysz began to regain his form. At the 2003 World Championships in Predazzo, he won the gold medal in both the individual normal and large hill competitions. This was followed up by three straight wins in Oslo and Lahti (twice in the latter), securing his second Nordic Tournament title. Małysz ended the season on a high by equalling the then-world record of in Planica, as well as fending off a late challenge by Sven Hannawald, who again finished runner-up in the overall World Cup standings—albeit with six wins to Małysz&#x27;s three, and by a closer margin than before.

In the following years, as is the case with almost all ski jumpers in the prime of their career, Małysz was unable to maintain his previous form. He only managed twelfth in the 2003–04 season, finishing on the podium four times but without a win. 2004–05 saw an improvement with fourth place in the overall standings as well as four wins; these came on the large hill in Harrachov, the ski flying hill in Kulm, and a double win in Zakopane. The only highlights of Małysz&#x27;s 2005–06 campaign, in which he finished ninth overall, were third place in Kuopio and a win in Oslo.

Małysz experienced a significant career resurgence in 2006–07, which began with a surprise win in Oberstdorf in January 2007. This was followed up by a double victory in Titisee-Neustadt, an individual gold medal on the normal hill at the 2007 World Championships, and a hat-trick of wins during the Nordic Tournament (Lahti, Kuopio, and Oslo) to win his third and final such title. The season was punctuated with a clean sweep of all three competitions in Planica, which enabled him to leapfrog his younger competitor Anders Jacobsen with only two competitions remaining. This secured Małysz a fourth World Cup title, equalling Matti Nykänen&#x27;s record total in the 1980s.

Sporadic success from 2008 to 2011 saw Małysz achieve seventeen podiums, as well as silver medals in both the individual normal hill and large hill competitions at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A fitting end to Małysz&#x27;s career came in the form of a home victory in Zakopane on 21 January 2011, an individual bronze medal on the normal hill at the 2011 World Championships in Oslo on 26 February, and third place at the season finale in Planica on 20 March. Małysz publicly announced his retirement from ski jumping six days later.

==Legacy and awards==
Małysz&#x27;s success contributed to his enormous popularity not only among ski jumping fans but throughout Poland as well. Additionally, he is the only five-time winner of the ski jumping event at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival (in 1996, 2001, 2003, 2006 and 2007), earning the Holmenkollen Medal in 2001 for his ski jumping victories (shared with Bente Skari and Thomas Alsgaard). He was also voted four times the Polish sportsman of the year (2001, 2002, 2003, 2007).

For his sporting achievements, he received the Order of Polonia Restituta:

 Officer&#x27;s Cross (4th Class), 2002&lt;br&gt;
 Commander&#x27;s Cross (3rd Class), 2007&lt;br&gt;
 Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star (2nd Class), 2010

<text>John Arbuthnot FRS (&quot;baptised&quot; 29 April 1667 – 27 February 1735), often known simply as Dr Arbuthnot, was a Scottish physician, satirist and polymath in London. He is best remembered for his contributions to mathematics, his membership in the Scriblerus Club (where he inspired Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; book III and Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Peri Bathous, Or the Art of Sinking in Poetry&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus,&quot; and possibly &quot;The Dunciad&quot;), and for inventing the figure of John Bull.

==Biography==
In his mid-life, Arbuthnot, complaining of the work of Edmund Curll, among others, who commissioned and invented a biography as soon as an author died, said, &quot;Biography is one of the new terrors of death,&quot; and so a biography of Arbuthnot is made difficult by his own reluctance to leave records. Alexander Pope noted to Joseph Spence that Arbuthnot allowed his infant children to play with, and even burn, his writings. Throughout his professional life, Arbuthnot exhibited a strong humility and social conviviality, and his friends often complained that he did not take sufficient credit for his own work.

Arbuthnot was born in Arbuthnot, Kincardineshire, on the north-eastern coast of Scotland, son of Margaret (née Lammie) and Rev Alexander Arbuthnot, an Episcopalian priest. He may have graduated with an arts degree from Marischal College in 1685. Where Arbuthnot&#x27;s brothers took part in Jacobite causes in 1689, he remained with his father. These brothers included Robert, who fled after fighting for King James VII in 1689 and became a banker in Rouen and half-brother George, who fled to France and became a wine merchant. However, when William and Mary came to the throne and the Scottish and English parliaments required all ministers to swear allegiance to them as king and queen, Arbuthnot&#x27;s father did not comply. As a non-juror, he was removed from his church, and John was there to take care of affairs when, in 1691, his father died.
Arbuthnot went to London in 1691, where he is supposed to have supported himself by teaching mathematics (which had been his formal course of study). He lodged with William Pate, whom Swift knew and called a &quot;bel esprit&quot;. He published &quot;Of the Laws of Chance&quot; in 1692, translated from Christiaan Huygens&#x27;s &quot;De ratiociniis in ludo aleae.&quot; This was the first work on probability published in English. The work, which applied the field of probability to common games, was a success, and Arbuthnot became the private tutor of one Edward Jeffreys, son of Jeffrey Jeffreys, an MP. He remained Jeffreys&#x27;s tutor when the latter attended University College, Oxford in 1694, and he there met the variety of scholars then teaching mathematics and medicine, including Dr John Radcliffe, Isaac Newton, and Samuel Pepys. However, Arbuthnot lacked the money to be a full-time student and was already well educated, although informally. He went to the University of St Andrews and enrolled as a doctoral student in medicine on 11 September 1696. The &quot;very same day&quot; he defended seven theses on medicine and was awarded the doctorate.

He first wrote satire in 1697, when he answered Dr John Woodward&#x27;s &quot;An essay towards a natural history of the earth and terrestrial bodies, especially minerals...&quot; with &quot;An Examination of Dr Woodward&#x27;s Account &amp;c.&quot; He poked fun at the arrogance of the work and Woodward&#x27;s misguided, Aristotelian insistence that what is theoretically attractive must be actually true. In 1701, Arbuthnot wrote another mathematical work, &quot;An essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning, in a letter from a gentleman in the city to his friend in Oxford.&quot; The work was moderately successful, and Arbuthnot praises mathematics as a method of freeing the mind from superstition.

In 1702, he was at Epsom when Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne fell ill. According to tradition, Arbuthnot treated the prince successfully. According to tradition again, this treatment earned him an invitation to court. Also around 1702, he married Margaret, whose maiden name is possibly Wemyss. Although there are no baptismal records, it seems that his first son, George (named in honour of the prince), was born in 1703. He was elected to be a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1704. Also thanks to the Queen&#x27;s presence, he was made an MD at Cambridge University on 16 April 1705.

Arbuthnot was an amiable individual, and Swift said that the only fault an enemy could lay upon him was a slight waddle in his walk. His conviviality and his royal connections made him an important figure in the Royal Society. In 1705, Arbuthnot became physician extraordinary to Queen Anne, and at the same time was put on the board trying to publish the &quot;Historia coelestius.&quot; Newton and Edmund Halley wanted it published immediately, to support their work on orbits, while John Flamsteed, the Royal Astronomer whose observations they were, wanted to keep the data secret until he had perfected it. The result was that Arbuthnot used his leverage as friend and physician to Prince George, whose money was paying for the publication, to force Flamsteed to allow it out, albeit with serious errors, in 1712. Also as a scholar, Arbuthnot took up an interest in antiquities and published &quot;Tables of Grecian, Roman, and Jewish measures, weights and coins; reduced to the English standard&quot; in 1705, 1707, 1709, and, expanded with a preface (which indicated that his second son, Charles, was born in 1705), in 1727 and 1747.

Although Arbuthnot was not a Jacobite after the fashion of his brothers, he was a Tory, for national and familial reasons. Anne was advised (and many said controlled) by Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who was a champion of Whig causes. In 1706, the Duchess of Marlborough fell out with Anne—a schism which the Tories were pleased to encourage. The marriage of lady-in-waiting Abigail Hill to Samuel Masham, which was the first overt sign of Anne&#x27;s displeasure with Sarah Churchill, took place in Arbuthnot&#x27;s apartments at St James&#x27;s Palace. The reasons for the choice of apartment and the degree of involvement of Arbuthnot in either the love match or Anne&#x27;s estrangement, are not clear. As a Scotsman, Arbuthnot served the crown by writing &quot;A sermon preach&#x27;d to the people at the Mercat Cross of Edinborough on the subject of the union. Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10, Verse 27.&quot; The work was designed to persuade Scots to accept the Act of Union. When the Act passed, Arbuthnot was made a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was also made a physician in ordinary to the Queen, which made him part of the royal household.

Arbuthnot returned to mathematics in 1710 with &quot;An argument for Divine Providence, taken from the constant regularity observed in the births of both sexes&quot; (linked below) in the Royal Society&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Transactions.&quot; In this paper, Arbuthnot examined birth records in London for each of the 82 years from 1629 to 1710 and the human sex ratio at birth: in every year, the number of males born in London exceeded the number of females. If the probability of male and female birth were equal, the probability of the observed outcome would be 1/282. This vanishingly small number led Arbuthnot to believe that this phenomenon was not due to chance, but to divine providence: &quot;From whence it follows, that it is Art, not Chance, that governs.&quot; This paper was a landmark in the history of statistics; in modern terms he performed statistical hypothesis testing, computing the &quot;p&quot;-value (via a sign test), interpreted it as statistical significance, and rejected the null hypothesis. This is credited as &quot;… the first use of significance tests …&quot;, the first example of reasoning about statistical significance and moral certainty, and &quot;… perhaps the first published report of a nonparametric test …&quot;.

==As a Scriblerian==

In 1710, Jonathan Swift moved to London. With Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (who was then the secretary of the treasury and not a peer), he produced the Tory &quot;Examiner,&quot; and Arbuthnot made their acquaintance and began to provide &quot;hints&quot; to them. These &quot;hints&quot; were ideas for essays, satirical gambits, and facts, rather than secrets of any sort. From 1711 to 1713, Arbuthnot and Swift formed &quot;The Brothers&#x27; Club,&quot; though Arbuthnot characteristically gave away his ideas and even his writings, never seeking credit for them.

In 1712, Arbuthnot and Swift both attempted to aid the Tory government of Harley and Henry St. John in their efforts to end the War of the Spanish Succession. The war had profited John and Sarah Churchill, and the Tory ministry sought to end it by withdrawing from all England&#x27;s alliances and negotiating directly with France. Swift wrote &quot;The Conduct of the Allies,&quot; and Arbuthnot wrote a series of five pamphlets featuring John Bull. The first of these, &quot;Law Is a Bottomless Pit&quot; (1712), introduced a simple allegory to explain the war. John Bull (England) is suing Louis Baboon (i.e. Louis Bourbon, or Louis XIV of France) over the estate of the dead Lord Strutt (Charles II of Spain). Bull&#x27;s lawyer is the one who really enjoys the suit, and he is Humphrey Hocus (Marlborough). Bull has a sister named Peg (Scotland). The pamphlets are Swiftian in their satire, in that they make all of the characters hopelessly flawed and comic and none of their endeavour worth pursuing (which was Arbuthnot&#x27;s intent, as he sought to make the war an object of scorn), but it is filled with homespun humour, a common touch, and a sympathy for the figures that is distinctly non-Swiftian.

In 1713, Arbuthnot continued his political satire with &quot;Proposals for printing a very curious discourse... a treatise of the art of political lying, with an abstract of the first volume.&quot; As with other works that Arbuthnot encouraged, this systemizes a rhetoric of bad thinking and writing. He proposes to teach people to lie well. Similar lists and systems are in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Peri Bathos&quot; and John Gay and Pope&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus.&quot; Also in 1713, Arbuthnot was made a physician of Chelsea Hospital, which provided him with a house. It was this house that hosted the meetings of the Scriblerus Club, which had as its members Harley (now Earl of Oxford), St. John (now Viscount Bolingbroke), Pope, Gay, Swift, and Thomas Parnell. According to all the members of the club, Arbuthnot was the one who contributed the most in ideas, and he was the only source they could draw upon when satirizing the sciences, and his was the idea for the &quot;Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus,&quot; a pedantic man who, like Arbuthnot&#x27;s earlier opponent, Dr Woodward, would read three or four lines of Classical literature and deduce a universal (and absurd) truth from them.

The club met for only a year, as Queen Anne died in July 1714, and the club met for the last time in November of that year. When Anne died, she had no will. Consequently, all her servants were left without positions and entirely at the mercy of the next administration – an administration that was chosen by the enemies of Arbuthnot and the other Scriblerans. When George I came to the throne, Arbuthnot lost all of his royal appointments and houses, but he still had a vigorous medical practice. He lived at &quot;the second door from the left in Dover Street&quot; in Piccadilly.

==Life under the Hanoverians==

In 1717, Arbuthnot contributed somewhat to Pope and Gay&#x27;s play, &quot;Three Hours after Marriage,&quot; which ran for seven nights. He was a friend to George Frederic Handel and appointed director to the Royal Academy of Music (1719) from the start in 1719 till 1729.

In 1719 he took part in a pamphlet war over the treatment of smallpox. In particular, he attacked Dr Woodward, who had again presented a dogmatic and, Arbuthnot thought, irrational opinion. In 1723, Arbuthnot was made one of the censors of the Royal College of Physicians, and as such he was one of the campaigners to inspect and improve the drugs sold by apothecaries in London. In 1723, the apothecaries sued the RCP, and Arbuthnot wrote &quot;Reasons humbly offered by the ... upholders (undertakers) against part of the bill for the better viewing, searching, and examining of drugs.&quot; The pamphlet suggested that the funeral directors of London might wish to sue the Royal College of Physicians as well to ensure that drug safety remained poor. In 1727, he was made an elect of the Royal College of Physicians.

In 1726 and 1727, Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope reunited at Arbuthnot&#x27;s house during visits, and Swift showed Arbuthnot the manuscript of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; ahead of time. The detailed parody of on-going Royal Society projects in book III of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; likely came from &quot;hints&quot; from Arbuthnot. The visit also bore fruit in Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; of 1729 (the second edition), where Arbuthnot probably wrote the &quot;Virgilius restauratus&quot; satirizing Richard Bentley.

Arbuthnot was guardian to Peter the Wild Boy on his first arrival in London.

In 1730, Arbuthnot&#x27;s wife died. The next year, he produced a work of popular medicine, &quot;An essay concerning the nature of aliments, and the choice of them, according to the different constitutions of human bodies.&quot; The book was quite popular, and a second edition, with advice on diet, came out the next year. It had four more full editions and translations into French and German. In 1733 he wrote another very popular work of medicine called &quot;An Essay Concerning the Effects of Air on Human Bodies.&quot; As with the former work, it went through multiple editions and translations. He argued that the air itself had to have enormous effects on the personality and persons of humanity, and he believed that the air of locations resulted in the characteristics of the people, as well as particular maladies. He advised his readers to ventilate sickrooms and to seek fresh air in cities. Although the idea that airs carried sickness was incorrect, the practical upshot of Arbuthnot&#x27;s advice was efficacious, as crowded, poorly sanitized Augustan era cities had bad air and infectious air.

His son Charles, studying to be a divine at Christ Church, Oxford, died in 1731, the same year that the Swift and Pope &quot;Miscellanies, Volume the Third&quot; (which was the first volume) appeared. He contributed &quot;An Essay of the Learned Martinus Scriblerus Concerning the Origine of the Sciences&quot; to the volume.

In 1734, his health began to decline. He had kidney stones and asthma, and he was also overweight. On 17 July 1734, Arbuthnot wrote to Pope to tell him that he had a terminal illness. In a response dated 2 August, Pope indicates that he planned to write more satire, and on 25 August told Arbuthnot that he was going to address one of his epistles to him, later characterizing it as a memorial to their friendship. Arbuthnot died at his house in Cork Street, in London on 27 February 1735, eight weeks after the poem &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot; was published. He is buried at St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.

==Literary significance==

Arbuthnot was one of the founding members of the Scriblerus Club, and was regarded by the other wits of the group as the funniest, but he left fewer literary remains than the other members. His satires are written with an ease, a humanity, and an apparent sympathy. Swift and Arbuthnot had similar styles in language (both preferred direct sentences and clear vocabulary) with a feigned frenzy of lists and taxonomies, and sometimes their works are attributed to each other. The treatise on political lying, for example, has been attributed to Swift in the past, although it was definitely Arbuthnot&#x27;s. Generally, Arbuthnot&#x27;s writings are not as vicious or nihilistic as Swift&#x27;s, but they attack the same targets and both refuse to hold up a set of positive norms for their readers.

Because of Arbuthnot&#x27;s own insistence on not being recognized, it is difficult to speak definitively of his literary significance. Samuel Johnson thought highly of him as Boswell noted: &quot;Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne&#x27;s reign, he observed ,&#x27;I think Dr. Arbuthnott the first man among them. He was the most universal genius, being an excellent physician, a man of deep learning, and a man of much humour.&#x27;&quot; Arbuthnot was at the heart of many of the greatest satires of his age. He was a conduit and source for a great many of the finest literary accomplishments for over half a century of writing, but Arbuthnot was zealous that he not receive credit.

<doc id="175871" wikidata="Q3588744" url="?curid=175871" title="Émile Saisset">
<text>Émile Edmond Saisset (16 September 181427 December 1863) was a French philosopher.

==Life==
Émile Edmond Saisset was born at Montpellier. He studied philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure, and carried on the eclectic tradition of his master along with Ravaisson and Jules Simon. In 1842 he was professor of philosophy at Caen, at the École Normale in Paris. He later moved on to the College de France in 1843. He became a member of the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques at the Sorbonne in 1862. Saisset, known as &quot;fashionable psychologist&quot;, was associated with the Eclectic school of Victor Cousin.

Saisset&#x27;s chief works are a monograph on Aenesidemus the Sceptic (1840); &quot;Le Scepticisme: Ænésidème, Pascal, Kant&quot; (1845); a translation of Spinoza (1843); &quot;Précurseurs et disciples de Descartes&quot; (1862); &quot;Discours de la philosophie de Leibniz&quot; (1857) (a work which had great influence on the progress of thought in France); &quot;Essai de philosophie religieuse&quot; (1859); &quot;Critique et histoire de la philosophie&quot; (1865).

His untimely death in 1863, &quot;a year after his appointment to the Sorbonne, surely prevented his literary output from being more formidable.&quot;

<doc id="175875" wikidata="Q208470" url="?curid=175875" title="Critical mass">
<text>In nuclear engineering, a critical mass is the smallest amount of fissile material needed for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. The critical mass of a fissionable material depends upon its nuclear properties (specifically, its nuclear fission cross-section), density, shape, enrichment, purity, temperature, and surroundings. The concept is important in nuclear weapon design.

== Point of criticality==

When a nuclear chain reaction in a mass of fissile material is self-sustaining, the mass is said to be in a &quot;critical&quot; state in which there is no increase or decrease in power, temperature, or neutron population.

A numerical measure of a critical mass depends on the effective neutron multiplication factor , the average number of neutrons released per fission event that go on to cause another fission event rather than being absorbed or leaving the material. 
A &quot;subcritical&quot; mass is a mass that does not have the ability to sustain a fission chain reaction. A population of neutrons introduced to a subcritical assembly will exponentially decrease. In this case, known as , .

A &quot;critical&quot; mass is a mass of fissile material that self-sustains a fission chain reaction. In this case, known as , . A steady rate of spontaneous fission causes a proportionally steady level of neutron activity.

A &quot;supercritical&quot; mass is a mass which, once fission has started, will proceed at an increasing rate. In this case, known as , . The constant of proportionality increases as increases. The material may settle into equilibrium (&quot;i.e.&quot; become critical again) at an elevated temperature/power level or destroy itself.

Due to spontaneous fission a supercritical mass will undergo a chain reaction. For example, a spherical critical mass of pure uranium-235 (235U) with a mass of about would experience around 15 spontaneous fission events per second. The probability that one such event will cause a chain reaction depends on how much the mass exceeds the critical mass. If there is uranium-238 (238U) present, the rate of spontaneous fission will be much higher. Fission can also be initiated by neutrons produced by cosmic rays.

==Changing the point of criticality==
The mass where criticality occurs may be changed by modifying certain attributes such as fuel, shape, temperature, density and the installation of a neutron-reflective substance. These attributes have complex interactions and interdependencies. These examples only outline the simplest ideal cases:

===Varying the amount of fuel===
It is possible for a fuel assembly to be critical at near zero power. If the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass to create an &quot;exactly critical mass&quot;, fission would be self-sustaining for only one neutron generation (fuel consumption then makes the assembly subcritical again).

Similarly, if the perfect quantity of fuel were added to a slightly subcritical mass, to create a barely supercritical mass, the temperature of the assembly would increase to an initial maximum (for example: 1 K above the ambient temperature) and then decrease back to the ambient temperature after a period of time, because fuel consumed during fission brings the assembly back to subcriticality once again.

===Changing the shape===
A mass may be exactly critical without being a perfect homogeneous sphere. More closely refining the shape toward a perfect sphere will make the mass supercritical. Conversely changing the shape to a less perfect sphere will decrease its reactivity and make it subcritical.

===Changing the temperature===
A mass may be exactly critical at a particular temperature. Fission and absorption cross-sections increase as the relative neutron velocity decreases. As fuel temperature increases, neutrons of a given energy appear faster and thus fission/absorption is less likely. This is not unrelated to Doppler broadening of the 238U resonances but is common to all fuels/absorbers/configurations. Neglecting the very important resonances, the total neutron cross-section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity. Hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel (over/under moderation in LWR is a different topic). Thermal expansion associated with temperature increase also contributes a negative coefficient of reactivity since fuel atoms are moving farther apart. A mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone.

===Varying the density of the mass===
The higher the density, the lower the critical mass. The density of a material at a constant temperature can be changed by varying the pressure or tension or by changing crystal structure (see allotropes of plutonium). An ideal mass will become subcritical if allowed to expand or conversely the same mass will become supercritical if compressed. Changing the temperature may also change the density; however, the effect on critical mass is then complicated by temperature effects (see &quot;Changing the temperature&quot;) and by whether the material expands or contracts with increased temperature. Assuming the material expands with temperature (enriched uranium-235 at room temperature for example), at an exactly critical state, it will become subcritical if warmed to lower density or become supercritical if cooled to higher density. Such a material is said to have a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity to indicate that its reactivity decreases when its temperature increases. Using such a material as fuel means fission decreases as the fuel temperature increases.

===Use of a neutron reflector===
Surrounding a spherical critical mass with a neutron reflector further reduces the mass needed for criticality. A common material for a neutron reflector is beryllium metal. This reduces the number of neutrons which escape the fissile material, resulting in increased reactivity.

===Use of a tamper===
In a bomb, a dense shell of material surrounding the fissile core will contain, via inertia, the expanding fissioning material, which increases the efficiency. This is known as a tamper. A tamper also tends to act as a neutron reflector. Because a bomb relies on fast neutrons (not ones moderated by reflection with light elements, as in a reactor), the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei, and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core, they take rather longer to be absorbed by a fissile nucleus. But they do contribute to the reaction, and can decrease the critical mass by a factor of four. Also, if the tamper is (e.g. depleted) uranium, it can fission due to the high energy neutrons generated by the primary explosion. This can greatly increase yield, especially if even more neutrons are generated by fusing hydrogen isotopes, in a so-called boosted configuration.

==Critical size==

The critical size is the minimum size of a nuclear reactor core or nuclear weapon that can be made for a specific geometrical arrangement and material composition. The critical size must at least include enough fissionable material to reach critical mass. If the size of the reactor core is less than a certain minimum, too many fission neutrons escape through its surface and the chain reaction is not sustained.

==Critical mass of a bare sphere==
The shape with minimal critical mass and the smallest physical dimensions is a sphere. Bare-sphere critical masses at normal density of some actinides are listed in the following table. Most information on bare sphere masses is considered classified, since it is critical to nuclear weapons design, but some documents have been declassified.
The critical mass for lower-grade uranium depends strongly on the grade: with 45% 235U, the bare-sphere critical mass is around ; with 19.75% 235U it is over ; and with 15% 235U, it is well over . In all of these cases, the use of a neutron reflector like beryllium can substantially drop this amount, however: with a reflector, the critical mass of 19.75%-enriched uranium drops to , and with a reflector it drops to , for example.

The critical mass is inversely proportional to the square of the density. If the density is 1% more and the mass 2% less, then the volume is 3% less and the diameter 1% less. The probability for a neutron per cm travelled to hit a nucleus is proportional to the density. It follows that 1% greater density means that the distance travelled before leaving the system is 1% less. This is something that must be taken into consideration when attempting more precise estimates of critical masses of plutonium isotopes than the approximate values given above, because plutonium metal has a large number of different crystal phases which can have widely varying densities.

Note that not all neutrons contribute to the chain reaction. Some escape and others undergo radiative capture.

Let &quot;q&quot; denote the probability that a given neutron induces fission in a nucleus. Consider only prompt neutrons, and let &quot;ν&quot; denote the number of prompt neutrons generated in a nuclear fission. For example, &quot;ν&quot; ≈ 2.5 for uranium-235. Then, criticality occurs when &quot;ν·q&quot; = 1. The dependence of this upon geometry, mass, and density appears through the factor &quot;q&quot;.

Given a total interaction cross section σ (typically measured in barns), the mean free path of a prompt neutron is formula_1 where &quot;n&quot; is the nuclear number density. Most interactions are scattering events, so that a given neutron obeys a random walk until it either escapes from the medium or causes a fission reaction. So long as other loss mechanisms are not significant, then, the radius of a spherical critical mass is rather roughly given by the product of the mean free path formula_2 and the square root of one plus the number of scattering events per fission event (call this &quot;s&quot;), since the net distance travelled in a random walk is proportional to the square root of the number of steps:

:formula_3

Note again, however, that this is only a rough estimate.

In terms of the total mass &quot;M&quot;, the nuclear mass &quot;m&quot;, the density ρ, and a fudge factor &quot;f&quot; which takes into account geometrical and other effects, criticality corresponds to

:formula_4

which clearly recovers the aforementioned result that critical mass depends inversely on the square of the density.

Alternatively, one may restate this more succinctly in terms of the areal density of mass, Σ:

:formula_5

where the factor &quot;f&quot; has been rewritten as &quot;f&quot;&#x27; to account for the fact that the two values may differ depending upon geometrical effects and how one defines Σ. For example, for a bare solid sphere of 239Pu criticality is at 320 kg/m2, regardless of density, and for 235U at 550 kg/m2. 
In any case, criticality then depends upon a typical neutron &quot;seeing&quot; an amount of nuclei around it such that the areal density of nuclei exceeds a certain threshold.

This is applied in implosion-type nuclear weapons where a spherical mass of fissile material that is substantially less than a critical mass is made supercritical by very rapidly increasing ρ (and thus Σ as well) (see below). Indeed, sophisticated nuclear weapons programs can make a functional device from less material than more primitive weapons programs require.

Aside from the math, there is a simple physical analog that helps explain this result. Consider diesel fumes belched from an exhaust pipe. Initially the fumes appear black, then gradually you are able to see through them without any trouble. This is not because the total scattering cross section of all the soot particles has changed, but because the soot has dispersed. If we consider a transparent cube of length &quot;L&quot; on a side, filled with soot, then the optical depth of this medium is inversely proportional to the square of &quot;L&quot;, and therefore proportional to the areal density of soot particles: we can make it easier to see through the imaginary cube just by making the cube larger.

Several uncertainties contribute to the determination of a precise value for critical masses, including (1) detailed knowledge of fission cross sections, (2) calculation of geometric effects. This latter problem provided significant motivation for the development of the &quot;Monte Carlo method&quot; in computational physics by Nicholas Metropolis and Stanislaw Ulam. In fact, even for a homogeneous solid sphere, the exact calculation is by no means trivial. Finally, note that the calculation can also be performed by assuming a continuum approximation for the neutron transport. This reduces it to a diffusion problem. However, as the typical linear dimensions are not significantly larger than the mean free path, such an approximation is only marginally applicable.

Finally, note that for some idealized geometries, the critical mass might formally be infinite, and other parameters are used to describe criticality. For example, consider an infinite sheet of fissionable material. For any finite thickness, this corresponds to an infinite mass. However, criticality is only achieved once the thickness of this slab exceeds a critical value.

== Critical mass with a tamper ==
The critical mass can be greatly reduced by the use of a tamper. The following table lists the values for common neutron reflectors, where λtamp is the mean free path of a neutron within the tamper material before an elastic scattering. In nuclear weapon design, natural uranium is primarily used. Tungsten carbide was initially used in the Little Boy.
==Criticality in nuclear weapon design==

Until detonation is desired, a nuclear weapon must be kept subcritical. In the case of a uranium gun-type bomb, this can be achieved by keeping the fuel in a number of separate pieces, each below the critical size either because they are too small or unfavorably shaped. To produce detonation, the pieces of uranium are brought together rapidly. In Little Boy, this was achieved by firing a piece of uranium (a &#x27;doughnut&#x27;) down a gun barrel onto another piece (a &#x27;spike&#x27;). This design is referred to as a &quot;gun-type fission weapon&quot;.

A theoretical 100% pure 239Pu weapon could also be constructed as a gun-type weapon, like the Manhattan Project&#x27;s proposed Thin Man design. In reality, this is impractical because even &quot;weapons grade&quot; 239Pu is contaminated with a small amount of 240Pu, which has a strong propensity toward spontaneous fission. Because of this, a reasonably sized gun-type weapon would suffer nuclear reaction (predetonation) before the masses of plutonium would be in a position for a full-fledged explosion to occur.
Instead, the plutonium is present as a subcritical sphere (or other shape), which may or may not be hollow. Detonation is produced by exploding a shaped charge surrounding the sphere, increasing the density (and collapsing the cavity, if present) to produce a prompt critical configuration. This is known as an implosion type weapon.

==Prompt criticality==

The event of fission must release, on the average, more than one free neutron of the desired energy level in order to sustain a chain reaction, and each must find other nuclei and cause them to fission. Most of the neutrons released from a fission event come immediately from that event, but a fraction of them come later, when the fission products decay, which may be on the average from microseconds to minutes later. This is fortunate for atomic power generation, for without this delay &quot;going critical&quot; would be an immediately catastrophic event, as it is in a nuclear bomb where upwards of 80 generations of chain reaction occur in less than a microsecond, far too fast for a human, or even a machine, to react. Physicists recognize two points in the gradual increase of neutron flux which are significant: critical, where the chain reaction becomes self-sustaining thanks to the contributions of both kinds of neutron generation, and prompt critical, where the immediate &quot;prompt&quot; neutrons alone will sustain the reaction without need for the decay neutrons. Nuclear power plants operate between these two points of reactivity, while above the prompt critical point is the domain of nuclear weapons, pulsed reactors designs such as TRIGA research reactors and the pulsed nuclear thermal rocket, and some nuclear power accidents, such as the 1961 US SL-1 accident and 1986 Soviet Chernobyl disaster.

<text>François Judith Paul Grévy (15 August 1807 – 9 September 1891), known as Jules Grévy (), was a French lawyer and politician who served as President of France from 1879 to 1887. He was a leader of the Moderate Republicans, and given that his predecessors were monarchists who tried without success to restore the French monarchy, Grévy is considered the first real republican president of France. During Grévy&#x27;s presidency from 1879 to 1887, according to David Bell, there was a disunity among his cabinets. Only one survived more than a year. Grévy paid attention chiefly to defense, internal order, and foreign relations. Critics argue that Grévy&#x27;s confusing approach to appointments set a bad precedent for handling crises. Grévy&#x27;s son-in-law was implicated in a corruption scandal in 1887, and Grévy had to resign after exhausting the pool of willing politicians to form a fresh government.

Born in a small town in the Jura department, Grévy moved to Paris where he initially followed a career in law before becoming a republican activist. He began his political career after the French Revolution of 1848, as a member of the National Assembly of the French Second Republic, where he became known for his opposition to Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and as a supporter of lesser authority for the executive branch. During the 1851 coup d&#x27;état by Louis-Napoléon he was briefly imprisoned, and afterwards retired from political life.

With the downfall of the Second French Empire and the reestablishment of the Republic in 1870, Grévy returned to prominence in national politics. After occupying high offices in the National Assembly and the Chamber of Deputies, he was elected president of France in 1879. During his presidency Grévy confirmed his longtime stance by diminishing his own executive authority in favor of the Parliament, and in foreign policy strove for peaceful relations and opposed colonialism. He was reelected in 1885, but two years later was compelled to resign due to a political scandal involving his son-in-law, although Grévy himself was not implicated. His nearly nine years as president of France are seen as the consolidation of the French Third Republic.

==Early life and career==
Grévy was born on 15 August 1807 in Mont-sous-Vaudrey, in the department of Jura, into a republican family. His paternal grandfather, Nicolas Grévy (1736–1812), the son of farmers from Aumont, moved to Mont-sous-Vaudrey during the French Revolution, where he bought the property of &quot;la Grangerie&quot;. He was a justice of the peace. Grévy&#x27;s parents were François Hyacinthe Grevy (1773–1857) and Jeanne Gabrielle Planet (1782–1855). His father, who had joined the French Revolutionary Army as a volunteer in 1792, rose to become a battalion commander and fought in the Revolutionary Wars until retiring to Mont-sous-Vaudrey under the Consulate. He operated a tile factory on his property.

At age 10, Grévy started attending school at the nearby town of Poligny, and continued his studies in Besançon, Dole, and finally at the Faculty of Law of Paris. He became a lawyer at the Paris bar in 1837, distinguishing himself at the Conférence du barreau de Paris. Having steadily maintained republican principles under the July Monarchy, he started his political activity as a defense attorney in the trial of Philippet and Quignot, two accomplies of Armand Barbès in a failed republican insurrection on 12 May 1839.

==Second Republic==

In 1848, a revolution in France abolished the July Monarchy and led to the creation of the Second Republic, and with it Grévy was appointed Commissioner of the Republic for the department of Jura. In April 1848 he was elected by that department for a seat in the constituent National Assembly. On the signed declaration for his candidacy, Grévy demanded a &quot;strong and liberal Republic, that makes itself loved for its wisdom and moderation&quot;. Foreseeing the rise of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in that year&#x27;s presidential election he began to advocate a weak executive branch, and became famous during the debates on the drafting of the Constitution for his opposition to electing the president by universal suffrage, instead proposing that the executive power should be vested on a &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;, who would be appointed and dismissed by the directly elected National Assembly. The &quot;Grévy Amendment&quot;, as it became known, was rejected, and in December 1848 Bonaparte was elected president of France.

Grévy was elected vice-president of the National Assembly in April 1849. The same month he protested against the president&#x27;s decision to launch an expedition against the revolutionary Roman Republic, created as part of the First Italian War of Independence, but the invasion proceeded and succeeded in restoring Papal rule. In 1851, his fear that Louis-Napoléon intended to perpetuate himself in power was proven true, when the president seized dictatorial power with a coup d&#x27;état on 2 December, in which Grévy was arrested and imprisoned in Mazas Prison. He was released shortly after but retired from politics in the subsequent French Empire, under now emperor Napoleon III, and returned to his law practice.

==Third Republic==
Grévy resumed his political career in the last years of the Empire. In 1868 he was elected to the Corps législatif, where he quickly emerged as a leader of the liberal opposition. Along with Adolphe Thiers and Léon Gambetta he opposed the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War, in 1870, and condemned the socialist insurrection of the Paris Commune. Upon the death of Thiers years later, in 1877, Grévy would become the head of the Republican Party.

After the collapse of the Empire in the Franco-Prussian War, Grévy was elected as representative of Jura and Bouches-du-Rhône to the National Assembly of the new Third Republic, in 1871. He served as president of the Assembly from February 1871 to April 1873, when he resigned on account of the opposition from the Right, which blamed him for having called one of its members to order in the session of the previous day. On 8 March 1876 Grévy was named president of the Chamber of Deputies, a post which he filled with such efficiency that upon the resignation of Legitimist president Marshal de MacMahon he seemed to step naturally into the Presidency of the Republic, and on 30 January 1879 was elected without opposition by the republican parties.

==Presidency==

Throughout his presidency, Grévy sought to minimize his powers and instead favored a strong legislature. On 6 February 1879, shortly after taking office, he made a speech before the Chambers where he explained his vision of the role of President: &quot;Subject with sincerity to the great law of the parliamentary regime, I will never enter into battle against national wishes expressed by its institutional bodies&quot;. This interpretation of the office&#x27;s limited power influenced most of the later presidents of the Third Republic.

In foreign policy he strove for peaceful relations, particularly with the German Empire, resisting revanchist demands for a retribution over the disastrous defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, and opposed colonial expansion. Among internal policies his presidency was marked by anti-clerical reforms, particularly under the government of prime minister Charles de Freycinet. In 1880, he passed an amnesty law in favor of the communards.
On 28 December 1885, Grévy was elected for another seven years as president of the Republic. Two years later however, in December 1887, he was compelled to resign due to a political scandal that started after his son-in-law, Daniel Wilson, was found to be selling awards of the Legion of Honour. Although Grévy himself was not implicated in the scheme, he was indirectly responsible for the misuse Wilson had made of the access to the Élysée. Under pressure from the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, Grévy resigned on 2 December and addressed a last message to the two chambers, in which he stated &quot;my duty and my right would be to resist, wisdom and patriotism command me to yield&quot;. This political matter was the first to feed anti-Masonic opinion in France.

Grévy wrote a two-volume &quot;Discours politiques et judiciaires&quot; (&quot;Political and Judicial Speeches&quot;) in 1888.

==Personal life==

Grévy married in 1848 to Coralie Frassie, the daughter of a tanner from Narbonne. They had one daughter, Alice (1849–1938), who married Daniel Wilson in 1881.

He died in his hometown of Mont-sous-Vaudrey on 9 September 1891, following a pulmonary edema. His state funeral was held on 14 September.

Initiated at the masonic lodge &quot;La Constante Amitié&quot; in Arras, his masonic activity was inseparable from his policies, especially in the ensuing struggle for separation of church and state that marked the beginning of the Third Republic and MacMahon&#x27;s resignation.

In private life, Grévy was an ardent billiards player, and was featured as one in a portrait published in the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in 1879.

He is referred to as one of Swann&#x27;s dinner hosts in Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

There is a type of lilac, &quot;Syringa vulgaris&quot; &#x27;President Grévy&#x27;, named after him.

Grévy&#x27;s zebra is named after him.

<text>Félix Antoine Philibert Dupanloup (3 January 180211 October 1878) was a French Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Orléans from 1849 to 1878. He was among the leaders of Liberal Catholicism in France.

==Biography==
Dupanloup was born at Saint-Félix, in Upper Savoy, (which at the time was part of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia rather than France) an illegitimate son of Prince Camillo Borghese. In his earliest years he was confided to the care of his brother, a priest in the diocese of Chambéry. In 1810 he was sent to a &quot;pensionnat ecclésiastique&quot; at Paris. Thence he went to the seminary of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet in 1813, and was transferred to the seminary of Saint Sulpice at Paris in 1820. In 1825 he was ordained priest, and was appointed vicar of the Madeleine at Paris. For a time he was tutor to the Orléans princes. He became the founder of a celebrated academy at St Hyacinthe, and received a letter from Gregory XVI lauding his work there, and calling him &quot;Apostolus juventutis&quot;.

He was elected to the Académie française in 1854, occupying the thirty-eighth chair and leading the academy&#x27;s &quot;religious party&quot;, in which capacity he manoeuvred against the election of agnostic intellectuals. Dupanloup resigned in 1875 after Émile Littré, an agnostic, was elected to the academy.

His imposing height, his noble features,his brilliant eloquence, as well as his renown for zeal and charity, made him a prominent feature in French life for many years. Crowds of persons attended his addresses, on whom his energy, command of language, powerful voice and impassioned gestures made a profound impression. When made bishop of Orléans in 1849, he pronounced a fervid panegyric on Joan of Arc, which attracted attention in England as well as France. Joan of Arc was later canonized, due partly to Dupanloup&#x27;s efforts. Before this, he had been sent by Archbishop Aifre to Rome, and had been appointed Roman prelate and protonotary apostolic.

For thirty years he remained a notable figure in France, doing his utmost to arouse his countrymen from religious indifference. He was a distinguished educationist who fought for the retention of the Latin classics in the schools and instituted the celebrated catechetical method of St Sulpice. Among his publications are:
* (1850)
* (3 vols., 1866)
* (1861, 4 vols.)
* (1872), a counterblast to Renan&#x27;s .

In ecclesiastical policy his views were moderate. Both before and during the First Vatican Council, he opposed the definition of the dogma of papal infallibility as inopportune, but after the definition was among the first to accept the dogma.

Dupanloup died on 11 October 1878 at the château of La Combe-de-Lancey.

==Memory==
In the work known as &quot;Illustrissimi&quot;, a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice, Dupanloup is one of the &quot;recipients&quot; of the letters. There are 40 letters in all, mainly to people in Italian history and fiction, but also to internationally well known fictional and historical characters such as Pinocchio, Charles Dickens, Hippocrates, and Jesus. Each of the letters tend to be droll and witty, but cleverly turned into a short sermon in order to make a point, whether it is on fashion, pornography, capitalism, or the communications industry.

In his book &quot;My Life and Loves&quot;, volume III, chapter 15, Frank Harris tells of an anecdote he told Prince Edward, The Prince of Wales, about the bishop:

<doc id="175880" wikidata="Q1248747" url="?curid=175880" title="Steptoe and Son">
<text>Steptoe and Son is a British sitcom written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson about a father-and-son rag-and-bone business in 26a Oil Drum Lane, a fictional street in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London. Four series were broadcast by the BBC in black and white from 1962 to 1965, followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974 in colour. The lead roles were played by Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett. The theme tune, &quot;Old Ned&quot;, was composed by Ron Grainer. The series was voted 15th in a 2004 poll by the BBC to find &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;. It was remade in the United States as &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, in Sweden as &quot;Albert &amp; Herbert&quot;, in the Netherlands as &quot;Stiefbeen en zoon&quot;, in Portugal as &quot;Camilo &amp; Filho&quot;, and in South Africa as &quot;Snetherswaite and Son&quot;. Two film adaptations of the series were released in cinemas, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (1972) and &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973).

The series focused on the inter-generational conflict of father and son. Albert Steptoe, a &quot;dirty old man&quot;, is an elderly rag-and-bone man, set in his grimy and grasping ways. By contrast, his son Harold is filled with social aspirations and pretensions. The show contained elements of drama and tragedy, such as how Harold was continually prevented from achieving his ambitions.

In 2000, the show was ranked number 44 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll Albert was ranked 39th on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

==Plot==
Many episodes revolve around sometimes violent disagreements between the two men, Harold&#x27;s attempts to bed women and momentary interest over things found on his round. Much of the humour derives from the pathos of the protagonists&#x27; situation, especially Harold&#x27;s continually thwarted (usually by the elder Steptoe) attempts to better himself, and the unresolvable love/hate relationship that exists between the pair.

Albert almost always comes out on top, and routinely proves himself superior to his son whenever they compete, such as when they played snooker into the night and pouring rain in 1970, and Scrabble and badminton in the 1972 series. Harold takes these games extremely seriously and sees them as symbols of his desire to improve himself, but his efforts come to nothing each time. His father&#x27;s success is partly down to greater skills but is aided by cynical gamesmanship and undermining of his son&#x27;s confidence. In addition, Albert habitually has better judgement than his son, who blunders into multiple con tricks and blind alleys as a result of his unrealistic, desperate straw-clutching approach. Occasionally the tables are turned, but overall the old man is the winner.

Harold is infuriated by these persistent frustrations and defeats, even going to the extent in &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; (1972) of attempting to partition the house so that he does not have to share with his selfish, uncultured and negative father. His plan ends in failure and ultimately he can see no way out. However, for all the bitterness there is an essential bond between the pair. In bad situations, Harold sticks by his father, and Albert looks out for his son. This protective bond is shown in several episodes, such as &quot;Full House&quot; (1963) when Albert wins back Harold&#x27;s money in a game of cards against Harold&#x27;s manipulative group of friends, and &quot;The Seven Steptoerai&quot; (1974) when they are menaced by a local gangster running a protection racket and team up with some of Albert&#x27;s friends to fight off the gangster&#x27;s thugs.

The 1974 Christmas special ended the run and it first appears Harold is once again at the bad end of poor planning, when he books a Christmas holiday abroad, but then finds his passport is out of date. His father must go alone, and Harold, tearfully it seems, waves him off to enjoy a potential good time without him. Harold trudges away, only to jump in a car with a woman to drive off on his own holiday, revealing that he had engineered the whole situation from the beginning.

&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; is the Steptoes&#x27; trading name, but as established in the first episode, the &quot;Son&quot; is not Harold as initially believed, but Albert. The name dates from when he and his mother (or father, depending on which storyline you believe) worked the rounds. The first series has the pair as very rough looking and often dirty and wearing ragged clothes, but they were portrayed as cleaner in later series.

==Characters==

The two main characters in the show are Albert Steptoe (Wilfrid Brambell) and Harold Steptoe (Harry H. Corbett). They have a large extended family who appear occasionally including many of Albert&#x27;s brothers and sisters, among them Auntie May (Rose Hill), Uncle Arthur (George A. Cooper) and Auntie Minnie (Mollie Sugden).

==Production==
Development

The show had its roots in a 1962 episode of &quot;Galton &amp; Simpson&#x27;s Comedy Playhouse&quot;. Galton and Simpson&#x27;s association with comedian Tony Hancock, for whom they had written &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, had ended and they had agreed to a proposal from the BBC to write a series of 10 comedy shows. The fourth in the series, &quot;The Offer&quot;, was born both out of writer&#x27;s block and budgetary constraints. Earlier shows in the series had cost more than expected, so the writers decided to write a two-hander set in one room. The idea of two brothers was considered but father and son worked best.

Galton and Simpson were not aiming to make a pilot for a series, having worked for seven years with Hancock. However, Tom Sloan, the BBC&#x27;s head of comedy, told them during rehearsals that &quot;The Offer&quot; was a definite series pilot: he saw that the Steptoe idea had potential. Galton and Simpson were reportedly overwhelmed by this reaction, and the first of what became eight series was commissioned, the first four of which were transmitted between 1962 and 1965. The last four series were broadcast between 1970 and 1974, in colour. At the peak of the series&#x27; popularity, it received viewing figures of some 28,000,000 viewers per episode. In addition, the early 1970s saw two feature films and two 46-minute Christmas specials. In 2005, a play based on the series was released called &quot;Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane&quot;, written by Ray Galton and John Antrobus.

Casting

Unlike other British TV series of the early 1960s, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; cast actors in its principal roles rather than comedians. Galton and Simpson had decided that they wanted to try to write for performers who &quot;didn&#x27;t count their laughs&quot;.

Both of the main actors used voices considerably different from their own. Brambell, despite being Irish, spoke with a received pronunciation English accent, as did the Manchester-raised Corbett. Brambell was aged 49 when he accepted the role of Albert, only 13 years older than Corbett. For his portrayal, he acquired a second set of &quot;rotten&quot; dentures to accentuate his character&#x27;s poor attitude to hygiene.

Music

Ron Grainer won a second successive Ivor Novello award for the show&#x27;s theme tune &#x27;Old Ned&#x27;, to which he gave a different treatment, one year later, during a Rag-and-Bone Man scene in The Home-Made Car. The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoes&#x27; horse, Hercules.

Locations

Outside filming of the Steptoes&#x27; yard took place at a car-breakers&#x27; yard in Norland Gardens, London W11, then changing to Stable Way, Latimer Road, for the later series. Both sites have subsequently been redeveloped with no evidence now remaining of the entrance gates through which the horse and cart were frequently driven.

The pilot episode and the first four series, which aired in 1962–1965, were recorded in the BBC Lime Grove Studios in London. When the show returned in 1970 after a four-year hiatus, the programme was made in the BBC Television Centre studios in west London, as from 1970 the show was recorded in colour.

Notability

During its production in the 1960s and 1970s, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; marked itself out as radical compared to most UK sitcoms. This was an age when the predominant sources of laughter in British comedy were farce, coincidence, slapstick and innuendo. However &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; brought greater social realism. Its characters were not only working class but demonstrably poor. The earthy language and slang used were in marked contrast to the refined voices heard on most television of the time: e.g., in &quot;Back in Fashion&quot;, Harold warns Albert that when the models arrive, &quot;if you feels like a D&#x27;Oyly Carte (rhyming slang for &#x27;fart&#x27;), you goes outside.&quot; Social issues and debates were routinely portrayed, woven into the humour. The programme did not abandon the more traditional sources of comedy but used them in small doses. The characters, and their intense and difficult relationship, displayed deeper qualities of writing and performance than comedy fans were used to.

==Episodes==
&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; is rare among 1960s BBC television programmes, in that every episode has survived and exists in the BBC Archives, despite the mass wiping of many BBC archive holdings between 1967 and 1978. However, all the instalments from the first 1970 series and all but two from the second were originally made in colour and are only known to survive in the form of black and white domestic videotape recordings. Copies were made from the master tapes for the writers by an engineer at the BBC using a Shibaden SV-700 half-inch reel-to-reel video recorder—a forerunner of the video cassette recorder. In 2008, the first reel of a black and white telerecording of the Series 5 episode &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (lasting approximately 15 minutes) was returned to the BBC; this is the only telerecording of a colour &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; episode known to still exist. Of the 30 episodes produced in colour, 17 exist in their original colour format.

The original 2&quot; Quad videotapes of all the episodes of the original 1962–65 series were wiped in the late 1960s. However, these episodes mostly survive on film transfers of the original videotapes as 16mm black and white telerecordings. The exceptions to this are &quot;The Stepmother&quot;, &quot;The Wooden Overcoats&quot;, &quot;The Lodger&quot; and &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Tory&quot;, which exist as optical transfers made from domestic 405 line reel to reel videotapes obtained from writers Galton and Simpson.

The BBC has released 10 DVDs of the series—each of the eight series, and two compilations entitled &quot;The Very Best of Steptoe and Son&quot; volumes 1 and 2. Two Christmas specials are also available on DVD, as are two feature films: &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot;. A boxed set of Series 1–8 and the two Christmas specials was released on Region 2 DVD by 2entertain on 29 October 2007.

In addition, 52 episodes were remade for BBC Radio, initially on the Light Programme in 1966–67 and later Radio 2 from 1971 to 1976.

A special one-off remake of the &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; episode aired on BBC Four on 14 September 2016, as part of the BBC&#x27;s Lost Sitcom season recreating lost episodes of classic sitcoms.

==Sketch appearances==
* In 1962, Brambell and Corbett appeared as Steptoe and Son in a short sketch written by Galton and Simpson on the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot; programme, broadcast on 25 December 1962. There are no known recordings.
* In 1963, they appeared on the ITV Royal Variety Performance in a sketch written by Galton and Simpson featuring Steptoe and Son totting outside Buckingham Palace, the telerecording of the live show, broadcast on 10 November 1963, still exists. The audio of the sketch was also released on a 7-inch single.
* On 31 December 1963 the BBC broadcast an edition of It&#x27;s a Square World which featured a cameo by Wilfrid Brambell as Albert Steptoe witnessing the launch of BBC TV Centre into space. The sketch was included as an extra on the special edition DVD release of Doctor Who: The Aztecs
* In 1966, they appeared on the BBC series &quot;The Ken Dodd Show&quot; in another live on stage sketch written by Galton and Simpson featuring Steptoe and Son on Blackpool beach, with Ken Dodd in the last two minutes as a strange golf professional. A telerecording of the show, broadcast on 24 July 1966, survives.
* In 1967, they appeared in character in a short filmed sequence for the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot; programme. The black and white film sequence featuring Steptoe and Son, broadcast on 25 December 1967, still exists.
* In 1978, they recorded a Radio 2 sketch, referred to by fans as &quot;Scotch on the Rocks&quot;, produced especially for a show titled &quot;Good Luck Scotland&quot;. This was again written by Galton and Simpson and had a basic premise of Albert wishing to go to Argentina to watch the Scottish football team play in the 1978 World Cup as the &quot;Good Luck Scotland&quot; title of the programme referred to Scotland&#x27;s chances of winning the World Cup that year.

==Adverts==
In 1977, Brambell and Corbett appeared in character for two television ads for Ajax cleaning products, recorded during their tour of Australia. In 1981, their final ever appearance together was in a UK advert for Kenco Coffee.

==In other media==
Audio

A number of LPs and EPs featuring TV soundtracks have been released.

Books

To tie in with the original series, two novelisations were written by Gale Pedrick:
*
In 2002 BBC Books published &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; by Galton, Simpson and Ross, which comprehensively covered the television and radio series, films, Royal Variety Shows, commercials and the &quot;Sanford &amp; Son&quot; spin-off.

==Other countries==
* United States; in 1963 Jack Paar screened an episode of &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; during one of his one-hour Friday night shows on NBC. Paar was an anglophile and frequently spotlighted British culture on his show. Later in 1963 he screened a film-clip of The Beatles, their first appearance on U.S. TV. In 1965 Joseph E. Levine produced a pilot based on &quot;The Offer&quot; for the American market with Galton and Simpson. Starring Lee Tracy as Albert and Aldo Ray as Harold, it was unscreened, and did not lead to a series. The pilot was released on DVD in the UK in 2018. The concept was later re-worked as &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, a top-rated series that ran for five years (1972–77) on the NBC network.

* Sweden; Sten-Åke Cederhök and Tomas von Brömssen starred in &quot;Albert &amp; Herbert&quot;. The pair lived at Skolgatan 15, an address in a working-class neighbourhood of Haga, Gothenburg.
* The Netherlands; &quot;Stiefbeen en Zoon&quot; ran for thirty-three episodes. It was awarded the 1964 Golden Televizier Ring.
* Norway; the 1975 Norwegian film, &quot;Skraphandlerne&quot;, starred Leif Juster and Tom Tellefsen. The names of the characters were Albert and Herbert, the names of the characters in the Swedish remake.
* Portugal; &quot;Camilo &amp; Filho Lda.&quot;, starring famous Portuguese comedian Camilo de Oliveira, with Nuno Melo as his son.
*South Africa: broadcast on the South African Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s commercial radio station Springbok Radio (now closed down) as &quot;Snetherswaite and Son&quot; in 1980. The run of 56 episodes was produced in Durban by veteran radio comedy producer Tom Meehan. It starred Tommy Read as Albert and Brian Squires as Harold. The name Steptoe was changed to Snetherswaite for the South African series, a recurring character Tommy Read played in the SABC version of &quot;&quot;The Men from the Ministry&quot;&quot; called Humbert Snetherswaite.

==Films==
Steptoe and Son

In 1972 a film version was released of the show proving highly popular. This first film, also called &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; focuses on Harold getting married but still not being able to get away from his father.

Steptoe and Son Ride Again

Due to popular demand and the commercial success of the first film, another film, &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot;, was released in 1973.

==Spin-offs==
===Television===
====&quot;When Steptoe Met Son&quot;====

&quot;When Steptoe Met Son&quot; was a 2002 Channel 4 documentary about the personal lives of Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H. Corbett. It aired on 20 August 2002.

The programme reveals how Brambell and Corbett were highly dissimilar to their on-screen characters. Corbett felt he had a promising career as a serious actor, but was trapped by his role as Harold and forced to keep returning to the series after typecasting limited his choice of work. Brambell, meanwhile, was a homosexual, something that in the 1960s was still frowned upon and - until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 - illegal, and thus driven underground. The documentary went on to describe an ill-fated final tour of Australia, during which the already strained relationship between Corbett and Brambell finally broke down for good.

====&quot;The Curse of Steptoe&quot;====

The Curse of Steptoe is a television play which was first broadcast on 19 March 2008 on BBC Four as part of a season of dramas about television personalities. It stars Jason Isaacs as Harry H. Corbett and Phil Davis as Wilfrid Brambell. The drama is based upon the actors&#x27; on-and-off-screen relationship during the making of the BBC sitcom &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, and is based on interviews with colleagues, friends and family of the actors, and the &quot;Steptoe&quot; writers, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson.

The screenplay was written by Brian Fillis, also responsible for the similarly themed 2006 drama &quot;Fear of Fanny&quot;, which is about television personality Fanny Cradock off-screen. The 66-minute film is directed by Michael Samuels and produced by Ben Bickerton.

Both &quot;When Steptoe Met Son&quot; and &quot;The Curse of Steptoe&quot; were considered inaccurate by writers Galton and Simpson and Corbett&#x27;s family.

===Theatre===
====&quot;Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane&quot;====
In October 2005, Ray Galton and John Antrobus premiered their play, &quot;Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane&quot;, at the Theatre Royal, York. It then went on tour across the country. It was set in the present day and related the events leading to Harold killing his father and their eventual meeting 30 years later, Albert then appearing as a ghost. 

It was not the first time this idea had been considered. When Wilfrid Brambell left the UK after the third series to pursue an eventually unsuccessful Broadway musical career, Galton and Simpson toyed with the concept of &#x27;killing off&#x27; Albert in order to continue the show without having to await Brambell&#x27;s return. The character would have been replaced with Harold&#x27;s illegitimate son, Arthur (a part thought to be intended for actor David Hemmings). This idea was detested by Corbett, who thought it ridiculous, although the 2008 drama &quot;The Curse of Steptoe&quot; depicts Corbett as being delighted with the concept, since assuming the role of father would allow Harold&#x27;s character some development and growth, which he felt was long overdue.

====&quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;====
In March 2011 the Engine Shed Theatre Company performed three episodes of the series live on stage at the Capitol Theatre, Horsham. Jack Lane played Albert Steptoe and Michael Simmonds played Harold. The three episodes performed by the company were: &quot;Men of Letters&quot;, &quot;Robbery With Violence&quot; and &quot;Seance in a Wet Rag and Bone Yard&quot;. Engine Shed went on to adapt and perform the two Christmas Specials later that year.

Many of the original TV episodes of Steptoe and Son have now been officially adapted to the stage by the original writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, with David Pibworth.

Steptoe and Son by Hambledon Productions

Between 2017 - 2022, theatre company Hambledon Productions produced four consecutive tours, based on the original Galton and Simpson scripts. These included &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; (2017-2018, featuring the episodes: &quot;Come Dancing, Men of Letters&quot; and &quot;Divided We Stand&quot;), &quot;Christmas with Steptoe and Son&quot; (2018-2019, featuring the episodes: &quot;The Party, The Bath&quot; and &quot;A Perfect Christmas&quot;), &quot;Steptoe and Son Radio Show: Christmas Edition&quot; (2021, a radio play based on the previous tour) and &quot;The Steptoe and Son Radio Show&quot; (2022) featuring the episodes &quot;Is That Your Horse Outside?, Upstairs, Downstairs, Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; and &quot;A Death in the Family.&quot; This recent tour was co-produced with Apollo Theatre Company. Across all these productions, John Hewer played Harold Steptoe and Jeremy Smith played Albert Steptoe. 

====&quot;Steptoe and Son by Kneehigh&quot;====

Performed in 2012 and 2013 by Kneehigh Theatre, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; was adapted from four of the show&#x27;s original scripts. The production was designed to highlight the Beckettian nature of Albert and Harold&#x27;s situation, focusing on themes of over-reliance and being trapped within social class. The production toured the UK and received positive reviews from the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and three stars from &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Lynn Gardner.

<doc id="175882" wikidata="Q5719616" url="?curid=175882" title="Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn">
<text>Henry Thomas Cockburn of Bonaly, Lord Cockburn ( ; Cockpen, Midlothian, 26 October 1779 – Bonaly, Midlothian, 26 April/18 July 1854) was a Scottish lawyer, judge and literary figure. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland between 1830 and 1834.

==Background and education==

His mother Janet Rannie was a sister-in-law of the influential Lord Melville, through her sister Elizabeth, and his father, Archibald Cockburn, was Sheriff of Midlothian and Baron of the Court of Exchequer. He was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh.

His brother, John Cockburn FRSE (died 1862), was a wine merchant and founder of Cockburn&#x27;s of Leith.

==Literary career==
Cockburn contributed regularly to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. In this popular magazine of its day he is described as: &quot;rather below the middle height, firm, wiry and muscular, inured to active exercise of all kinds, a good swimmer, an accomplished skater, an intense lover of the fresh breezes of heaven. He was the model of a high-bred Scotch gentleman. He spoke with a Doric breadth of accent. Cockburn was one of the most popular men north of the Tweed.&quot; He was a member of the famous Speculative Society, to which Sir Walter Scott, Henry Brougham and Francis Jeffrey belonged.

The extent of Cockburn&#x27;s literary ability only became known after he had passed his 70th year, on the publication of his biography of lifelong friend Lord Jeffrey in 1852, and from his chief literary work, the &quot;Memorials of his Time&quot;, which appeared posthumously in 1856. His published work continued with his &quot;Journal&quot;, published in 1874. These constitute an autobiography of the writer interspersed with notices of manners, public events, and sketches of his contemporaries, of great interest and value.

==Legal and judicial career==

Cockburn entered the Faculty of Advocates in 1800, and attached himself, not to the party of his relatives, who could have afforded him most valuable patronage, but to the Whig party, and that at a time when it held out few inducements to men ambitious of success in life. He became a distinguished advocate, and ultimately a judge. He was one of the leaders of the Whig party in Scotland in its days of darkness prior to the Reform Act 1832, and was a close friend of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. He was the defence lawyer for Helen McDougal, Burke&#x27;s wife, in the trial for the Burke and Hare murders, and won her acquittal.

On the accession of Earl Grey&#x27;s ministry in 1830 he became Solicitor General for Scotland. During his time here he drafted the First Scottish Reform Bill. In 1834 he was raised to the bench, and on taking his seat as a Judge in the Court of Session he adopted the title of Lord Cockburn as a Scottish Lord of Session.

==Conservation==

Whilst Lord Cockburn&#x27;s name is usually associated with building conservation, this reputation is somewhat misplaced as his interest was very selective. In 1845 he purchased the entire estate of Bonaly, south-west of Edinburgh. He rebuilt the farmhouse in a romantic fashion, adding a tower, and renaming it Bonaly Tower. However, the rest of the village (which appears to have dated from the 17th century or older) was razed to the ground to improve views from his new house. There is no record of what became of the inhabitants of the village.

==Family==
Cockburn married Elizabeth Macdowall, daughter of James Macdowall and his second wife Margaret Jamieson, in Edinburgh, Midlothian, on 12 March 1811. As was common in the period he had both a town house and country house. The country house was at Bonaly, on the south-west edge of Edinburgh. His large town house at 14 Charlotte Square, in the west end of the city, was designed by Robert Adam. They had five daughters and six sons:

The authors Alec Waugh and Evelyn Waugh, the journalist Claud Cockburn, Claudia Cockburn (wife of actor Michael Flanders) and author Sarah Caudwell were all descended from Cockburn, as are journalists Laura Flanders, Stephanie Flanders, Alexander Cockburn (husband of author Emma Tennant), Andrew Cockburn (husband of journalist Leslie Cockburn) and Patrick Cockburn (son-in-law of Bishop Hugh Montefiore) and actress Olivia Wilde (former wife of Tao Ruspoli).

==Death and legacy==
Cockburn died on 26 April 1854, at his mansion of Bonaly, near Edinburgh and is buried in the city&#x27;s Dean Cemetery. A statue of him by local sculptor William Brodie stands in the north-east corner of Parliament Hall.

Cockburn Street, built in the 1850s to connect the High Street with the North British Railway&#x27;s Waverley station, is also named after him. The building at the foot of the street, formerly the &quot;Cockburn Hotel&quot;, bears his image in profile in a stone above the entrance.

Cockburn had an interest in architectural conservation, particularly in Edinburgh, where several important historic buildings such as John Knox&#x27;s House and Tailors&#x27; Hall in the Cowgate owe their continued existence to the change in attitude towards conservation which he helped bring about. The Cockburn Association (Edinburgh Civic Trust), founded in 1875, was named in his honour.

Cockburn was played by Russell Hunter in &quot;Cocky&quot;, a one-man play which was effectively a dramatisation of his memoirs, broadcast on BBC Scotland. It ended with his closing speech to the jury in the Burke and Hare trial.

<doc id="175883" wikidata="Q2604344" url="?curid=175883" title="List of theological demons">
<text>This is a list of demons that appear in religion, theology, demonology, mythology, and folklore. It is not a list of names of demons, although some are listed by more than one name.

The list of demons in fiction includes those from literary fiction with theological aspirations, such as Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. Because numerous concern mythology, folklore, and folk fairy tales, much overlap may be expected.

<text>Robotic control is the system that contributes to the movement of robots. This involves the mechanical aspects and programmable systems that makes it possible to control robots. Robotics can be controlled by various means including manual, wireless, semi-autonomous (a mix of fully automatic and wireless control), and fully autonomous (using artificial intelligence).

== Modern robots (2000-present) ==

=== Medical and surgical ===
In the medical field, robots are used to make precise movements that are difficult for humans. Robotic surgery involves the use of less-invasive surgical methods, which are “procedures performed through tiny incisions”. Robots use the da Vinci surgical method, which involves the robotic arm (which holds onto surgical instruments) and a camera. The surgeon sits on a console where he controls the robot wirelessly. The feed from the camera is projected on a monitor, allowing the surgeon to see the incisions. The system is built to mimic the movement of the surgeon’s hands and has the ability to filter slight hand tremors. But despite the visual feedback, there is no physical feedback. In other words, as the surgeon applies force on the console, the surgeon won’t be able to feel how much pressure he or she is applying to the tissue.

=== Military ===
The earliest robots used in the military dates back to the 19th century, where automatic weapons were on the rise due to developments in mass production. The first automated weapons were used in World War I, including radio-controlled, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Since the invention, the technology of ground and aerial robotic weapons continues to develop, it transitioned to become part of modern warfare. In the transition phase of the development, the robots were semi-automatic, being able to be controlled remotely by a human controller. The advancements made in sensors and processors lead to advancements in capabilities of military robots. Since the mid-20th century, the technology of artificial intelligence (A.I.) began to develop and in the 21st century, the technology transferred to warfare, and the weapons that were semi-automatous is developing to become lethal autonomous weapons systems, LAWS for short.

==== Impact ====
As the weapons are being developed to become fully autonomous, there is an ambiguous line of what is the line that separates an enemy to a civilian. There is currently a debate of whether or not artificial intelligence is able to differentiate these enemies and the question of what is morally and humanely right (for example, a child unknowingly working for the enemies).

=== Space exploration ===
Space missions involve sending robots into space in the goal of discovering more of the unknown. The robots used in space exploration have been controlled semi-autonomously. The robots that are sent to space have the ability to maneuver itself, and are self-sustaining. To allow for data collection and a controlled research, the robot is always in communications with scientists and engineers on Earth. For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Curiosity rover, which is part of their Mars exploration program, the communication between the rover and the operators are made possible by “an international network of antennas that…permits constant observation of spacecraft as the Earth rotates on its own axis”.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in robotic control to make it able to process and adapt to its surroundings. It is able to be programmed to do a certain task, for instance, walk up a hill. The technology is relatively new, and is being experimented in several fields, such as the military.

==== Boston Dynamics&#x27; robots ====
Boston Dynamic’s “Spot” is an autonomous robot that uses four sensors and allows the robot to map where it is relative to its surroundings. The navigational method is called simultaneous localization and mapping, or “SLAM” for short. Spot has several operating modes and depending on the obstacles in front of the robot, it has the ability to override the manual mode of the robot and perform actions successfully. This is similar to other robots made by Boston Dynamics, like the “Atlas”, which also has similar methods of control. When the “Atlas” is being controlled, the control software doesn’t explicitly tell the robot how to move its joints, but rather it employs mathematical models of the underlying physics of the robot’s body and how it interacts with the environment”. Instead of inputting data into every single joint of the robot, the engineers programmed the robot as a whole, which makes it more capable to adapt to its environment. The information in this source is dissimilar to other sources, except the second source, because robots vary so much depending on the situation.

<doc id="175889" wikidata="Q1417866" url="?curid=175889" title="Groovebox">
<text>A groovebox is a self-contained electronic or digital musical instrument for the production of live, loop-based electronic music with a high degree of user control facilitating improvisation. The term &quot;Groovebox&quot; was originally used by Roland Corporation to refer to its MC-303, released in 1996. The term has since entered general use, and the concept dates back to the Movement Computer Systems Drum Computer in 1981 and Fairlight CMI &quot;Page R&quot; in 1982.

A groovebox consists of three integrated elements. 
* One or more sound sources, such as a drum machine, a synthesizer, or a sampler
* A music sequencer
* A control surface that is a combination of knobs (potentiometers or rotary encoders), sliders, and/or buttons, and display elements (LEDs and/or an LCD screen)

The integration of these elements into a single system allows the musician to rapidly construct and control a pattern-based sequence, often with multiple instrumental or percussion voices playing simultaneously.

These sequences may also be quickly chained together into a song in a live performance. Grooveboxes allow sequences and songs to be saved, retrieved from memory, and inserted into the current performance whilst playing. In some cases, an entire musical performance may be created by a single player with a single groovebox. In other cases, the groovebox is simply one instrument amongst many. This is reflected by the large variety of grooveboxes available, ranging from Roland&#x27;s lower-end MC and SP products which include basic sequencing and sampling capabilities, to Akai&#x27;s flagship MPC 4000 and 5000, Yamaha&#x27;s RS7000 or Roland&#x27;s own MV-8800 which include features such as high-end sampling, high-polyphony synthesizers, and extensive sequencing, connection and storage possibilities.

Groovebox style instruments have facilitated many performers, both amateur and professional, who may have previously been unfamiliar with electronic music, to explore the genre. Whilst some in the genre initially derided these instruments (in particular the MC-303) and the opening of the field as leading to a drop in standards, they are now generally accepted as having a legitimate place in the form. In addition, many performers and bands from outside the electronic community have integrated groovebox instruments into their shows, as a convenient way of incorporating electronic sound into a more traditional format. The sequencer and control aspects of a groovebox may be used to control an external instrument over MIDI, and the internal voices may similarly be controlled by external equipment.

A groovebox is similar to a music workstation. The general differences are that it will often omit, or include only a simplified keyboard, is designed to be portable, and will usually include more user controls. Whereas a workstation is often targeted towards studio musicians and composers, grooveboxes are designed more to suit the needs of live performers. However, units matching either description are used both on stage and in the studio. A defining characteristic of a groovebox is the ability for the performer to alter both the sequence and the sound parameters in real time, without interruption of the performance. Units marketed as such, which have failed to implement this feature correctly, or at all, have not been well received.

The Roland Groovebox may also be compared to drum machines such as the earlier Roland TR series (606, 808, 909 etc.), or to their TB-303, and the term has retroactively been applied to such units.

<text>Spin Doctors are an American alternative rock band from New York City, best known for their early 1990s hits &quot;Two Princes&quot; and &quot;Little Miss Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, which peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at No. 7 and No. 17, respectively.

The band currently consists of Chris Barron (lead vocals), Eric Schenkman (guitar and vocals), Aaron Comess (drums and keyboards) and Jack Daley (bass).

==History==
The group originated in the late 1980s in New York City, originally as a band called Trucking Company; this band included Canadian guitarist Eric Schenkman, harmonicist John Popper, and later vocalist Chris Barron, who was Popper&#x27;s Princeton, New Jersey high school friend. Popper left this side project to focus on his main gig with Blues Traveler full-time. With a name change to Spin Doctors, as well as the addition of Aaron Comess on drums and Mark White on bass, the classic lineup was in place by the spring of 1989.

Spin Doctors signed with Epic Records/Sony Music A&amp;R executive Frankie LaRocka in 1990. The band&#x27;s Epic debut EP &quot;Up for Grabs...Live&quot; was recorded live at the Wetlands Preserve in lower Manhattan, and released in January 1991. (In November 1992, these EP tracks were remixed and supplemented by additional live recordings to form the album &quot;Homebelly Groove...Live&quot;.) Spin Doctors were known for their somewhat lengthy live shows, sometimes jamming even more than is evident on their live releases. They also often performed double-bill gigs opening for Blues Traveler, with members of both bands all jamming together as the transition from Spin Doctors set into the Blues Traveler set. Spin Doctors have many songs from their early club days that were never officially released, but remain circulated via concert recordings.

Spin Doctors&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Pocket Full of Kryptonite&quot;, was released in August 1991. The band continued to play extensive live shows, gaining grassroots fans, as the album was mostly ignored commercially. In the summer of 1992, the band toured with the first lineup of the H.O.R.D.E. festival, sharing the stage with fellow jam bands Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler, and Phish. That summer, commercial popularity heated up, as radio and MTV began playing &quot;Little Miss Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Two Princes&quot;, with the videos directed by filmmaker Rich Murray (who would direct many of the band&#x27;s videos). The album went Gold in September 1992, and then received another boost in sales after the band&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October 1992. Additional videos and singles followed for &quot;What Time Is It&quot;, &quot;How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?)&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s Blues&quot;. By June 1993, the album went Triple Platinum. Ultimately it sold over five million copies in the U.S. and another five million overseas, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart.
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, which put the band on its cover in January 1993, said the band&#x27;s &quot;popularity is based on universal rock &amp; roll virtues ... The Doctors aren&#x27;t trying to blaze new trails. They know we&#x27;ve been down this way with the Stones, Curtis Mayfield, and a few of their other touchstones. But the proof—plenty of it—is in the party.&quot; Spin Doctors made an appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (episode 3450), singing a modified version of &quot;Two Princes&quot; that emphasized the importance of sharing starring Elmo, Zoe, and Telly. Another song on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featured Muppet versions of their band starring Count von Count and Zoe singing &quot;Little Miss Count Along&quot; based on their hit &quot;Little Miss Can&#x27;t be Wrong&quot; that focused on counting. In 1993, they recorded covers of &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;, originally by Creedence Clearwater Revival, for the film &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; for &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;.

Spin Doctors&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Turn It Upside Down&quot;, released in June 1994, was less commercially successful than &quot;Pocket Full of Kryptonite&quot;, but sold a million copies in the U.S. and another million internationally. The second single, &quot;You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast&quot;, was a modest hit (No. 42 on the pop chart). The band set out on a three-month headlining tour, and played to large crowds at Woodstock &#x27;94 and the Glastonbury Festival. Shortly after the release of &quot;Turn It Upside Down&quot;, original guitarist Eric Schenkman left the band in September 1994 by walking offstage during a concert in Berkeley, California, citing musical and personal differences, and being weary of the road. Schenkman was replaced by Anthony Krizan.

Featuring new guitarist Krizan, Spin Doctors released &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Believe in Something&quot; in May 1996. It produced the single and video &quot;She Used to Be Mine&quot;. They performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and did some touring, with Ivan Neville joining the band on keyboards. During this period, Spin Doctors contributed the theme song to Seasons 2 and 3 of the television show &quot;Spin City.&quot; After touring wrapped up in the fall of 1996, Krizan eventually left the band, for reasons that remain relatively unknown. He was replaced by Israeli musician Eran Tabib after auditioning nearly 200 candidates. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Believe in Something&quot; did not live up to previous album sales, selling only 75,000 copies. Epic dropped the band in 1996.
In 1998, Spin Doctors signed to Uptown/Universal and released &quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot; in June 1999. During the recording of the album, Mark White left the band. The bass tracks on the album were finished by original band member Aaron Comess. During the tour supporting the album, Barron lost his voice due to a rare acute form of vocal cord paralysis that severely affected his ability to talk and sing. He was told he had a 50/50 chance of ever talking or singing normally again. Keyboardist Ivan Neville also took over vocal duties for a few dates, but the band eventually cancelled the remainder of its tour. Barron&#x27;s voice came back in early 2000 (first comeback [solo] shows in March 2000), at which point he began performing with his band and the Give Daddy Five. Barron undertook what he calls &quot;a journeyman songwriting experience&quot;, composing tunes with Blues Traveler&#x27;s John Popper and with former BMI executive Jeff Cohen.
Spin Doctors remained inactive as a band until September 2001, when news about the closing of Wetlands sparked the original four members to reunite. On September 7, 2001, the original lineup took the stage for the first time since 1994 to play at Wetlands. It was the final closing week of the club. The landmark show was a great success for the fans and the band.

Odd shows followed in 2002 through 2005, which eventually led to a brand new studio album, &quot;Nice Talking to Me&quot;, released on September 13, 2005. The single &quot;Can&#x27;t Kick the Habit&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot;. It received moderate radio airplay, along with the songs &quot;Margarita&quot; and the title track &quot;Nice Talking to Me&quot;. While the record received good reviews, follow-up proved difficult when the record company that released it went out of business.

In 2008, the band continued to play one-off live shows in the United States and Europe. Drummer Aaron Comess released an instrumental record of all his own compositions entitled &quot;Catskills Cry&quot; featuring bassist Tony Levin and guitarist Bill Dillon. In 2009, Barron released the solo record &quot;Pancho and the Kid&quot; on Valley Entertainment. During the summer of 2010, Barron released &quot;Songs from the Summer of Sangria&quot;. This five-song EP was his first official release with his band The Time Bandits.

In 2011, the band celebrated the 20-year anniversary of &quot;Pocket Full of Kryptonite&quot; with a UK and US tour. Sony Legacy released a 20th anniversary edition with bonus material on August 29, 2011.

In April 2013, the band released &quot;If the River Was Whiskey&quot;, their sixth studio album.

In January 2022, the band fired longtime bassist Mark White after 33 years over his refusal to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

In August 2024, the band announced on their Facebook page that touring bassist Jack Daley has joined the band as a full-time member.

On January 16th, 2025, the band released their first single in over a decade: &quot;Still a Gorilla&quot;, and announced their next album, &quot;Face Full of Cake&quot;.

<doc id="175897" wikidata="Q1018680" url="?curid=175897" title="Coconut Grove">
<text>Coconut Grove, also known colloquially as “The Grove,” is an affluent and the oldest continuously inhabited neighborhood of Miami in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The neighborhood is roughly bounded by North Prospect Drive to the south, LeJeune Road to the west, South Dixie Highway (US 1) and Rickenbacker Causeway to the north, and Biscayne Bay to the east. It is south of the neighborhoods of Brickell and The Roads and east of Coral Gables. The neighborhood&#x27;s name has been sometimes spelled &quot;Cocoanut Grove&quot; but the definitive spelling &quot;Coconut Grove&quot; was established when the city was incorporated in 1919.

What is today referred to as Coconut Grove was formed in 1925 when the city of Miami annexed two areas of about equal size, the city of Coconut Grove and most of the town of Silver Bluff. Coconut Grove approximately corresponds to the same area as the 33133 ZIP Code although the ZIP Code includes parts of Coral Way and Coral Gables and a small portion of ZIP Code 33129. The area is often referred to as &quot;The Grove,” and locals take pride that Coconut Grove is one of the greenest areas of Miami.

Coconut Grove is directly served by the Miami Metrorail at Coconut Grove and Douglas Road stations.

== History ==
Several waves of immigration established Coconut Grove, the first in 1825, when the Cape Florida lighthouse went into operation, kept by John Dubose. The settlers primarily came from the Northeastern United States, in addition to British and Bahamian immigrants. They included sailors, naturalists, and artists. Many Black Bahamian immigrants were hired to construct the historical landmarks in and around Coconut Grove. They were believed to be the only people capable of withstanding the extreme heat and humidity, as well as the large mosquito population.

Dr. Horace P. Porter is credited for coming up with the name when, in 1873, he rented a home from Edmond D. Beasley&#x27;s widow, who homesteaded 160 acres of bay-front property. He lived there for only a year, but during that time, he established a post office which he named “Coconut Grove.”

The first hotel on the South Florida mainland was located in Coconut Grove. Called the Bay View Inn (later known as the Peacock Inn), it was built in 1882 on the site of present-day Peacock Park by English immigrants Isabella and Charles Peacock, who had been the owners of a wholesale meat business in London. Coconut Grove&#x27;s first Black settlement, in the 1880s, was established by Bahamian laborers who worked at the Peacock Inn. The Barnacle Historic State Park is the oldest house in Miami-Dade County still standing in its original location. It was built in 1891, and was home to Ralph Middleton Munroe, also known as &quot;The Commodore&quot; for being the first commodore and founder of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club, an American yacht designer, and early resident of Coconut Grove.

Formerly an independent city, Coconut Grove was annexed by the city of Miami in 1925. In the 1960s, bay-shore Coconut Grove served as the center of South Florida&#x27;s youth countercultural movement, notably hosting several love-ins and concerts (including a now-infamous Doors concert at Dinner Key Auditorium) during the latter part of the decade. The Bahamian community continued to grow in Coconut Grove through the 1970s.

A surge of commercial development in Coconut Grove was driven by the construction of three major residential complexes during the late 1970s and early 1980s: Yacht Harbour Condominiums in 1975; Grove Isle, a condominium, club, and hotel complex, in 1979; and L&#x27;Hermitage in 1980. This was followed by the opening of 2575 S. Bayshore Drive in 1982 and the 1983 opening of Grove Towers. Further development was proposed for Grove Isle in 2013.

== Economy ==

Coconut Grove has a number of outdoor festivals and events, the most prominent of which is the annual Coconut Grove Arts Festival. Others include the King Mango Strut, which began as a parody of the Orange Bowl Parade, and which continues each year on the last Sunday in December. The Great Taste of the Grove Food &amp; Wine Festival takes place each April. Each June, the Goombay Festival transforms Grand Avenue in Coconut Grove into a Carnaval (Caribbean Carnival), celebrating Bahamian culture, with Bahamian food and Caribbean music (Junkanoo).

The Grove has numerous restaurants, open air and streetside cafes, and several waterfront restaurants and bars. By night, the Grove becomes a center of nightlife frequented by locals, young professionals, students from the nearby University of Miami and Florida International University, and tourists.

Shopping is abundant in the Grove, with two open-air malls, CocoWalk, the Streets of Mayfair, and many other street shops and boutiques.

The Village Center, the three blocks radiating from and focusing on the intersection of Main, McFarland, and Grand Avenues, home to the majority of the retail and restaurant business in the Grove, is also home to three gyms, a multiplex movie house in CocoWalk, several parking garages, a state historic site, an elementary school, a City of Miami fire station, several large condos and residential rental towers, the Coconut Grove Post Office, and two sizable parks.

<text>Robot was a German imaging company known originally for clockwork cameras, later producing surveillance (Traffipax) and bank security cameras. Originally created in 1934 as a brand of Otto Berning, it became part of the Jenoptik group of optical companies in 1999, and specializes in traffic surveillance today.

The motorized amateur cameras powered by clockwork (spring) motors were first made in 1934, and ended with a special limited edition collector&#x27;s model, &quot;Star Classic&quot;, in 1996. The Robot film cameras used 35 mm film, mostly in square 24 × 24 mm image format, but many used 18 × 24 mm (half-frame) and 24 × 36 mm (standard Leica format), and non-standard formats such as 6 × 24 mm (Recorder 6), 12 × 24 mm (Recorder 12) and 16 × 16 mm (Robot SC).

==Camera Models==

===Robot I===
Around 1930 Heinz Kilfitt, a trained watchmaker, designed a new 35 mm film compact camera using a 24×24 mm frame format (instead of the Leica 24×36 mm or cine 18×24 mm formats). The 24×24mm square frame provided many advantages, including allowing over 50 exposures per standard roll of Leica film instead of 36. Kodak and Agfa rejected the design, and it was sold to Hans Berning, who set up the Otto Berning firm.

Otto Berning was granted its first Robot patent in 1934; a US patent was granted in 1936. The camera was originally intended to come in two versions: Robot I, without motor, and Robot II with a spring motor. Its release was delayed and already the first camera &quot;Robot I&quot; included its hallmark spring motor. The first production cameras had a stainless steel body, a spring drive that could shoot 4 frames per second, and a rotary shutter with speeds from 1 to 1/500th second. The camera used proprietary &quot;Type K&quot; cartridges, not the now-standard 35 mm cartridges introduced in the same year by Kodak&#x27;s Dr. August Nagel Kamerawerk for the Retina. The camera does not have a rangefinder, as it was designed for use mostly with short focal length lenses (e.g. 40 mm) with great depth of field.

The Robot I was quite small, the body measuring 108 mm (4¼ inches) long, 63 mm (2½ inches) high, and 32 mm (1¼ inches) deep. A very sharp zone-focusing &quot;f/&quot;2.8, 3.25 cm Zeiss Tessar lens added 125mm (1/2 inch) to the camera depth. It was about the size of the much later Olympus Stylus although it weighed about 567 grams (20 ounces), approximately the weight of a modern SLR. The die-cast zinc and stamped stainless steel body was crammed with clockwork. A spring motor on the top plate provided the driving force for a rotary behind-the-lens shutter and a sprocket film drive. The film was loaded into cassettes in a darkroom or changing bag. The cassettes appear to be based on the Agfa Memo cassette design, the now-standard Kodak 35 mm cassette not yet being popular in Germany. In place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes, the Robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage. When the camera back was shut, the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another.

The rotary shutter and the film drive are like those used in cine cameras. When the shutter release is pressed, a light-blocking shield lifts and the shutter disc rotates a full turn exposing the film through its open sector; when the pressure is released the light-blocking shield returns to its position behind the lens, and the spring motor advances the film and recocks the shutter. This is almost instantaneous. With practice a photographer could take 4 or 5 pictures a second. Each winding of the spring motor was good for about 25 pictures, half a roll of film. Shutter speed was determined by spring tension and mechanical delay since the exposure sector was fixed. The Robot I had an exposure range of 1 to 1/500, and provision for time exposures.

The camera had other features not specifically related to action photography. The small optical viewfinder could be rotated 90 degrees to permit pictures to be taken in one direction while the photographer was facing in another. When the viewfinder was rotated, the scene was viewed through a deep purple filter similar to those used by cinematographers to judge the black and white contrast of an image. The camera had a built-in deep yellow filter which could be positioned behind the lens.

===Robot II===
In 1938 Berning introduced the Robot II, a slightly larger camera with some significant improvements but still using the basic mechanism. Among the standard lenses were a 3 cm Zeiss Tessar and a 3.75 cm Zeiss Tessar in f/2.8 and 3.5 variations, a f/2.0, 40 mm Zeiss Biotar and f/4, 7.5 cm Zeiss Sonnar. The film cassette system was redesigned, and the 1951 IIa accepted a standard 35 mm cassette. The special Robot cassettes type-N continued to be used for take-up. A small Bakelite box was sold to allow colour film to be rewound into the original cassettes as required by film processing companies. The camera was synchronized for flash. The swinging viewfinder was retained, but now operated by a lever rather than moving the entire housing. Both the deep purple and yellow filters were eliminated in the redesign. Some versions were available with a double-wind motor which could expose 50 frames on one winding. Civilian versions of the Robot were discontinued at the outset of the Second World War, but it was used as a bomb damage assessment camera by the Luftwaffe, mounted in the tail of Ju 87 (Stuka) dive bombers. This was an electrically driven camera using large cassettes possibly as many as 300 24 x 24mm images. Unlike the central Leica 250GG camera in the Ju 87, which was switched on automatically when the dive brakes were applied, the Robot camera had to be switched on manually. In the stress of the automatic pull out, when it was not uncommon for the pilot to black out from the g levels, switching on the bomb damage assessment camera was frequently forgotten.
===Robot Star and Junior===

In the 1950s Robot introduced the Robot Star. Film could now be rewound into the feed cassette in the camera as in other 35 mm cameras.

Robot then introduced the &quot;Junior&quot;, an economy model with the quality and almost all the features of the &quot;Star&quot; but without the angle finder or the rewind mechanism.

In the late 1950s the company, now called Robot-Berning, redesigned the Robot Star and created the Vollautomat Star II. The length stayed the same but the height increased by 125mm (half an inch). The new higher top housing disposed of the right angle finder and instead included an Albada finder with frames for the factory-fitted 38/40 mm and 75 mm lenses. The drive and shutter too were improved. By 1960 the hallmark stamped steel body was replaced by heavier die castings. The camera became, with slight changes, the Robot Star 25 and Star 50. The Robot Star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding, and the double-motor Robot Star 50 could expose 50 frames. Since most Robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position, Robot also introduced versions without a finder, and even without rewind. Although most production dates from the 1950-1960s era, essentially the same camera continued to be manufactured into the late 1990s.

===Robot Royal===

Robot-Berning also produced enlarged versions of the Robot, the Robot Royal 18, 24 and 36, with built-in rangefinder and with an autoburst mode of operation capable of shooting 6 frames per second. The camera was about the size of a Leica M3 and weighed 907g (almost 2 pounds). It was equipped with a Schneider Xenar 45 mm f/2.8 lens. The Robot Royal 36 took a standard 35 mm still picture but was identical to the Royal 24 in all other regards. They retained the behind-the-lens rotary shutter with speeds from 1/2 to 1/500 s.

Robot Royal II is a larger viewfinder camera, it has no rangefinder, it does not have burst mode, it is a stripped down Robot Royal III.
Robot Royal III has a main spring, when tightened, the camera can take 4 to 5 pictures in succession. It has a built in rangefinder, eight interchangeable
bayonet mount lenses.

There are two versions, Robot Royal 36, produce 36 24x36mm images on a roll of 135 film, Robot Royal 24 makes 50 24x24mm images on 135 film

A version for instrumentation (and traffic) was also created on the basis of the Royal design: the Recorder. These cameras were like the Royal but without viewfinder or rangefinder. They had interfaces to motors and detachable backs to support bulk film cassettes. A special parallel series of the Royal too was available that included these features. While the Royal had only limited market success, the Recorder was well accepted. It became the centerpiece of the company&#x27;s portable document capture, traffic control and security solutions, and continues to be the standard Robot camera for instrumentation applications.

===Military and government models===
During the Second World War, specially adapted models were made for the German Luftwaffe.

During the Cold War, Robots had a large following in the espionage business. The small camera could be concealed in a briefcase or a handbag, the lens poking though a decorative hole, and activated repeatedly by a cable release concealed in the handle. The company was well aware of this market and produced a variety of accessories which made the camera even more suitable for covert photography.

== Sequence photography ==

While the Robots were capable of sequence photography, the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon taking lenses and shutter speeds. To reach speeds as high as 1/500 second the inertia of the thin vulcanite shutter disc had to be kept at a minimum, requiring a small-diameter disc with a minimal sector opening. The screw in lens mount was 26 mm in diameter. The clear lens opening was only 20 mm. In contrast, Leica&#x27;s mount was almost twice as large at 39 mm. Further, to permit lens interchangeability, the shutter was mounted behind the lens so the disc interrupted the expanding light cone. This placed some limits on lens design. While the 75mm Sonnar could be used with the aperture set to &quot;f/&quot;22, the Tele-Xenar suffered from some shutter disc vignetting unless opened more.

The maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 mm, although telephotos up to 600 mm were offered. A 150 mm Tele-Xenar was available for long-distance action photography, but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 mm frame. The lack of a rangefinder on the Robot and Robot Star required zone focusing of these long lenses: every shot had to be estimated or pre-measured. All of the mechanical movement made for a noisy camera, although not as noisy as some modern motor drives. For an extra fee, Robot-Berning supplied silenced versions with nylon gears.

Within their limits the Robots did an excellent job of sequence photography. The standard 38 mm &quot;f/&quot;2.8 Xenar lenses were extremely sharp, even by today&#x27;s standards, and zone focusing worked well on rapid action with short focal length lenses. The reliable motor drive was as fast, if not faster, than later electrical drives, and there were no batteries to run down. Flash could be used at any speed. The square frame was big enough, with modern films, for A4 (210 x 297 mm, or 8.25&quot;× 11.75&quot;) or greater enlargements, and 50 pictures could be taken on a standard 36-exposure roll. The cameras, especially the later ones built to industrial standards, will take much abuse and still keep functioning.

<text>Iwo Jima, officially romanized and pronounced Iōtō (, literally: &quot;Sulfur Island&quot;), is one of the Japanese Volcano Islands, which lie south of the Bonin Islands and together with them make up the Ogasawara Archipelago. Together with the Izu Islands, they make up Japan&#x27;s Nanpō Islands. Although south of Tokyo on Honshu, Iwo Jima is administered as part of the Ogasawara Subprefecture of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.

Only in size, the island is still volcanic and emits sulfurous gases. The highest point of Iwo Jima is Mount Suribachi at high. Although likely passed by Micronesians who made their way to the Bonins to the north, Iwo Jima was largely ignored by the Spanish, Dutch, British, and Japanese until a relatively late date after its 1543 rediscovery. The Japanese eventually colonized the island, administering it as the Ioto or Iojima Village under Tokyo&#x27;s jurisdiction until all civilians were forcibly evacuated to Honshu in July 1944 near the end of World War II.

Because it was able to provide secure airfields within easy range of the Japanese Home Islands, Iwo Jima was not passed by like other Pacific fortresses; instead, the Battle of Iwo Jima between February 1945 and March 1945 was some of the fiercest fighting of the Pacific War, with Imperial Japan and the United States both suffering over 20,000 casualties. Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph of the second flagraising on Mount Suribachi has become one of the most famous examples of wartime photojournalism and an iconic American image. Following the Japanese surrender, the US military occupied Iwo Jima along with the other Nanpo Islands and the Ryukyus; Iwo Jima was returned to Japan with the Bonins in 1968.

Now technically part of the territory and municipal jurisdiction of Ogasawara Village, the island still has no permanent inhabitants except a Self-Defense Force base on its Central Field. Its soldiers, sailors, and airmen receive their own services from Ayase or Sayama but provide emergency assistance to communities on the Bonins who are still connected with the mainland only by an infrequent day-long ferry. As of 1991, the land of Iwo Jima was owned by 6 individuals, the Village of Ogasawara, and the Government of Japan. Additionally, at least 8 individuals held leasehold interests in certain parts of the land owned by the village. The North Kanto Defense Bureau of the Ministry of Defense pays rent on the land lease to the individual owners and leaseholders.

The area of Iwo Jima continues to increase due to the uplift of the ground due to active volcanic activity; in 1911 it was , in 1945 it was , in 2014 it was and in 2023, it will be .

==Name==

The original records of De la Torre&#x27;s 1543 expedition have been lost, but he does not appear to have separately named Iwo Jima, despite later sources sometimes miscrediting him with the name Sulfur or Sulphur Island (orig. or ). Instead, he seems to have only named the Volcano Islands as a group (orig. ) after an eruptionprobably on South Iwo Jimaactive as his ship passed through the area.

Other Spanish explorers may have named or renamed the island in the years afterward. Certainly, John Gore was aware of Spanish accounts of the area with him when he visited in 1779 and recorded its English name as Sulphur Island.

The name was subsequently calqued into Late Middle Japanese with the Sino-Japanese form and pronunciation &quot;Iwōtō&quot; or &quot;Iwō-tō&quot; (, , &quot;Sulfur Island&quot;), still used by the control tower for the remaining airport. In the past this was also sometimes romanized as &quot;Iwautau&quot;. The native Japanese reading of the same character is &quot;shima&quot; (leading to the English misreading &quot;Iwo Shima&quot;), which typically shifts to &quot;jima&quot; when prefixed by another character. This version is the origin of the English names &quot;Iwojima&quot;, &quot;Iwo-jima&quot;, and &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;, with many variant pronunciations including and . This archaic or mistaken form of the Japanese name was particularly reinforced during the Second World War, when it was mistakenly used by Japanese naval officers who arrived to fortify the island ahead of US invasion.

In general Japanese use, the /w/ has dropped out of the modern pronunciation to become &quot;Iōtō&quot; or &quot;Iō-tō&quot; (), a spelling formally adopted following Japan&#x27;s 1946 orthography reform. This newer form is sometimes borrowed into English pronunciations of the island&#x27;s name as and . The high-profile Clint Eastwood films &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; revived complaints from prewar residents about continued misreadings of the island&#x27;s name, particularly within Japanese. After formal debate, the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism&#x27;s Geographical Survey Institute formally announced on 18 June 2007 that the official pronunciation would return to &quot;Iōtō&quot; or &quot;Iō-tō&quot;.

硫黄島, pronounced &quot;Iōjima&quot;, is currently the name of a different island in Kagoshima.

==Geography==


Iwo Jima has an approximate area of . The most prominent feature is Mount Suribachi on the southern tip, a vent that is thought to be dormant and is high. Named after a Japanese grinding bowl, the summit of Mount Suribachi is the highest point on the island. Iwo Jima is unusually flat and featureless for a volcanic island. Suribachi is the only obvious volcanic feature, as the island is only the resurgent dome (raised centre) of a larger submerged volcanic caldera surrounding the island. The island forms part of the Kazan-retto islands Important Bird Area (IBA), designated by BirdLife International.

80 km (43 nautical miles, 50 mi) north of the island is and south is ; these three islands make up the Volcano Islands group of the Ogasawara Islands. Just south of Minami-Iō-jima are the Mariana Islands.

The visible island stands on a plateau (probably made by wave erosion) at depth about 15 m, which is the top of an underwater mountain 1.5 km to 2 km tall and 40 km diameter at base.

===Eruption history===
Iwo Jima has a history of minor volcanic activity a few times per year (fumaroles, and their resultant discolored patches of seawater nearby). In November 2015 Iwo Jima was placed first in a list of ten dangerous volcanoes, with volcanologists saying there was a one in three chance of a large eruption from one of the ten this century.

====Prehistoric====
* Earlier: An undersea volcano started, and built up into a volcanic island. It was truncated, either by caldera-forming eruption or by sea erosion.
* About 760±20 BC: a large eruption with pyroclastic flows and lava destroyed a previous forested island
* 131±20BC and 31±20 BC: carbon-14 date of seashells found buried in lava at Motoyama (see map)
* Micronesian tools and carvings found in the Bonin Islands to the north suggest Iwo Jima may have been visited or inhabited as well. With limited archaeological access, however, no such remains have been found to date.

====Witnessed====
*1543: Commanding the , the Spanish explorer Bernardo de la Torre almost certainly sighted Iwo Jima and the other Volcano Islands at some point between September 25 and October 2 while making another failed attempt to sail east across the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. (No attempt would be successful until 1565.) Attempting to secure reinforcements for Ruy López de Villalobos when Filipino resistance proved unexpectedly strong, De la Torre apparently passed the islands during an eruption on South Iwo Jima, realized his supply of water would be insufficient for completing his mission, and returned south to rendezvous with López de Villalobos in the Moluccas. Over the next century, other Spanish sailors passed the islandsparticularly once Alonso de Arellano found a safe northeastern route back to Mexico from the Philippineswithout settling or formally claiming them. The Volcano Islands did, however, form part of the notional boundaries between the Spanish and Portuguese Empires in the Eastern Hemisphere following the treaties of Tordesillas and Zaragoza, such that the Spanish considered them within their sphere of influence.
*15 November 1779: Following British captain James Cook&#x27;s death on Hawaii, ships previously under his command landed on Iwo Jima during the return voyage from his 3rd expedition. Under James King and John Gore, the expedition&#x27;s surveying crew mapped the island, recording a beach at sea level which was above sea level by 2015 due to volcanic uplifting. Such uplifting occurs on the island at a varying rate of between per year, with an average rate of per year. Gore&#x27;s visit was sometimes misunderstood or misrepresented as a new discovery, as in the report in the December 1786 supplement to &quot;The New London Magazine&quot;: 
*Early 1945: United States armed forces landed on a beach which by 2015 was above sea level due to volcanic uplift.
*28 March 1957: A phreatic eruption occurred without warning northeast of Suribachi, lasting 65 minutes and ejecting material high from one crater. Another crater, wide and deep, formed by collapse 50 minutes after the eruption ended.
*9–10 March 1982: Five phreatic eruptions occurred from vents on the northwest shore of the island.
*21 September 2001: A submarine eruption began from three vents southeast of Iwo-jima. It built a diameter pyroclastic cone.
*October 2001: A small phreatic eruption at Idogahama (a beach on the northwest coast of the island) made a crater wide and deep.
*May 2012: Fumaroles, and discolored patches of seawater were seen northeast of the island, indicating further submarine activity.
*May to June 2013: Series of smaller volcanic earthquakes.
*April 2018: A number of volcanic earthquakes, high white plumes up to .
*30 October to 5 November 2019: Volcanic quakes and subaerial eruption.
*29 April to 5 May 2020: Subaerial eruption and volcanic plume rising up to in height.
*8 September to 6 October 2020: Volcanic plume up to in height and a minor eruption.
*24 November 2021: Small phreatic eruption occurred with the ash plume height yet to be known.

On 11 July 2022, the first magmatic eruption in over 1000 years began just offshore. The article was cited as saying &quot;Officials of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) visited the site between July 12 and July 15 and observed volcanic eruptions every five minutes, which created water columns tens of meters high and spewed black smoke. The officials also observed many rocks that had washed ashore on the coast of Iwoto island. There were small cavities inside the rocks. The officials believe they are cooled lava, formed after magma has erupted, quickly cooled and solidified. The temperature on the inside of some of the rocks was as high as 120 degrees, according to the officials.&quot;

At the beginning of November 2023, a series of continuous eruptions of material resulted in a new islet breaking the surface and beginning to grow. Following continuous volcanic activity since the initial eruption the island now dubbed Niijima, Japanese for &#x27;new island&#x27;, has continued to grow and is now visible from space.

Iwo Jima has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) with long, hot summers and warm winters with mild nights.


==History==

===Pre-1945===
The island was first visited by a Westerner in October 1543, by Spanish sailor Bernardo de la Torre on board the carrack &quot;San Juan de Letrán&quot; when trying to return from Sarangani to New Spain.

In the late 16th century, the island was discovered by the Japanese.

Before World War II Iwo Jima was administered as Iōjima village and was (and is today) part of Tokyo. A census in June 1943 reported an island civilian population of 1,018 (533 males, 485 females) in 192 households in six settlements. The island had a primary school, a Shinto shrine, and one police officer; it was serviced by a mail ship from Haha-jima once a month, and by Nippon Yusen ship once every two months. The island&#x27;s economy relied upon sulfur mining, sugarcane farming, and fishing; an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with poor economic prospects, Iwo Jima had to import all rice and consumer goods from the Home Islands.

Even before the beginning of World War II, there was a garrison of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the southern part of Iwo Jima. It was off-limits to the island&#x27;s civilian population, who already had little contact with the naval personnel, except for trading.
Throughout 1944, Japan conducted a massive military buildup on Iwo Jima in anticipation of a U.S. invasion. In July 1944, the island&#x27;s civilian population was forcibly evacuated, and no civilians have permanently settled on the island since.

War-displaced islanders who are now in their 80s and older longed to return to the island, which they considered &quot;a special place associated with memories both happy and sad&quot;. Their repeated requests to return to the island have not been realized given the reason that the area has a dynamic volcanic activity. Former islanders and their family members, however, are occasionally granted permission to visit the graves of their ancestors. Islanders and their descendants are trying to write down their memories, interview other former islanders, and create &quot;a digital archive of photos to preserve memories of life on the now-forbidden island to pass them down to posterity&quot; for younger generations who may not appreciate that Iwo Jima was once a place many had called home.

===Battle of Iwo Jima===
The American invasion of Iwo Jima began on February 19, 1945, and continued to March 26, 1945. The battle was a major initiative of the Pacific Campaign of World War II. The Marine invasion, known as &quot;Operation Detachment&quot;, was charged with the mission of capturing the airfields on the island for use by P-51 fighters, and the emergency landings of damaged heavy bombers that were not able to reach their main bases in the Marianas (Guam, Saipan and Tinian). Prior to the seizure, Japanese fighters had harried U.S. bombing missions to Japan.

The battle was marked by some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with vast bunkers, hidden artillery, and 18 kilometers (11 mi) of tunnels. The battle was the first U.S. attack on the Japanese Home Islands and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, over 19,000 were killed and only 1,083 taken prisoner.

One of the first objectives after landing on the beachhead was the taking of Mount Suribachi. At the second raising of a flag on the peak, Joe Rosenthal photographed six Marines raising the United States flag on the fourth day of the battle (February 23). 

The photograph was extremely popular, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Photography that same year. It is regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war.

After the fall of Mount Suribachi in the south, the Japanese still held a strong position throughout the island. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi still had the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, two artillery, and three heavy mortar battalions, plus the 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death. On the night of March 25, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack led by Kuribayashi. The island was officially declared &quot;secured&quot; the following morning.

According to the U.S. Navy, &quot;The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.&quot; Comparatively, the 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. (five Army, two Marine Corps Divisions and Navy personnel on ships) casualties were over 62,000 of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing, while the Battle of the Bulge lasted 40 days (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945) with almost 90,000 U.S. casualties comprising 19,000 killed, 47,500 wounded and 23,000 captured or missing.

After Iwo Jima was declared secured, about 3,000 Japanese soldiers were left alive in the island&#x27;s warren of caves and tunnels. Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions. Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion – offering them water, cigarettes, or coffee. The last of these stragglers, two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno&#x27;s men (Ohno&#x27;s body was never found), Kōfuku Yamakage and Rikio Matsudo, lasted three and a half years, surrendering on January 6, 1949.

In memory of the battle, three ships of the U.S. Navy have been named :

* , a planned which began construction in early 1945, but cancelled in August 1945 with the end of the war. It was eventually scrapped in 1949.
* , the lead ship of the s, served from 1961 to 1993, and scrapped in 1995.
* , a , commissioned in 2001 and in active service .

===U.S. Naval Base Iwo Jima===
The U.S. military occupied Iwo Jima until June 26, 1968, when it was returned to Japan. The United States Navy built and operated a naval base on the island.

====U.S. nuclear arms base====
Between 1956 and 1959, it is claimed that US Military forces stored at least one nuclear weapon at Iwo Jima, with some nuclear components being stored on the island until 1966. This made Iwo Jima one of several islands hosting nuclear weapons during the US Military Occupation of Japan.
The claim was initially made by authors at the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot;, parsing heavily redacted declassified documents.

On December 12, 1999, U.S. Under Secretary for Defense Policy Walter Slocombe told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Our position is that there have been no violations of our obligations under the security treaty and related arrangements.&quot;

Norris, Arkin and Burr, authors at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, however concluded:

There were nuclear weapons on Chichi Jima and Iwo Jima (Iwo To)&quot;...&quot; Chichi Jima, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa were under U.S. occupation, that the bombs stored on the mainland lacked their plutonium and/ or uranium cores&quot;...&quot; This elaborate stratagem maintained the technicality that the United States had no nuclear weapons &quot;in Japan.&quot;

===Japanese military base===

Since returning the island from the U.S. to Japan on June 26, 1968, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) maintain a station on Iwo Jima. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) operates a naval air base on the island at Central Field. The airstrip is 2,650 meters (8,700 ft) long and 60 meters (200 ft) wide. The JMSDF is in charge of support, air traffic control, fueling, and rescue. The airstrip is rarely used for emergency landings by commercial airplanes flying transpacific routes (between the Northeast Asia and Saipan, Guam). The IATA airport code of IWO and the ICAO airport code of RJAW are assigned to the airfield. The JMSDF Air Wing 21 Detachment Iōtō provides support for emergency medical air transportation from the Bonin Islands (Chichijima and Hahajima) to Honshu. The base is occasionally used as a relay point for the medical transport. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force also uses the base. The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force is in charge of explosive ordnance disposal, and maintains a garrison of 400 troops on the island. Two abandoned airfields from World War II are nearby, North Field to the north of the current air base, and an unfinished Japanese airfield to the south of the base, which was improved after the U.S. invasion of the island.

The U.S. Navy&#x27;s Carrier Air Wing Five, based at the United States Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni when not deployed aboard , also uses the base for field carrier landing practice (FCLP). To justify the U.S. Navy&#x27;s use of the airfield, the U.S. Navy still nominally has a 1,639-acre (663-ha) disused communication facility (Iwo-Jima Communication Site, FAC3181) on the island under the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement. The U.S. Coast Guard&#x27;s Iwo Jima LORAN-C transmitter facility was transferred to Japan in 1993 and demolished in 1994.

Civilian access to the island is restricted to those visiting graves of former residents and attending memorial services for U.S. and Japanese fallen soldiers, construction workers and cafeteria staff for the naval air base, and meteorological, geological and environmental agency officials. The Japanese troops stationed on the island register their residential addresses in Ayase, Kanagawa or Sayama, Saitama for voting, tax, and social security purposes. Officially, there is no population on the island.

While large areas of the Bonin Islands are designated as a national park (Ogasawara National Park) as well as inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, Iwo Jima is included neither in the National Park nor the World Heritage natural site because of the military installations.

===Reunion of Honor===
The first large scale reunion on the island was held in 1970 on the 25th anniversary of the battle. The event was sponsored by the Fifth Marine Division Association and included both American and Japanese veterans of the battle. Other notable attendees included then Brigadier General William K. Jones commander of the 3rd Marine Division, NBC’s senior correspondent in Asia John Rich, and Yoshitaka Shindō grandson of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. The widows of General Kuribayashi and Colonel Takeichi Nishi also attended events with American veterans held in Tokyo.

On February 19, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the day that U.S. forces began the assault on the island, veterans from both forces gathered for the Reunion of Honor just a few meters/yards away from the spot where U.S. Marines had landed on the island.
During the memorial service a granite plaque was unveiled with the message:

On the 40th anniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima, American and Japanese veterans met again on these same sands, this time in peace and friendship. We commemorate our comrades, living and dead, who fought here with bravery and honor, and we pray together that our sacrifices on Iwo Jima will always be remembered and never be repeated.

It is inscribed on both sides of the plaque, with the English translation facing the beaches where U.S. forces landed and the Japanese translation facing inland, where Japanese troops defended their position.

After that, the Japan–U.S. combination memorial service of the 50th anniversary was held in front of this monument in March 1995. The 55th anniversary was held in 2000, followed by a 60th reunion in March 2005 (see U.S. National Park Service photo below), and a 70th anniversary ceremony on March 21, 2015.

A memorial service held on the island in 2007 got particular attention because it coincided with the release of the movie &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima.&quot; The joint U.S.–Japanese ceremony was attended by Yoshitaka Shindo, a Japanese lawmaker who is the grandson of the Japanese commander during the battle, Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi, and Yasunori Nishi, the son of Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist equestrian who died commanding a tank unit on the island.

Active Marines have also visited the island on occasion for Professional Military Education (PME).

<text>The Château de la Bourdaisière () is a 19th-century county house in the Commune of Montlouis-sur-Loire, in the Indre-et-Loire &quot;département&quot; of France.

The site of the present house dates back to the 14th century when it was a fortress belonging to Jean Meingr. Over the next few generations, the property changed hands several times, until 1520 when King Francis I arranged for construction of a new castle on the site. Built for his mistress, Marie Gaudin, the wife of Philibert Babou, Superintendent of Finances for France, after her death, the property would remain in the family&#x27;s hands.

Marie Gaudin&#x27;s granddaughter, Gabrielle d&#x27;Estrées, was born in the château and would herself grow up to become mistress to another king, Henry IV of France.

In 1775, the château was partially destroyed by order of King Louis XV&#x27;s most powerful Minister, Étienne François, Duc de Choiseul. Étienne François wanted to use the stones from Château de la Bourdaisière for the construction of his Pagoda at his estate in Chanteloup, near Amboise.

Lying in ruins, in 1786 the land was sold to Louise Adélaïde of Penthièvre Bourbon. In 1802 the property was acquired by Baron Joseph Angelier who undertook a massive reconstruction of Château Bourdaisière. The interior work would be completed by his son, Gustave Angelier. Although a small château, when compared to the great châteaux of the Kings and some of those built by other wealthy nobles, it is a magnificent Renaissance construction fronted by traditional French gardens.

The Castle was sold in 1923 to a wealthy American, Mrs. de Mérinville who sold it in 1938. During World War II, the château was occupied by the Nazis. After the war, a lack of funds by its owner saw it become severely run down. In 1959, its contents were auctioned off and government turned the château into a home for the elderly.

It was sold again in 1988 to an attorney, François Michaud, who owned it until 1991 when it was acquired by its current owners, the Princes of Broglie who undertook significant improvements and modernization. In 2003, Château de la Bourdaisière gained considerable attention in North America, as the primary site for the television show &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;. In 2011, the chateaus gardens were finalist for the &quot;European Garden Award&quot; bestowed by the European Garden Heritage Network.

The château was listed as a &quot;monument historique&quot; in 1947.

<text>Anthropology of religion is the study of religion in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. The anthropology of religion, as a field, overlaps with but is distinct from the field of Religious Studies. The history of anthropology of religion is a history of striving to understand how other people view and navigate the world. This history involves deciding what religion is, what it does, and how it functions. Today, one of the main concerns of anthropologists of religion is defining religion, which is a theoretical undertaking in and of itself. Scholars such as Edward Tylor, Emile Durkheim, E.E. Evans Pritchard, Mary Douglas, Victor Turner, Clifford Geertz, and Talal Asad have all grappled with defining and characterizing religion anthropologically.

==History==
In the 19th century cultural anthropology was dominated by an interest in cultural evolution; most anthropologists assumed a simple distinction between &quot;primitive&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.

Edward Burnett Tylor (1832-1917), sometimes called the “father of anthropology,” took an evolutionary approach to religion. Tylor defined religion as a “belief in spiritual beings” but did not believe all religions were equal or equally “true.” His evolutionary perspective is evident in his book (1871) &quot;Primitive Culture: Researches into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Language, Art, and Custom,&quot; in which he proposed a taxonomy of religions and believed that “primitive” religions were a result of cognitive errors. In other words, these beliefs explained natural phenomena that the people or culture did not fully understand. He called this “animism,” which included attributing a spirit to inanimate objects.

James George Frazer (1854-1941), most well-known for his book &quot;The Golden Bough,&quot; also approached the study of religion from an evolutionist perspective. Frazer&#x27;s hierarchy of religions included different stages: first magic, then religious, and ending in scientific. Frazer argues that magic becomes an increasingly futile practice as religious systems develop. This is when the religious phase begins, in which the world is explained through reference to divine beings who intervene in the world. In the final stage, elites see religion as insufficient or incorrectly addressing world phenomena and begin to seek to understand the world through laws of nature.

Towards the end of the 19th century, anthropologists of religion began to question the distinctions between magic and religion made by Tylor and Frazer. William Robertson Smith (1846-1894) in &quot;Lectures of the Religion of the Semites (1899)&quot; proposed the idea of the totem. For Smith, social groups worshiped totems which represented their ancestors and worshipping totemic items accounted for the emergence of religions. Thus, Smith&#x27;s theory of totemism rose in prominent within the field of anthropology of religion, challenging and in some instances fully replacing Tylor&#x27;s theory of animism.

Durkheim (1858-1917) expanded on the concept of the totem, viewing religion as a collective societal force. For him, religious forces are essentially collective societal forces, embodied in the totem. The society imparts the totem with its power, meaning, and existence, which in turn gives the god or the religion its significance. In “Origins of Belief,” Durkheim argues that a totem symbolizes society, or as he calls it, the clan, and the god. As he puts it, “the totem is the visible body of God.” The totem itself might be an inconsequential object, like an animal, or a wooden cross. Despite its physical insignificance, Durkheim contends that the totem represents the clan. However, individuals do not consciously recognize that their reverence for the totem is, in fact, reverence for society itself. Instead, they perceive the totem as something external to their consciousness. In Durkheim&#x27;s view, “society gives the sensation of a perpetual dependence.”

Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) moved away from the inquiry into the origins of the religion shifting the theory of religion to focus on religion as a function of the social world. In his essay, “Magic, Science, and Religion,” Malinowski argues that religion in its social and psychological functions promotes social integration and community. Malinowski separates the categories of religion and magic in specifying that magic is used for functional ends: to solve problems or achieve objectives where other methods have failed.

E.E. Evans Pritchard (1902-1973) is most famous for his work on witchcraft. His book &quot;Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande&quot; approaches witchcraft as a cohesive and internally consistent system of knowing. While Pritchard believed that religious systems were a reflection of social environment, he was primarily concerned with thought patterns and logic within belief systems.

Victor Turner (1920-1983) understood religion through the lens of rituals, rites of passage and symbolism. He considered religion to be the lynchpin in cultural systems. In his book &quot;The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure,&quot; he proposes his theory of liminality and communitas. He developed liminality from folklorist Arnold Van Gennep. For Turner, the liminal stage is a period of ambiguity or transition where an individual&#x27;s status in a ritual change from pre-ritual stage to post-ritual. The idea of communitas refers to the common experience of community during a ritual.

Mary Douglas’ (1921-2007) work and topics were inspired by Evans-Pritchard. They both explained social systems in terms of functionalism. She defined religion through the lens of ritual. In her most famous book, &quot;Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo,&quot; she compares Western and “primitive” societies in showing that Western societies also relied on “magic” through rituals around purity and pollution, such as teeth brushing. She sees ritual as a collective force or system that places limits on the body. In this way, the image of society is carved onto the body through reiterations of purity and pollution.

Talal Asad (1932-now) is a prominent anthropologist of religion today who focuses on religion and modernity. Asad is well known for his work on religion and power. He has argued that overlooking the history of defining religion can lead us to overlook its imbrication with power. He has also pointed to the ways in which modernity has delimited religion to a certain sphere of life, so that religion can be pointed out or identified in certain ways and not in others. In doing this, he has also called for the development of a religion of secularity.  

Clifford Geertz and Talal Asad publicly debated the “universal” nature of religion. While Geertz, provided an operational definition for religion that allowed for variation across cultures, he saw this definition as encapsulating certain universal features of “religion.” Alternatively, Asad questioned the very existence of “universal religion” in pointing to the ways in which ideas about the universal were rooted in distinctly Christian ideas and traditions. Influenced by Michel Foucault and Edward Said, Asad questions the conceptual assumptions involved in or undergirding the production of knowledge. This is what led Asad to question the existence of separate sphere of society that could be called or identified as “religion.” In undermining the existence of religion as a separate sphere, Asad points to Western modernity as producing religion as distinct from other parts of society.

One key component of anthropology of religion is ethnographic fieldwork. This is what makes anthropologists who study religion distinct from other Religious Studies scholars. Ethnography is most simply put, the empirical observation and description of individuals, societies, and cultures. For anthropologists of religion, ethnographic fieldwork focuses on religion through the lens of rituals, worship, religious values, and other components of lived religion. Developments in ethnographic approaches to the study of religion or theoretical developments in the ethnographic study of religion have spanned decades.

Evolutionist perspectives were reflective of Darwinian theories of evolution and saw religious systems in a taxonomic and hierarchical way: some religions were closer to the truth than others and Christianity was always at the top of pyramid. Functionalist perspectives aimed to study religion as a part of society that played an important an integral role: non-Christian religions were not compared to Christianity on a sliding scale, but rather taken in context with the whole cultural context. Humanist theories of evolution see religions as products of human culture and invention, rather than metaphysical or supernatural phenomena that “exist” outside of the human cultures that produce them. Cross-cultural or comparative theories of religion focus on “religion” as something that can be found and compared across all human cultures and societies.

The anthropology of religion today reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as Karl Marx (1818-1883), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), and Max Weber (1864-1920). Anthropologists of religion are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.

Recently, a prominent ethnographer of religion, Robert Orsi, has asked scholars of religion to abandon the empirical approach to ethnography of religion that was co-emergent with modernity. This approach entails the impulse to explain God or gods in people&#x27;s lives as a function or symbol of some other thing. Orsi asks those who study religion to instead take God and gods as real actors, really present.

== Definition of religion ==

One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself. At one time anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or ghosts, the use of magic as a means of controlling the supernatural, the use of divination as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of rituals such as prayer and sacrifice as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of shamanism or ancestor worship. According to Clifford Geertz, religion is
Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European primitivism). Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion – such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual – but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.

Anthony F. C. Wallace proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: vision quest.
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The Tillamook have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one&#x27;s own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.
