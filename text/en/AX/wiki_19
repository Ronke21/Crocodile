<text>Connie Booth (born December 2, 1940) is an American actress and writer. She has appeared in several British television programmes and films, including her role as Polly Sherman on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, which she co-wrote with her then-husband John Cleese. In 1995, she quit acting and worked as a psychotherapist until her retirement.

==Early life==
Booth was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on December 2, 1940. Her father was a Wall Street stockbroker and her mother was an actress. The family later moved to New York State. Booth entered acting and worked as a Broadway understudy and waitress. She met John Cleese while he was working in New York City; they married on February 20, 1968.

==Acting career==
Booth secured parts in episodes of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (1969–74) and in the Python films &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; (1971) and &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; (1975, as a woman accused of being a witch). She also appeared in &quot;How to Irritate People&quot; (1968), a pre-Monty Python film starring Cleese and other future Monty Python members; a short film titled &quot;Romance with a Double Bass&quot; (1974) which Cleese adapted from a short story by Anton Chekhov; and &quot;The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It&quot; (1977), Cleese&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes spoof, as Mrs. Hudson.

Booth and Cleese co-wrote and co-starred in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (1975 and 1979), in which she played waitress and chambermaid Polly. For thirty years Booth declined to talk about the show until she agreed to participate in a documentary about the series for the digital channel Gold in 2009.

Booth played various roles on British television, including Sophie in &quot;Dickens of London&quot; (1976), Mrs. Errol in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; (1980) and Miss March in a dramatisation of Edith Wharton&#x27;s &quot;The Buccaneers&quot; (1995). She also starred in the lead role of a drama called &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; (1981), in which she played the role of the schizophrenic daughter of an abusive father. In 1994, she played a supporting role in &quot;The Culex Experiment&quot;, an episode of the children&#x27;s science fiction TV series &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;.

Booth also had a stage career, primarily in the London theatre, appearing in 10 productions from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s, notably starring with John Mills in the 1983–1984 West End production of &quot;Little Lies&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre.

==Psychotherapy career==
Booth ended her acting career in 1995. After studying for five years at the University of London, she began a career as a psychotherapist, registered with the British Psychoanalytic Council.

==Personal life==
In 1971, Booth and Cleese had a daughter, Cynthia, who appeared alongside her father in the films &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; and &quot;Fierce Creatures&quot;. Booth and Cleese divorced in 1978. With Cleese, Booth wrote the scripts for and co-starred in both series of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, although the two were actually divorced before the second series was finished and aired. Their daughter Cynthia married screenwriter Ed Solomon in 1995.

Booth married John Lahr, author and former &quot;New Yorker&quot; senior drama critic, in 2000. They live in North London.

<doc id="177850" wikidata="Q1032400" url="?curid=177850" title="Canadian Tire">
<text>Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited () is a Canadian retail company which operates in the automotive, hardware, sports, leisure and housewares sectors. Its Canadian operations include: Canadian Tire (including Canadian Tire Petroleum gas stations and financial services subsidiary Canadian Tire Bank), Mark&#x27;s, FGL Sports (including Sport Chek and Sports Experts), PartSource, and the Canadian operations of Party City. Canadian Tire acquired the Norwegian clothing and textile company Helly Hansen from the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan in 2018.

Canadian Tire is known for its Canadian Tire money, a loyalty program first introduced in 1958 using paper coupons that resemble banknotes. The company&#x27;s head office is located at the Canada Square Complex in Toronto, Ontario, and it is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It is a participant in the voluntary Scanner Price Accuracy Code managed by the Retail Council of Canada.

==History==
On October 24, 1922, John William Billes and Alfred Jackson Billes invested their combined savings of $1,800 in the Hamilton Tire and Garage Ltd. (established in 1909 as the Hamilton Garage and Rubber Company) in Toronto. Hamilton Tire and Garage specialized in buying tires at a discount from manufacturers in the winter then reselling the tires during the busy summer season. The brothers opened a retail store at Yonge and Gould Streets in Toronto, Ontario.

A product focus on tires was emphasized in 1927 with the incorporation of the name Canadian Tire Corporation Limited because, as A.J. Billes said, &quot;...it sounded big&quot;. During 1928, the first Canadian Tire catalogues were distributed, consisting of price lists along with road maps.

In 1934, the first official Associate Store was opened in Hamilton, Ontario by Walker Anderson on King Street. In 1944, to fund its growth, Canadian Tire Corporation became a public company and sold 100,000 shares. By 1945, there were 110 Canadian Tire stores. In 1946, an employee stock purchasing plan was implemented to encourage employee loyalty while discouraging unionization.

The first gas bar opened in 1958 at the corner of Yonge and Church Streets in Toronto. Canadian Tire money that gave gas bar customers an in-store discount began in 1958. By June 1961, there were 31 locations. The small financial services company Midland Shoppers Credit Limited was purchased in 1968 and renamed Canadian Tire Acceptance, Limited.

Canadian Tire entered the clothing market by acquiring Mark&#x27;s Work Wearhouse in 2001.

In 2003, CTC established the Canadian Tire Bank, under Canada&#x27;s Bank Act, from its then-named Canadian Tire Financial Services, Limited, subsidiary along with its Mastercard portfolio, which was later renamed as Canadian Tire Services, Limited, effective January 1, 2015. CTC sold 20% of its Canadian Tire Bank to Scotiabank in 2014; it later repurchased this stake in 2023.

In April 2018, Triangle Rewards was launched as a replacement to the digital My Canadian Tire Money program and Options Mastercard. Traditional paper Canadian Tire money continues to be offered at some Canadian Tire stores for customers without a rewards card, though at a reduced rate.

In May 2018, the company extended further into the clothing market by acquiring Helly Hansen. As of December 2021, the company operates 667 Canadian Tire stores, 397 SportChek stores, and 381 Mark&#x27;s stores. The current President and CEO is Greg Hicks.

===U.S. expansion attempts===
Canadian Tire tried twice to expand into the United States. In 1982, it purchased the Wichita Falls, Texas-based White Stores, Inc. automotive retail chain with 81 stores in Texas from its then-owner Household Merchandising Inc., a subsidiary of Household Finance, for US$40.2 million. In 1986, after losing nearly US$100 million they closed some stores and sold the remaining 40 stores, three warehouses and other White assets to Kansas City, Missouri-based Western Auto Supply.

The second time, during the early 1990s, Canadian Tire tried to open a specialized auto parts chain called Auto Source that attempted to have 25,000 different parts or more on the shelf in each store, more than its competitors. The first Auto Source was opened in Indianapolis in 1991. Unlike the previous attempt, the Auto Source concept was built from scratch. During the next three years, Canadian Tire had opened two Auto Source stores each in Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus and Louisville for a total of ten stores before abruptly closing the money-losing chain in 1995. Some of the stores were sold to Pep Boys.

Although Auto Source lost nearly CA$60 million during its four years of existence, a scaled-down version was used in Canada under the PartSource brand.

==Brands==

Canadian Tire owns a number of house brands, with some of its most prominent including Mastercraft (tools), MotoMaster (automotive), as well as NOMA (household goods, particularly lights and Christmas lights) and Simoniz (car care products)—two brands for which Canadian Tire acquired the Canadian trademark rights.

In the 2010s, Canadian Tire began to expand its array of private labels in order to better-compete with online retailers such as Amazon. In 2013, Canadian Tire launched Frank, a budget brand oriented towards household goods and grocery; the brand is known for packaging containing product-specific taglines involving its eponymous mascot—such as &quot;Frank talks trash&quot; (garbage bags), &quot;Frank knows all aboot maple&quot; (maple-flavoured coffee) and &quot;Frank doesn&#x27;t scrub you the wrong way&quot; (dish sponges)—which became a viral trend in 2020. 

Canadian Tire owns the rights to three ice hockey brands. In 2011, the company&#x27;s purchase of the Forzani Group gave it the rights to the Hespeler and Victoriaville brands. In 2018, it acquired the trademarks of Sherwood Hockey.

On May 10, 2017, Canadian Tire announced it would buy Padinox, the manufacturer of the Paderno kitchen equipment.

==Operations==
At the end of 2018, Canadian Tire employed 12,735 full-time and 17,951 part-time employees in the corporate structure. These figures do not include temporary employees or employees working for Associate Stores, petroleum stores or franchise stores. There is an in-house Triangle Learning Academy, an allusion to the triangular CTC logo for employee and Associate Store management training.

===Financial services===
Canadian Tire Bank (CTB) is the company&#x27;s retail deposit-taking and credit card issuing arm. They are held indirectly under the &quot;Canadian Tire Services, Limited&quot;, holding company, Canadian Tire Bank (CTB), a bank under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Bank Act&quot; since 2003. Before 2003, all financing occurred under the &quot;Canadian Tire Financial Services&quot;. In 2014, The Bank of Nova Scotia acquired a 20% economic and voting interest in Canadian Tire Bank, with an option to acquire up to an additional 30% of the company within ten years (or require Canadian Tire buy back its existing 20% interest) at the then fair market value of the business for $500 million CAD in cash.

Ostensibly in tandem with Scotiabank&#x27;s acquisition of a minority position in Canadian Tire Bank, Canadian Tire renamed its intermediary holding company &quot;Canadian Tire Financial Services Limited&quot; as Canadian Tire Services, Limited, effective January 1, 2015, dropping the moniker &quot;Canadian Tire Financial Services&quot; from use. Additionally, in approximately 2018, Canadian Tire rebranded its credit card-issuing online banking website as &quot;Canadian Tire Bank&quot;, removing the last vestige of &quot;Canadian Tire Financial Services&quot; from active use.

===Petroleum===

Canadian Tire Petroleum (CTP), operating as Canadian Tire Gas+, is the division of Canadian Tire which operates gas stations and car washes. CTP was founded in 1958 as a means of increasing customer traffic to Canadian Tire stores. In Ontario, CTP also operates Pit Stop, which provides services like oil changes and rust checks. The Canadian Tire money loyalty program was originally launched through the gas bars as &quot;Gas Bonus Coupons.&quot; CTP has opened three Q Stop stores featuring a mini-grocery store and other items. 

CTP also holds the concession to operate the 24-hour gas stations at ONroute service centres in Ontario along Highway 401 and parts of Highway 400.

In May 2023, Canadian Tire announced an agreement with Suncor Energy, under which all Canadian Tire Gas+ locations will be converted to Petro-Canada franchises, and the company&#x27;s Petro-Points rewards program will be integrated with Canadian Tire&#x27;s Triangle program. The first converted location opened in July 2024 in Kitchener, Ontario.

===Retail===
Moody&#x27;s observed Canadian Tire&#x27;s unique position in Canadian retail as being &quot;often both misunderstood and underestimated&quot; and &quot;completely foreign&quot; in comparison to U.S. retail, citing its variety of products (ranging from auto parts to sporting goods to outdoors products and grocery at some locations) and that &quot;its proprietary &#x27;currency,&#x27; Canadian Tire money, which is a by-product of its loyalty program, has been accepted across Canada by multiple retailers and could almost be described as a &#x27;sub-fiat&#x27; currency.&quot;

In November 2000, Canadian Tire introduced an online retail operation. On January 1, 2009, citing consumer disinterest in online shopping compared to its physical stores, the Company discontinued online sales. On November 1, 2013, Canadian Tire returned to online shopping with delivery to stores.

In 2009, Canadian Tire introduced a new &quot;Smart store&quot; concept featuring &quot;boutiques&quot; that prominently showcased products within the chain&#x27;s core product categories. Popular product categories such as auto parts and home goods were moved towards the front of the store to improve their prominence, and some locations began to sell common groceries as a pilot project.

With the demise of Target&#x27;s businesses in Canada in 2015, Canadian Tire acquired the leases of 12 former Target store locations.

In June 2015, Canadian Tire opened its largest location to-date at South Edmonton Common, which features of retail space on two floors, widened and expanded departments, various interactive experiences (including a driving simulator and virtual reality), as well as a rotating exhibit of Hockey Canada memorabilia.

In September 2022, Canadian Tire opened a flagship location at Carlingwood Mall in Ottawa to mark the company&#x27;s centennial; it introduces a large-scale concept called &quot;Remarkable Retail,&quot; which carries a modernized design and focuses on enhancing its auto centres, seasonal departments, and delivery and pickup services. The concept was also used for a new location in Welland, Ontario and will be used for a future Calgary location. That year, the company also committed $1.2 billion to renovate 225 stores with its &quot;Concept Connect&quot; format. The following month, Canadian Tire also opened its largest location to-date in Chilliwack, British Columbia at the Cottonwood Centre; occupying a former Sears, it has of retail space.

====Automotive parts====

In addition to the Canadian Tire stores&#x27; Parts department, CTC owns PartSource, an automotive parts and accessories specialty chain which has 91 stores across Nova Scotia, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. It serves commercial automotive installers and do-it-yourself mechanics. Before November 2013, some stores were owned and operated by franchisees; all currently belong to Canadian Tire.

====Clothing====
In 2001, Canadian Tire acquired Mark&#x27;s Work Wearhouse (now branded as Mark&#x27;s), a retailer of business casual and work wear, for $116 million. Along with standalone stores, some Canadian Tire locations feature integrated Mark&#x27;s locations. Due to space constraints, some smaller Canadian Tire locations removed their Mark&#x27;s department when remodelled into the &quot;Smart store&quot; format .

In May 2018, the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan sold the Norwegian sportswear retailer Helly Hansen to Canadian Tire for $985 million.

====Sporting goods====
In May 2011, Canadian Tire announced the purchase of Forzani Group, a Canadian sporting goods retailer that operates various brands, including SportChek, Atmosphere, Intersport, Hockey Experts, National Sports, Nevada Bob&#x27;s Golf, S3, Sport Mart, Sports Experts, Tech Shop, Pro Hockey Life, and The Fitness Source. In February 2021, Canadian Tire announced the closure of all National Sports stores, citing a focus on efficiencies and core assets.

====Party City====
In October 2019, Canadian Tire closed its acquisition of Party City&#x27;s Canadian business. As part of the deal, CTC signed a 10-year supply agreement with Party City&#x27;s parent company Amscan.

==Marketing==
===Advertisements===
Historically, Canadian Tire&#x27;s Christmas ads featured Santa Claus and Ebenezer Scrooge arguing about whether Canadian Tire&#x27;s selection or their sales prices were the reason to do Christmas shopping there, involving the marketing slogan &quot;Give like Santa, save like Scrooge&quot;.

A stamp was issued by Canada Post commemorating Canadian Tire&#x27;s 75th anniversary. It is based on the Canadian Tire advertisement showing a boy (Bike Story) receiving his first bicycle, which his father purchased at a Canadian Tire retail store.

Starting in 2007, the company ran month-long advent calendar promotions, offering free CDs and discounts throughout the holiday season.

From 1997 to 2005, the company&#x27;s ads featured the &quot;Canadian Tire couple&quot;. The male role, also known as the Canadian Tire guy, was played by Canadian actor Ted Simonett, and Gloria Slade played the female role. They usually showcase a new product to one of their neighbours who needs a specific tool. The &quot;Canadian Tire Couple&quot; was featured on &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; as one of their targets of the year, as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most annoying couple.&quot; They also made a feature guest appearance on &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; as actors in a skit.

In early 2006, ads featuring the couple were phased out and replaced by a new campaign featuring overhead signs found in Canadian Tire&#x27;s store aisles.

In 2013, Canadian Tire produced a commercial promoting its MasterCraft Eliminator Ultra car battery, and its ability to function in extreme cold, which featured a stripped GMC Sierra pickup truck with its body re-created as an ice sculpture. The ad premiered during the 2014 NHL Winter Classic.

In March 2015, Canadian Tire launched a new ongoing marketing campaign, &quot;Tested for Life in Canada.&quot; The campaign, which includes television advertising and in-store labels, showcases products that have been vetted based on input by a consumer focus group recruited by the chain and their reviews of the products. The program also collects feedback that is used to help improve products marketed by Canadian Tire.

===Sports sponsorships===
====Motorsport====

During the 1980s, the company sponsored an IndyCar racing team. Alfred J. Billes&#x27;s son David Billes was a Canadian Corvette racer before opening Performance Engineering Ltd. He was later Jacques Villeneuve Sr.&#x27;s car owner in CART IndyCar competition in the early 1980s and entered two cars in the 1985 Indianapolis 500. In 1985, Jacques Villeneuve Sr. won the race at Road America.

David Billes was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 1994.

The company has had naming rights at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, formerly known as Mosport International Raceway, since 2012.

====Other sports====
The home arena of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) has been known as the Canadian Tire Centre since 2013.

The company sponsors the Northern Super League, which is planned to be Canada&#x27;s top division of women&#x27;s soccer.

<doc id="177851" wikidata="Q591967" url="?curid=177851" title="Blizzard of Ozz">
<text>Blizzard of Ozz is the debut studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, released on 12 September 1980 in the UK and on 27 March 1981 in the US. The album was Osbourne&#x27;s first release following his firing from Black Sabbath in 1979. &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; is the first of two studio albums Osbourne recorded with guitarist Randy Rhoads prior to Rhoads&#x27; death in 1982. In 2017, it was ranked 9th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Composition and recording==
Much of the album was written by guitarist Randy Rhoads, bassist Bob Daisley, and Ozzy Osbourne in a live-in rehearsal facility in Monmouth, Wales, with a friend of Osbourne&#x27;s named Barry Scrannage performing as the group&#x27;s drummer. Scrannage was never considered as a candidate to be the group&#x27;s permanent drummer and was not involved in the songwriting process at all. The band recorded demos of the songs &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, &quot;Crazy Train&quot;, &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot;, and &quot;You Looking at Me Looking at You&quot; in Birmingham in early 1980 with ex-Lone Star drummer Dixie Lee. They had hoped Lee would be a permanent member but &quot;he wasn&#x27;t the final piece of the puzzle&quot;, bassist Daisley recalls. After auditioning several drummers, ex-Uriah Heep member Lee Kerslake was hired as the permanent drummer. The completed lineup retreated to Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire for six days to rehearse and give Kerslake an opportunity to learn the new songs. A week later, they travelled to Ridge Farm Studio to commence recording.

The first track written for the album was &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot;. Osbourne has stated that the song was his way of saying goodbye to his former band Black Sabbath, as he had thought his career was over after leaving the band. After performing a show in Birmingham, the band hastily returned to Ridge Farm to remix &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; for a single. The next morning they were informed that their label Jet Records instead wanted a brand new song to release as a single. Rhoads, Daisley, and Kerslake quickly put together the song &quot;You Said It All&quot;, with drummer Kerslake performing the guide vocal at soundcheck while a drunken Osbourne slept under the drum riser. The song was ultimately never recorded, though a live version was released on &quot;Ozzy Osbourne Live EP&quot; in 1980. The final track written was &quot;No Bone Movies&quot;, which was originally intended to be used only as a B-side but was added to the album in order to give Kerslake a writing credit, as all the other material had been written before he joined the band. Keyboardist Don Airey claims that parts of &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth)&quot; as well as the intro to &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; were written by him in the studio, though he never received writing credit for these contributions.

Chris Tsangarides was originally hired to produce the album, with Max Norman to serve as studio engineer. Osbourne and the band were very unhappy with Tsangarides&#x27; production and he was fired and replaced with Norman, who stepped in to complete producing and engineering. Norman&#x27;s production work on &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; is uncredited, though he did go on to produce all of Osbourne&#x27;s albums prior to 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;.

At the time of the album&#x27;s recording, the band itself was billed as &quot;The Blizzard of Ozz&quot;. The band members were expecting the album to be credited to the band with Osbourne&#x27;s name in smaller print, just as it appeared on the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; single released several days prior. The back cover of the first pressing of the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; single stated that the track came from a forthcoming Jet Records album entitled &quot;Ozzy Osbourne/ Blizzard of Ozz Vol. 1&quot;. In fact, when the band appeared at the Reading Festival in 1980 they were billed simply as &quot;Ossie Osborne&#x27;s New Band&quot;. According to Daisley, &quot;When the album was released the words &#x27;Ozzy Osbourne&#x27; were in bigger print than &#x27;The Blizzard of Ozz&#x27; which made it look like an Ozzy Osbourne album called &quot;The Blizzard of Ozz&quot;. Randy [Rhoads] was never one to rock the boat. He knew he was in a situation which was a good opportunity for him being relatively unknown, so when Lee [Kerslake] and I were ousted, Randy had no allies and the act became &#x27;Ozzy Osbourne&#x27; and no longer a band.&quot; Rhoads felt that he and Daisley were contributing the vast majority of the songwriting and arranging, and he had little interest in performing in a backing band for someone he felt wasn&#x27;t contributing as much. Drummer Kerslake has maintained that Rhoads almost left the band in late 1981, due to this displeasure. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to go [on tour with Osbourne]. We told him we were thrown out. He said he was going to leave the band as he did not want to leave us behind. I told him not to be stupid but thanks for the sentiment&quot;, the drummer later recalled. Entertainment attorney Steven Machat, who was involved in the deal Osbourne signed with Jet Records, said in his 2011 book &quot;Gods, Gangsters and Honour: A Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Odyssey&quot; that Osbourne&#x27;s soon-to-be manager and wife Sharon Levy was not happy with the level of creative input that Rhoads, Daisley, and Kerslake had in the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; album and did not want them to share the credit. Album producer Max Norman concurs that Daisley and Kerslake made considerable songwriting contributions during their time in the band, while also noting that the Osbourne camp &quot;might want to dispute that now.&quot;

Although Sharon has said that the recording of &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; was one of the best experiences of her life, she was in Los Angeles during recording and not yet involved with the band. Osbourne&#x27;s then-wife Thelma was present at Ridge Farms Studios for much of the recording.

==Release==
The album tracks &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; were released as singles in 1980. &quot;Crazy Train&quot; made number 49 on the UK Singles Chart and was moderately successful in the United States, reaching number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Tracks chart and the single peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart in 1981. Though it received little radio airplay upon its initial release, &quot;Crazy Train&quot; has become one of Osbourne&#x27;s signature songs and a staple of classic rock radio playlists over the ensuing years. In January 2009, the song achieved a 2× Platinum certification status.

The album was a commercial success, being certified 4× Platinum in the US in 1997, a feat Osbourne would not achieve again until &quot;No More Tears&quot; was certified in 2000. In 2019 it was certified 5× Platinum. In the UK, it was the first of four Osbourne albums to attain Silver certification (60,000 units shipped) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in August 1981. It also ranked 13th on a &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers poll of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time&quot;. In his autobiography, Osbourne readily admitted that at the time the album was being recorded, he felt he was in direct competition with his former band, Black Sabbath.
&quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; was controversially re-released in 2002 with the original bass and drum tracks replaced by newly recorded parts from bassist Robert Trujillo and drummer Mike Bordin; however, the original bass and drum tracks were reinstated for the 2011 release due to public outcry. The 2011 release was certified Silver by BPI in 2013. A box set featuring both re-issued albums, the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz/Diary of a Madman 30th Anniversary Deluxe Box Set&quot;, was released, featuring both CD re-issues, 180-gram LP Vinyl versions of both albums (original album only), the &quot;Thirty Years After the Blizzard&quot; DVD Documentary, over 70 minutes of additional rare live performances and interviews, a replica of Ozzy&#x27;s cross, and a 2 sided poster.

On September 18, 2020, Osbourne released an expanded edition of &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; including the bonus tracks and outtakes included on previous reissues (i.e. the 2002 reissue and the 2011 expanded edition) as well as seven live recordings from the Blizzard of Ozz tour and one additional live track.

== Controversies ==

===&quot;Suicide Solution&quot;===
The song &quot;Suicide Solution&quot; has met with its share of controversy, most notably the October 1984 suicide of 19-year-old John McCollum who shot himself in the head. McCollum&#x27;s parents alleged that their son had listened to the song immediately prior to killing himself, and they sued Osbourne along with CBS Records for &quot;encouraging self-destructive behavior&quot; in young people who were &quot;especially susceptible&quot; to dangerous influences (&quot;McCollum et al. v. CBS, Inc., et al.&quot;). In his defence, Osbourne stated in court that when the song was being written the words &quot;Wine is fine but whiskey&#x27;s quicker&quot; came to him suddenly and were a reflection not on the merits of suicide but rather on the death of AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott, a friend of Osbourne&#x27;s who had recently died of alcohol-related misadventure. Bob Daisley, who claims to have written the majority of the song&#x27;s lyrics, has stated that he had Osbourne&#x27;s own substance abuse issues in mind when he composed the song. The McCollums&#x27; complaint was dismissed on the grounds that the First Amendment protected Osbourne&#x27;s right to free artistic expression.

=== 2002 reissue ===
In 1986, Daisley and Kerslake sued Osbourne for unpaid royalties, eventually winning songwriting credits on &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. Subsequently, a 2002 reissue was made of these albums which replaced Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s original bass and drum parts with new parts recorded by Osbourne&#x27;s then-current drummer Mike Bordin and bassist Robert Trujillo. The 2002 reissue also included new backing vocals from singers Mark Lennon and John Shanks.

Osbourne&#x27;s wife and manager, Sharon, claimed at the time that it was Ozzy, not she, who was responsible for the decision to re-record the parts, stating &quot;because of Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s abusive and unjust behaviour, Ozzy wanted to remove them from these recordings. We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums.&quot; However, Osbourne contradicted this claim in his 2009 autobiography, stating that the decision to re-record the original bass and drum parts was Sharon&#x27;s decision, and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t have anything to do with&quot; it. He said his wife &quot;just snapped&quot; and had it done without his knowledge. He also stated that &quot;a sticker was put on the covers telling everyone about it&quot;, although the sticker was not initially placed on the re-issue and was only placed on the covers at a later date due to fan outcry over the altered recordings.

In 2003, Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court in Los Angeles. This dismissal was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. With regard to the reissue, Ozzy stated to The Pulse of Radio, reiterating a conversation with Sharon, &quot;You know what, whatever the circumstances were, I want the original thing back.&quot; The 30th Anniversary release of &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; contains the original recordings, not the 2002 remixes.

<doc id="177852" wikidata="Q730613" url="?curid=177852" title="Diary of a Madman (album)">
<text>Diary of a Madman is the second studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. It was released in October 1981, and re-issued on CD on 22 August 1995. This is the last Osbourne studio album to feature guitarist Randy Rhoads and drummer Lee Kerslake. An altered version appeared in 2002 with the original bass and drum parts removed and re-recorded. In 2011, a &quot;Deluxe 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released with all original parts restored. To date, the album has sold over 3 million copies worldwide.

&quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; was supported by the Diary of a Madman Tour, which began on November 5, 1981, and ended August 8, 1982, spanning Europe, North America, and Asia. On March 19, 1982, during the North American leg of the tour, Rhoads died in a plane crash in Leesburg, Florida; after a two-week break, the tour continued with guitarist Bernie Tormé performing several shows in place of Rhoads before in turn being replaced by Brad Gillis.

==Composition and recording==

&quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; is the final album recorded with late guitarist Randy Rhoads. Although bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Tommy Aldridge are credited in the liner notes and pictured on the inner sleeve for the American vinyl and cassette release and later CD re-issues, it was bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake who performed all bass and drum parts on the original release. Aldridge has stated of the album, &quot;I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that it&#x27;s not my drumming on that album. I have never taken credit for that recording and have always given Lee Kerslake, whenever asked or interviewed, the credit he rightly deserves.&quot;

Daisley provided significant contributions to the album&#x27;s songwriting, having written some of the music and most of the lyrics. Kerslake claims to have also had a hand in the writing of the album, even performing lead vocals on some of the original demo recordings. Flying High Again&#x27; was one of my ideas, &#x27;Over the Mountain&#x27; was another. The basic (demo) tracks were just Bob&#x27;s words, my vocals—though some of the words I wrote—and Randy&#x27;s playing. It was unreal. And then we got Don Airey to come in and do the keyboards&quot;, he stated in 2009. Kerslake says he used a piano in the studio to write many of the songs with guitarist Randy Rhoads. Daisley and Kerslake were not given credit for their performance or songwriting contributions, a situation which resulted in a later lawsuit.

During the album&#x27;s recording, Kerslake says the band members were given no money to live on, prompting them to approach management. Shortly after, both Kerslake and Daisley were fired. &quot;Everything was working fine,&quot; said Kerslake. &quot;It was only when Sharon (Osbourne) came in that we had a problem. When she started managing—taking over—she wasn&#x27;t the manager until &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. Before that was her brother, David. He didn&#x27;t really want to handle it. He had too much to do for Don in the office. So she came in and it started to get edgy. But we never suspected a thing until we went away on holiday. Next minute, they&#x27;re rehearsing with Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo, and going to America.&quot;

Although Don Airey is credited as keyboardist on the album, it was in fact a musician named Johnny Cook (who had worked with Daisley in Mungo Jerry in the 1970s) who actually recorded the keyboard parts. Airey was on tour as a member of Rainbow at the time of recording and was thus unavailable.

==Cover art==
The album&#x27;s cover art features Osbourne&#x27;s son Louis to his side, with Osbourne himself posing in theatrical make-up.

==Reception==

Reception of the album has been generally positive. In particular, the neo-classical guitar work of Randy Rhoads has received much praise. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not uncommon to find fans who prefer &quot;Diary&quot; to &quot;Blizzard&quot;, since it sets an even more mystical, eerie mood, and since Rhoads&#x27; playing is progressing to an even higher level&quot;. BBC Music referred to the album as &quot;a classic rock record in every way&quot;, &quot;lifted out of the ordinary by the legendary rock axe god, Randy Rhoads&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff called &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; &quot;a lasting classic that stands as the definitive showcase for Randy Rhoads.&quot;

Though the album is regarded quite favorably today, reviews upon its 1981 release were often less than enthusiastic. J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, for example, opined upon the album&#x27;s original release that &quot;the songs here are little more than riffs with a vocal line pasted on top&quot; and referred to Rhoads as &quot;a junior-league Eddie Van Halen – bustling with chops but somewhat short on imagination&quot;. The magazine, however, would change its tune and later rank the album 15th on its 2017 list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

== Re-issues ==

===The 2002 re-issue controversy===
The 2002 &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; reissue was derided by fans due to the removal of Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s original bass and drum tracks. The re-issue featured re-recorded bass and drum tracks contributed by Osbourne&#x27;s then-bassist and drummer Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin, respectively. The move was suspected of being retaliatory in nature, as Daisley and Kerslake had successfully sued Osbourne and his wife/manager Sharon in court, winning songwriting credits and royalties for their contributions to &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;.

Sharon later stated that Ozzy and not herself was responsible for the decision to re-record the parts, stating &quot;because of Daisley and Kerslake&#x27;s abusive and unjust behavior, Ozzy wanted to remove them from these recordings. We turned a negative into a positive by adding a fresh sound to the original albums.&quot; However, Osbourne contradicted this claim in his 2009 autobiography, stating that the decision to re-record the original bass and drum parts was strictly Sharon&#x27;s decision, and that &quot;I didn&#x27;t have anything to do with that decision.&quot; He said his wife &quot;just snapped&quot; and had it done without his knowledge. He also stated that &quot;a sticker was put on the covers telling everyone about it&quot;, though in fact the sticker was not initially placed on the re-issue and was only placed on the covers at a later date due to fan outcry over the altered recordings.

===Deluxe 30th Anniversary Edition===
In May 2011, Sony Legacy released its &quot;Deluxe 30th Anniversary Editions&quot; of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; and &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; with the original bass and drum tracks. These releases also featured bonus tracks and previously unreleased live material featuring guitarist Rhoads – &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; features a second CD entitled &quot;Ozzy Live&quot;, featuring previously-unreleased concert performances from the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; 1981 US tour. A box set was also released which included the remastered editions of both albums on CD as well as vinyl, and a DVD documentary entitled &quot;Thirty Years After The Blizzard&quot;.
&quot;Ozzy Live&quot; was also separately released as a double 180g vinyl exclusively on Record Store Day 2012.

<doc id="177853" wikidata="Q632888" url="?curid=177853" title="Tribute (Ozzy Osbourne album)">
<text>Tribute is a live album by British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, featuring his work with hard rock guitarist Randy Rhoads, in whose honor the album was released. The album was released in April 1987 in the US and May 1987 in the UK, five years after the death of Rhoads, then it was reissued on 22 August 1995, and again remastered and reissued in 2002. It peaked at number 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

==Background==
The album was released in memory of Randy Rhoads, guitarist for Osbourne&#x27;s band between 1979 and 1982 who died in a plane crash while on tour in Florida in 1982. The album also includes studio outtakes of Rhoads recording the classical-influenced acoustic guitar piece &quot;Dee&quot;, which Rhoads wrote for his mother Delores and which was originally included on Osbourne&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;.

A live album consisting entirely of renditions of Black Sabbath songs was originally planned to be recorded at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens in mid-1982 with Rhoads. Rhoads and drummer Tommy Aldridge felt that they had established themselves as recording artists and an album of cover songs would be a step backwards artistically, and they refused to participate. Bassist Rudy Sarzo was uncomfortable with refusing to perform, not having the same recording pedigree of his bandmates, but he stood with them and the trio informed management of their decision. Osbourne felt betrayed and his relationship with Rhoads never fully recovered. Plans for this proposed live album crumbled upon Rhoads&#x27; sudden death weeks later, though the plan was resurrected with the release of &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; later that year with Sarzo and Aldridge joined by Night Ranger guitarist Brad Gillis.

==Overview==
The majority of &quot;Tribute&quot;, from &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; through to &quot;Paranoid&quot;, was recorded live in Cleveland, Ohio on 11 May 1981. &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; and &quot;No Bone Movies&quot; are taken from an earlier English gig in support of the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; album, possibly from Southampton on 2 October 1980. These two tracks feature bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake.

The versions of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, and &quot;Paranoid&quot; featured on &quot;Tribute&quot; were originally intended to be included on the 1982 live album &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;. In the months following Rhoads&#x27; death, these three songs were intended to be released in tribute to the guitarist, but a record company decision was made to save them for a full album to be released at a later date.

The recording of &quot;Crazy Train&quot; that appears on this album was also released as the album&#x27;s only single on 10 February 1987, along with an accompanying music video. The album&#x27;s cover photo was taken at a performance in Rosemont, Illinois on 24 January 1982, by photographer Paul Natkin.

The operatic music which opens &quot;Tribute&quot;, as well as all of Osbourne&#x27;s live shows of that era, is &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from the &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; scenic cantata by Carl Orff. This introductory music was omitted from the 1995 remaster, with opening track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; subsequently being shortened to 4:43.

<text>Guy Edward Pearce (born 5 October 1967) is an Australian actor. He has received various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award, AACTA Award, and nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and two Golden Globe Awards.

Pearce started his career portraying Mike Young in the Australian television series &quot;Neighbours&quot; (1986–1989). Pearce received international attention for his breakout roles in &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (1994), Ed Exley in Curtis Hanson&#x27;s crime noir &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997) and a man suffering short-term memory loss in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Memento&quot; (2000).

His subsequent roles were in &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (2002), &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (2002), &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (2008), &quot;The Road&quot; (2009), &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; (2009), &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010), &quot;Lawless&quot; (2012), and &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot; (2018). He portrayed Peter Weyland in &quot;Prometheus&quot; (2012) and &quot;&quot; (2017), and acted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe playing Aldrich Killian in the film &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013). In Australian cinema he has acted in &quot;The Proposition&quot; (2005), &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot; (2010), &quot;The Rover&quot; (2014), and &quot;Swinging Safari&quot; (2018). For his performance as a wealthy industrialist in &quot;The Brutalist&quot; (2024), he received a nomination for the Academy Award and the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.

On television, he has played the title role in the series of films &quot;Jack Irish&quot; (2012–2021). Pearce starred in the HBO miniseries &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; (2011) and &quot;Mare of Easttown&quot; (2021). The former won him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor.

==Early life==
Pearce was born on 5 October 1967 in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England. His father, Stuart Pearce, was a Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot and RAF test pilot, and his mother, Anne Cocking (), was an English schoolteacher. He has an elder sister, Tracy. When Pearce was three years old, the family relocated to Geelong, Victoria, Australia. When he was eight years old, Pearce&#x27;s father died in an aircraft accident.

Pearce attended Geelong College, and was a member of the Geelong Society of Operatic and Dramatic Arts (GSODA) Junior Players. At the age of 16, he was a competitive amateur bodybuilder, leading to the title of Junior Mr. Victoria. He lived in Box Hill North, Victoria in the late 1980s while working on the Australian drama series &quot;Neighbours&quot;. His first film appearance, while still at Geelong College, was in a Victorian Vice Chancellors-funded film &quot;Life and Study at University&quot;, produced and directed by Peter Lane of Deakin University.

==Career==
=== Film and television ===
Pearce transitioned to television when he was cast in the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1986, playing the role of Mike Young for three years, a role which he reprised in 2022 for the show&#x27;s final episode. Pearce also found roles in other television series such as &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1988) and &quot;Snowy River: The McGregor Saga&quot; (1993).

The director/producer/writer Frank Howson cast Pearce in his first three films, &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;, &quot;Hunting&quot;, and &quot;Flynn&quot;, and paid for him to go to the Cannes Film Festival in 1991 for the premiere of the Howson-directed &quot;Hunting&quot;. The accompanying Howson-funded publicity campaign brought Pearce to the attention of the international film industry. He made his first major film breakthrough shortly after, with his role as a drag queen in &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; in 1994. Since then, he has appeared in several US productions including &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, &quot;Ravenous&quot;, &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, &quot;Memento&quot;, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, and &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

Pearce portrayed pop artist Andy Warhol in &quot;Factory Girl&quot; and Harry Houdini in &quot;Death Defying Acts.&quot; He also appeared in &quot;The Road&quot; and in &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; with Adam Sandler. Pearce continued to perform in Australian films, such as &quot;The Hard Word&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Proposition&quot; (2005), written by fellow Australian Nick Cave.

In January 2009, Pearce returned to the stage after a seven-year absence. He performed in the Melbourne Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Poor Boy&quot;, a play with music, co-written by Matt Cameron and Tim Finn. In 2009, he portrayed Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson in &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot;. In 2010, he appeared as David, Prince of Wales, who became Edward VIII, in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;. Both films won the Academy Award for Best Picture, making Pearce the first actor to appear in back-to-back Best Picture winners since Michael Peña (who appeared in &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and &quot;Crash&quot;).

Pearce starred as the eponymous lead in the Australian TV miniseries &quot;Jack Irish&quot;, an adaptation of the detective novels of author Peter Temple broadcast on the ABC network in 2012. In May 2012, Pearce was cast to star in David Michôd&#x27;s &quot;The Rover&quot;. In 2013, Pearce played the villain character Aldrich Killian in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot;. Pearce appeared in a documentary special celebrating &quot;Neighbours&quot;″ 30th anniversary, &quot;Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite&quot;, which aired in Australia and the UK in 2015. Pearce had a supporting role in Neil Armfield&#x27;s 2015 romantic-drama film &quot;Holding the Man&quot;. For his role in the 2024 film &quot;The Brutalist&quot;, he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination.

=== Music ===
In 1989, Pearce released the single &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; from the soundtrack &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot;. The song peaked at number 156 on the ARIA Charts. He appeared in Australian band Silverchair&#x27;s music video for &quot;Across the Night&quot; and in Razorlight&#x27;s video for &quot;Before I Fall to Pieces.&quot; Pearce recorded the soundtrack for &quot;A Slipping-Down Life&quot;, singing and playing guitar on cover versions of songs by Ron Sexsmith, Vic Chesnutt and Robyn Hitchcock. Pearce released his first album, &quot;Broken Bones&quot;, in November 2014. Pearce released his second studio album, &quot;The Nomad&quot;, in 2018. He appeared in the video for the song &quot;Follow Me Around&quot; by Radiohead.

==Personal life==
Pearce married his childhood sweetheart, psychologist Kate Mestitz, in March 1997. In October 2015, Pearce announced their divorce. Pearce was in a relationship with Dutch actress Carice van Houten; they had a son in August 2016. In January 2025, Van Houten stated that she and Pearce have split, and have &quot;...not been a couple for years&quot;.

Pearce has supported charitable organisations related to animal conservation and habitat preservation, as well as publicly expressing his solidarity with the Palestinian people during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

In February 2025, Pearce accused his &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; co-star Kevin Spacey of sexually harassing him while filming the movie. Spacey responded to the accusation by posting a video on the social media platform X, where he told Pearce to &quot;grow up&quot; and that he was &quot;not a victim.&quot;

<text>Curtis Lee Hanson (March 24, 1945 – September 20, 2016) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Born in Reno, Nevada, Hanson grew up in Los Angeles. After dropping out of high school, Hanson worked as photographer and editor for &quot;Cinema&quot; magazine. In the 1970s, Hanson participated as a writer for the horror film &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot; (1970) and made his directorial debut the B-Movie &quot;Sweet Kill&quot; (1973), where he lacked creative control to fulfill his vision. While Hanson continued directing, he rose to prominence screenwriting critically acclaimed films such as &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; (1978), &quot;White Dog&quot; (1982), and &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1983). 

After working on projects that kept him unsatisfied, he decided that he should write and direct thriller films based on the success of &quot;The Silent Partner.&quot; Hence, he followed up with &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987) where his writing and directing finally came to merge. By this point, his body of work made an impression on screenwriter David Koepp, who was convinced that he could handle the directorial duties for his script, which led to &quot;Bad Influence&quot; (1990). Finally he directed &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992), which was both a critical and commercial success

Moving forward he directed the thriller &quot;The River Wild&quot; (1994), which grossed $94.2 million. Afterwards, he directed the acclaimed neo-noir crime film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997) earning him the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as well as nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. The film was also nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and is preserved by the Library of Congress in the National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

His next directorial effort was the critically acclaimed comedy-drama &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; (2000). Then came the hip-hop drama &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002), starring rapper Eminem and based on his life experiences. The film was a triumph with critics and at the box-office grossing $242.9 million. Finally the romantic comedy &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; (2005), was also critically acclaimed and a financial success.

Prior to his 2014 retirement, due to poor health, Hanson directed &quot;Lucky You&quot; (2007), and &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot; (2012), both had troubled productions and the final results did not came near his previous critical and financial accomplishments. Hanson last significant directorial effort was the HBO television film &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot; (2011) receiving nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series or Movie and Outstanding Directing for a Limited Series or Movie. Hanson died of natural causes in 2016.

== Early life ==
Hanson was born in Reno, Nevada, and grew up in Los Angeles. He was the son of Beverly June Curtis, a real estate agent, and Wilbur Hale &quot;Bill&quot; Hanson, a teacher. Hanson dropped out of high school, finding work as a freelance photographer and editor for &quot;Cinema&quot; magazine.

== Film career ==
=== 1970 to 1982: early writing and directing efforts ===
In 1970, Hanson is listed among the writers of Daniel Haller&#x27;s &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, a film adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story.

In 1973, Hanson wrote and directed his first feature, &quot;Sweet Kill&quot; starring Tab Hunter. The film came about when Hanson approached the executive producer Roger Corman about the possibility of writing and directing a film for him. Corman replied he might also be interested in a modern horror film along the lines of &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). Hanson wrote the script originally with the killer as a female. Corman liked it but felt it was &quot;a little too different&quot; for the killer to be female so asked she be turned male. According to Hanson, the film cost $130,000 and Corman was supposed to put up two-thirds of the money. After Corman decided to only put up a third, Hanson said &quot;I went to my parents and persuaded them to put a mortgage on their home in order to finance this film.&quot; After creative interference from Corman, Hanson later described the experience as a &quot;very unhappy&quot; one.

That same year, Hanson, with the pseudonym Edward Collins, shot a film called &quot;And God Bless Grandma and Grandpa&quot;. Producer Peter S. Traynor wanted to shoot new scenes. Which he did with actor Dean Jagger, in 1974, who played a character named &quot;Dr. Shagetz.&quot; It was renamed &quot;God Bless Dr. Shagetz.&quot; In 1975, a litigation started between Traynor and the film&#x27;s financial investors. It is rumored that with the name &quot;God Bless Dr. Shagetz,&quot; it had limited released in 1977. In 1983, a producer named Mardi Rustam, bought the films rights and shot new footage. In 1985, Rusham&#x27;s version was released as a direct to video title name &quot;Evil Town&quot;.

In 1978, Hanson wrote and was an associate producer for Daryl Duke&#x27;s Canadian film &quot;The Silent Partner&quot;. The film came about when Hanson was being asked to direct b-level picture and decided to write something more ambitious. He said that &quot;&quot;The Silent Partner&quot; was a film I wrote on spec. I was hoping to direct it but I didn&#x27;t get the opportunity. But I ended up finishing the movie. I was brought back by the producers to do a week of pick-up shots and all of the post-production. &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; did well in Canada both critically and financially, winning several Canadian Film Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. The film was a sleeper upon its US release, with Brendon Hanley of the film database Allmovie noting that the film&quot;...stands out as one of the best sleepers of the late &#x27;70s&quot;.

In 1980, Hanson directed &quot;The Little Dragons&quot; starring Chris and Pat Petersen.

In 1982, Hanson was among the screenwriters of Samuel Fuller&#x27;s &quot;White Dog&quot;. The film depicts the struggle of a dog trainer named Keys, who is black, trying to retrain a stray dog trained to make vicious attacks upon, and to kill, any black person. &quot;White Dog&quot; was a 1970 novel, whose story was purchased for use by Paramount in 1975, with Hanson selected to write the screenplay and Roman Polanski hired to direct. Before shooting commenced, Polanski had legal problems, leaving the production in limbo. Over a span of six years, the project was given to various writers and producers. By 1981, Hanson, back on board as the film&#x27;s screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film&#x27;s director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on short notice, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. The film was praised by critics, particularly for its treatment of racism and Fuller&#x27;s directorial talents.

=== 1983 to 1994: rise to prominence and breakthrough ===
In 1983, Hanson directed &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot;, a teen-comedy starring Tom Cruise, about teenagers going to Tijuana to visit a brothel. Hanson explains that it was &quot;not a happy experience. A picture I&#x27;m proud of the work we all did, but it was again taken away, retitled, re-edited and music was stuck in I didn&#x27;t like.&quot; The film received negative reviews from critics. It has an 18% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews. It opened in 180 theaters in New York and Los Angeles, opening with $437,257 for the weekend; it grossed $1,246,141 domestically.

That same year he was credited among the writers of Carroll Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot;. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 100% based on reviews from eighteen critics, with an average rating of 7.7 out of 10. The film grossed in the US $27,668,764.

In 1986, Hanson directed the made-for-television crime drama film &quot;The Children of Times Square&quot;.

In 1987, Hanson directed &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; starring Steve Guttenberg, Isabelle Huppert, and Elizabeth McGovern. The film came about, while Hanson was only offered teen-comedies after &quot;Losin&#x27; It&quot; and wanted to accomplish something like &quot;The Silent Partners&quot;. He explains that, when he read the novel &quot;The Witness&quot; by Anne Holden and tried to get the film rights. Already bought by Paramount, Hanson made a deal with them. Hanson says McGovern was his &quot;only choice&quot; for the part of Denise. Hanson decided to cast French actress Huppert for a part of an American character, who felt she added sophistication to the role. Hanson says Guttenberg was not his first choice for the lead but rather a suggestion by producer Dino De Laurentiis, due to his popularity in comedies. Hanson agreed to cast Guttenberg, when he saw the actor&#x27;s enthusiasm, and his eagerness to escape typecast. Upon its original release, the film received mixed reviews from other film critics. As of April 2021, the film holds a 70% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus: &quot;A likable cast and mostly solid story...&quot; Of the film Hanson concluded &quot;that was the one where my writing and directing finally merged.&quot;

In 1990, Hanson directed &quot;Bad Influence&quot;, starring Rob Lowe and James Spader. Hanson stated that the film bears similarities to his earlier movies, &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; and &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot;. He said all are about a &quot;character who takes a step out of line. In these pictures the guy is very guilty ... and his guilt gets him in deeper and deeper. Because he&#x27;s guilty he pays a terrible price, but we feel better because he paid that price and he ends up with a strict moral code he didn&#x27;t have at the start of the picture.&quot; He explained that he got the directing duties because screenwriter David Koepp &quot;was a big fan of a picture I had written called &quot;The Silent Partner&quot;. When he wrote &quot;Bad Influence&quot;, which actually had elements in it that were kind of inspired by &quot;The Silent Partner&quot;, I think this is something David would be the first to say himself, the people who financed the movie were going, &quot;Who should we get to direct this?&quot; As it happened, one of them was a big fan of &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; and said, &quot;Well, what about that guy?&quot; and David went, &quot;That&#x27;s a great idea!&quot; During rehearsals, a sex scandal story broke about Lowe. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in the theory that any publicity is good,&quot; said Hanson. &quot;For Rob&#x27;s sake and the picture&#x27;s sake, I wish it had never happened. The story broke shortly before rehearsals and my reaction was completely selfish. I kept wondering, &#x27;How does this affect the movie? How does it affect his performance?&#x27; It was like a carnival atmosphere around him.&quot; Hanson said of the final result that &quot;&quot;Bad Influence&quot; is a movie that I&#x27;m very proud of, actually. It was the first movie where I was pretty much, within the confines of budget and obvious considerations like that, I was pretty much able to follow through with this all the way to the end including the choice of music, right down to the end.&quot; &quot;Bad Influence&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. It holds a 65% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews.

In 1992 Hanson directed &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.&quot; The film opened on January 10, 1992, and grossed $7.7 million in its opening weekend. The film lasted at #1 for four consecutive weeks and by the end of its run earned $88 million in the United States and Canada and $52 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $140 million.

=== 1994 to 2005: continued success ===
In 1994, Hanson directed the adventure film &quot;The River Wild&quot; starring Meryl Streep, Kevin Bacon, and David Strathairn&quot;.&quot; It grossed $94,216,343 worldwide, earning $46,816,343 in the United States and Canada and $47,400,000 internationally.

In 1997, Hanson directed the noir film &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;. Prior to the Warner Brothers acquisition of the James Ellroy novel &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;, and his hiring as a writer and director, Hanson had been a long-time fan of the author. Regarding Ellroy&#x27;s characters, Hanson said &quot;What hooked me on them was that, as I met them, one after the other, I didn&#x27;t like them — but as I continued reading, I started to care about them.&quot; Ellroy&#x27;s novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him with an opportunity to &quot;set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the &#x27;20s and &#x27;30s, was being bulldozed.&quot;

Hanson was subsequently joined by screenwriter Brian Helgeland who had lobbied to be its writer prior to the hiring of Hanson. They worked on the script together for two years, with Hanson turning down jobs and Helgeland writing seven drafts for free. Relatively unknown Australian actors Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were cast in leading roles, Hanson explained that he wanted to &quot;replicate my experience of the book. You don&#x27;t like any of these characters at first, but the deeper you get into their story, the more you begin to sympathize with them. I didn&#x27;t want actors audiences knew and already liked.&quot; Hanson explained that due to the success of &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and&quot; &quot;The River Wild,&quot; he was &quot;able for the first time to initiate a picture that was a personal project from the get go. Not only initiate it, but follow through with the making of it in the way that I wanted to.&quot; &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was a critical and commercial success. It grossed $126 million against a $35 million budget and received acclaim from critics, with praise for the acting, writing, directing, editing, and Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s musical score. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning two: Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay. In 2015, the Library of Congress selected &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2000 Hanson directed &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, a comedy drama starring Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire. Actress Elizabeth McGovern advised Hanson to work with screenwriter Steve Kloves. When he was given the writer&#x27;s script for &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; and was told that Michael Douglas was interested in starring, he &quot;fell in love with these characters – and they made me laugh.&quot; Hanson also identified with the main character and the &quot;thing building up inside him: frustration, hunger, yearning, et cetera.&quot; One of the challenges for Hanson was to take a plot that, as he put it, &quot;is meandering and, apparently, sort of aimless,&quot; and a character that &quot;does things that even he doesn&#x27;t really know why he&#x27;s doing them,&quot; and try to create a &quot;feeling of focus&quot; to keep the audience interested. Another challenge the director faced was working in actual locations in very cold weather that was constantly changing. Hanson also considered Robert Downey Jr., who at the time had legal and personal problems, for a role. Downey met with Hanson where they addressed his problems. The actor demonstrated a commitment to the project and Hanson hired him. Reportedly, Downey acted professionally for the entire shoot. Hanson also contacted Dante Spinotti about working on the film in November 1998. In its opening weekend, &quot;Wonder Boys&quot; opened at No. 7 in the US and Canadian box office and grossed a total of US$5.8 million in 1,253 theaters. It went on to gross $19,393,557 there and $14,033,031 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $33,426,588. Based on a $55 million budget, the film was a box office bomb. The film received largely positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 81% rating, based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a 73 out of 100 score, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In 2000, Hanson directed the music video &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; by Bob Dylan. The song-writer Clinton Heylin wrote &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; to demonstrates a close knowledge of the film &quot;Wonder Boys&quot;, for which it was written. The lyrics make reference to &quot;dancing lessons&quot;, &quot;the jitterbug rag&quot; and dressing &quot;in drag&quot;, all of which feature in the plot of the film. Hanson recalled: &quot;I learned that Dylan might be interested in contributing an original song… So when I came back from filming in Pittsburgh, Bob came by the editing room to see some rough cut footage. I told him the story and introduced him to the characters. We talked about Grady Tripp and where he was in life, emotionally and creatively. Weeks later a CD arrived in the mail&quot;. For the music video, Hanson intercut footage of Dylan with sequences from the feature film, to suggest that Dylan was interacting with the film&#x27;s characters.

In 2002, Hanson directed &quot;8 Mile&quot; a semi-biographical hip hop drama film about and starring rapper Eminem. According to Paul Rosenberg (Eminem&#x27;s manager) both Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle were considered to direct, while Boyle came close, Eminem felt he had a better connection with Hanson. Hanson explained that his bond with Eminem began when they discussed their shared vision for &quot;8 Mile&quot;. Eminem’s admiration for Hanson’s earlier films, &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992) and &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997), helped build trust. Hanson noted that Eminem didn’t want a vanity project; instead, he sought to be part of a meaningful film. Initially, Hanson was cautious about casting him, worried that Eminem’s reputation could be a liability. He recalled a remark from actor Russell Crowe, who had previously worked with Hanson, upon hearing about the project: “Good idea, Curtis. But who are you going to get to play Eminem?” highlighting the risk of whether Eminem could carry the film as an actor. Ultimately, Hanson was won over by Eminem’s natural charisma, particularly in his expressive eyes, a quality Hanson described as essential for engaging audiences and carrying the story. Hanson added that Eminem was involved in &quot;8 Mile&quot; from the project&#x27;s inception, as writer Scott Silver developed the script with him in mind. Early drafts, however, lacked a strong connection to Detroit and set Eminem’s character as a hotel bellboy. Hanson reworked the script to ground it in Detroit’s identity, moving the character to an automotive stamping plant, shifting the timeline to 1995, and adding elements like the local radio station and arson scenes emblematic of the city’s struggles. While Eminem’s input on the script was limited to initial discussions, Hanson collaborated with him closely during rehearsals, particularly on the rap battles, explaining their thematic significance as Eminem crafted lyrics, including the theme song “Lose Yourself.” Hanson emphasized authentic casting, bringing in Detroit locals and fostering a bond among the actors, most of whom were new to film. Their group name, 3 1/3, emerged organically during rehearsals, symbolizing Detroit’s 313 area code and a deeper commentary on identity and unity. For Hanson, the goal was to create an authentic portrayal of this world, finding performers who could fully embody their characters. It received positive reviews, with critics praising the music and Eminem&#x27;s performance. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports the film has 75% of 214 professional critics giving a positive review and a rating average of 6.7/10. Also a box office success, it opened at in the US with $51.3 million grossed in its opening weekend and an eventual total of $242.9 million worldwide.

Also in 2002, Hanson directed &quot;Piddler on the roof&quot; an episode of the sitcom &quot;Greg the Bunny&quot;. Furthermore, he acted in Spike Jonze&#x27;s &quot;Adaptation&quot;.

In 2005, Hanson directed the comedy drama &quot;In Her Shoes&quot;, starring Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette. &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 164 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office, raking in $10,017,575 USD in its first opening weekend. Its worldwide gross totaled $83,697,473.

=== 2007 to 2014: later projects and retirement ===
Hanson wrote, produced and directed the 2007 film &quot;Lucky You&quot;. He developed the film with his producing partner Carol Fenelon, who was a regular competitor in poker tournaments. Hanson said, &quot;Part of the reason for wanting to make the movie was that the poker world was different, interesting, and we had an affinity for it. But the other part of it was the emotional thing. The skills at the table — and in the movie business — are different from the qualities that you want running your personal life. That single-mindedness, the aggression, the duplicity or bluffing or whatever you want to call it, the lack of sympathy...&quot; The film was initially set for release on December 16, 2005. However, the film sat on the shelf for two years and went through numerous release date changes as Warner Bros. mandated a half-dozen different cuts of the film in response to negative test screenings. Opening the same weekend as &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;, the film debuted at $2.7 million in ticket sales; the lowest saturated opening week since 1982. It finished its theatrical run with $8,382,477 in total worldwide revenue. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It holds a 28% approval rating based on 141 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

In 2010, Hanson served as an executive producer for &quot;Win-Loss&quot; and episode of the television show &quot;Three Rivers&quot;.

In 2011, Hanson directed the television film &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot;, based on the 2009 Andrew Ross Sorkin book of the same name about the beginnings of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. The film was produced by Hanson&#x27;s production company Deuce Three Productions for HBO. The film received 11 nominations at the Emmy Awards, with Hanson being nominated for &quot;Outstanding Directing For A Miniseries, Movie Or A Dramatic Special&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Miniseries or Movie&quot;.

Also in 2011, Hanson produced David Frankel&#x27;s film &quot;The Big Year.&quot;

His last film was to be &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot; in 2012. Michael Apted received director credit alongside Hanson after he took over as director during the last 15 days of principal photography, while Hanson recovered from complications arising from recent heart surgery. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 32% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 4.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It&#x27;s sweet, gentle, and affably modest, but &quot;Chasing Mavericks&quot; is ultimately pulled under by an unconvincing script and a puzzling lack of energy.&quot;

In 2014, he served as an executive producer for the FX pilot &quot;Hoke&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t picked up for a series.

Hanson later retired from film work and was reported to have frontotemporal dementia.

Within his career, he was an active member of the Directors Guild of America, he was a member of the Creative Rights Committee, the President&#x27;s Committee on Film Preservation, and the Film Foundation.

== Personal life and death ==
Hanson had a son named Rio, with his partner Rebecca Yeldham. In 2016, Hanson died of natural causes at his Hollywood Hills home at the age of 71. It was later reported that Hanson suffered from a rare terminal condition known as frontotemporal degeneration which he had been suffering with for &quot;some time&quot;. Hanson was unaware of his condition as lack of awareness of the presence of the disease is a symptom in and of itself.

== Influences and style ==
Hanson said that he was heavily influenced by the directors Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray. In an interview with the New York Times in 2000, Hanson stated that Ray&#x27;s film &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; was among many that he watched in preparation for the filming of &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;.

<doc id="177857" wikidata="Q927579" url="?curid=177857" title="No Rest for the Wicked (Ozzy Osbourne album)">
<text>No Rest for the Wicked is the fifth solo studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. It was released in October 1988, and was re-issued on 22 August 1995, and again on 25 June 2002. The album was certified gold in December 1988 and has since gone double platinum. It peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was the first album to feature guitarist Zakk Wylde, keyboardist John Sinclair and the first to feature bassist Bob Daisley since &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;.

==Overview==
&quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; is the recording debut of lead guitarist Zakk Wylde. After firing lead guitarist Jake E. Lee in 1987, Osbourne received a demo tape from Wylde and later hired him after an audition.

Bassist/lyricist Bob Daisley made his return to Osbourne&#x27;s band after the two had a falling out in 1985. Once the album&#x27;s recording was complete, Daisley was once again out, replaced by Osbourne&#x27;s former Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler for subsequent promotional tours.

&quot;Miracle Man&quot;, &quot;Crazy Babies&quot;, and &quot;Breaking All the Rules&quot; were released as singles with accompanying music videos. The song &quot;Hero&quot; was an unlisted hidden bonus track on the original 1988 CD and cassette releases. The song &quot;Miracle Man&quot; was a pointed barb aimed at televangelist Jimmy Swaggart. Swaggart had long been critical of Osbourne&#x27;s music and live performances, before he himself was involved in a 1988 prostitution scandal. The song &quot;Bloodbath in Paradise&quot; references Charles Manson and the Manson Family murders.

Creative Director John Carver was hired by Osbourne&#x27;s management to conceptualize and direct the album sleeve for &quot;No Rest For the Wicked&quot;. Carver&#x27;s concept was to portray Osbourne as Jesus Christ, with photographer Bob Carlos Clarke taking the cover photo.

<text>The Ultimate Sin is the fourth studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. It was released on 22 Feb. 1986, and was remastered and re-issued on CD on 22 August 1995. It is the second and last of Osbourne&#x27;s albums to feature lead guitarist Jake E. Lee, the first to feature drummer Randy Castillo, and the only album to feature bassist Phil Soussan, who co-wrote the album&#x27;s hit single &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot;.

The album was awarded Platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded Double Platinum status in October 1994 by the RIAA.

==Overview==
Upon returning from the Betty Ford Center in 1985 where he had undergone treatment for substance abuse, Osbourne was presented with a substantial quantity of music written by guitarist Jake E. Lee. After having been cheated out of his writing and publishing claims for Osbourne&#x27;s previous album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;, Lee says this time he refused to contribute anything until he had a contract in front of him guaranteeing his writing credit and publishing rights. Much of this music would form the basis of the album. The album&#x27;s lyrics were largely written by long-time Osbourne bassist and lyricist Bob Daisley. 

Daisley left the band prior to recording after having a disagreement with Osbourne, prompting the hiring of Greg Chaisson as his replacement. Chaisson claims to have written many of the bass parts on the album, but he was quickly fired after Osbourne decided his image did not fit the band; Chaisson would reunite with Lee a few years later in Badlands. Phil Soussan was ultimately hired just before recording commenced. Neither Daisley nor Chaisson were credited for their songwriting contributions on the initial 1986 pressing of the album, though Daisley did receive credit on subsequent pressings.

Future Y&amp;T, Suicidal Tendencies and Megadeth drummer Jimmy DeGrasso worked with Lee and Daisley on demos for the album, but this version of the band fell apart due to Osbourne&#x27;s commitment to the Black Sabbath summer 1985 reunion concert at Live Aid; Castillo and Soussan ultimately replaced DeGrasso and Daisley once recording commenced.

The working title for the album was &quot;Killer of Giants&quot; after the album&#x27;s song of the same name. Osbourne opted to change the title to &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; at the last minute. On 1 April 1986, a live performance promoting the album in Kansas City, Missouri, was filmed and released later that year as the home video &quot;The Ultimate Ozzy&quot;. In 1987, after the various tours in support of the album had concluded, guitarist Lee was unexpectedly fired by Osbourne&#x27;s wife and manager Sharon. The specific justification for Lee&#x27;s dismissal remains unknown. Bassist Soussan also departed, with Bob Daisley once again entering the fold.

==Reception==
At the time of its release, &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; was Osbourne&#x27;s highest-charting studio album, as heavy metal was enjoying a surge in popularity during the mid-1980s. The RIAA awarded the album Platinum status on 14 May 1986, soon after its release; it was awarded Double Platinum status on 26 October 1994. The album sold over 2,000,000 copies worldwide. In the UK, it was the final of four Osbourne albums to attain Silver certification (60,000 units shipped) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in April 1986.

Despite its commercial success, Osbourne cites &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; as his least favorite solo album, saying &quot;If there was ever an album I&#x27;d like to remix and do better, it would be &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot;.&quot; Much of the vocalist&#x27;s blame has been placed on the shoulders of producer Ron Nevison, saying &quot;(He) didn&#x27;t really do a great production job. The songs weren&#x27;t bad, they were just put down weird. Everything felt and sounded the fucking same. There was no imagination.&quot;

==Availability==

Despite being one of Osbourne&#x27;s most successful solo albums, &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; was the only album among Osbourne&#x27;s back catalog to not be reissued or remastered in 2002. Though no official reason was given, rumors circulated that an ongoing legal struggle with bassist/songwriter Phil Soussan over his song &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; was responsible for the album&#x27;s failure to be re-issued. The only available CD version of &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; remains the 1995 remastered version, which is missing four measures of music between the first chorus and second verse of &quot;Shot in the Dark&quot; found on the original CDs, vinyl copies, and cassettes.

==Track listing==
Note

<doc id="177860" wikidata="Q559584" url="?curid=177860" title="Man of La Mancha">
<text>Man of La Mancha is a 1965 musical with a book by Dale Wasserman, music by Mitch Leigh, and lyrics by Joe Darion. It is adapted from Wasserman&#x27;s non-musical 1959 teleplay &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot;, which was in turn inspired by Miguel de Cervantes and his 17th-century novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. It tells the story of the &quot;mad&quot; knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition. The work is not and does not pretend to be a faithful rendition of either Cervantes&#x27; life or &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. Wasserman complained repeatedly about people taking the work as a musical version of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;.

The original 1965 Broadway production ran for 2,328 performances and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The musical has been revived four times on Broadway, becoming one of the most enduring works of musical theatre.

&quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, the principal song in the show, became a standard. The musical has played in many other countries around the world, with productions in Dutch, French (translation by Jacques Brel), German, Hebrew, Irish, Estonian, Japanese, Korean, Bengali, Gujarati, Uzbek, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili, Finnish, Chinese, Ukrainian, Turkish, and nine distinct dialects of the Spanish language.

&quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut, in 1965, and had its New York premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in 1965.

==History==
&quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; started as a non-musical teleplay written by Dale Wasserman for CBS&#x27;s &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot; program. This original telecast starred Lee J. Cobb, Colleen Dewhurst (who replaced Viveca Lindfors), and Eli Wallach and was performed on a television sound stage. The DuPont Corporation disliked the title &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, thinking that its viewing audience would not know what La Mancha actually meant, so a new title, &quot;I, Don Quixote&quot;, was chosen. The play was broadcast live on November 9, 1959, with an estimated audience of 20 million. The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, Billy Rose Collection, has a rare tape of this broadcast.

Years after this television broadcast and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non-musical Broadway play, director Albert Marre called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical. Mitch Leigh was selected as composer, with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall. Unusually for the time, this show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass, instead making heavier use of brass, woodwinds, percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort.

The original lyricist of the musical was poet W. H. Auden, but his lyrics were discarded, some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting, attacking the bourgeois audience at times. Auden&#x27;s lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion.

==Productions==
The musical first played at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut in 1965. Rex Harrison was to be the original star of this production, but although Harrison had starred in a musical role in the stage and film versions of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, the musical demands of the role of Don Quixote were too heavy for him. Richard Kiley instead became Don Quixote. 

After 22 previews, the musical opened off-Broadway at the experimental thrust-stage ANTA Washington Square Theatre in Greenwich Village on November 22, 1965. The show moved to Broadway to the Martin Beck Theatre on March 20, 1968, then to the Eden Theatre on March 3, 1971, and finally to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on May 26, 1971, for its last month, a total original Broadway run of 2,328 performances. Musical staging and direction were by Albert Marre, choreography was by Jack Cole, and Howard Bay was the scenic and lighting designer, with costumes by Bay and Patton Campbell.

Richard Kiley won a Tony Award for his performance as Cervantes/Quixote in the original production, and it made Kiley a &quot;bona fides&quot; Broadway star. Kiley was replaced in the original Broadway run by first Jose Ferrer on Broadway and in the 1966 National Tour, and then by operatic baritone David Atkinson. Atkinson also performed Cervantes/Quixote in the 1968 National Tour and for all of the matinee performances in the 1972 Broadway revival, which also starred Kiley.

The original cast also included Irving Jacobson (Sancho), Ray Middleton (Innkeeper), Robert Rounseville (The Padre), and Joan Diener (Aldonza). John Cullum, Hal Holbrook, and Lloyd Bridges also played Cervantes and Don Quixote during the run of the production. Keith Andes also played the role.

The musical was performed on a single set that suggested a dungeon. All changes in location were created by alterations in the lighting, by the use of props supposedly lying around the floor of the dungeon, and by reliance on the audience&#x27;s imagination. More recent productions, however, have added more scenery.

The original West End London production was at the Piccadilly Theatre, opening on April 24, 1968, and running for 253 performances. Keith Michell starred, with Joan Diener reprising her original role and Bernard Spear as Sancho.

The play has been revived on Broadway four times:
* 1972 – with 3 of the original actors from
the original 1965 cast: Richard Kiley as Cervantes/Quixote, Irving Jacobson as Sancho Panza and Joan Diener as Aldonza/Dulcinea, running for 140 performances
* 1977 – with Richard Kiley as Cervantes/Quixote, Tony Martinez as Sancho Panza and Emily Yancy as Aldonza/Dulcinea, running for 124 performances
* 1992 – with Raul Julia as Cervantes/Quixote and Sheena Easton as Aldonza/Dulcinea, running for 108 performances. Easton was replaced late in the run by the original Dulcinea, Joan Diener.
* 2002 – with Brian Stokes Mitchell as Cervantes/Quixote, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Aldonza/Dulcinea, and Ernie Sabella as Sancho Panza, running for 304 performances; Marin Mazzie took over as Aldonza (Dulcinea) on July 1, 2003. This production featured Scenic and Costume Design by Paul Brown, Lighting Design by Paul Gallo, Sound design by Tony Meola and Projection design by Elaine J. McCarthy.

In the film &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; (1972), the title role went to Peter O&#x27;Toole (singing voice dubbed by Simon Gilbert), James Coco was Sancho, and Sophia Loren was Aldonza.

Hal Linden played Quixote in the show&#x27;s 1988 U.S. National tour, and Robert Goulet played Quixote in the 1997–98 U.S. National tour.

A studio-made recording of the score was released in 1996, conducted by Paul Gemignani and starring Plácido Domingo as Quixote, Mandy Patinkin as Sancho, Julia Migenes as Aldonza, Jerry Hadley as the Priest and Samuel Ramey as the Innkeeper.

In 2014, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; featured as part of the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada.

In 2015, the Shakespeare Theatre Company produced &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; at the Sidney Harman Hall. The production starred Anthony Warlow as Quixote and Amber Iman as Aldonza/Dulcinea.

In 2019, the play received a West End revival with a production at the London Coliseum. Kelsey Grammer starred as Cervantes/Quixote, Danielle de Niese and Cassidy Janson as Aldonza/Dulcinea, Peter Polycarpou as Sancho, and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the Governor/Innkeeper.

==Synopsis==
In the late sixteenth century, failed author-soldier-actor and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes has been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition, along with his manservant. They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as &quot;the Governor&quot; suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as &quot;the Duke,&quot; charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The &quot;Governor&quot; agrees.

Cervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a knight-errant. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his &quot;squire&quot;, Sancho Panza. (&quot;Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)&quot;)

Don Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote&#x27;s mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quixote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.

Cervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn&#x27;s serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically (&quot;It&#x27;s All The Same&quot;), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.

Don Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty (&quot;Dulcinea&quot;). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote&#x27;s kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote&#x27;s tender ballad into a mocking serenade.

Meanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote&#x27;s niece, has gone with Quixote&#x27;s housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote&#x27;s madness may bring them than with his actual welfare (&quot;I&#x27;m Only Thinking of Him&quot;).

Cervantes chooses &quot;the Duke&quot; to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia&#x27;s fiancé, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home (&quot;I&#x27;m Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]&quot;).

Back at the inn, Sancho delivers a from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than &quot;I Really Like Him&quot;. Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote&#x27;s behavior and her inability to laugh at him (&quot;What Do You Want of Me?&quot;). In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song (&quot;Little Bird, Little Bird&quot;). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.

The priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun&#x27;s heat (&quot;The Barber&#x27;s Song&quot;). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the &quot;Golden Helmet of Mambrino&quot;, which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote&#x27;s view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile (&quot;To Each His Dulcinea&quot;).

Quixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn&#x27;s courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on (&quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight (&quot;The Combat&quot;). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination – and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho – he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so (&quot;Knight of the Woeful Countenance&quot;).

Quixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one&#x27;s enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off (&quot;The Abduction&quot;). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood (&quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; – first reprise).

At this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried. The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.

The Don Quixote play resumes (&quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; – first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies (&quot;Moorish Dance&quot;) who take advantage of Quixote&#x27;s naiveté and steal everything they own, including Quixote&#x27;s horse Rocinante and Sancho&#x27;s donkey Dapple. Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea (&quot;Aldonza&quot;).

Suddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote&#x27;s mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the &quot;Knight of the Mirrors&quot;. He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote (&quot;Knight of the Mirrors&quot;), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet – he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.

Cervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.

Quixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up (&quot;A Little Gossip&quot;), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of &quot;Dulcinea&quot; and tries to help him remember the words of &quot;The Impossible Dream.&quot; Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again (&quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; – second reprise). But it is too late – in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings &quot;The Psalm&quot; (Psalm 130 in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend&#x27;s death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, &quot;My name is Dulcinea.&quot;

The Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot; in chorus.

<text>The House of Sabah ( &quot;Āl Ṣabāḥ&quot;) is the ruling family of Kuwait.

==History==
===Origin===
The Al Sabah family originate from the Bani Utbah confederation. Prior to settling in Kuwait, the Al Sabah family were expelled from Umm Qasr in southern Iraq by the Ottomans due to their predatory habits of preying on caravans in Basra and trading ships in Shatt al-Arab. According to one oral tradition, the Al Sabah family settled across various regions in southern Iran and Iraq, until they finally settled in what is now Kuwait around the mid-1700s. According to another oral tradition, told to the Political Agent by Shaikh Abdulla, the Sabahs fled drought in central Arabia in the early 1700s. They migrated south, but finding conditions bleaker still, returned and now with other families migrated to Zubara, on Qatar&#x27;s west coast. Conditions there were no better so they migrated again, this time north to Kuwait where, finding water, they settled. On the last leg of the journey they had &quot;atabu-ila al-shimal&quot; (moved to the north). And that, according to one tradition, was the origin of the name Bani Utub. Soon after founding a settlement in Kuwait, a Sabah became leader, ruling until his death in 1762.

===Mubarak the Great===
The reign of Mubarak the Great (1896-1915) forged the critical alliance between Kuwait and Britain. In the late 19th century, resurgent Ottoman power coupled with rising Al-Saud power drew Kuwait closer to the Ottomans. This began to change as the century closed. When Sheikh Mohammed came to power in 1892, disagreements soon arose between him and his brother Mubarak. Muhammad dealt with this by busying Mubarak with affairs outside the capital. In 1896 he summoned his sons, Jabir and Salim, and some supporters and rode to Kuwait, secretly entering Muhammed&#x27;s house. There he killed Muhammed and his brother Jarrah. In the morning, Mubarak announced that his brothers had died, and that he ruled in their stead.

===Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim===
Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah ended the British protectorate status of Kuwait by signing a treaty with the British on 19 June 1961. He introduced the Constitution of Kuwait in 1962, followed by the Parliament in 1963.

===Gulf War===
During the Gulf War, the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and his government ran the exiled government from a hotel in Ta&#x27;if, Saudi Arabia.

From Ta&#x27;if, Sheikh Jaber set up his government so that its ministers were in communication with the people still in Kuwait. The government was able to direct an underground armed resistance made up of both military and civilian forces and was able to provide public services to the Kuwaiti people who remained, such as emergency care through the funds that it had saved from oil revenues. In the meantime, Sheikh Jaber and his government lobbied to receive military support action against Iraq before and during the Gulf War. When the war ended on 28 February 1991, Sheikh Jaber remained in Saudi Arabia while declaring three months of martial law.

By imposing martial law, government officials were able to ensure that there were no Iraqis still in Kuwait who may have attempted to once again overthrow the government. They were also tasked with making sure that the country was safe enough for Sheikh Jaber and his government to return, which they eventually did on 15 March 1991.

== Public feuds ==
Kuwaiti political scientist Mohammed Alwuhaib has argued that &quot;members of the Al Sabah [have] interfered in and manipulated political and economic factions as a tool to weaken each other, with allegations of corruption a particularly common tactic.&quot;

In August 2011, supporters of Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah &quot;discovered&quot; documents that incriminated up to one-third of Kuwaiti politicians in what quickly became the largest political corruption scandal in Kuwaiti history. By October 2011, 16 Kuwaiti politicians were alleged to have received payments of $350m in return for their support of government policy.

In December 2013, allies of Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad claimed to possess tapes purportedly showing that Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah and Jassem Al-Kharafi were discussing plans to topple the Kuwaiti government. Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad appeared on local channel Al-Watan TV describing his claims.

In April 2014 the Kuwaiti government imposed a total media blackout to ban any reporting or discussion on the issue. In March 2015, Kuwait&#x27;s public prosecutor dropped all investigations into the alleged coup plot and Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad read a public apology on Kuwait state television renouncing the coup allegations. Since then, &quot;numerous associates of his have been targeted and detained by the Kuwaiti authorities on various charges,&quot; most notably members of the so-called &quot;Fintas Group&quot; that had allegedly been the original circulators of the fake coup video.

In December 2015, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad was convicted of &quot;disrespect to the public prosecutor and attributing a remark to the country&#x27;s ruler without a special permission from the emir&#x27;s court,&quot; issuing a suspended six-month prison sentence and a fine of 1,000 Kuwaiti Dinar. In January 2016, the Kuwaiti appeals court overturned the prior ruling and cleared Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad of all charges.

In November 2018, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad, along with four other defendants, were charged in Switzerland with forgery related to the fake coup video. Shortly thereafter, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad temporarily stepped aside from his role at the International Olympic Committee, pending an ethics committee hearing into the allegations. In August 2021, Sheikh Ahmed attended court alongside three of the other four defendants. In September 2021, Sheikh Ahmed was convicted of forgery along with the four other defendants. He denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal.

In November 2019, former deputy prime minister and minister of interior Sheikh Khaled Al Jarrah Al Sabah was dismissed from office after minister of defense Sheikh Nasser Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah filed a complaint with the Kuwaiti Attorney General alleging embezzlement of 240 million Kuwaiti dinars ($794.5 million) of Kuwait government funds had taken place during Khaled&#x27;s tenure as minister of defense. In July 2020, the US Department of Justice filed an asset forfeiture claim against The Mountain Beverly Hills and other real property in the United States, alleging a group of three Kuwaiti officials, including Sheikh Khaled Al Jarrah, set up unauthorized accounts in the name of the country&#x27;s Military Attache Office in London, known as the &#x27;Army Fund.&#x27; They allegedly funded the accounts with over $100m of Kuwaiti public money and used it for their own purposes. In March 2021, the Kuwaiti ministerial court ordered the detention of Khaled Al Jarrah, who was arrested and imprisoned.

On 13 April 2021, a Kuwaiti court ordered the detention of former prime minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah on corruption charges related to the &#x27;Army Fund.&#x27; He is the first former Kuwaiti prime minister to face pre-trial detention over graft charges. The crimes allegedly took place during Jaber Al-Sabah&#x27;s 2001–11 term as defense minister.

<doc id="177866" wikidata="Q845206" url="?curid=177866" title="No More Tears">
<text>No More Tears is the sixth studio album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne. Released on 17 September 1991, the album charted at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart and number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. &quot;No More Tears&quot; spawned four singles which reached the top ten of the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, including the number two &quot;Mama, I&#x27;m Coming Home&quot;, and the Grammy-winning track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Change the World&quot;. Along with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; it is one of Osbourne&#x27;s two best-selling solo albums in North America, having been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA and double platinum by CRIA. It was Osbourne&#x27;s final album to feature drummer Randy Castillo and longtime bassist and songwriter Bob Daisley.

== Background ==
Guitarist Zakk Wylde contributed songwriting to the album, while Motörhead bassist/vocalist Lemmy Kilmister wrote the lyrics for six songs; however, only four were used on the album. Although Mike Inez appeared in the album&#x27;s videos and promotional tours, long-time Osbourne collaborator Bob Daisley plays bass on the entire album. Inez is credited as a writer for the title track; although he does not perform on the actual recording, the intro bass riff was composed by him.

The 2002 reissue of &quot;No More Tears&quot; featured two additional tracks entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; and &quot;Party with the Animals&quot;. Both tracks had originally been released in 1991 as B-sides. The version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; on the 2002 reissue contains a different set of lyrics than the original b-side. The original b-side version can be found on the single and the original Japanese pressing of the CD.

According to professional wrestler and Fozzy lead vocalist Chris Jericho, when asked about the title of the song &quot;A.V.H.&quot;, Osbourne told him it stands for &quot;Aston Villa Highway&quot;, a homage to the football team he and his Black Sabbath bandmates followed as young men growing up in Birmingham.

==Reception==

&quot;No More Tears&quot; received positive reviews from critics, and is considered to be one of Osbourne&#x27;s best albums. &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked the album #22 on their list of &quot;Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included &quot;No More Tears&quot; on their list &quot;Top 100 &#x27;90s Rock Albums&quot;. They also considered it to be Osbourne&#x27;s third best album, only behind his first two albums. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; also considered it to be Osbourne&#x27;s third best album.

<text>Essex County is a primarily rural county in Southwestern Ontario, Canada comprising seven municipalities: Amherstburg, Kingsville, Lakeshore, LaSalle, Leamington, Tecumseh and the administrative seat, Essex.

==Administrative divisions==
Essex County is composed of seven municipalities (in order of population):

* Municipality of Lakeshore
* Town of LaSalle
* Municipality of Leamington
* Town of Tecumseh
* Town of Amherstburg
* Town of Kingsville
* Town of Essex

The City of Windsor and the Township of Pelee are within the Essex census division but are not part of Essex County. The census division had a population of 422,860 as of 2021.

==Geography==
Essex County is largely composed of clay-based soils, with sandy soils along the beaches and shores. For the most part, Essex County is flat farmland, with some woodlots. There is a small 30–50 foot (10–15 m) high ridge near Kingsville and Leamington in the southern part of the county, and large marshland near Hillman Marsh Conservation Area, and Point Pelee National Park. Lake St. Clair is located north, the Detroit River to the west, and the western basin of Lake Erie to the south.

===Adjacent counties and municipalities===
* Windsor (north)
* Across Lake St. Clair lies Macomb County, Michigan, US (north)
* Chatham-Kent (east)
* Wayne County, Michigan, US (west and northwest)
* Monroe County, Michigan, US (southwest)
* Across Lake Erie lie Lucas (southwest), Ottawa (south), and Erie (southeast) counties, Ohio, US

==Climate==
Essex County hosts some of the warmest summer weather in Canada, given that it is the southernmost part of Canada. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) with four distinct seasons and a localized maritime climate from the surrounding Great Lakes.

Average winters are wet and cold with a variety of conditions including rain, snow, freezing rain, sleet and fog. Temperatures and conditions change frequently during the winter months, with short periods of both bitter cold or mild weather. Winter storms are common but usually cause minimal disruption. Essex County resides outside of the Great Lakes snowbelt and doesn&#x27;t experience intense lake-effect snow accumulation like other surrounding areas, although strong westerlies off Lake Michigan can sometimes push snow squalls into the area.

Summers are hot and humid with an abundance of sunny weather. Like the surrounding Midwestern United States, thunderstorms and severe weather are more frequent during the spring and summer months.

==History==
===Colonial settlement===
The area that has come to be known as Essex was one of the first counties to be settled by non-indigenous people in Upper Canada, later to become Ontario. The settlements were mostly established by French settlers in the mid-18th century. Around 1749, the first permanent settlements began to appear on what is now the south or Canadian side of the Detroit River, across from the French Fort Detroit. They cultivated long, narrow plots of land along the river. Despite the name, this is not a river as such but rather a strait connecting Lake Huron and the smaller Lake Saint Clair in the north to Lake Erie in the south, as part of the Great Lakes.

Lower down the river, lands were occupied by native people known as Wyandot or Huron, around the Jesuit Catholic Mission of Bois Blanc (French for White Wood), opposite the island of the same name. The Mission was eventually abandoned and re-established closer to what became Sandwich Township after the British took over the French territory following the Seven Years&#x27; War. It was closer to the safety of the British-fortified Fort Detroit. When farmers arrived, they encountered difficulty in trying to clear the extremely thick forests that covered Essex County. The farmers grew to &quot;hate&quot; the trees, and chopped them down, starved them from nourishment by cutting deep gashes in the bark, and burned them to clear the way to get to the fertile soils underneath. The fires were so intense, that the reddish glow could be seen from Fort Chicago, 300 miles (500 km) away, as millions of cords of wood burned.

Settlement continued southward along the river and was known as Petite Côte (Small Coast), which was a reference to the shorter length of river frontage compared to the Detroit/American side. Landmarks were named for settler LaSalle and the local Ojibway, which continue to be in use. The first road in Ontario was laid out to connect the settlements, which is now over 200 years old and is known as Former King&#x27;s Highway 18 (now County Road 20).

When river frontage along the Petite Côte was occupied, settlement began to extend toward Lake St. Clair, which became known as the &quot;Assumption Settlement&quot;, for the name of its Catholic church. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the French ventured east along the south shore of Lake Saint Clair and settled in the present-day areas of Belle River (Belle-Rivière), Rochester, Tecumseh, Saint-Joachim and Stoney Point (Pointe-aux-Roches). These communities still have a large francophone population.

Amherstburg and Sandwich were the first towns established in Essex County, both in 1796 after the British finally ceded and evacuated Fort Detroit along the Detroit River under the terms of the &quot;Jay Treaty&quot;. This was negotiated by John Jay, and signed in 1794 following the American Revolutionary War. It was intended to settle the US northern boundary with Canada. It upheld the original boundary lines along the Great Lakes between the US and Upper Canada by the Treaty of Paris of 1783 and the wider set of treaties known as the Peace of Paris, which ended the American Revolution (1775–1783) and overseas European and multi-continental wars. Britain ceded the territory of eastern North America to be the United States.

The British built Fort Malden near Amherstburg, opposite Bois Blanc Island, separating the British military presence from the more heavily populated area of Sandwich upstream, and positioned strategically to control the entrance of the river from Lake Erie and Lake Huron to the north. The populations of both towns were augmented by people immigrating from the southern United States after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), including from the new City of Detroit, who chose to remain British subjects, known as &quot;Loyalists&quot; or &quot;United Empire Loyalists&quot;.

After the American Revolution, and the War of 1812 (1812–1815), which also was a confrontation over the northern border, some people continued to migrate north to the area. Settlers also arrived from the east seeking land, traveling by Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River of Lower Canada. Settlers began to move eastward along the north shore of Lake Erie.

The colonial government purchased land for development from the Indigenous in the southern half of the current county, located in the four townships formerly known as Gosfield North and South, and Colchester North and South. The British Court made land available for settlement, provided that the colonist complete certain improvements within a year and that it not be used for speculation. This area became known as the &quot;New Settlement&quot; (as compared to the &quot;Old Settlement&quot; of the towns of Amherstburg and Sandwich. Settlers in this area included Hessians who fought for the British against the American rebels, (especially known in history at the Battle of Trenton in New Jersey on the morning of December 26, 1776) and Pennsylvania Dutch pacifists (ethnic German Mennonites, many from Pennsylvania).

===Formation of Essex County===
In 1791, the province of Upper Canada was formed. In 1792, Upper Canada was divided into nineteen counties, of which Essex was the eighteenth and part of the Western District. At that time, the eastern boundary of Essex County extended further east into what is now Kent County. Settlement continued: on January 1, 1800, an Act for the Better Division of the Province established the Townships of Rochester, Mersea, Gosfield, Maidstone, Sandwich and Malden.

===Settlement 1820 to 1870===

Longer roads began to appear in the county after the War of 1812, the first of which followed Indian trails. Colonel Thomas Talbot contributed to road development, and Talbot Road was named for him. Talbot Road followed a natural ridge of glacial moraine which stretched from Windsor to Point Pelee.

The establishment of good roads led to further settlement along the &#x27;Middle Road&#x27; and in the area of what is now Leamington. Settlers of this era were often emigrants from Britain and Ireland; in the 1840s the Great Famine led to significant immigration. The village of Maidstone was the centre of the Irish community, and an area known as the &quot;Scotch Colony&quot; appeared along the shore of Lake St. Clair to the north.

In 1854 the Great Western Railway connected the Detroit frontier with the east, crossing Essex County. The Canadian terminal was in Windsor, which consequently forged ahead of the other towns of the county. Other railway lines were built that connected settlements in Kingsville, Harrow, Essex and Leamington.

Essex County was also a destination of the Underground Railroad. In the 19th-century Black Americans came to Essex county by way of Pelee&#x27;s Point, Gosfield (now Kingsville), Colchester, Sandwich, and Windsor. Those who stayed in the area settled in the communities of Fort Malden, Sandwich, New Canaan, Mersea, and nearby Dawn Settlement (now Dresden), Buxton (now North Buxton and South Buxton), Chatham, and Elgin. The major settlement areas were Amherstburg and Windsor. The John Freeman Walls Historic Site in Maidstone (Lakeshore) is testament to this period. Many of the descendants of the fugitives moved back to the United States to support the Northerners (Union Army) in the American Civil War, (1861–1865), or to reconnect with family after emancipation. Many families stayed.

=== Late 19th century===
By the late 19th century Essex County had seen fur trading and logging, land clearing and farming, road building and railway development, saw mills and gristmills, railway stations and water ports. By this time the forests were being removed to make way for farmland.

Also noticeable in some farmers&#x27; fields are oil pumps, particularly near Belle River and Leamington, in the northern and eastern parts of the county, respectively. This is from oil shale within the bedrock of the Marcellus Formation.

===20th Century===
====Essex County restructuring, 1990s====

In 1992, discussions began to take place to reduce the number of individual municipalities, which at the time numbered 21 in the county. This culminated on January 1, 1999, when a Minister&#x27;s Order by the Ontario Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing was implemented, putting in place the new municipal structure for the County of Essex.

Townships:
*Anderdon - Now part of Amherstburg
*Colchester North - Now part of Essex
*Colchester South - Now part of Essex
*Gosfield North - Now part of Kingsville
*Gosfield South - Now part of Kingsville
*Maidstone - Now part of Lakeshore
*Malden - Now part of Amherstburg
*Mersea - Now part of Leamington
*Rochester - Now part of Lakeshore
*Sandwich East - Parts in Windsor and in Tecumseh
*Sandwich South - Now in Tecumseh
*Sandwich West - Parts in LaSalle and in Windsor
*Tilbury North - Now in Lakeshore
*Tilbury West - Now in Lakeshore

Towns:
*Amherstburg, Ontario (former town of, now merged with Anderdon Twp. and Malden Twp.)
*Belle River, Ontario
*Essex, Ontario (former town of, merged with Colchester N. Twp. and Colchester S. Twp.)
*Harrow, Ontario
*Kingsville, Ontario (former town of, merged with Gosfield N. Twp. and Gosfield S. Twp.)
*Lasalle, Ontario (former part of Sandwich Town)
*Leamington, Ontario (former town of, merged with Mersea Twp.)
*St. Clair Beach, Ontario
*Tecumseh, Ontario (former town of, merged with Sandwich S. Twp)

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Essex County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Government==
The County of Essex is governed by a County Council, whose members are the mayors and deputy mayors from the seven lower-tier municipalities of the county. The Head of Council is known as the Warden. The term of office for County Councillors and the Warden coincides with the frequency of municipal elections in Ontario, in other words a person elected to be Mayor of Leamington, for example, will be a member of County Council for the term that she or he is Mayor. Hilda MacDonald, Mayor of Leamington, was chosen to be Warden at the most recent election. A complete list (from 1853 to present) of the past Wardens of Essex County can be found online.

County government is responsible for issues that include transportation, community and social services (e.g. homes for the aged, child care, social housing), libraries, planning, emergency management coordination and corporate-wide business such as finance and taxation policies, general corporate policy and labour relations. The County does not have a police force or fire services, for which the seven municipalities are responsible.

==Education==

English-language public education for kindergarten through secondary school grades in Essex County is administered by the Greater Essex County District School Board, along with the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board which oversees English-language Catholic education.

French-language public and Catholic education are overseen by the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire catholique Providence respectively. The scope of all of these organizations includes both the County and the City of Windsor.

Until 1998 the Essex County Board of Education operated Anglophone secular public schools.

Public post-secondary education is available at the University of Windsor, St. Clair College, and more recently Collège Boréal.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
====Emergency medical services====
Essex-Windsor Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provides pre-hospital treatment and transportation to over 45,000 patients per year. The service operates out of 12 bases, and employs over 260 Primary Care Paramedics. Essex-Windsor EMS covers all of Essex County, Windsor, and Pelee Island.

==Economy==
===Energy===

Essex County is home to Canada&#x27;s largest wind farm as of June 2012. This is due to both its ideal wind conditions and abundance of available farmland.

===Agriculture===
Essex County has one of Canada&#x27;s longest growing seasons at 212 days per year. Leamington, a town in Essex County, has also been known for its greenhouses. It now has the largest concentration of commercial greenhouses in all of North America, with nearly 2000 acres of greenhouse vegetable production in the general area. Major products of the greenhouse industry, in addition to tomatoes, are peppers, cannabis, cucumbers, roses, and other flowers.

Major employers include Highbury Canco, Aphria, FortDearborn, Highline Mushrooms, Elring-Klinger, Nature Fresh Farms, Hub International, Lakeside Produce and AMCO Farms.

=== Tourism ===
Essex County is home to 13 VQA wineries that are a part of Ontario&#x27;s southernmost appellation. At the same latitude as the Mediterranean, the Lake Erie North Shore Region provides a unique climate in a continental region.

==Tartan==

Essex County also has an official tartan.

The tartan&#x27;s colours correspond to different meanings.

* /Yellow is meant to stand for sunshine, also for the rich agriculture and golden harvests of the many farmed plants (grains, corn, soybeans, barley, oats and wheat).
* Green stands for the spring fields around Essex County.
* Red represents tomatoes, as Leamington is the &quot;Tomato Capital of Canada&quot;, and for other fruits, such as apples.
* Blue stands for the blue skies and the waterways of the county.
* Black is meant to represent the automotive industry that fuels Windsor and Essex County.
* White represents the salt mines in Windsor and western Essex County, and fish in the surrounding rivers and lakes.

<doc id="177869" wikidata="Q2177756" url="?curid=177869" title="Diplomatic history">
<text>Diplomatic history deals with the history of international relations between states. Diplomatic history can be different from international relations in that the former can concern itself with the foreign policy of one state while the latter deals with relations between two or more states. Diplomatic history tends to be more concerned with the history of diplomacy, but international relations concern more with current events and creating a model intended to shed explanatory light on international politics.

==History==
==Historiography==

===Ranke===
In the 5th century BCE the Greek historian Thucydides was highly concerned with the relations among states. However Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), the leading German historian of the 19th century, codified the modern form of diplomatic history. Ranke wrote largely on the history of Early Modern Europe, using the diplomatic archives of the European powers (particularly the Republic of Venice) to construct a detailed understanding of the history of Europe &quot;wie es eigentlich gewesen ist&quot; (&quot;as it actually happened&quot;). Ranke saw diplomatic history as the most important kind of history to write because of his idea of the &quot;Primacy of Foreign Affairs&quot; (&quot;Primat der Aussenpolitik&quot;), arguing that the concerns of international relations drive the internal development of the state. Ranke&#x27;s understanding of diplomatic history relied on using as sources the large number of official documents produced by modern western governments; he argued that historians should examine such sources in an objective and neutral spirit.

===20th century scholars===
Ranke&#x27;s understanding of the dominance of foreign policy, and hence an emphasis on diplomatic history, remained the dominant paradigm in historical writing through the first half of the twentieth century. In the early 20th centuries, work by prominent diplomatic historians such as Charles Webster, Harold Temperley, and Bernadotte Everly Schmitt focused on great European events, especially wars and peace conferences. A notable breakthrough in diplomatic historiography occurred in 1910 when the French government start to publish all of the archives relating to the war of 1870.

Ranke&#x27;s approach, combined with the effects of the War Guilt Clause in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) that blamed Germany, stimulated a massive outpouring in many languages on the origins of the war of 1914. The Bolsheviks in Russia published key secret papers from the Allies in 1918 and other governments commissioned carefully edited, multivolume collections of key documents in their possession. Numerous historians wrote multi-volume histories of the origins of the war. In the interwar period, most diplomatic historians tended to blame all of the Great Powers of 1914 for the First World War, arguing that the war was in effect everybody&#x27;s responsibility. In general, the early works in this vein fit fairly comfortably into Ranke&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;Aussenpolitik&quot;.

Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War:
: diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies.
She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing political, intellectual and social history to displace diplomatic history.

For the first half of the 20th century, most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the &quot;Primat der Aussenpolitik&quot; approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces. The most notable exceptions to this tendency were A. J. P. Taylor and William Medlicott in Britain, Pierre Renouvin in France, and William L. Langer in the United States, who examined economic and domestic political forces.

===Causes of World War Two===
Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s multi-volume &quot;The Second World War&quot;, especially the first volume &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; (1948) set the framework and the interpretation for much later historiography. His interpretation, echoing his own position before the war, that World War II was caused by the mad ambitions of Adolf Hitler; Churchill damned the cowardly and weak-willed British and French leaders who used appeasement in a futile effort to avoid the war. Churchill did not consider the argument that the alternative to appeasement was a premature war that Germany would win in 1938. The British historian A. J. P. Taylor&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot; challenged Churchill&#x27;s viewpoint and argued that Hitler had no master-plan for conquering the world. Instead he was an ordinary statesman –-an opportunistic leader seizing whatever chances he had for expansionism. The fact that a world war started over Poland in 1939 was due to diplomatic miscalculation by all the countries concerned, instead of being a case of German aggression. British historians such as D.C. Watt, Paul Kennedy, George Peden and David Dilks argued that appeasement was not an aberration, and that it was an old British tradition which in this case flowed from numerous structural, economic and military factors. Historians such as Christopher Thorne and Harry Hinsley abandoned the previous focus on individual leaders to discuss the broader societal influences such as public opinion and narrower ones like intelligence on diplomatic relations. In recent years the debates regarding the 1930s have continued, but new approaches are in use, such as an analysis in terms of Britain&#x27;s national identity.

===French approaches===
A group of French historians centered around Pierre Renouvin (1893–1974) and his &quot;protégés&quot; Jean-Baptiste Duroselle and started a new type of international history in the 1950s that included taking into account what Renouvin called &#x27; (profound forces) such as the influence of domestic politics on French foreign policy. However, Renouvin and his followers still followed the concept of &#x27; with Renouvin arguing that French society under the Third Republic was “sorely lacking in initiative and dynamism” and Baumont arguing that French politicians had allowed &quot;personal interests&quot; to override &quot;any sense of the general interest&quot;. In 1979, Duroselle&#x27;s book &quot;La Décadence&quot; offered a total condemnation of the entire Third Republic as weak, cowardly and degenerate.

===Fischer debate on World War One===
At the same time, in 1961 when the German historian Fritz Fischer published &quot;Griff nach der Weltmacht&quot;, which established that Germany had caused the First World War led to the fierce &quot;Fischer Controversy&quot; that tore apart the West German historical profession. One result of Fischer&#x27;s book was the rise in the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; (Primacy of Domestic Politics) approach. As a result of the rise of the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; school, diplomatic historians increasing started to pay attention to domestic politics. In the 1970s, the conservative German historian Andreas Hillgruber, together with his close associate Klaus Hildebrand, was involved in a very acrimonious debate with the leftish German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler over the merits of the &quot;Primat der Aussenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of foreign politics&quot;) and &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of domestic politics&quot;) schools. Hillgruber and Hildebrand made a case for the traditional &quot;Primat der Aussenpolitik&quot; approach to diplomatic history with the stress on examining the records of the relevant foreign ministry and studies of the foreign policy decision-making elite. Wehler, who favored the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; approach, for his part contended that diplomatic history should be treated as a sub-branch of social history, calling for theoretically based research, and argued that the real focus should be on the study of the society in question. Moreover, under the influence of the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; approach, diplomatic historians in the 1960s, 70s and 80s start to borrow models from the social sciences.

===Mason–Overy debate on internal pressures inside Nazi Germany===
A notable example of the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; approach was the claim by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason who claimed that the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a “barbaric variant of social imperialism”. Mason argued that “Nazi Germany was always bent &quot;at some time&quot; upon a major war of expansion”. However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted. In Mason&#x27;s view in the period between 1936 and 1941, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler&#x27;s &quot;will&quot; or &quot;intentions&quot; that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy. Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution. According to Mason, by 1939, the “overheating” of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing. Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless “smash and grab” foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany. Mason&#x27;s theory of a &quot;Flight into war&quot; being imposed on Hitler generated much controversy, and in the 1980s he conducted a series of debates with economic historian Richard Overy over this matter. Overy maintained the decision to attack Poland was not caused by structural economic problems, but rather was the result of Hitler wanting a localized war at that particular time in history. For Overy, a major problem with the Mason thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way unrecorded by the records, that information was passed on to Hitler about the &quot;Reich&quot; economic problems. Overy argued that there was a major difference between economic pressures inducted by the problems of the Four Year Plan, and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserve of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan. Moreover, Overy asserted that the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness was somewhat downplayed by Mason.

===Japanese-American relations===
In addition, because World War II was a global war, diplomatic historians start to focus on Japanese-American relations to understand why Japan had attacked the United States in 1941. This in turn led diplomatic historians to start to abandon the previous Euro-centric approach in favor of a more global approach. A sign of the changing times was the rise to prominence of such diplomatic historians such as the Japanese historian Chihiro Hosoya, the British historian Ian Nish, and the American historian Akira Iriye, which was the first time that Asian specialists became noted diplomatic historians.

===Vietnam war and revisionism===
The Cold War and decolonization greatly added the tendency to a more global diplomatic history. The Vietnam War led to the rise of a revisionist school in the United States, which led many American historians such as Gabriel Kolko and William Appleman Williams to reject traditional diplomatic history in favor of a &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; approach that saw a widespread examination of the influence of American domestic politics together with various social, economic and cultural forces on foreign-policy making. In general, the American Cold War revisionists tended to focus on American foreign policy decision-making with respect to the genesis of the Cold War in the 1940s and on how the United States became involved in Vietnam in the 1960s. Starting in the 1960s, a ferocious debate has taken place within Cold War historiography between the advocates of the “orthodox” school which saw the Cold War as a case of Soviet aggression such as Vojtech Mastny against the proponents of the “revisionist” school which saw the Cold War as a case of American aggression. Latterly, a third school known as &quot;neo-orthodox&quot; whose most prominent member is the American historian John Lewis Gaddis has emerged, which holds through the United States borne some responsibility for the Cold War, the lion&#x27;s share of the responsibility goes to the Soviet Union.

===Recent trends===
In Europe diplomatic history fell out of favor in the late Cold War era. Since the collapse of communism in 1989–91, however, there has been a renaissance, led especially by historians of the early modern era, in the history of diplomacy. The new approach differs from previous perspectives by the wholesale incorporation of perspectives from political science, sociology, the history of mentalities, and cultural history.

In the U.S. since the 1980s, the discipline of diplomatic history has become more relevant to and better integrated with the mainstream of the academic history profession. It has taken the lead in internationalization of American historical studies. Since it explores the interaction of domestic and international forces, the field has become increasingly important for its study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies as applied to foreign affairs. There have been major influences from other new approaches such as Orientalism and globalism, as well as gender and racial history. The history of human rights has become important as well. Despite all these innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state interacting with other states, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of America&#x27;s superpower status is essential to understanding the world internationally.

In the early 1980s, historian Jeffrey Kimball surveyed the ideological preferences of 109 active diplomatic historians in the United States as well as 54 active military historians. He reports that:
:Of historians in the field of diplomatic history, 7% are Socialist, 19% are Other, 53% are Liberal, 11% are None and 10% Conservative. Of military historians, 0% are Socialist, 8% are Other, 35% are Liberal, 18% are None and 40% are Conservative.

As a field that explores the meeting of domestic and international forces, the study of US foreign relations has become increasingly important for its examination of both the study of culture and identity and the exploration of political ideologies. Particularly shaped by the influence of studies of Orientalism and globalism, gender studies, race, and considerations of national identity, diplomatic history was often at the cutting edge of historical research. Despite such innovations, however, the core endeavor of diplomatic history remains the study of the state, which is also a key to its broadening appeal, since considerations of US state power are essential to understanding the world internationally.

<doc id="177871" wikidata="Q959976" url="?curid=177871" title="John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)">
<text>John Breckinridge (December 2, 1760 – December 14, 1806) was an American politician, militia officer, planter, and lawyer. He served several terms in the state legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky before being elected to the United States Senate. Breckinridge also served as the United States Attorney General during the second term of President Thomas Jefferson. He was the progenitor of Kentucky&#x27;s Breckinridge family and the namesake of Breckinridge County, Kentucky.

Breckinridge&#x27;s father was a landowner and colonel in the Virginia militia who married into the Preston family. Breckinridge attended the William and Mary College intermittently between 1780 and 1784; his attendance was interrupted by the American Revolutionary War and he was elected thrice to the Virginia House of Delegates. One of the youngest members of the house, this allowed him to meet many prominent politicians. In 1785, Breckinridge married &quot;Polly&quot; Cabell, a member of the Cabell family. Despite a successful political career, letters from relatives in Kentucky convinced him to move to the western frontier. He established a slave plantation named &quot;Cabell&#x27;s Dale&quot; near Lexington, Kentucky in 1793.

Breckinridge continued his legal and political career and was appointed as the Attorney General of Kentucky soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned his office and was subsequently elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives. As a legislator, Breckinridge secured the passage of a more humane criminal code which abolished capital punishment for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip back to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Jefferson&#x27;s Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson&#x27;s request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson&#x27;s authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge&#x27;s death. Although Breckinridge opposed calling a constitutional convention for the new state in 1799, he was elected as a Kentucky delegate. Due to his influence, the state&#x27;s government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slaveowners and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state&#x27;s Democratic-Republican Party and fellow delegates elected him as speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.

Elected to the Senate in 1800, Breckinridge functioned as Jefferson&#x27;s floor leader, guiding administration bills through the chamber that was narrowly controlled by his party. Residents of the western frontier called for his nomination as vice president in 1804, but Jefferson appointed him as Attorney General in 1805 instead. He was the first cabinet-level official from the West but had little impact before his death from tuberculosis on December 14, 1806, at the age of 46.

==Early life and family==
John Breckinridge&#x27;s grandfather, Alexander Breckenridge (1686–1743), immigrated from Ireland to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, around 1728, while the Breckinridge family originated in Ayrshire, Scotland, before migrating to Ulster (possibly County Antrim or County Londonderry) probably in the late 17th century. In 1740, the family moved to Augusta County, Virginia, near the city of Staunton and Alexander died there in 1743.

John Breckinridge was born in Augusta County on December 2, 1760, the second of six children of Robert Breckenridge (1720–1773) and his second wife, Lettice (Preston) Breckenridge (1728–1797). His mother was the daughter of John Preston of Virginia&#x27;s Preston political family. Robert Breckenridge had two children by a previous marriage, and through one of these half-brothers John Breckinridge was uncle to future Congressman James D. Breckinridge. A veteran of the French and Indian War, Robert Breckenridge had farmed as well as served first as Augusta County&#x27;s under-sheriff, then as sheriff, then justice of the peace. Soon after John Breckinridge&#x27;s birth, the family moved southward along the Wilderness Road to Botetourt County where Robert Breckenridge farmed, as well as became a constable and justice of the peace, and served in the Virginia militia. He died in 1773, leaving 12-year-old John of land, one slave, and half-ownership of another slave.

Breckinridge received a private education suitable to his class, possibly including Augusta Academy (now Washington and Lee University), but any records containing this information have been lost. After his father&#x27;s death, the younger Breckinridge helped support the family by selling whiskey, brandy, and hemp. He learned surveying from his uncle, William Preston, and between 1774 and 1779, held a clerical job in the Botetourt County land office in Fincastle. Preston sought opportunities for his nephew to attend private schools alongside his sons, but Breckinridge&#x27;s other responsibilities interfered with his attendance. Preston also nominated Breckinridge as deputy surveyor of Montgomery County, a position he accepted after passing the requisite exam on February 1, 1780. Later that year, he joined his cousin, future Kentucky Senator John Brown, at the William and Mary College. The instructors who influenced him most were Reverend James Madison and George Wythe.

The American Revolutionary War forced the William and Mary College to close in 1781, and during various times during the conflict British, French, and American troops used them as barracks while controlling the surrounding area. Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia, Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians&#x27; military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War, and less reliable sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia. If Breckinridge served, Harrison speculates that such occurred in one or two short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene&#x27;s army in southwest Virginia.

===Early political career===
Although he had not sought the office and was not old enough to serve, Botetourt County voters twice elected Breckinridge to represent them part-time as one of the western county&#x27;s representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Though without documentary support, some claim fellow delegates twice refused Breckinridge his seat because of his age, but his constituents reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.

Prevented from meeting at Williamsburg due to fears of a British attack there, the House convened May 7, 1781, in Richmond, but failed to achieve a quorum. Due to British General Charles Cornwallis&#x27; advance on Richmond on May 10, the legislators adjourned to Charlottesville on May 24. Breckinridge arrived in Charlottesville on May 28; a quorum was present to conduct legislative business through June 3. The next morning, Jack Jouett rode into the city, warning the legislators that 250 light cavalrymen under Banastre Tarleton were approaching. Legislators quickly adjourned to Staunton and fled for their horses. Days later, they completed the session&#x27;s business there. Breckinridge stayed at his mother&#x27;s house between sessions, rejoining the legislature in Richmond in November 1781. Much of the session consisted of adopting resolutions of thanks for individuals who had made that city safe by defeating Cornwallis at Yorktown.

Financial difficulties prevented Breckinridge&#x27;s return to college. He did not seek reelection in 1782; instead, he spent a year earning money by surveying, and was reelected to the House of Delegates in 1783, joining his legislative colleagues in May. He also joined the Constitutional Society of Virginia; fellow society members included future U.S. presidents James Madison and James Monroe. The House adjourned June 28, 1783, and Breckinridge returned to the William and Mary College, studying through the end of the year, excepting the legislative session in November and December. With the war over, he urged that no economic or political penalties be imposed on former Loyalists. In contrast to his later political views, he desired a stronger central government than provided for in the Articles of Confederation; he argued that the national government could not survive unless it could tax its citizens, a power it did not have under the Articles.

Financial problems caused Breckinridge to leave the William and Mary College after the spring semester in 1784. Because of his studies earlier in the year, he had no time to campaign for reelection to the House of Delegates, so he asked his brother Joseph and his cousin John Preston to campaign on his behalf. Initially, his prospects seemed favorable, but he was beaten by future Virginia Congressman George Hancock. After the defeat, voters from Montgomery County – where Breckinridge had previously been a surveyor – chose him to represent them in the House. As a Virginia legislator, Breckinridge served on the prestigious committees on Propositions and Grievances, Courts of Justice, Religion, and Investigation of the Land Offices. His fellow committee members included Henry Tazewell, Carter Henry Harrison, Edward Carrington, Spencer Roane, John Marshall, Richard Bland Lee, and Wilson Cary Nicholas. Inspired by his legislative service, he spent the summer between legislative sessions studying to become a lawyer. The legislative session focused on domestic issues like whether Virginia should establish a tax to benefit religion in the state. Breckinridge was not associated with any denomination, and his writings indicate that he was opposed to such a tax. Instead, he and James Madison secured approval of a religious liberty bill first proposed by Thomas Jefferson over five years earlier. The legislature rose on January 7, 1785, and Breckinridge was admitted to the bar later that year, beginning practice in Charlottesville.

===Marriage and children===
On June 28, 1785, Breckinridge married Mary Hopkins (&quot;Polly&quot;) Cabell (1769–1858), daughter of Joseph Cabell (1732–1798), a member of the Cabell political family. Polly&#x27;s dowry included a 400-acre (1.6-km2) plantation in Albemarle County dubbed &quot;The Glebe&quot;. Nine children were born to the John and Polly Breckinridge – Letitia Preston (1786–1831), Joseph &quot;Cabell&quot; (1788–1823), Mary Hopkins (1790–1793), Robert (1793–1793), Mary Ann (1795–1817), John (1797–1841), Robert Jefferson (1800–1871), William Lewis (1803–1876), and James Monroe (1806–1820).

Polly, Cabell, and Letitia all fell ill but survived a smallpox epidemic in 1793; however, Mary Hopkins and their first son named Robert died. Cabell Breckinridge would later follow a similar career as a planter, lawyer and politician, and become Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives and later Kentucky&#x27;s Secretary of State. Other sons became ministers and planters; the family&#x27;s loyalties would be split during the American Civil War long after this man&#x27;s death. Cabell Beckinridge&#x27;s son John C. Breckinridge continued the family legal, planter and political traditions and become U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge, and a presidential candidate, only to side with the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Meanwhile his brother John Breckinridge also attended the same university, receiving a degree from Princeton Theological Seminary, before serving as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives, and president of Oglethorpe College (now Oglethorpe University) in Georgia. Robert Jefferson Breckinridge became superintendent of public instruction under Governor William Owsley and became known as the father of Kentucky&#x27;s public education system. William Lewis Breckinridge became a prominent Presbyterian minister, serving as moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1859 and later as president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and Oakland College in Yale, Mississippi. In 1804, this Breckinridge&#x27;s daughter Letitia married Alfred W. Grayson, son of Virginia Senator William Grayson. Alfred Grayson died in 1808, and in 1816, the widowed Letitia married Peter Buell Porter, who would later serve as Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams.

Meanwhile, farming at the Glebe proved barely enough for Breckinridge&#x27;s growing family. Breckinridge&#x27;s legal career provided enough money for some comforts but required long hours and difficult work. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to him and asked him to represent his own clients in his absence. Though still interested in politics, Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people&#x27;s support. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia&#x27;s ratification convention.

==Relocation to Kentucky==
Breckinridge&#x27;s half-brothers, Andrew and Robert, moved to Kentucky in 1781, and his brother William followed in 1783. By 1785, Andrew and Robert were trustees of Louisville. Their letters described Kentucky&#x27;s abundant land and plentiful legal business, in contrast to the crowded bar and scarce unclaimed land in Virginia. By 1788, Breckinridge was convinced that Kentucky offered him more opportunity, and the next year, he traveled west to seek land on which to construct an estate. Although inaccurate reports of his death reached Virginia, he arrived safely in Kentucky on April 15, 1789, and returned to Virginia in June. The following year, he paid 360 pounds sterling for along the North Elkhorn Creek about from present-day Lexington, Kentucky. The land, purchased from his only sister Betsy&#x27;s father-in-law, lay adjacent to land owned by his sister, and in 1792, he purchased an adjacent , bringing his total holdings in Kentucky to . After the purchase, he instructed William Russell, a friend already living in Kentucky, to find tenants to lease and improve the land.

In February 1792, Breckinridge, a Democratic-Republican, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives over token opposition. On the date of the election, he wrote to Archibald Stuart, &quot;The People appearing willing to elect, I could have no objection to serve them one Winter in Congress.&quot; Despite this, he left for Kentucky in March 1793 and resigned without serving a day in Congress, which convened on March 4. He chose the longer but safer route to Kentucky, joining a group of flatboats at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, for the trip down the Monongahela and Ohio rivers to Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky). His family, along with 25 slaves, arrived in April and established a slave plantation which they named &quot;Cabell&#x27;s Dale&quot;. By the time of Breckinridge&#x27;s move, he owned in Kentucky.

==Domestic life in Kentucky==

When he arrived in Kentucky, much of Breckinridge&#x27;s land was occupied by tenant farmers whose leases had not yet expired. He planted rye and wheat on of unleased land and sent 11 slaves and an overseer to clear land for the fall planting. Eventually, his crops at Cabell&#x27;s Dale included corn, wheat, rye, barley, hay, grass seed, and hemp, but he refused to grow tobacco, a major cash crop, which he found too vulnerable to over-cultivation. He also bred thoroughbred horses, planted an orchard, and practiced law. He engaged in land speculation, particularly in the Northwest Territory, and at various times owned interests in iron and salt works, but these ventures were never very successful.

As his plantation became more productive, Breckinridge became interested in ways to sell his excess goods. On August 26, 1793, he became a charter member of the Democratic Society of Kentucky, which lobbied the federal government to secure unrestricted use of the Mississippi River from Spain. Breckinridge was elected chairman, Robert Todd and John Bradford were chosen as vice-chairmen, and Thomas Todd and Thomas Bodley were elected as clerks. Breckinridge authored a tract entitled &quot;Remonstrance of the Citizens West of the Mountains to the President and Congress of the United States&quot; and may have also written &quot;To the Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany (sic) and Apalachian (sic) Mountains&quot;. He pledged funding to French minister Edmond-Charles Genêt&#x27;s proposed military operation against Spain, but Genêt was recalled before it could be executed. Although alarmed that frontier settlers might initiate war with Spain, President George Washington made no immediate attempt to obtain use of the Mississippi, which the society maintained was &quot;the natural right of the citizens of this Commonwealth&quot;. The resistance of the eastern states, particularly Federalist politicians, caused Breckinridge to reconsider his support of a strong central government.

Breckinridge was also concerned with easing overland transport of goods to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee to raise funds for a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road&#x27;s upkeep.

Breckinridge was also interested in education. Before moving to Kentucky, he accumulated a substantial library of histories, biographies, law and government texts, and classical literature. Frequently, he allowed aspiring lawyers and students access to the library, which was one of the most extensive in the west. He also provided funding for a municipal library in Lexington. His lobbying for a college to be established in Lexington bore fruit with the opening of Transylvania Seminary (now Transylvania University) in 1788. He was elected to the seminary&#x27;s board of trustees on October 9, 1793, and supported hiring Harry Toulmin as president in February 1794 and consolidating the seminary with Kentucky Academy in 1796. Conservatives on the board and in the Kentucky General Assembly forced Toulmin – a liberal Unitarian – to resign in 1796, and Breckinridge&#x27;s enthusiasm for his trusteeship waned. He attended board meetings less frequently and resigned in late 1797.

==Kentucky Attorney General==

Kentucky needed qualified governmental leaders, and on December 19, 1793, Governor Isaac Shelby appointed Breckinridge attorney general. Three weeks after accepting, he was offered the post of District Attorney for the Federal District of Kentucky, but he declined. Secretary of State Edmund Randolph directed Shelby to prevent French agents in Kentucky from organizing an expedition against Spanish Louisiana. On Breckinridge&#x27;s advice, Shelby responded that he lacked the authority to interfere. Lack of funding prevented the expedition, but Shelby&#x27;s noncommittal response helped prompt passage of the Neutrality Act of 1794 which outlawed participation by U.S. citizens in such expeditions.
In November 1794, the Democratic-Republicans nominated Breckinridge to succeed John Edwards in the U.S. Senate. Federalists were generally unpopular in Kentucky, but the signing of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty – which temporarily secured Kentucky&#x27;s use of the Mississippi River – and Anthony Wayne&#x27;s expedition against the Indians in the Northwest Territory prompted a surge of support for the federal government in Kentucky. The election&#x27;s first ballot reflected this, as Federalist candidate Humphrey Marshall received 18 votes to Breckinridge&#x27;s 16, John Fowler&#x27;s 8, and 7 votes for the incumbent Edwards. On the runoff ballot, Marshall was elected over Breckinridge by a vote of 28–22. Harrison posits that Marshall&#x27;s incumbency in the General Assembly may have aided his election but notes that Marshall downplayed its significance.

In May 1796, Kentucky&#x27;s gubernatorial electors convened to choose Shelby&#x27;s successor. Their votes were split among four candidates; frontiersman Benjamin Logan received 21 votes, Baptist minister James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and Breckinridge&#x27;s cousin, Senator John Brown, received 1. The Kentucky Constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required for election, but the electors held a runoff vote. Most of Todd&#x27;s supporters voted for Garrard, and he won the election. Breckinridge claimed he had no authority to intervene but declared that, as a private citizen, he believed Logan should be governor. The state senate was authorized to settle disputed elections, but they, too, refused to intervene. Breckinridge resigned as attorney general on November 30, 1797; the extension of the attorney general&#x27;s duties to include representing the state in federal district court as well as the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and reluctance to serve under Garrard after publicly declaring he had no right to his office may have contributed to the decision. A month later, he declared his candidacy to fill a vacancy in the Fayette County delegation to the Kentucky House of Representatives. Of the 1,323 votes cast, he garnered 594 (45%), the most of any of the six candidates in the race.

==Kentucky House of Representatives==
Breckinridge pressed to reform the state&#x27;s criminal code, which was based on the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s failed attempt to reform Virginia&#x27;s code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment&#x27;s severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.

===Kentucky Resolutions===
In August, Breckinridge traveled to Virginia&#x27;s Sweet Springs to improve his health. He visited family and friends while there, but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known. At some point, he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently-enacted Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret, and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life. In 1814, John Taylor revealed Jefferson&#x27;s authorship; Breckinridge&#x27;s grandson, John C. Breckinridge, wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor&#x27;s claims. Cautioning that the passage of time and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details, Jefferson responded that he, Breckinridge, Wilson Nicholas, and possibly James Madison met at Monticello, at a date Jefferson could not recall, to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts. They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state.
Letters between Nicholas and Jefferson indicate a different series of events. In a letter dated October 4, 1798, Nicholas informed Jefferson that he had given &quot;a copy of the resolutions you sent me&quot; to Breckinridge, who would introduce them in Kentucky. The letter also indicated that this was a deviation from the original plan to deliver the draft to a legislator in North Carolina for introduction in the legislature there. Nicholas felt that recipient was too closely associated with Jefferson, risking his being discovered as the resolutions&#x27; author. According to Nicholas, Breckinridge wanted to discuss the draft with Jefferson, but Nicholas advised against the meeting, fearing it could implicate Jefferson. A subsequent letter from Jefferson expressed his approval of Nicholas&#x27; actions. Lowell Harrison notes that after Breckinridge left Virginia, his contacts with Jefferson were few until his election to the Senate in 1801. Harrison considered it unlikely that Jefferson was mistaken about a meeting between the two to discuss a matter as important as the resolutions, positing that Jefferson may have met separately with Breckinridge and Nicholas to discuss the resolutions, and that the meeting with Breckinridge was kept secret from Nicholas. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Breckinridge&#x27;s activities in Virginia in 1798, the extent of his influence on Jefferson&#x27;s original draft of the resolutions is unknown.

In Garrard&#x27;s November 5, 1798, State of the Commonwealth address, he encouraged the General Assembly to declare its views on the Alien and Sedition Acts. Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three-person committee to carry out the governor&#x27;s charge. The resolutions that the committee brought to the floor on November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions. The first seven were exactly as Jefferson had written them, but Breckinridge modified the last two, eliminating Jefferson&#x27;s suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts. During the debate on the House floor, Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them. Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate. Upon concurrence of both houses, Garrard signed the resolutions.

Federalist state legislatures, primarily those north of the Potomac River, sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions. Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt a second set of resolutions affirming the first, lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence. Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions, maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set. Breckinridge, chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives at the outset of the 1799 session, took on the task, drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification. The resolutions unanimously passed the House. The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them, especially the endorsement of nullification, but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written. Breckinridge&#x27;s presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky.

===Kentucky Constitution of 1799===

Some Kentucky citizens were already displeased with parts of the state&#x27;s constitution, and the disputed gubernatorial election of 1796 had added to the enthusiasm of those calling for a constitutional convention to revise it. Breckinridge opposed such a call, fearing changes would imperil his wealth and power. John Breckinridge asked, &quot;Where is the difference whether I am robbed of my horse by a highway-man, or of my slave by a set of people called a Convention?... If they can by one experiment emancipate our slaves; the same principle pursued, will enable them at a second experiment to extinguish our land titles; both are held by rights equally sound.&quot; The desire for a convention was so strong, even in aristocratic Fayette County, that Breckinridge&#x27;s position nearly cost him his seat in the legislature. Seeking election to a full term in May 1798, he was the seventh-highest vote-getter, securing the last of Fayette County&#x27;s seats in the legislature by only eight votes. Despite the efforts of conservatives like Breckinridge and George Nicholas, in late 1798, the General Assembly called a convention for July 22, 1799. Delegates to the convention were to be elected in May 1799, and the conservatives immediately began organizing slates of candidates that would represent their interests. Popular because of his role in securing adoption of the Kentucky Resolutions, Breckinridge was among the six conservative candidates promoted in Fayette County, all of whom were elected. Out of the fifty-eight men who arrived in Frankfort in late July as convention delegates, 57 were slaveowners and 50 held substantial property. Between the election and the convention, Breckinridge and Judge Caleb Wallace worked with Nicholas (who did not seek election as a delegate) to draft resolutions that Breckinridge would introduce at the convention in an attempt to steer the proceedings toward conservative positions.

The largest group of delegates at the convention – about 18 in number – were aristocrats who advocated protection of their wealth and status, including instituting voice voting in the legislature (which left legislators vulnerable to intimidation), safeguarding slavery, and limiting the power of the electorate. A smaller group led by Green Clay and Robert Johnson consisted mostly of planters who opposed most limits on the power of the legislature, which they believed was superior to the executive and judicial branches. A third group, led by future governor John Adair, agreed with the notion of legislative supremacy, but opposed limits on other branches of the government. The smallest group was the most populist and was led by John Bailey. The conservative faction strengthened the previous constitution&#x27;s slavery protections by denying suffrage to free blacks and mulattoes. Legislative apportionment based on population, the addition of a lieutenant governor, and voice voting of the legislature – all issues advocated by Breckinridge – were also adopted. He was unable to preserve the electoral college that elected the governor and state senators, but the direct election of these officers was balanced by a provision that county sheriffs and judges be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. Attempts to make judicial decisions subject to legislative approval were defeated after Breckinridge defended the extant judicial system. He was also the architect of the constitution&#x27;s provisions for amendment, which made changing the document difficult, but not entirely impossible. Because of his leading role in the convention, Breckinridge was regarded as the father of the resultant constitution, which was ratified in 1799, and emerged from the convention as the leader of his party. He was reelected as Speaker of the House in 1800.

==U.S. Senator==
On November 20, 1800, the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to the U.S. Senate by a vote of 68–13 over John Adair. He was eligible for the special congressional session called for March 4, 1801, but his summons to the session remained undelivered at the Lexington post office until March 5, and he consequently missed the entire session. When he left for Washington, D.C., late in the year, he left several of his pending legal cases in the hands of rising attorney Henry Clay, who would later become U.S. Secretary of State.

Although Democratic-Republicans held a narrow majority in the Senate, the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause. Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic-Republicans and newly elected president, Thomas Jefferson. His proposed repeal of the Federalist-supported Judicial Act of 1801, which had increased the number of federal courts and judges, was particularly controversial. On January 4, 1802, he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary. Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional; once established, courts were inviolate, he maintained. On January 20, Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments. South Carolina&#x27;s John E. Colhoun, a Democratic-Republican, voted with the Federalists, and the result was a 15–15 tie. Empowered to break the tie, Jefferson&#x27;s vice president, Aaron Burr, voted with the Federalists. The five-man committee consisted of three Federalists, enough to prevent the bill&#x27;s return to the floor, but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley, who had traveled home because of a family illness, returned to the chamber, the Democratic-Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition. In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate, Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress. On February 3, the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16–15, with the House concurring a month later.

===Louisiana Purchase===
Breckinridge advocated internal improvements and formed a coalition of legislators from South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Kentucky to support a system of roads connecting the Southern coastal states with the western frontier, but the routes they proposed proved impossible to construct with the technology available at the time. Spanish revocation of Kentucky&#x27;s right of deposit at New Orleans – in violation of Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty – further frustrated and angered frontier residents. Although many desired war with Spain, Jefferson believed a diplomatic resolution was possible and urged restraint. Federalists, seeking to divide the Democratic-Republicans and curry favor with the West, abandoned their usual advocacy of peace. Pennsylvania Federalist James Ross introduced a measure allocating $5 million and raising 50,000 militiamen to seize the Louisiana Territory from Spain. Cognizant of Jefferson&#x27;s desire for more time, Breckinridge offered a substitute resolution on February 23, 1803, allocating 80,000 troops and unlimited funds for the potential invasion of New Orleans, but he left their use at the discretion of the president. Breckinridge&#x27;s resolution was adopted after a heated debate.
Before an invasion became necessary, U.S. ambassadors learned that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, and France offered to sell the territory to the U.S. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe, U.S. ministers to France, agreed to the purchase, even though they had not been given the authority to do so. Jefferson was pleased with the purchase, but feared he had no constitutional authority to effect it. In an August 12, 1803, letter to Breckinridge, Jefferson discussed his constitutional misgivings about the Louisiana Purchase and proposed that Breckinridge introduce a simple constitutional amendment in the Senate: &quot;Louisiana, as ceded by France to the U.S., is made a part of the U.S.&quot; Breckinridge ignored the proposed amendment and immediately formed a coalition of western senators to approve the purchase.

After the purchase was approved, Jefferson drafted a system of governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he delivered his draft to Breckinridge and asked him to introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson&#x27;s plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.

===Consideration for the vice presidency===
By July 1803, citizens of the western states, desiring more representation in the federal government and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge&#x27;s nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election. Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson&#x27;s running mate. Breckinridge&#x27;s service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.
The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804. Contrary to previous conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations from the floor would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York&#x27;s George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not to vote for him at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote the election of the Democratic-Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee.

Westerners expressed dissent over Clinton&#x27;s nomination instead of their preferred candidate. The June 29, 1804, edition of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Independent Gazetteer&quot; carried an editorial, signed &quot;True American&quot;, that denounced the Virginia–New York coalition, attacked Clinton as too old, and called for electors to vote for Breckinridge for vice president. Potential electors in western states pledged to carry out &quot;True American&quot;&#x27;s proposal. Allan B. Magruder attempted to warn Breckinridge in advance of the editorial&#x27;s publication, but his letter – dated June 23, 1804 – did not reach Breckinridge until July 1. On July 5, Breckinridge published a response in the Kentucky &quot;Palladium&quot; denouncing the proposal and encouraging electors to vote for the Democratic-Republican slate as nominated. He requested that all newspapers that had printed the &quot;True American&quot; editorial also print his response.

In the same edition that carried Breckinridge&#x27;s response, Daniel Bradford, editor of the &quot;Kentucky Gazette&quot;, penned an editorial revealing Breckinridge&#x27;s close friend, William Stevenson, as the author of the &quot;True American&quot; article and noting that Breckinridge had waited nearly a week to publish a response, and claiming the delay was intended to allow him to gauge public sentiment before denouncing Stevenson&#x27;s proposal. Bradford had been at odds with Breckinridge since the 1799 constitutional convention, and his dislike intensified when Breckinridge refused to use his influence to gain appointments for Bradford&#x27;s relatives – John Bradford and James Bradford – as Public Printer of the United States and Secretary of Louisiana Territory, respectively. Bradford&#x27;s claims were quickly endorsed by anonymous editorial writers in newspapers across the west.

Stevenson swore under oath that Breckinridge had no part in composing the &quot;True American&quot; article. Breckinridge publicly stated that Bradford&#x27;s brother, Charles, had shown him a draft of the &quot;True American&quot; editorial prior to its publication and asked his opinion of it; Breckinridge advised him not to publish it, and Bradford temporarily obliged. An illness, Breckinridge said, had confined him to his home at the time of the editorial&#x27;s publication, and he was not aware that the &quot;Independent Gazetteer&quot; had printed it until he attended the court at Frankfort days later; he immediately returned home and composed his rebuttal. In light of this evidence, few still maintained the credibility of the reports in the &quot;Kentucky Gazette&quot; by the time of the election. Every Kentucky elector voted for both Jefferson and Clinton.

===Other Senate matters===
After the Louisiana Purchase, Breckinridge focused on securing a vote to present the Twelfth Amendment to the states for ratification. He did not agree with all the changes effected by the amendment, the primary purpose of which was to direct presidential electors to vote separately for president and vice president; he supported abolishing the electoral college, electing both officials by popular vote. Democratic-Republicans wanted the amendment adopted before the 1804 election to avoid Jefferson&#x27;s being saddled with a hostile vice president again, and Breckinridge announced his support for the amendment in late October. With several members of his party absent, he would not be able to secure the two-thirds majority needed to send the amendment to the states for ratification. Recognizing this fact, Federalists pushed for an immediate vote, putting Breckinridge in the position of trying to delay a vote on a measure both he and his constituents supported. Debate began on November 23 after several Democratic-Republicans had returned. South Carolina Federalist Pierce Butler contended that the amendment would allow large states to pick the president; James Jackson, a Democratic-Republican from Georgia, countered by taunting, &quot;Never will there be a Federal President or Vice-President again elected, to the end of time.&quot; Federalists moved adjournment at 6:00 p.m. on December 2, but Breckinridge, determined to hold a vote that night, blocked the move and took the floor for the first time in days. By 10:00 p.m., senators clamored for a vote, and the measure was approved 22–10. State legislatures quickly acted on the amendment, and by September 23, 1804, it was declared in force for the upcoming election.

Other business in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the , which had been captured off the coast of northern Africa, and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures. He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections, especially in the House, but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls. Robert Wright&#x27;s measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore, Maryland, in protest of legislators&#x27; poor accommodations in Washington, D.C., was defeated by a vote of 9–19, but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study. Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment trial of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated, and some Democratic-Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal. Majorities were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment, and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two-thirds majority. Breckinridge and three other Democratic-Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth, on which every senator sided with Chase.

==U.S. Attorney General==
When U.S. Attorney General Levi Lincoln resigned in December 1804, Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin sought a replacement. Virginia&#x27;s John Thomson Mason, Gallatin&#x27;s first choice, declined the appointment. U.S. Navy Secretary Robert Smith desired the office, and Jefferson agreed to appoint him, contingent upon finding a suitable replacement for Smith as Secretary of the Navy. Jefferson appointed Massachusetts Congressman Jacob Crowninshield to replace Smith, and both appointments were confirmed by the Senate March 3, 1805. Crowninshield refused his appointment, however, and Smith was forced to remain as Secretary of the Navy. Jefferson then offered the position to Breckinridge, Gallatin&#x27;s second choice. Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7, 1805, to accept the appointment. He was the first U.S. cabinet-level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains, and his appointment boosted Jefferson&#x27;s popularity in the west. Lowell Harrison called the appointment a mistake by Jefferson, not because Breckinridge lacked any qualifications, but because Jefferson was not able to replace his leadership in the Senate. He noted that after Breckinridge&#x27;s departure from the chamber, the Federalist minority experienced a revival of influence under the leadership of Connecticut&#x27;s Uriah Tracy.

Stopping to visit with friends &quot;en route&quot; to Washington, D.C., Breckinridge arrived on December 7, 1805. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on December 20. He was influential in Jefferson&#x27;s infrequent cabinet meetings, where he served as the lone voice of the west. His most notable advisory opinion – that no local government in the Territory of Orleans had the power to tax federal property there – was upheld in the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Marshall in &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;. He was sworn in to represent the federal government before the Supreme Court when it convened – about a week late because of the illness of several justices – on February 12, 1806. He was spared the awkwardness of practicing before a judge he had voted to impeach because Samuel Chase was absent for the Court&#x27;s entire six-week term. The court heard only six cases during the term; most of them were cases Breckinridge had inherited from his predecessor, and Harrison wrote that none were of lasting importance. Cases such as &quot;Maley v. Shattuck&quot; involved international maritime law – an area with which Breckinridge was not familiar – and arose from the Napoleonic Wars, which complicated neutral American trade with both Britain and France. During the term, Breckinridge lost four cases, won one, and the justices sent one back for retrial in a lower court.

==Death and legacy==
Breckinridge returned to Cabell&#x27;s Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky&#x27;s Olympian Springs, hoping it would aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on the cause of his illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband&#x27;s death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell&#x27;s Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.

At the time of his death, Breckinridge owned over of land, and his net worth was estimated at more than $20,000. With a workforce of nearly 70 slaves, he was one of the largest slaveholders in the state. The breeding of horses and mules at Cabell&#x27;s Dale had become more profitable than selling the excess crops raised there. His daughter, Mary Ann, and her husband, David Castleman, inherited the horse and mule breeding operations, which eventually became the thoroughbred stable of Castleton Lyons. Breckinridge County, Kentucky, created from a portion of Hardin County in 1799, was named in Breckinridge&#x27;s honor.

<doc id="177872" wikidata="Q2566566" url="?curid=177872" title="Leamington, Ontario">
<text>Leamington ( ) is a municipality in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. With a population of 29,680 in the Canada 2021 Census, it forms the second largest urban centre in Windsor-Essex County after Windsor, Ontario. It includes Point Pelee National Park, the southernmost point of mainland Canada.

Known since the 20th century as the &quot;Tomato Capital of Canada&quot;, it is the location of a tomato processing plant owned by Highbury-Canco; founded in 1908, the plant was owned until 2014 by the H. J. Heinz Company. Due to its location in the southernmost part of Canada, Leamington uses the motto &quot;Sun Parlour of Canada&quot;.

==Communities==
Besides the town of Leamington itself, the municipality of Leamington comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Albuna, Blytheswood, Cherry Lane Estates, Elmdale, Goldsmith, Marentette Beach, Mount Carmel, Oakland, Seacliffe, Wigle, Windfall, Chalmers, Erie Curve, Hillman, Point Pelee and Sturgeon Woods.

== History ==
Leamington was incorporated as a village in 1874, but by 1869, the European-Canadian settlement already had a population of 350. The community was named after Royal Leamington Spa in England, after having originally been called &quot;Gainesville&quot; or &quot;Gainesborough&quot; for local mill owner William Gaines, and before that, Wilkinson Corners. It has had a post office since June 1854.

It was a crossroads hamlet with about 300 residents and was first known for its lumber products rather than tomatoes. There was extensive lumbering in western Ontario, as across the river in Michigan and also upper Michigan. There were several docks, and fish were plentiful in Lake Erie, so much so that sturgeon could be speared from the shore and fish was the cheapest food available.

Leamington was a &quot;sundown town,&quot; a place where Black people would face violence or harassment if they were in public after dark. In 1930, a group of Black parishioners on a visit to Seacliff Park were ordered to leave Leamington by several town administrators. David Suzuki attests that he was told, upon arrival in Leamington in 1946, that “no colored person has ever stayed here beyond sunset.”

Leamington was also one of the few Canadian municipalities included in the &quot;Negro Motorist Green Book&quot;, the American publication listing safe businesses for travelling black people.

On 1 January 1999, the town was amalgamated with the surrounding Township of Mersea to form an expanded Town of Leamington. Similar municipal restructuring took place throughout Essex County.

In the early hours of June 6, 2010, an F1 tornado ripped through portions of southern Essex County, stretching from Harrow, through Kingsville, to southern Leamington before dissipating near Point Pelee National Park, creating considerable damage, but no loss of life or any direct injuries. The tornado passed through Leamington, damaging various important landmarks and facilities in town, including the marina.

== Climate ==
Leamington lies on the 42nd Parallel, the same latitude as Chicago, Boston, the northern border of California, Rome, and Zaragoza. It is located on the north shore of Lake Erie, which acts to moderate its climate.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Leamington had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Language ===

The majority of people from Leamington speak English. According to the 2016 census, 24,070 speak English only, 12,100 male and 11,970 female, 1,655 people speak both English and French, 735 male and 920 female, and 1,330 people speak neither English nor French.

Residents of Leamington include a population of Lebanese, Portuguese and Italian. Mennonite settlers, whose ancestors immigrated from Russia, have also added to the population.

=== Age ===

According to the 2016 census, the average age of people living in Leamington is 41.3 years - for men the age was 39.7 and for women the age was 42.9 years of age. 

=== Immigration ===

According to a 2006 survey, 7,485 are immigrants or migrants, and 19,365 people are natives of Canada. The majority of migrants come from Mexico and Jamaica, and are employed as seasonal farm workers through the Temporary foreign worker program in Canada. According to the census, Leamington had the highest percentage of Latin Americans in Canada, with 4.9%.

== Transportation ==
Transportation around the city is offered by the Leamington Transit bus system. The city has a small private airport located to the east of town. The town is also connected to the provincial highway network by Highway 3 (to Windsor), and Highway 77 (to Highway 401).

A rail line that Heinz built from its plant to the harbour has been converted to a bicycle path going from the middle of town to the Marina. Two ferries, (MV &quot;Jiiman&quot; and MV &quot;Pelee Islander II&quot;) owned by the Owen Sound Transportation Company, run on a regularly scheduled seasonal basis from Leamington to Pelee Island with continuing service on to Sandusky, Ohio.

== Economy ==

The H. J. Heinz company established a factory in 1908 in Leamington. The Heinz products are shipped from the city with both English and French labels, mostly to the United States. Ketchup and baby food are the main products. In November 2013 Heinz announced that it would close the Leamington plant in 2014, meaning job losses for 740 employees at the plant and hundreds more support workers.

Regional and local businessmen worked to save the plant. A campaign was conducted on Facebook to raise support and funds. As a 54-year-old law in Canada bans the use of tomato paste in tomato juice, thus requiring fresh tomatoes, they arranged a deal whereby Highbury Canco took over the plant in 2014. It produces tomato juice and other products for Heinz. Around 250 workers still process canned products at the over 100-year-old factory.

Leamington has also been known for its greenhouses. It now has the largest concentration of commercial greenhouses in all of North America, with of greenhouse vegetable production in the general area. Major products of the greenhouse industry, in addition to tomatoes, are peppers, cannabis, cucumbers, roses, and other flowers. Hydroponic farming has been very successfully adopted by many greenhouse operators in Leamington. Historically, tobacco was an important crop in the area. Tobacco production declined in the 1960s and today is virtually nonexistent.

Migrant workers, mostly Mexican and Caribbean seasonal labourers, annually arrive in the region to work in Leamington&#x27;s greenhouses and farms. Several Mexican and Jamaican shops and a Mexican consulate have opened to serve the migrants.

Leamington became a production site of Aphria, one of Canada&#x27;s largest medicinal and recreational marijuana greenhouse operators. A merger in December 2020 with Nanaimo, British Columbia-based Tilray, led to the closure of Tilray&#x27;s production site in Leamington and operations were consolidated at the former Aphria site under the name Tilray.

==Healthcare==

Erie Shores Healthcare serves the city of Leamington, as well as Essex and Chatham Kent. Opened in 1950, Leamington District Memorial Hospital succeeded two smaller healthcare facilities: Hopewell Hospital (c. 1933) and Cottage Hospital (c. 1920). In mid-December 2016, the hospital formally submitted notice to the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, it wished to change its name to Erie Shores Healthcare, and subsequently has been approved. Other major healthcare needs can be undertaken in nearby Windsor, Ontario.

== Education ==
English-language public education for kindergarten through secondary school grades in Essex County is administered by the Greater Essex County District School Board, along with the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board which oversees English-language Catholic education.

French-language public and Catholic education are overseen by the Conseil scolaire Viamonde and the Conseil scolaire catholique Providence, respectively. The scope of all of these organizations includes both the County and the City of Windsor.

Prior to 1998, the Essex County Board of Education operated Anglophone secular public schools.

<doc id="177877" wikidata="Q2396377" url="?curid=177877" title="Paradox of hedonism">
<text>The paradox of hedonism, also called the pleasure paradox, refers to the practical difficulties encountered in the pursuit of pleasure. For the hedonist, constant pleasure-seeking may not yield the most actual pleasure or happiness in the long term when consciously pursuing pleasure interferes with experiencing it.

The utilitarian philosopher Henry Sidgwick was first to note in &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot; that the paradox of hedonism is that pleasure cannot be acquired directly. Variations on this theme appear in the realms of philosophy, psychology, and economics.

==Overview==

Failing to attain pleasures while deliberately seeking them has been variously described:

* John Stuart Mill, the utilitarian philosopher, in his autobiography:
But I now thought that this end [one&#x27;s happiness] was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness[...] Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way[...] Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so.

* Viktor Frankl in &quot;Man&#x27;s Search for Meaning&quot;:
Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&#x27;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&#x27;s surrender to a person other than oneself.

The more a man tries to demonstrate his sexual potency or a woman her ability to experience orgasm, the less they are able to succeed. Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself.

* Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche in &quot;The Antichrist&quot; (1895) and &quot;The Will to Power&quot; (1901):
What is good? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself.
What is bad? Everything that is born of weakness.
What is happiness? The feeling that power increases—that a resistance is overcome.

[...] it is significantly enlightening to substitute for the individual &#x27;happiness&#x27; (for which every living being is supposed to strive) &quot;power&quot; [...] joy is only a symptom of the feeling of attained power [...] (one does not strive for joy [...] joy accompanies; joy does not move)

* Psychologist Alfred Adler in &quot;The Neurotic Constitution&quot; (1912):
Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;will to power&quot; and &quot;will to seem&quot; embrace many of our views, which again resemble in some respects the views of Féré and the older writers, according to whom the sensation of pleasure originates in a feeling of power, that of pain in a feeling of feebleness.

* Poet and satirist Edward Young:
The love of praise, howe&#x27;er concealed by art,
Reigns more or less supreme in every heart;
The Proud to gain it, toils on toils endure;
The modest shun it, but to make it sure!

* Politician William Bennett:
Happiness is like a cat, if you try to coax it or call it, it will avoid you; it will never come. But if you pay no attention to it and go about your business, you&#x27;ll find it rubbing against your legs and jumping into your lap.

* Novelist João Guimarães Rosa:
Happiness is found only in little moments of inattention.

==Suggested explanations==
&quot;Happiness&quot; is often imprecisely equated with &quot;pleasure&quot;. If, for whatever reason, one does equate happiness with pleasure, then the paradox of hedonism arises. When one aims solely towards pleasure itself, one&#x27;s aim is frustrated. Henry Sidgwick comments on such frustration after a discussion of self-love in the above-mentioned work:

I should not, however, infer from this that the pursuit of pleasure is necessarily self-defeating and futile; but merely that the principle of Egoistic Hedonism, when applied with a due knowledge of the laws of human nature, is practically self-limiting; i.e., that a rational method of attaining the end at which it aims requires that we should to some extent put it out of sight and not directly aim at it.

While not addressing the paradox directly, Aristotle commented on the futility of pursuing pleasure. Human beings are actors whose endeavours bring about consequences, and among these is pleasure. Aristotle then argues as follows:

How, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we grow weary? Certainly all human things are incapable of continuous activity. Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies activity.

Sooner or later, finite beings will be unable to acquire and expend the resources necessary to maintain their sole goal of pleasure; thus, they find themselves in the company of misery. Evolutionary theory explains that humans evolved through natural selection and follow genetic imperatives that seek to maximize reproduction, not happiness. As a result of these selection pressures, the extent of human happiness is limited biologically. David Pearce argues in his treatise &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; that humans might be able to use genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and neuroscience to eliminate suffering in all human life and allow for peak levels of happiness and pleasure that are currently unimaginable.

Competing philosophies seek to balance hedonism with good acts and intentions, thus &quot;earning&quot; the pleasure.

<doc id="177882" wikidata="Q1418875" url="?curid=177882" title="Sealab 2021">
<text>Sealab 2021 is an American adult animated television series created by Adam Reed and Matt Thompson for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late-night programming block, Adult Swim. Cartoon Network aired the show&#x27;s first three episodes in December 2000 before the official inception of the Adult Swim block on September 2, 2001, with the final episode airing on April 24, 2005. &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; is one of the only four original Williams Street series that premiered in 2000 before Adult Swim officially launched, with the others being &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, &quot;The Brak Show&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;.

Much like Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, the animation used stock footage from Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s short-lived, environmentally themed animated series &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, along with original animation; Hanna-Barbera was not involved in the production. The show was a satirical parody of both the original &quot;Sealab&quot; series and the general conventions of the 1970s animated children&#x27;s series. While there was initial resistance from several of the original series&#x27; creators to the reuse of their characters, production moved forward on the series. &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; was produced by 70/30 Productions.

==Episodes==

==Production==
Adam Reed and Matt Thompson, the creators and writers of &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;, came up with the idea for the show in 1995 while they were production assistants for Cartoon Network. They stumbled on a tape of the show &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, and wrote replacement dialogue. Cartoon Network passed on the show because it did not believe it was funny. Five years after quitting Cartoon Network, the two went back to the original tape, this time making the characters do what they wanted. Cartoon Network bought the show, coincidentally around the same time that Adult Swim was created. The original &quot;pitch pilot&quot; is available on the Season 1 DVD as a special feature.

Very few of the episodes of the series share any continuity or ongoing plot. For instance, the entire installation is destroyed at the end of many episodes, and crew members are often killed in horrible ways, only to return in the following episode. There are occasional running gags, such as the &quot;Grizzlebee&#x27;s&quot; restaurant chain, a parody of Applebee&#x27;s and Bennigan&#x27;s, the character of Sharko, and Prescott, the half-man, half-tentacle monster &quot;from the network&quot;. It contains many references to the pop culture of the 1980s–2000s and makes use of other cartoons from the 1970s besides that on which it is based, such as 1973&#x27;s &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; for the on-screen appearances of the Sealab writers, and various one-off appearances of other characters.

==Characters==
* Captain Hazel &quot;Hank&quot; Murphy (Harry Goz) is the ostensible leader of the crew, though his qualifications, and even his grasp on reality, are questionable. He is generally found loitering on the bridge, neglecting his duties. Murphy spends his time participating in scams and juvenile antics, generally causing problems that the crew has to solve. The only episode which features Murphy acting responsibly throughout is &quot;7211&quot;, which is a faithful reenactment of the original &quot;Sealab 2020&quot; show. Captain Murphy is a parody of Captain Mike Murphy from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;. Generally, Murphy is incapable to the point of incompetence. On more than one occasion, it has been implied that Murphy has gone insane due to the amount of time he has spent underwater. However, the crew either does not notice this or does not care and usually follows his orders, even when they will directly lead to the crew&#x27;s deaths. Murphy is a practicing Alvian and has a deep-seated fear of doppelgängers and especially flashlights, the latter a fear for which there is no name. After the death of Harry Goz, Murphy was written out of the show by having him leave Sealab to fight in the &quot;Great Spice Wars&quot;. It is implied that Murphy is the leader of the Rebel forces in this war, though the reasoning behind this is or its effect on the war is never explored. A recap montage of Murphy&#x27;s moments were played in the final episode in memory of his voice actor. He later appeared in the Reed and Thompson-created series &quot;Archer&quot;, where he was voiced by Jon Hamm and debuted in the two-part episode &quot;Sea Tunt&quot;.
* Captain Bellerophon &quot;Tornado&quot; Shanks (Michael Goz) is a retired football coach and health and hygiene teacher who lost his job for slapping (or throat punching) a student. He answered Sealab&#x27;s help wanted ad and became the new captain, despite having no experience whatsoever. Shanks is from Texas and is the youngest of several brothers all named after characters in Greek mythology, and all of whom met their death on or around a bridge in Shanks&#x27;s hometown. Dropping his Southern accent late in the series (citing that some viewers thought he was gay), Shanks&#x27; personality bears a resemblance to Captain Murphy, being voiced by Harry Goz&#x27;s son. Shanks is much more self-aware than Murphy, openly commenting on the odd goings-on aboard Sealab and even the fact that he is on a television program. Since Shanks has no experience or idea what he is doing, he goes along with whatever the rest of the crew suggests, usually with disastrous results. Captain Shanks debuted in the season 3 episode &quot;Tornado Shanks&quot;.
* Lieutenant Jodene Sparks (Bill Lobley) is the station&#x27;s radio operator who is always seen sitting with his headsets on. Sparks is a parody of Lieutenant Sparks from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;. Sparks mostly uses the radio for his own personal purposes, even going so far as to disconnect vital transmissions that interrupt him. He generally travels around in his office chair, mostly because he is lazy, even though it was suggested that he is crippled. Sparks is a convict serving time at Sealab while still operating a black market distillery and takes part in a wide variety of other illegal activities. He occasionally serves as a voice of reason to the crew, particularly to Murphy. He is just as often the catalyst of problems aboard Sealab, including Sealab&#x27;s destruction. He is claustrophobic and a Malkin, the show&#x27;s version of Wiccan. Sparks&#x27;s quest for money has been in several plots, such as the murdering of the crew to collect on life insurance policies, the creation of Stimutacs to &quot;make an assload of money&quot;, and his numerous underhand deals with Paddy O&#x27;Reilly, and the various Daves. An early episode revealed that he acts as a criminal mastermind called &quot;Overlord&quot; with a hollowed-out volcano base and an army of minions. Episode 46 reveals he enjoys hentai with themes of forced submission and humiliation. Rank: Commander.
* Debbie &quot;White Debbie&quot; DuPree (Kate Miller) is a marine biologist and one of only two adult women on the base. Serving as a parody of Gail from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, she is a blonde and is often the object of the sexual interest of the males on Sealab. She has an ongoing sexual relationship with Doctor Quinn, and their relationship, its ups and downs, and its effect on the rest of the crew play out in several stories. This does not stop the other males, particularly Stormy, from attempting to get on her good side. Debbie&#x27;s mood swings are a constant issue to the crew, as she changes wildly from the sole voice of reason to a shrieking lunatic. Debbie picked up the &quot;White Debbie&quot; appellation at the behest of Doctor Quinn, who thought it was unfair that Debbie Love went by &quot;Black Debbie&quot; while Debbie Dupree was simply Debbie. Nevertheless, few of the crew actually call her that. Rank: Lieutenant Commander.
* Derek &quot;Stormy&quot; Waters (Ellis Henican) is a pretty boy lacking in intelligence or seemingly any qualifications to be working on a government research lab, and a parody of Hal from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;. Stormy&#x27;s job is never clearly defined and he usually walks around Sealab doing whatever he wants or acts as a henchman or assistant to whomever he is nearest. Stormy usually works alongside Quinn, who is frequently the victim of Stormy&#x27;s ignorance, but ironically is the crew member who&#x27;s most tolerant of him. The two frequently find themselves in &quot;Odd Couple&quot;-like situations. Stormy has shown skill in the operation of the submersible Deep Diver, both as a pilot and gunner, as well as operating other technological gadgets, though he is just as irresponsible in those positions as anywhere else. The crew has been shown to dislike or mistreat Stormy on multiple occasions, such as putting a sign outside the mess hall saying &quot;No Stormies&quot; when they held a pizza party or forgetting that he was trapped outside of the closet with Murphy&#x27;s carnivorous dogs. Stormy is a proudly practicing Alvian, like Murphy. Of all characters, Stormy is the most different in the episode &quot;7211&quot;. In the episode, he directs the rest of the crew effectively in the salvage of the damaged sub. He is allergic to shellfish. Rank: Lieutenant Commander.
* Dr. Quentin Q. Quinn (Brett Butler) is the science officer. Parodying Ed from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, he is an extremely intelligent African-American with an IQ of 260 and Ph.D.s in several scientific disciplines, of which he is not shy about reminding the other characters. Quinn grew up in unbelievably over-the-top poverty and got to where he is through hard work, unlike the majority of the other characters. He is regarded as an uptight killjoy by most of the crew. Quinn is often the only responsible crew member and the sole voice of reason. This has caused the other crew to neglect their duties even further, as they believe &quot;Quinn will handle it.&quot; Despite his intelligence, Quinn is extremely vain and prone to outbursts of anger when he is not appreciated. Quinn often attempts to prevent Murphy&#x27;s questionable plans from being enacted, leading Murphy to distrust Quinn. However, Murphy is aware that he and the station completely depend on Quinn, going so far as to snake his vacation to ensure that he does not leave the station. Quinn has an ongoing sexual relationship with Debbie Dupree. In the first episode, he revealed that he inhabits a robot body of his own design. Rank: Lieutenant Commander.
* Marco Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Erik Estrada) is the station&#x27;s engineer. Spoofing Dr. Paul Williams from &quot;Sealab 2020&quot;, he is very strong and muscular, unlike the rest of the crew. He speaks with a Spanish accent and often exclaims random things in Spanish, although not actually speaking the language. Quinn even remarks that his Spanish is terrible. His name comes from both the Spaniard epic 11th-century poem &quot;Cantar del Mio Cid&quot;, which featured the character Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, and from the 1982 Literary Nobel Prize winner journalist and novelist Gabriel García Márquez. Marco&#x27;s exact heritage is unknown, though he is fiercely not a Spaniard. Marco is prone to violence, both in the defense of the crew and against them. Marco often argues with Murphy about his methods and seems to be the only one to whom Murphy actually listens. Despite this, Murphy often calls Marco &quot;mailbox head&quot; and included a segment on his radio show where listeners could call in to tell him why they hated Marco. Marco gets along with most of the crew, especially Sparks and Quinn. Marco also interacts with the orphans on Sealab and has been shown to have a soft side. Rank: Lieutenant Commander.
* Hesh Hepplewhite (MC Chris) is the station&#x27;s reactor operator and, more often than not, their whipping boy. Hesh has a habit of continually referring to himself in the third person. It was revealed that he is Jewish. Nasal-voiced, smart-mouthed, and whiny, Hesh is not well-liked by most of the crew and thus works in the part of the station farthest away from them. He has no real understanding of how the reactor works and generally has to have guidance from Quinn when there is a problem. Hesh&#x27;s own interactions with the machinery are generally useless or actively destructive, such as the &quot;hammer game&quot;, which involves smashing the computers with a hammer. Hesh generally does not participate in the crew&#x27;s activities unless he interrupts on the radio. Hesh performs the birthday song at Quinn&#x27;s birthday and acts as Murphy&#x27;s caddie. Hesh&#x27;s safety is not a concern to any of the characters, as Murphy sent him into the reactor core to recover a ball. As a result of being isolated in the reactor, Hesh has developed odd tendencies, such as dressing as a woman on multiple occasions. Rank: Lieutenant.
* Debbie &quot;Black Debbie&quot; Allison Love (Angela Gibbs) is both the only other adult female and the only black female on the station. She is the parody of the &quot;Sealab 2020&quot; character Mrs. Thomas (Ed Thomas&#x27;s mother). She teaches school to the Sealab&#x27;s orphans and is very proud of her race. She has a relationship with Marco at the beginning of the show and briefly dates Sparks and Tornado in the later seasons. In one episode, her name is displayed on a monitor as Debbie Allison; but in another, her nameplate is shown as Debbie Love. She is a former Heisman Trophy winner. Rank: Lieutenant.
* Dr. Ilad Virjay (Adam Reed) is the station&#x27;s official doctor and in-house surgeon noted for his thick Indian accent and relatively normal personality. He graduated third in his class from The Medical College of Mescutabuti. He practices Manduism, the Sealab universe&#x27;s version of Hinduism. Dr. Virjay is shown to be jealous of Dr. Quinn as the latter has multiple Ph.Ds and a higher IQ. Dr. Virjay delivers all his lines in a deadpan, whether informing crew members of medical issues or confronting an invisible monster shortly before his death. It is later revealed that he is also janitor for Sealab&#x27;s restaurant section. Rank: Unknown.
* Dolphin Boy is a little chubby boy that speaks in dolphin noises. One of the orphans that inhabit Sealab for some reason, he is a member of Black Debbie&#x27;s class. Dolphin Boy often wanders around the station and, as a result, is often embroiled in whatever is going on. When translated, Dolphin Boy generally says inoffensive, naively childish statements, universally resulting in derision and hatred from the rest of the crew. He is the target of endless fat jokes and is often killed by the Sealab crew members for no reason whatsoever. He is the persona non grata of Sealab. Rank: Lieutenant Jr. Grade.
* Sharko (Matt Thompson) is a half-human, half-shark freak of nature who is the result of Marco having sexual relations with a female shark.
* The Five Jew Bankers are a lampoon of Jewish conspiracy theories. They are introduced in &quot;Neptunati&quot; (Season 3 Episode 13).

==International broadcast==
In Canada, &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; currently airs on the local version of Adult Swim. It previously aired on the former Teletoon at Night program block on Teletoon in English Canada.

==Home media and streaming==
The series has been available on HBO Max since September 1, 2020.

==Reception==
In January 2009, IGN listed &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; as the 79th best in the &quot;Top 100 Animated Series&quot;. In 2013 IGN placed &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; as number 22 on their list of top 25 animated series for adults.

Paul Di Filippo of the website &quot;Sci Fi Weekly&quot;, in his review of the Season 3 DVD, felt that general fan opinion of the show declined sharply following the death of Harry Goz (the voice of Captain Hazel Murphy) during Season 3.

In 2021, upon the 20-year anniversary of Adult Swim, Nerdist stated of the series, &quot;It&#x27;s one thing to imagine &quot;Sealab 2021&quot;. It&#x27;s another getting it on the airwaves.&quot; Boston&#x27;s Rock 92.9 published an article calling it &quot;Another masterful reworking of old cartoon footage.&quot;

<doc id="177885" wikidata="Q2720759" url="?curid=177885" title="Esotropia">
<text>Esotropia () is a form of strabismus in which one or both eyes turn inward. The condition can be constantly present, or occur intermittently, and can give the affected individual a &quot;cross-eyed&quot; appearance. It is the opposite of exotropia and usually involves more severe axis deviation than esophoria. Esotropia is sometimes erroneously called &quot;lazy eye&quot;, which describes the condition of amblyopia; a reduction in vision of one or both eyes that is not the result of any pathology of the eye and cannot be resolved by the use of corrective lenses. Amblyopia can, however, arise as a result of esotropia occurring in childhood: In order to relieve symptoms of diplopia or double vision, the child&#x27;s brain will ignore or &quot;suppress&quot; the image from the esotropic eye, which when allowed to continue untreated will lead to the development of amblyopia. Treatment options for esotropia include glasses to correct refractive errors (see accommodative esotropia below), the use of prisms, orthoptic exercises, or eye muscle surgery.

==Types==
=== Concomitant esotropia ===
Concomitant esotropia – that is, an inward squint that does not vary with the direction of gaze – mostly sets in before 12 months of age (this constitutes 40% of all strabismus cases) or at the age of three or four. Most patients with &quot;early-onset&quot; concomitant esotropia are emmetropic, whereas most of the &quot;later-onset&quot; patients are hyperopic. It is the most frequent type of natural strabismus not only in humans, but also in monkeys.

Concomitant esotropia can itself be subdivided into esotropias that are either &quot;constant&quot;, or &quot;intermittent&quot;.

; Constant esotropia
: A constant esotropia, as the name implies, is present all the time.
; Intermittent esotropia
: Intermittent esotropias, again as the name implies, are not always present. In very rare cases, they may only occur in repeated cycles of &#x27;one day on, one day off&#x27; (Cyclic Esotropia). However, the vast majority of intermittent esotropias are accommodative in origin.

A patient can have a constant esotropia for reading, but an intermittent esotropia for distance (but rarely vice versa).

=== Accommodative esotropia ===
Accommodative esotropia (also called &quot;refractive esotropia&quot;) is an inward turning of the eyes due to efforts of accommodation. It is often seen in patients with moderate amounts of hyperopia. The person with hyperopia, in an attempt to &quot;accommodate&quot; or focus the eyes, converges the eyes as well, as convergence is associated with activation of the accommodation reflex. The over-convergence associated with the extra accommodation required to overcome a hyperopic refractive error can precipitate a loss of binocular control and lead to the development of esotropia.

The chances of an esotropia developing in a hyperopic child will depend to some degree on the amount of hyperopia present. Where the degree of error is small, the child will typically be able to maintain control because the amount of over-accommodation required to produce clear vision is also small. Where the degree of hyperopia is large, the child may not be able to produce clear vision no matter how much extra-accommodation is exerted and thus no incentive exists for the over-accommodation and convergence that can give rise to the onset of esotropia. However, where the degree of error is small enough to allow the child to generate clear vision by over-accommodation, but large enough to disrupt their binocular control, esotropia will result.

Only about 20% of children with hyperopia greater than +3.5 diopters develop strabismus.

Where the esotropia is solely a consequence of uncorrected hyperopic refractive error, providing the child with the correct glasses and ensuring that these are worn all the time, is often enough to control the deviation. In such cases, known as &#x27;fully accommodative esotropias&#x27;, the esotropia will only be seen when the child removes their glasses. Many adults with childhood esotropias of this type make use of contact lenses to control their &#x27;squint&#x27;. Some undergo refractive surgery for this purpose.

A second type of accommodative esotropia also exists, known as &#x27;convergence excess esotropia&#x27;. In this condition the child exerts excessive accommodative convergence relative to their accommodation. Thus, in such cases, even when all underlying hyperopic refractive errors have been corrected, the child will continue to squint when looking at very small objects or reading small print. Even though they are exerting a normal amount of accommodative or &#x27;focusing&#x27; effort, the amount of convergence associated with this effort is excessive, thus giving rise to esotropia. In such cases an additional hyperopic correction is often prescribed in the form of bifocal lenses, to reduce the degree of accommodation, and hence convergence, being exerted. Many children will gradually learn to control their esotropias, sometimes with the help of orthoptic exercises. However, others will eventually require extra-ocular muscle surgery to resolve their problems.

=== Congenital esotropia ===
&quot;Congenital esotropia&quot;, or &quot;infantile esotropia&quot;, is a specific sub-type of primary concomitant esotropia. It is a constant esotropia of large and consistent size with onset between birth and six months of age. It is not associated with hyperopia, so the exertion of accommodative effort will not significantly affect the angle of deviation. It is, however, associated with other ocular dysfunctions including oblique muscle over-actions, dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), manifest latent nystagmus, and defective abduction, which develops as a consequence of the tendency of those with infantile esotropia to &#x27;cross fixate&#x27;. Cross fixation involves the use of the right eye to look to the left and the left eye to look to the right; a visual pattern that will be &#x27;natural&#x27; for the person with the large angle esotropia whose eye is already deviated towards the opposing side.

The origin of the condition is unknown, and its early onset means that the affected individual&#x27;s potential for developing binocular vision is limited. The appropriate treatment approach remains a matter of some debate. Some ophthalmologists favour an early surgical approach as offering the best prospect of binocularity whilst others remain unconvinced that the prospects of achieving this result are good enough to justify the increased complexity and risk associated with operating on those under the age of one year.

=== Incomitant esotropia ===
Incomitant esotropias are conditions in which the esotropia varies in size with direction of gaze. They can occur in both childhood and adulthood, and arise as a result of neurological, mechanical or myogenic problems. These problems may directly affect the extra-ocular muscles themselves, and may also result from conditions affecting the nerve or blood supply to these muscles or the bony orbital structures surrounding them. Examples of conditions giving rise to an esotropia might include a sixth cranial nerve (or abducens nerve) palsy, Duane&#x27;s syndrome or orbital injury.

==Diagnosis==
=== Classification ===
==== Right, left or alternating ====

Someone with esotropia will squint with either the right or the left eye but never with both eyes simultaneously. In a &quot;left esotropia&quot;, the left eye &#x27;squints&#x27;, and in a &quot;right esotropia&quot; the right eye &#x27;squints&#x27;. In an &quot;alternating esotropia&quot;, the patient is able to alternate fixation between their right and left eye so that at one moment the right eye fixates and the left eye turns inward, and at the next the left eye fixates and the right turns inward. This alteration between the left and right eye is mostly spontaneous, but may be voluntary in some cases. Where a patient tends to consistently fixate with one eye and squint with the other, the eye that squints is likely to develop some amblyopia. Someone whose squint alternates is very unlikely to develop amblyopia because both eyes will receive equal visual stimulation. It is possible to encourage alternation through the use of occlusion or patching of the &#x27;dominant&#x27; or &#x27;fixating&#x27; eye to promote the use of the other. Esotropia is a highly prevalent congenital condition.

==== Concomitant versus incomitant ====

Esotropias can be concomitant, where the size of the deviation does not vary with direction of gaze, or incomitant, where the direction of gaze does affect the size, or indeed presence, of the esotropia. The majority of esotropias are concomitant and begin early in childhood, typically between the ages of 2 and 4 years. Incomitant esotropias occur both in childhood and adulthood as a result of neurological, mechanical or myogenic problems affecting the muscles controlling eye movements.

==== Primary, secondary or consecutive ====

Concomitant esotropias can arise as an initial problem, in which case they are designated as &quot;primary&quot;, as a consequence of loss or impairment of vision, in which case they are designated as &quot;secondary&quot;, or following overcorrection of an initial exotropia in which case they are described as being &quot;consecutive&quot;. The vast majority of esotropias are primary.

== Treatment ==

The prognosis for each patient with esotropia will depend upon the origin and classification of their condition. However, in general, management will take the following course:

# Identify and treat any underlying systemic condition.
# Prescribe any glasses required and allow the patient time to &#x27;settle into&#x27; them.
# Use occlusion to treat any amblyopia present and encourage alternation.
# Where appropriate, orthoptic exercises (sometimes referred to as vision therapy) can be used to attempt to restore binocularity.
# Where appropriate, prismatic correction can be used, either temporarily or permanently, to relieve symptoms of double vision.
# In specific cases, and primarily in adult patients, botulinum toxin can be used either as a permanent therapeutic approach, or as a temporary measure to prevent contracture of muscles prior to surgery
# Where necessary, extra-ocular muscle surgery, like strabismus surgery, which is a surgery where the doctors physically move the muscle that is making the eye contract. This can be undertaken to improve cosmesis and, on occasion, restore binocularity.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;esotropia&quot; is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;ésō&quot;, meaning “within”, and &quot;trópos&quot;, meaning “a turn”.

Connors&#x27; songs have become part of the Canadian cultural landscape. Among his best-known songs are &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Bud the Spud&quot; and &quot;The Hockey Song&quot;; the last is played at various games throughout the National Hockey League, including at every Toronto Maple Leafs home game. In 2018, the song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in a ceremony at a Leafs game.

==Early life==
Charles Thomas Connors was born on February 9, 1936, at the General Hospital in Saint John, New Brunswick, to Isabel Connors and Thomas Joseph Sullivan.

Isabel&#x27;s family were Irish Protestants, and his maternal grandfather, John Connors, was a sea captain from Boston, Massachusetts, who had died before Charles was born. His father was a Catholic of Irish ancestry, and &quot;may have been Métis or ... Micmac.&quot; Isabel Connors and Thomas Joseph Sullivan did not marry until 30 years later, as Sullivan&#x27;s family were devout Catholics and did not want him marrying a Protestant; they later divorced. Sullivan&#x27;s mother gave him $10, and he was told to leave home. Connors was also a cousin of New Brunswick fiddling sensation, Ned Landry.

Connors&#x27; first home was on St. Patrick Street, in the &quot;poorest and most rundown part of Saint John&quot;. He lived there with his mother, his maternal grandmother Lucy Scribner, and his maternal stepgrandfather Joe Scribner When Connors was three, Lucy and Joe died within weeks of each other. This forced Isabel to move to a two-bedroom apartment. Around this time Isabel got pregnant again by Tom&#x27;s father when he briefly returned, and Tom got a taste of hitchhiking when he and Isabel went to visit relatives in Tusket Falls, Nova Scotia. This trip was the first time he saw his mother steal to feed them, when she stole food from a Chinese restaurant in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. When they returned to Saint John, they moved in with friends of Isabel and she gave birth to Tom&#x27;s sister Marie, who had to stay in hospital to have a birthmark removed. Later, Isabel and Tom moved in with her new boyfriend Terrence Messer at the corner of Clarence and Erin Streets. While they did not marry, the family would take on his surname. Terrence and Isabel did pretend to be married to find a place to live, due to the moral standards of the time. The family was quite poor, and Terrence was a neglectful stepfather, who spent most of the family&#x27;s money on wine. When they missed paying rent, the family was evicted and moved to a house on St. Patrick Street. Marie finally came home from the hospital then, but she died when Tom was four, following more surgery to remove another birthmark. To make ends meet, Isabel got a job scrubbing floors and Terrence did odd jobs. The family was evicted again after a spat with the landlord when Tom started a fire in their apartment. Their next home was a basement apartment on King Street.

Connors spent a short time living with his mother in a low-security women&#x27;s penitentiary before he was seized by Children&#x27;s Aid Society and later adopted by Cora and Russell Aylward in Skinners Pond, Prince Edward Island.

At 13 he ran away from his adoptive family to hitchhike across Canada. He got his first guitar at 14, and at 15 he wrote his first song called &quot;Reversing Falls Darling&quot;. His hitchhiking journey consumed the next 13 years of his life as he travelled among various part-time jobs while writing songs on his guitar, singing for his supper. He worked in mines and rode in boxcars, and in the coldest part of winter he welcomed vagrancy arrests for the warm place to sleep. At his last stop in Timmins, Ontario, he found himself a nickel short of a 35-cent beer at the city&#x27;s Maple Leaf Hotel. Connors told the bartender to put the cap back on the bottle and he&#x27;d head for the Sally Ann, but the bartender, Gaëtan Lepine, accepted the 30 cents and offered him a second beer if he would open his guitar case and play a few songs. These few songs turned into a 14-month run at the hotel, a weekly spot on CKGB in Timmins, eight 45-RPM recordings, and the end of the beginning for Tom Connors.

==Musical career==
Connors was never part of the Canadian musical establishment, and his style was quite different from other Canadian icons such as Leonard Cohen or Gordon Lightfoot. He could, however, be characterized as a passionist poet within Canadian culture, similar to Milton Acorn and Stan Rogers. As the &quot;National Post&quot; characterized him:

Typically writing about Canadian lore and history, some of Connors&#x27; better-known songs include &quot;Bud the Spud&quot;, &quot;Big Joe Mufferaw&quot;, &quot;The Black Donnellys&quot;, &quot;The Martin Hartwell Story&quot;, &quot;Reesor Crossing Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot;, and &quot;The Hockey Song&quot;. This last, often incorrectly called &quot;The Good Old Hockey Game,&quot; is frequently played over sound systems at National Hockey League (NHL) games.

Throughout the years, Connors never lost touch with Gaëtan Lepine, the bartender he befriended in Timmins; in fact, the two wrote many songs together. These songs are featured in &quot;250 Songs by Stompin&#x27; Tom: Including All the Words and Chords&quot;.

In 1968, he composed and sang a radio jingle for a Sudbury-area tire store, Duhamel &amp; Dewar, in exchange for a set of winter tires:&quot;When your tires are old and worn

and you think they should be newer,

drive on down to the Tire Town

and see Duhamel and Dewar.&quot;During the mid-1970s Connors wrote and recorded &quot;The Consumer&quot;, an ode to bill-paying that became the theme song for the popular Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) consumer affairs program &quot;Marketplace&quot;. For the first few seasons, Connors appeared in the program&#x27;s opening credits, before &quot;The Consumer&quot; was replaced as the theme—initially by an instrumental background version and ultimately by a different piece of music.

In 1974 Connors had a series running on CBC Television in which he met and exchanged with folks from all across Canada. &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom&#x27;s Canada&quot; was co-produced with the CBC, and consisted of 26 half-hour episodes.

The song that Connors wrote in the least time was &quot;Maritime Waltz&quot;, which was completed in 12 minutes.

His character was rough but genuine. As the &quot;National Post&quot; noted:

In 1999, after completing a 38-city tour, Connors received the National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards held in Toronto.

In 2009, Connors was the recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

===Nickname===
Connors&#x27; habit of stomping the heel of his left boot to keep rhythm earned him the nickname &quot;that stompin&#x27; guy&quot;, or &quot;Stomper&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t until Canada&#x27;s 100th birthday, July 1, 1967, that the name &quot;Stompin&quot; Tom Connors was first used, when Boyd MacDonald, a waiter at the King George Tavern in Peterborough, Ontario, introduced Connors on stage. Based on an enthused audience reaction to it, Connors had it officially registered in Ontario as Stompin&#x27; Tom Ltd. the following week. Various stories have circulated about the origin of the foot stomping, but it&#x27;s generally accepted that he did this to keep a strong tempo for his guitar playing—especially in the noisy bars and beer joints where he frequently performed. After numerous complaints about damaged stage floors, Connors began to carry a piece of plywood that he stomped even more vigorously than before. The &quot;&quot;stompin&quot; board became one of his trademarks. After stomping a hole in the wood, he would pick it up and show it to the audience (accompanied by a joke about the quality of the local lumber) before calling for a new one. It was reported that when asked about his &quot;stompin&#x27; board&quot;, Connors replied, &quot;it&#x27;s just a stage I&#x27;m going through&quot;. Connors periodically auctioned off his &quot;stompin&#x27; boards&quot; for charity, with one board selling for $15,000 in July 2011.

===Favourite guitar===
Connors&#x27;s favourite guitar was a Gibson Southern Jumbo acoustic that he purchased in 1956 while on his way through Ohio to Nashville, Tennessee, and Mexico. He discovered it in a furniture store, hidden in a case on top of a shelf and, after some haggling, purchased it for $80 (he had $90 with him). The guitar was used to audition in 1964 at the Maple Leaf Hotel in Timmins, as well as for writing &quot;Bud the Spud&quot; four years later. Although retired in 1972, it remained in his possession. It has subsequently been refurbished, a birthday gift from his wife Lena. The serial number inside the guitar reads 2222 in red stamped numbers and the actual age of the guitar is still unknown.

===Releases===
Connors released music on seven different labels. His earliest foray into recording was on the CKGB Timmins radio station label. These 45 RPM singles were pressed by Quality Records in Toronto, and distributed (and paid for) primarily by Tom. His first two albums (and two subsequent 45 RPM singles) were released on the Rebel Records bluegrass label, under the name &quot;Tom Connors&quot;. These two albums were subsequently re-released on Dominion Records under the Stompin&#x27; Tom moniker and had to be totally re-recorded due to a dispute with Rebel Records owner John Irvine.

Most of Connors&#x27;s well-known albums were released on Dominion Records (1969–70), and after 1971 on the Boot Records label that he co-founded with Jury Krytiuk and Mark Altman. His releases on Dominion (and all subsequent releases) were done under the name &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors&quot;. Most of the Rebel and Dominion albums would be reissued (and in some cases, re-recorded) under the Boot label, and would represent the bulk of his recorded material. It was released on 33 RPM record albums, 45 RPM record singles, 8-tracks, and cassette tapes.

After his retreat from the music business in the late 1970s, he started the A-C-T (Assisting Canadian Talent) label in 1986, and released two albums: &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom is Back to Assist Canadian Talent&quot; and his comeback album, &quot;Fiddle and Songs&quot; in 1988. A-C-T also re-released Connors&#x27;s back catalogue on cassette tapes only.

All of his subsequent releases (and re-releases) have been through Capitol Records / EMI. Most of this work is now available on Compact Disc. In recent years, many of his album releases have included at least one re-recording of one of his earlier songs.

===Promoting Canadian artists===
Connors founded three record labels, which promoted not just his own work, but that of other Canadian artists:
* Boot Records, together with its budget label Cynda, which were active in the 1970s and 1980s
* A-C-T, active from the late 1980s

Among artists who were featured on these labels were Liona Boyd, Rita MacNeil, The Canadian Brass, Dixie Flyers, Charlie Panigoniak, among others. Liona Boyd recalled in 2013 about the time Connors signed Boyd to Boot for her first record, 1974&#x27;s &quot;The Guitar&quot;, and two more:

===Cultural and historical references===
In the book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda&quot;, Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian general who led the UNAMIR peacekeeping force in Rwanda during that country&#x27;s 1994 genocide reported that he played a recording of Connors&#x27;s song &quot;The Blue Berets&quot; (about United Nations peacekeeping forces) to keep up his troops&#x27; morale while their headquarters was under bombardment.

The Les Claypool Frog Brigade mentions Connors in the song &quot;Long in the Tooth&quot; on the album &quot;Purple Onion&quot;, while Corb Lund references him in the song &quot;Long Gone to Saskatchewan&quot; and Dean Brody references him in the song &quot;Canadian Girls&quot;.

Tim Hus also wrote a song titled &quot;Man with the Black Hat&quot; about Connors.

===Songs referencing Canadian historical events===
The following is a list of events in the history of Canada which have been the subject of a song by Connors, who is widely renowned for singing about both well-known and little-known episodes in the country&#x27;s past.

==Personal life==

Connors married Lena Welsh on November 2, 1973. The ceremony was broadcast live on &quot;Elwood Glover&#x27;s Luncheon Date&quot; on CBC Television. During an interview on the show, he said they had chosen to get married on television to share this happy moment with his fans across the country whose support had rescued him from a difficult pre-showbusiness life.
Connors had a son, Taw Connors. He also had another son, Tom Jr.

Connors was a heavy smoker—estimated to consume 100 cigarettes a day—and an equally heavy drinker. On tour, he had to drive the lead truck, and could never be the last person to go to bed, and that often meant that his fellow musicians had to keep up with his pace.

Connors always wore his black Stetson in public, and refused to remove it for any reason, even when meeting Queen Elizabeth II at a dinner in Ottawa in October 2002. Buckingham Palace smoothed the way by likening Mr. Connors&#x27;s hat to a religious headdress such as a nun&#x27;s habit or a Sikh&#x27;s turban. However, Connors did go hatless during his nationally-televised wedding on CBC-TV to Lena Welsh.

===Retirement and nationalist protest===
As the 1970s progressed, he retired to his farm at Ballinafad, near Erin, Ontario, to protest the lack of support given to Canadian stories by the policies of the Federal government, particularly the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). He also boycotted the Juno Awards in protest of the qualification guidelines set by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) for possible nominees who were being consistently nominated and awarded outside of their musical genre. He strongly opposed artists who conducted most of their business in the United States being nominated for Junos in Canada. Connors, who referred to these particular artists as &quot;turncoat Canadians&quot;, felt that, since they had chosen to live and work in the U.S., it was only fair that they competed with Americans for Grammy Awards, and left the Juno competition to those who lived and conducted business in Canada.

His protest caught national attention when he sent back his six Junos accompanied by a letter to the board of directors.

He remained in retirement for 12 years, only returning to the studio in 1986 to produce a new album to promote Canadian artists. That year, Tim Vesely and Dave Bidini of Rheostatics crashed his 50th birthday party and published an article about it in a Toronto newspaper, initiating a resurgence of public and record label interest in his work which resulted in the release in 1988 of &quot;Fiddle and Song&quot;, his first new album since 1977.

===Guest of honour on &quot;Late Night&quot;===
Connors&#x27; music is rarely heard outside Canada, with the possible exception of his anthemic &quot;The Hockey Song&quot; which has been recorded by many artists and played regularly within the arenas of the National Hockey League. It has been suggested that Connors refused to allow foreign release of his material, although a more likely reason is that the very Canadian-specific subject matter of many of his folk songs has resulted in limited demand in foreign markets. When &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; taped a week&#x27;s worth of shows in Canada in 2004, Connors was one of the guests of honour, leading the Toronto audience in a rendition of &quot;The Hockey Song&quot;; this was one of the few times Connors performed on American television. Another Canadian-taped installment of &quot;Late Night&quot; featured a segment in which Triumph the Insult Comic Dog visited Quebec; a parody of Connors&#x27; &quot;Canada Day, Up Canada Way&quot; is heard during the segment.

===Dispute with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation===
According to Connors&#x27; promoter, Brian Edwards, the CBC had expressed interest for Connors to do a music special since 1990. Connors shot and edited a live concert presentation at Hamilton Place at a cost of over $200,000 of his own money in September 2005. Edwards said that a copy was presented to the CBC&#x27;s head of TV variety and that he received a reply the next day telling him that a decision would be reached within a few weeks. After 10 weeks, another email was then sent to the newly appointed programming VP, and a prompt reply came back that said that the broadcaster was moving away from music and variety programming and that the Connors special did not fit with its strategy.

Edwards said that he received another letter from the CBC that reinforced its lack of interest in the concert special but said that Connors would have been a great guest to perform a song on the network&#x27;s &quot;Hockeyville&quot; series or an excellent subject for a &quot;Life and Times&quot; project. In response, Connors said:

Ultimately, the film was released on DVD as &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom In Concert&quot; by EMI in 2006. The soundtrack was released posthumously on CD at the same time as a DVD &amp; Blue Ray re-issue by Universal Music Canada in 2014.

===Autobiography===
&quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom: Before the Fame&quot; is an autobiography detailing Connors&#x27; childhood years in an orphanage, and as a farm labourer. It was a runner-up for the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction in 1996 and became a bestseller in 1997. It details his life before becoming famous. In 2000 Connors wrote his second autobiography &quot;The Connors Tone&quot;.

===Death and memorial service===
Connors died of kidney failure on March 6, 2013, at his home in Ballinafad. He refused to seek medical treatment, as he was skeptical of the benefits of medical technology. On March 7, flags were lowered to half-mast at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, and also in Tillsonburg, to mark his death. On March 9, that following Saturday night, &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; broadcast a special tribute to Connors at the opening of its broadcast.

Immediately after his death, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted:

In a 1995 interview, Mr. Connors offered the opinion that nobody should die happy:

On March 7, several members of the federal New Democratic Party caucus, led by former musicians Charlie Angus and Andrew Cash, performed a group rendition of Connors&#x27; signature song &quot;Bud the Spud&quot; in the foyer of the House of Commons of Canada in tribute.

In addition to reports and obituaries published in the Canadian media, his death was also reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, BBC News and the Xinhua News Agency.

A memorial was held on March 13, 2013, at the Peterborough Memorial Centre in Peterborough, Ontario. Tommy Hunter attended, and the celebration included speeches by former governor general Adrienne Clarkson and Ken Dryden. Testimonials were given or read from others, including Roméo Dallaire, Rita MacNeil and Liona Boyd. Before his death, Connors had personally selected the artists who would perform:

At the end of the service, before &quot;Sudbury Saturday Night&quot; was played, Tom Connors, Jr., spoke about his father, and looked to the future:

He was subsequently buried at Erin Union Cemetery in Erin, Ontario. The headstone contains these words:

Connors was also the subject of a video tribute at the 2013 East Coast Music Awards on March 10.

==Honours==
The following honours were conferred on him:
* From the Juno Awards, Country Male Vocalist of the Year (1971–1975) and Country Album of the Year (1974, for &quot;To It And at It&quot;)—all subsequently returned in 1978. He left instructions that the Junos were not to celebrate him after his death.
* In 1993, a Doctor of Laws degree &quot;honoris causa&quot; from St. Thomas University, which was the inspiration for his album titled &quot;Dr. Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors, eh?&quot;, released the same year.

In 1993, he declined to be inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame.

In &quot;The Greatest Canadian&quot; list, he ranked thirteenth, the highest placing for any artist on the list. Connors was one of four musicians pictured on the second series of the Canadian Recording Artist Series issued by Canada Post stamps on July 2, 2009.

<text>In the study of history as an academic discipline, a primary source (also called an original source) is an artifact, document, diary, manuscript, autobiography, recording, or any other source of information that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in library science and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions.

In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.

Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit of hindsight are secondary. A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used. For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about their friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.

==Significance of source classification==

===History===
In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability. In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that &quot;if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.&quot; Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they &quot;speak for themselves&quot; in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources.

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. Though the terms &quot;primary source&quot; and &quot;secondary source&quot; originated in historiography as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements, and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In scientific literature, a primary source, or the &quot;primary literature&quot;, is the original publication of a scientist&#x27;s new data, results, and theories. In political history, primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns, and eyewitness accounts. In the history of ideas or intellectual history, the main primary sources are books, essays, and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In religious history, the primary sources are religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals.

A study of cultural history could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take archaeological artifacts and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.
* Narrative sources or literary sources tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include diaries, films, biographies, leading philosophical works, and scientific works.
* Diplomatic sources include charters and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
* Social documents are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian&#x27;s publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.

The Lafayette College Library provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.
* In the humanities, a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
* In the social sciences, the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
* In the natural sciences, a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results.

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in archives, libraries, museums, historical societies, and special collections. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be located in many different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the Huntington Library in California houses many documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The Library of Congress maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are American Memory and Chronicling America. The National Archives and Records Administration also has digital collections in Digital Vaults. The Digital Public Library of America searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The Internet Archive also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the National Archives provides a consolidated search of its own catalog and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the National Archives of Scotland. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own online catalogs. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, Europeana has digitized materials from across Europe while the World Digital Library and Flickr Commons have items from all over the world. Trove has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or finding aid. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as WorldCat, the Library of Congress catalog, the National Archives catalog, and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles, and papers. Arthur Marwick says &quot;Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history.&quot; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice, some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be memoirs, autobiographies, or oral interviews that were taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in classical studies, where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of archives and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as a scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. &quot;Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous, and very difficult to analyze and interpret.&quot; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and &quot;if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.&quot; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.
However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be bias and tacit unconscious views that twist historical information.

The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to peer review, can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author&#x27;s career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and objectivity of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a journal entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual&#x27;s opinion on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and eyewitnesses may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate. For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias. As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be censored or altered for propaganda or cover-up purposes. The facts can be distorted to present the opposing sides in a negative light. Barristers are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined. Moreover, the distinction between &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered &quot;primary&quot;, since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered &quot;secondary&quot;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the &quot;primary source&quot; may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called diplomatics.

For centuries, popes used the forged Donation of Constantine to bolster the Papacy&#x27;s secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false Anglo-Saxon charters, a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by monasteries and abbeys to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by Sir Edward Dering, who placed false monumental brasses in a parish church. In 1986, Hugh Trevor-Roper authenticated the Hitler Diaries, which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the UK National Archives in the hope of establishing a false provenance. However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.

<doc id="177892" wikidata="Q12016" url="?curid=177892" title="The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)">
<text>The Four Seasons () is a group of four violin concerti by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi, each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year. These were composed around 1718–1720, when Vivaldi was the court chapel master in Mantua. They were published in 1725 in Amsterdam, together with eight additional concerti, as (&quot;The Contest Between Harmony and Invention&quot;).

&quot;The Four Seasons&quot; is the best known of Vivaldi&#x27;s works. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, &quot;Spring&quot;, borrows patterns from a sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi&#x27;s contemporaneous opera &quot;Il Giustino&quot;. The inspiration for the concertos is not the countryside around Mantua, as initially supposed, where Vivaldi was living at the time, since according to Karl Heller they could have been written as early as 1716–1717, while Vivaldi was engaged with the court of Mantua only in 1718.

They were a revolution in musical conception: Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), a shepherd and his barking dog, buzzing flies, storms, drunken dancers, hunting parties from both the hunters&#x27; and the prey&#x27;s point of view, frozen landscapes, and warm winter fires.

Unusual for the period, Vivaldi published the concerti with accompanying sonnets (possibly written by the composer himself) that elucidated what it was in the spirit of each season that his music was intended to evoke. The concerti therefore stand as one of the earliest and most detailed examples of what would come to be called program music—in other words, music with a narrative element. Vivaldi took great pains to relate his music to the texts of the poems, translating the poetic lines themselves directly into the music on the page. For example, in the middle section of &quot;Spring&quot;, when the goatherd sleeps, his barking dog can be heard in the viola section. The music is elsewhere similarly evocative of other natural sounds. Vivaldi divided each concerto into three movements (fast–slow–fast), and, likewise, each linked sonnet into three sections.

==Structure==
Vivaldi&#x27;s arrangement is as follows:

# Concerto No. 1 in E major, Op. 8, RV 269, &quot;Spring&quot; (&quot;La primavera&quot;)
# Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 8, RV 315, &quot;Summer&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;estate&quot;)
# Concerto No. 3 in F major, Op. 8, RV 293, &quot;Autumn&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;autunno&quot;)
# Concerto No. 4 in F minor, Op. 8, RV 297, &quot;Winter&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;inverno&quot;)
A performance of all four concerti may take about 40–43 minutes. Approximate timings of the individual concerti:
# Spring: 10 minutes
# Summer: 11 minutes
# Autumn: 11 minutes
# Winter: 9 minutes

==Sonnets and allusions==

There is some debate as to whether the four &quot;concerti&quot; were written to accompany four sonnets or vice versa. Though it is not known who wrote the accompanying sonnets, the theory that Vivaldi wrote them is supported by the fact that each sonnet is broken into three sections, each neatly corresponding to a movement in the concerto. Regardless of the sonnets&#x27; authorship, &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; can be classified as program music, instrumental music intended to evoke something extra-musical, and an art form which Vivaldi was determined to prove sophisticated enough to be taken seriously.

In addition to these sonnets, Vivaldi provided instructions such as &quot;The barking dog&quot; (in the second movement of &quot;Spring&quot;), &quot;Languor caused by the heat&quot; (in the first movement of &quot;Summer&quot;), and &quot;the drunkards have fallen asleep&quot; (in the second movement of &quot;Autumn&quot;).

A new translation of the sonnets into English by Armand D&#x27;Angour was published in 2019.

==Recording history==

The date and personnel on the first recording of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; are disputed. There is a compact disc of a recording made by the violinist Alfredo Campoli taken from acetates of a French radio broadcast; these are thought to date from early in 1939. The first proper electrical recording was made in 1942 by Bernardino Molinari; though his is a somewhat different interpretation from modern performances, it is clearly recognisable as &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;. Molinari&#x27;s recording was made for Cetra, and was issued in Italy and subsequently in the United States on six double-sided 78s, in the 1940s. It was then reissued on long-playing album in 1950, and, later, on compact disc.

The first American recording was made in the final week of 1947 by the violinist Louis Kaufman. The recording was made at Carnegie Hall in advance of a scheduled recording ban effective 1 January 1948. The performers were The Concert Hall Chamber Orchestra under Henry Swoboda, Edith Weiss-Mann (harpsichord) and Edouard Nies-Berger (organ). This recording helped the re-popularisation of Vivaldi&#x27;s music in the mainstream repertoire of Europe and America following on the work done by Molinari and others in Italy. It won the French Grand Prix du Disque in 1950, was elected to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002, and was selected the following year for the National Recording Registry in the Library of Congress. Kaufman, intrigued to learn that the four concertos were in fact part of a set of twelve, set about finding a full score and eventually recorded the other eight concertos in Zürich in 1950, making his the first recording of Vivaldi&#x27;s complete Op. 8.

The ensemble I Musici has recorded &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; probably more often than any other established musical group to date: The debut recording in 1955 with Felix Ayo; again with Ayo in 1959, this time in stereo — the very first stereo recording of the work; subsequent recordings featuring Roberto Michelucci (1969), the highly acclaimed 1982 recording with Pina Carmirelli, Federico Agostini (1988), Mariana Sîrbu (1995), Antonio Anselmi (2012) and Marco Fiorini (2021). There is also a video recording of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; performed by I Musici in Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s hometown of Venice, filmed by Anton van Munster in 1988.

The 1969 Argo recording by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields conducted by Neville Marriner and featuring the soloist Alan Loveday sold over half a million copies; it became the ensemble&#x27;s first gold record.

I Solisti di Zagreb, under the baton of Antonio Janigro with Jan Tomasow as violin soloist and Anton Heiller on harpsichord, followed in 1957 on the Vanguard label, further reissued under the Philips and other labels. Wilfrid Mellers, an English music critic, musicologist and composer wrote of this performance, &quot;the soloists phrase their lyricism beautifully.&quot; John Thornton wrote about this recording, &quot;Here is matchless ensemble playing, topped by Tomasow&#x27;s secure playing. Janigro reveals his talent for conducting, which competes with his considerable talent for cello playing.&quot;

Ivan Supek wrote of this recording:

Paul Shoemaker wrote about this recording:

Nigel Kennedy&#x27;s 1989 recording of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; with the English Chamber Orchestra sold over copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling classical works ever. The marketing of Kennedy&#x27;s record was described as &quot;the first time that a classical artist had been given the full pop marketing treatment&quot;, with a promotional single, and advertisements on billboards, TV and radio.

Gil Shaham and the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra recorded &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; as well as a music video for the first movement of &quot;Winter&quot; that was featured regularly on The Weather Channel in the mid-1990s.

Surround sound versions of the piece have been issued on Super Audio CD by Richard Tognetti, Pinchas Zukerman, Jonathan Carney and Rachel Podger.

&quot;The World&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Recorded Music&quot; in 1952 cites only two recordings of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; – by Molinari and Kaufman. , approximately 1,000 recorded versions have been made since Campoli&#x27;s in 1939.

In 2009, all four concertos were arranged for piano by pianist Jeffrey Biegel.

In 2023, Gramophone Magazine named La Serenissima&#x27;s recording of the Manchester version of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; as &quot;potentially the most streamed interpretation ever.&quot; with over 165 million streams on Spotify alone.

Classical musicians have sought to distinguish their recordings of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, with historically informed performances, and embellishments, to the point of varying the instruments and tempi, or playing notes differently from the listener&#x27;s expectation (whether specified by the composer or not). It is said that Vivaldi&#x27;s work presents such opportunities for improvisation. Many period-based ensembles have recorded &quot;The Four Seasons,&quot; including La Serenissima under the direction of Adrian Chandler who recorded the Manchester version of &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, The English Concert under the direction of Trevor Pinnock, the Academy of Ancient Music under the direction of Christopher Hogwood and Europa Galante under the direction of Fabio Biondi.

==Reception==
The Four Seasons was voted #67 in the Classic FM Hall of Fame. Three of the four concerti were included in the Classic 100 Concerto listing.

==Derivative works==
Derivative works of these concerti include arrangements, transcriptions, covers, remixes, samples, and parodies in music — themes in theater and opera, soundtracks in films (or video games), and choreography in ballet (along with contemporary dance, figure skating, rhythmic gymnastics, synchronized swimming, etc.) — either in their entirety, single movements, or medleys. Antonio Vivaldi appears to have started this trend of adapting music from &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, and since then it has expanded into many aspects of the performing arts (as have other instrumental &amp; vocal works by the composer). This &quot;contest between harmony and invention&quot; (as it were) now involves various genres around the world:

;1726 (or 1734)
* Vivaldi re-scored the &quot;Allegro&quot; movement from the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto, both as the opening sinfonia (third movement), and chorus (adding lyrics) for his opera &quot;Dorilla in Tempe&quot;.
* J. S. Bach used the theme of the first movement of the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto for the third movement (&quot;aria&quot;) of his cantata &quot;Wer weiß, wie nahe mir mein Ende?&quot; (BWV 27).

;1727 (or 1730, 1731)
* Vivaldi based his setting of &quot;Gelido in ogni vena&quot;, an aria from Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Siroe, re di Persia&quot; libretto, on the first movement of the &quot;Winter&quot; concerto. Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Siroe&quot;, containing an aria on this text, premiered in 1727 (music lost). An aria on the &quot;Gelido in ogni vena&quot; text also appeared in his 1730 &quot;Argippo&quot; (music lost). In 1731, he inserted the extant version of this aria in his &quot;Farnace&quot; when this opera was restaged in Pavia.

;1739
* Nicolas Chédeville (France) arranged the concerti (as &quot;Le printemps, ou Les saisons amusantes&quot;) for hurdy-gurdy or musette, violin, flute, and continuo.

;1765
* The French composer Michel Corrette composed and published a choral motet, &quot;Laudate Dominum de Coelis&quot;, subtitled &quot;Motet à Grand Chœur arrangé dans le Concerto de Printemps de Vivaldi&quot;. The work, for choir and orchestra, consists of the words of Psalm 148 set to the music from the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto with vocal soloists singing the solo concerto parts.

;1775
* Jean-Jacques Rousseau published his flute version of the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto.

;1969
* The Swingle Singers (France) recorded an album (&quot;The Joy of Singing&quot;) based on the work (and that of other composers).

;1970
* Astor Piazzolla (Argentina) published &quot;Estaciones Porteñas&quot;, &quot;The Four Seasons of Buenos Aires&quot;; these have been included in &quot;eight seasons&quot; performances, along with Vivaldi&#x27;s work, by various artists.

;1972
* Moe Koffman (Canada) recorded a jazz album of the concerti.

;1976
* The New Koto Ensemble (Japan) recorded the concerti on koto instruments.

;1978
* Michael Franks (United States) composed a vocal serenade based on the theme of the Adagio from the &quot;Summer&quot; concerto. This was subsequently covered by WoongSan (Korea) in 2010.

;1981
* &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; is used in the eponymous 1981 film, along with other Vivaldi concertos for flute.

;1982
* Patrick Gleeson (United States) recorded a &quot;computer realization&quot; of the concerti.

;1984
* Thomas Wilbrandt (West Germany) composed and recorded &quot;The Electric V&quot; (later adapted for film), which interprets Vivaldi&#x27;s work with ambient electronics, vocals, and samples of the original concerti.
* Roland Petit (France) choreographed a ballet (entitled &quot;Les Quatre Saisons&quot;) to an I Musici performance of Vivaldi&#x27;s work.

;1987
* Ben Shedd (United States) produced a scenic tour of nature with the concerti as background music (narrated by William Shatner).

;1990
* A MIDI arrangement of the &quot;Spring&quot; concerto by Passport Designs was included with Windows 3.0.

;1993
* Jean-Pierre Rampal (France) recorded arrangements of the concerti for flute; these were also recorded by Jadwiga Kotnowska.

;1995
* Arnie Roth (United States) recorded &quot;The Four Seasons Suite&quot;, including sonnets (recited by Patrick Stewart). This may not qualify as a derivative work, depending on whether Vivaldi&#x27;s translated sonnets were meant to be narrated with the music (versus being read in Italian, or silently by the audience).

;1997
* The Baronics (Canada) recorded surf guitar versions of one movement from each of the concerti.
* French musician Jacques Loussier composed and recorded, with his trio, jazz-swing interpretations of the concerti.

;1998
* The Great Kat (England/United States) recorded a shred guitar (and violin) version of the &quot;Presto&quot; movement from the &quot;Summer&quot; concerto.
* Vanessa-Mae (Singapore/Britain) recorded a crossover version of the same movement for electric violin.

;1999
* The Chinese Baroque Players recorded arrangements of the concerti for traditional Chinese instruments.
* Petrova &amp; Tikhonov (Russia) performed their long program to a medley of Vivaldi&#x27;s seasons to win the European Figure Skating Championships.

;2000
* Venice Harp Quartet (Italy) recorded arrangements of the concerti for harp ensemble.
* Gustavo Montesano (Argentina) recorded a tango guitar version of the &quot;Spring&quot; &quot;Allegro&quot; with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.
* Jochen Brusch (Germany) &amp; Sven-Ingvart Mikkelsen (Denmark) recorded arrangements of the concerti for violin and organ.

;2001
* Ferhan &amp; Ferzan Önder (Turkish twin sisters) recorded a transcription of the concerti for two pianos by Antun Tomislav Šaban.
* BanYa (South Korea) recorded a dance version of the &quot;Winter&quot; concerto for the &quot;Pump It Up&quot; video game.
* Susan Osborn (United States) recorded a new-age vocal serenade based on the &quot;Winter&quot; &quot;Largo&quot;.
* The Charades (Finland) recorded the &quot;Presto&quot; from the &quot;Summer&quot; concerto as &quot;Summer Twist&quot;, for surf guitar ensemble.

;2003

<text>Booderee National Park and Botanic Gardens, formerly Jervis Bay National Park and Jervis Bay Botanic Gardens, are located in the Jervis Bay Territory of Australia. The reserve is composed of two sections:
* the Bherwerre Peninsula, on the southern foreshore of Jervis Bay, Bowen Island and the waters of the south of the bay
* lands bordered by Wreck Bay to the south, St Georges Basin to the north and Sussex Inlet to the west

What is now a national park was declared as a nature reserve in 1971. In 1992, Jervis Bay National Park was declared. The local Aboriginal community was offered two seats on the park&#x27;s Board of Management and declined as part of a protest over land rights issues.

In 1995, the park was transferred to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community. At this time, the name of the park was changed to &quot;Booderee&quot;. The name, meaning &quot;bay of plenty&quot; or &quot;plenty of fish&quot; in the Dhurga language, was chosen by the local Aboriginal community. It is now co-managed with Parks Australia.

== History ==

In 1995, the park was transferred to the Wreck Bay Aboriginal Community, when the name was changed to &quot;Booderee&quot;. The name, meaning &quot;bay of plenty&quot; or &quot;plenty of fish&quot; in the Dhurga language, was chosen by the local Aboriginal community. It is now co-managed with Parks Australia. In 2010 the park won international award in the Virgin Holidays&#x27; Responsible Tourism Awards.

The lighthouse was built during the 19th century because of the number of the shipwrecks that happened nearby. Unfortunately, the lighthouse was built in the wrong spot and it came to be regarded as a navigational hazard.

==Description==
The park is managed as an Indigenous Protected Area.

The reserve is composed of two sections:
* The Bherwerre Peninsula, located on the southern foreshore of Jervis Bay;
* The lands bordered by Wreck Bay to the south.

There are hundreds of kilometres of walking tracks.

==Park highlights==

Cave Beach with its unspoiled beaches and abundant flora and fauna, the park, located just three hours from the cities of Sydney and Canberra, is extremely popular with tourists.

The park&#x27;s sea cliffs are the highest in New South Wales and among the highest anywhere on the east coast of
Australia, peaking at Steamers Head which rises to 130 m.

The Cape St George Lighthouse ruin is considered the most significant European heritage site in the park and was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1981.

The beach at Greenpatch is a popular destination, and is said to have the whitest sand in the world. In addition there are abundant surf breaks on the ocean sides of the Park, most notably South Coast Pipe.

Although not accessible to the public, a little penguin rookery exists on Bowen Island.

Murrays beach lies just to the west of the southern headland, facing Bowen Island and is one of the most beautiful in the park.

<text>The Hatter (called Hatta in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;) is a fictional character in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and its 1871 sequel &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. He is often referred to as the Mad Hatter, though this term was never used by Carroll. The phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot; pre-dates Carroll&#x27;s works. The Hatter and the March Hare are described as &quot;both &quot;mad&quot;&quot; by the Cheshire Cat, in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; in the sixth chapter titled &quot;Pig and Pepper&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;===
The Hatter character, alongside all the other fictional beings, first appears in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. In &quot;Chapter Seven – A Mad Tea-Party&quot;, while exploring Wonderland, Alice comes across the Hatter having tea with the March Hare and the Dormouse. 

The Hatter tells Alice how he once always had Time on his side, but explains that now they have argued – they are always having tea because when he tried to sing for the foul-tempered Queen of Hearts, she sentenced him to death for &quot;murdering the time&quot;, but he escapes decapitation. In retaliation, now Time (referred to as &quot;he&quot; by the Hatter) won&#x27;t do a thing for the Hatter, keeping him trapped at 6:00 pm (aka teatime).

When Alice arrives at the tea party, the Hatter is characterised by switching places on the table at any given time, making short, personal remarks, asking unanswerable riddles, and reciting nonsensical poetry, all of which eventually drives Alice away. The Hatter appears again in &quot;Chapter Eleven – Who Stole the Tarts?&quot;, as a witness at the Knave of Hearts&#x27; trial, where the Queen appears to recognise him as the singer she sentenced to death, and the King of Hearts also cautions him not to be nervous or he will have him &quot;executed on the spot&quot;.

===&quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;===
The character also appears briefly in Carroll&#x27;s 1871 &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. Under the name of &quot;Hatta,&quot; the Hatter was in trouble with the law once again. He was, however, not necessarily guilty, as the White Queen explained that subjects were often punished before they commit a crime, rather than after, and sometimes they did not even commit one at all. He was also mentioned as one of the White King&#x27;s messengers along with March Hare, who went under the name of &quot;Haigha.&quot; Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s illustration depicts Hatta as sipping from a teacup as he did in the original novel. Alice does not comment on whether Hatta is the Hatter of her earlier dream.

==Characterization==
===Etymology===
Mercury was used in the manufacturing of felt hats during the 19th century, causing a high rate of mercury poisoning among those working in the hat industry. Mercury poisoning causes neurological damage, including slurred speech, memory loss, and tremors, which led to the phrase &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;. In the Victorian age, many workers in the textile industry, including hatters, sometimes developed illnesses affecting the nervous system, such as central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis, which is portrayed in novels like &quot;Alton Locke&quot; by Charles Kingsley and &quot;North and South&quot; by Elizabeth Gaskell, which Lewis Carroll had read. Many such workers were sent to Pauper Lunatic Asylums, which were supervised by Lunacy Commissioners such as Samuel Gaskell and Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge, Carroll&#x27;s uncle. Carroll was familiar with the conditions at asylums and visited at least one, the Surrey County Asylum, himself, which treated patients with so-called non-restraint methods and occupied them, amongst others, in gardening, farming and hat-making. Besides staging theatre plays, dances and other amusements, such asylums also held tea-parties.

===Appearance===
Although, during the trial of the Knave of Hearts, the King of Hearts remarks upon the Hatter&#x27;s headgear, Carroll does not describe the exact style of hat he wears. The character&#x27;s signature top hat comes from John Tenniel&#x27;s illustrations for the first edition, in which the character wears a large top hat with a hatband reading &quot;In this style 10/6&quot;. This is further elaborated on in &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;, a shortened version of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, adapted by the author himself for young children. Here it is stated that the character is wearing a hat on his head with a price tag containing the numbers 10 and 6, giving the price in pre-decimal British money as ten shillings and six pence (or half a guinea).

===Personality===

The Hatter and his tea party friend, the March Hare, are initially referred to as &quot;both mad&quot; by the distinctive Cheshire Cat. The first mention of both characters occurs in the sixth chapter of Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, titled &quot;Pig and Pepper&quot;, in a conversation between the child protagonist Alice and the Cheshire Cat, when she asks &quot;what sort of people live about here?&quot; to which the cat replies &quot;in &quot;that&quot; direction lives a Hatter, and in &quot;that&quot; direction, lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they&#x27;re both mad!&quot; Both then subsequently make their actual debuts in the seventh chapter of the same book, which is titled &quot;A Mad Tea-Party&quot;. Alice elects to visit the March Hare (reasoning he may be less mad as it is May) but of course meets both at the Tea Party.

Hat making was the main trade in Stockport where Carroll grew up, and it was not unusual then for hatters to appear disturbed or confused; many died early as a result of mercury poisoning. However, the Hatter does not exhibit the symptoms of mercury poisoning, which include excessive timidity, diffidence, increasing shyness, loss of self-confidence, anxiety, and a desire to remain unobserved and unobtrusive.

===Resemblance to Theophilus Carter===
It has often been claimed that the Hatter&#x27;s character may have been inspired by Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer. Carter was supposedly at one time a servitor at Christ Church, one of the University of Oxford&#x27;s colleges. This is not substantiated by university records. He later owned a furniture shop, and became known as the &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; from his habit of standing in the door of his shop wearing a top hat. Sir John Tenniel is reported to have come to Oxford especially to sketch him for his illustrations. There is no evidence for this claim, however, in either Carroll&#x27;s letters or diaries.

==Riddle==
In the chapter &quot;A Mad Tea Party&quot;, the Hatter asks a much-noted riddle: &quot;Why is a raven like a writing desk?&quot; When Alice gives up trying to figure out why, the Hatter admits &quot;I haven&#x27;t the slightest idea!&quot;. Carroll originally intended the riddle to be without an answer, but after many requests from readers, he and others—including puzzle expert Sam Loyd—suggested possible answers; in his preface to the 1896 edition of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, Carroll wrote:

Loyd proposed a number of alternative solutions to the riddle, including &quot;because Poe wrote on both&quot; (alluding to Poe&#x27;s 1845 narrative poem &quot;The Raven&quot;) and &quot;because the notes for which they are noted are not noted for being musical notes&quot;. The April 2017 edition of Bandersnatch, the Newsletter of the Lewis Carroll Society [Issue 172, , Apr 2017], published the following solution, proposed by puzzle expert Rick Hosburn: &quot;Why is a Raven like a Writing-desk?&quot; &quot;Because one is a crow with a bill, while the other is a bureau with a quill!&quot; The RSPB, in its definition of Raven, states: &quot;The raven [...] is all black with a large bill, and long wings.&quot; American author Stephen King provides an alternative answer to the Hatter&#x27;s riddle in his 1977 horror novel &quot;The Shining&quot;. Snowbound and isolated &quot;ten thousand feet high&quot; in the Rocky Mountains, five-year-old Danny hears whispers of the malign &quot;voice of the [Overlook] hotel&quot; inside his head, including this bit of mockery: &quot;Why is a raven like a writing desk? The higher the fewer, of course! Have another cup of tea!&quot;

Other proposed answers include; &quot;because one has flapping fits and the other fitting flaps&quot;; &quot;because one is good for writing books and the other better for biting rooks&quot;; and &quot;because a writing desk is a rest for pens and a raven is a pest for wrens&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Hatter has been featured in nearly every adaptation of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; to date; he is usually the male lead despite being a supporting character. The character has been portrayed in film by Norman Whitten, Edward Everett Horton, Sir Robert Helpmann, Martin Short, Peter Cook, Anthony Newley, Ed Wynn, Andrew-Lee Potts, and Johnny Depp. In music videos, the Hatter has been portrayed by Tom Petty, Dero Goi, and Steven Tyler. He has also been portrayed on stage by Nikki Snelson and Katherine Shindle, and on television by John Robert Hoffman, Pip Donaghy and Sebastian Stan. In ballet adaptations, Steven McRae also portrayed him as a mad &#x27;Tapper&#x27;. In March 2019, Chelsy Meiss became the first female soloist to play the Mad Hatter for the National Ballet of Canada.

===Films===

* In the 1951 Walt Disney animated feature &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the Hatter, referred to by others as &quot;The Mad Hatter&quot;, appears as a short, hyperactive man with grey hair, a large nose and a comical voice. He was voiced by Ed Wynn in 1951, and by Corey Burton in his later appearances (&quot;Bonkers&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;), while Alan Tudyk voices him in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;. Alice stumbles upon the Hatter and the March Hare having an &quot;un-birthday&quot; party for themselves. The Hatter asks her the infamous riddle &quot;why is a raven like a writing desk?&quot;, but when she tries to answer the Hatter and the March Hare think she is &quot;stark raving mad&quot; and the Hatter completely forgot that he asked her the riddle. Throughout the course of the film, the Hatter pulls numerous items out of his hat, such as cake and smaller hats. His personality is that of a child; angry one second, happy the next.
* The Hatter appears in Tim Burton&#x27;s 2010 version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; portrayed by Johnny Depp and given the name Tarrant Hightopp. In the film, the Hatter takes Alice toward the White Queen&#x27;s castle and relates the terror of the Red Queen&#x27;s reign while commenting that Alice is not the same as she once was. The Hatter subsequently helps Alice avoid capture by the Red Queen&#x27;s guards by allowing himself to be seized instead. He is later saved from execution by the Cheshire Cat and calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. Near the end of the film, the Hatter unsuccessfully suggests to Alice that she could stay in Wonderland and consummate his feelings for her. Critical reception to Johnny Depp&#x27;s portrayal of the Hatter was generally positive. David Edelstein of &quot;New York Magazine&quot; remarked that while the elements of the character suggested by Depp don&#x27;t entirely come together, &quot;Depp brings an infectious summer-stock zest to everything he does.&quot; Bill Goodykoontz of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; said that &quot;Depp is exactly what you&#x27;d expect, which is a good thing. Gap-toothed and leering, at times he looks like Madonna after sticking a fork in a toaster. How he finds his characters is anybody&#x27;s guess, a sort of thrift-store warehouse of eccentricities, it seems like. But it works.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; had a more mixed opinion and commented that Depp as the Hatter is &quot;a fantastic image, but once Depp opens his mouth, what comes out is a noisome Scottish brogue that makes everything he says sound more or less the same. The character offers no captivatingly skewed bat-house psychology. There isn&#x27;t much to him, really—he&#x27;s just a smiling Johnny one-note with a secret hip-hop dance move—and so we start to react to him the way that Alice does to everything else: by wondering when he&#x27;s going to stop making nonsense.&quot; Kenneth Turan of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;there&#x27;s no denying Depp&#x27;s gifts and abilities, but this performance feels both indulgent and something we&#x27;ve all seen before.&quot;
* The Hatter is played by Clarke Peters in the 2020 movie &quot;Come Away.&quot; He is depicted as the father of Captain Hook, the grandfather of Alice and Peter Pan, and the great-grandfather of Wendy Darling, John Darling, and Michael Darling.
* The Mad Hatter appears in the 2023 live-action/animated short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, voiced by Alan Tudyk.
* In 2025, The Mad Hatter will appear in &quot;Poohniverse: Monsters Assemble&quot; as a murderous version of himself, along with other characters from childhood fairytales.

===Television===
* Disney&#x27;s Mad Hatter was also a semi-regular on the Disney Afternoon series &quot;Bonkers&quot; and one of the guests in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, where he even made a cameo appearance in one of the featured cartoon shorts.
* The TV series &quot;Futurama&quot; has a robot named Mad Hatterbot who is based on the Hatter. Seen only in the HAL Institute (an asylum for criminally insane robots) the Mad Hatterbot only says one line: &quot;Change places!&quot;, which all in the room comply with when spoken. The price tag on his hat reads &quot;5/3&quot;, the same number as 10/6 presented with the numerator and the denominator each halved. A minor character, he has been in the episodes &quot;Insane in the Mainframe&quot; and &quot;Follow the Reader&quot; as well as the film &quot;&quot;.
* In Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot;, the Hatter (Andrew-Lee Potts) is portrayed as a smuggler who starts off working as a double agent for the Queen of Hearts and the Wonderland Resistance in the story; over the course of the story, he begins to side more and more with the Resistance, and ends up falling in love with Alice as he helps her along the way.
* In &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, the Mad Hatter is presented as possessing the unique ability to cross dimensions through his hat, and has a daughter, Grace, who lost her mother Priscilla as a result of a past deal with the Evil Queen. When the Queen offers him enough wealth to set his daughter up for life, he agrees to help her travel to Wonderland, but when it is revealed that the goal was for the Queen to retrieve her captured father, the Hatter is left trapped in Wonderland instead, as the portal will only allow two people to pass through it in either direction. Trapped in Wonderland, he was then driven mad as he attempted to find another way back to his world to reunite with his daughter. In the first season, trapped in the Land Without Magic, the Mad Hatter- now known as &#x27;Jefferson&#x27; as he lives in a mansion just on the outskirts of Storeybrooke- is one of the few who remembers his original life due to his insanity. His daughter has also been brought into Storeybrooke, but he has avoided making contact with her due to her new memories meaning that she would not recognise him. Unable to harness magic in this world, he attempts to recruit Emma to make a hat for him, but she is unable to harness her power, although Jefferson&#x27;s knowledge of the curse gives Emma further proof that Henry is telling the truth. Regina later recruits Jefferson to help her create a curse to use on Emma, but Regina&#x27;s efforts backfire and give Emma clear proof that the curse is real. In the second season, with the curse broken, Jefferson is eventually convinced to reunite with his daughter.
* In the Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Ever After High&quot; episode &quot;Spring Unsprung&quot;, the Mad Hatter makes an appearance as Madeline Hatter&#x27;s father. In the 47-minute special, he runs the Mad Hatter&#x27;s Tea Shoppe in the town of Bookend, not far from Maddie&#x27;s school Ever After High. He also runs a shop by the same name in Wonderland, but it was abandoned after the Evil Queen (Raven Queen&#x27;s mother) cast a curse upon the land.

===Video games===
* In the 2000 video game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, The Mad Hatter is portrayed as psychotic, literally gone &quot;mad&quot; and obsessed with time and clockworks, and considers himself to be a genius. He invents mechanical devices, often evidently using the bodies of living organisms for the base of his inventions, as he plans to do to all of Wonderland&#x27;s inhabitants. He appears in the 2011 sequel &quot;&quot; in the same appearance, although this time, he requests Alice&#x27;s help in retrieving his lost limbs from his former compatriots the March Hare and Dormouse. It is unknown on why the Hatter is obsessed with time, however it is implied that his insanity caused him to become delusional of eventually dying and began to worship Time (a unseen character from the novel) as some type of deity, including converting his entire body with cogs and gears as a way to live forever, especially turning the Wonderland inhabitants into machines as a supposed solution of &quot;saving&quot; their lives but of the cost of no freewill.
* Disney&#x27;s Mad Hatter makes a cameo appearance in a painting in the Tea Party Garden in the 2002 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and its 2009 sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;. He later made a physical appearance in the 2013 game &quot;Kingdom Hearts χ&quot;.
* The Mad Hatter appeared in the Sunsoft&#x27;s 2006 mobile game . The Mad Hatter is portrayed as a middle-school age boy in oversized clothes and a large hat that covers his whole head. Unlike most Wonderland residents, he acts rather bratty and rude to Ariko (the &quot;Alice&quot; of the game). In one of the bad endings, Mad Hatter is killed by a twisted Cheshire Cat.
* In &quot;Get Even&quot;, one of the asylum patients wearing the Pandora headsets dresses as the Hatter and has a tea party in his cell, he gives Cole Black a riddle to get the door open, there is a choice option to leave him in his room or set him free to which he&#x27;ll join the other inmates to kill Black, who they all believe is the &quot;Puppet Master&quot;.
* The Hatter takes on the role of narrator, guiding players through a detective quest based on Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland in Sherlock: Hidden Match-3 Cases, developed by G5 Entertainment in 2020.

===Music===
* The song &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; by an American garage rock band Shag was inspired by the character. It appeared on their self-titled album in 1969.
* Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s drawing of the Hatter, combined with a montage of other images from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, were used as a logo by Charisma Records from 1972 onwards.
* A Burton&#x27;s inspired Mad Hatter appears in &quot;The Man who became a Rabbit&quot; music video, an Indian version of Alice in Wonderland by Valérian MacRabbit and Lalkrishnan. Mad Hatter becomes Mac Hatter and gives one riddle to the main character : &quot;Spread blood on the birthday cake&quot;.
* The Mad Hatter&#x27;s name is used in Elton John&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters&quot;.
* The Mad Hatter is referenced to in the eponymous 2015 song by Melanie Martinez, next to a few other characters from Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.

===Live performance===
* In 1887, the Alice books were adapted for stage by Savile Clarke. Lewis Carol wrote a review he called &quot;&quot;Alice&quot; on the Stage&quot;. He singled out for praise &quot;the Hatter&quot; played by Sydney Harcourt (who also played Tweedledum), saying &quot;To see him enact the Hatter was a weird and uncanny thing, as though some grotesque monster, last seen in a dream, should walk into a room in broad daylight and quietly say &quot;Good Morning!&quot; I need not try to describe what I ment the Hatter to be, since, as far as I can now remember, it was exactly what Mr. Harcourt has now made him: and I may say nearly the same about Tweedledum: but the Hatter surprised me most-perhaps only because it came first in the play.&quot; 
* Disney&#x27;s Mad Hatter is a greetable character at the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort, Tokyo Disney Resort, Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.
* In &quot;Shrek The Musical&quot;, the Mad Hatter plays a small role as a fairytale creature (replacing the Gnome) and has two lines in songs including &quot;They ridiculed my hat&quot; and &quot;I smell like sauerkraut&quot;.
* Frank Wildhorn composed the music to and co-wrote the music to &quot;Wonderland: A New Alice&quot;. In this adaption the Hatter is portrayed as a female, the villain of the story, and Alice&#x27;s alter-ego and is a mad &quot;woman&quot; who longs to be Queen. She was played by Nikki Snelson in the original Tampa, Florida production, and then by Kate Shindle in the Tampa/Houston Tour, and the production on Broadway.
* In the 2015 Cbeebies Pantomime, the Mad Hatter (here just called the Hatter) is played by Andy Day, who got top male billing in promotional material. He first appears at the tea party, which is also attended by the March Hare, the Doormouse, the White Rabbit and Alice herself. They play the game and sing the song &quot;Ring Around the Table&quot;. He later appears at the Queen of Hearts&#x27; Garden Party where he competed in the Croquet game (alongside the Queen and the Duchess); he hit the hedgehog but missed the hoop.

===Comic strips and books===
* The Mad Hatter (also referred to as &quot;Jervis Tetch&quot;) is a supervillain and enemy of the Batman in DC comic books, making his first appearance in the October 1948 (#49) release of &quot;Batman&quot;. He is portrayed as a brilliant neurotechnician with considerable knowledge in how to dominate and control the human mind. Jervis had a obsession over Lewis Carroll&#x27;s books that he believes himself to be the reincarnation of the Mad Hatter, including making his henchmen wear outfits based on the Wonderland characters and kidnapping women and force them to dress and named them Alice.
* A spin-off of the traditional &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; story, Frank Beddor&#x27;s &quot;The Looking Glass Wars&quot; features a character named Hatter Madigan, a member of an elite group of bodyguards known in Wonderland as the &quot;Millinery&quot; after the business of selling women&#x27;s hats. He acts as the bodyguard of the rightful Queen, and as guide/guardian to the protagonist, Alyss Heart.
* The Mad Hatter in &quot;Pandora Hearts&quot; manga series is a chain (creature from the Abyss) that was contracted by Xerxes Break. The hatter basically looks like a large top hat with flowery decorations (similar to Break&#x27;s top hat) and a tattered cape. When summoned, it can destroy all chains and objects from the Abyss within a large area.
* The Japanese manga &quot;Alice in the Country of Hearts&quot; has been translated into English. The Hatter role is played by Blood Dupre, a crime boss and leader of a street gang called The Hatters, which controls one of the four territories of Wonderland.

<text>Waiting for the Sun is the third studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released by Elektra Records on July 3, 1968. The album&#x27;s 11 tracks were recorded between late 1967 and May 1968 mostly at TTG Studios in Los Angeles. It became the band&#x27;s only number one album, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four weeks, while also including their second US number one single, &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;. The first single released off the record was &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, which peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also became the band&#x27;s first hit album in the UK, where it reached number 16.

Having released two records that drew from a large pool of previously composed songs, the Doors started to improvise for their third album in late 1967. Due to the shortage of original material, the group suffered what drummer John Densmore described as the &quot;third album syndrome&quot;, meaning the difficulty of a band to have a stock of good compositions, capable of filling a third disc in a row. The recording sessions also proved difficult for the group due to lead singer Jim Morrison&#x27;s worsening alcoholism.

The album provoked mixed reactions upon release, with many deriding its diversity and songwriting quality as detriments and inconsistent. However, it has attracted more sympathetic appraisal for its mellower sound and experimentation with other genres. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release in 2018, a 1-LP/2-CD deluxe version of the album was released by Rhino Records. This was overseen by long-time Doors sound engineer Bruce Botnick.

==Background and recording==
The Doors started recording &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; in late 1967 at Sunset Sound Studios, with early versions of &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; and &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot;. The group soon moved at TTG Studios in Hollywood, California, where the majority of the album&#x27;s recording took place; the same time Frank Zappa was recording. The band had used up most of frontman Jim Morrison&#x27;s original songbook, a collection of lyrics and ideas, for their first two records. Consequently, following months of touring, interviews and television appearances, they had little new material. The band attempted to record a longer piece called &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; and intended the piece to occupy the second side of the album; this was later shelved. However, a recording of the &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; segment was included and the full lyrics to &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; were printed inside the album&#x27;s gatefold sleeve.
The removal of &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; drove the band to resort to composing many of the album tracks in the studio and digging up older songs that they had previously decided against recording, such as &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, to fill the gap of material. The production by Paul A. Rothchild led to multiple takes as a result of his growing perfectionism, which was becoming an issue for the group. Morrison&#x27;s increasing alcohol consumption also caused tension and difficulties in the studio, and at one point drummer John Densmore walked out of a session frustrated at his behavior. Alice Cooper was around during the recording sessions and he was reportedly worried about Morrison&#x27;s health. During the recording of &quot;Five to One&quot;, Morrison was in intense state of intoxication, to a degree that the studio&#x27;s assistants needed to support him to complete his vocal parts. Each song on the album required overall at least 20 takes with &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, recorded in two parts, requiring 130.

In her 1979 essay &quot;The White Album,&quot; Joan Didion described a day at Sunset Sound during the recording of the album. The mood is highly desultory, as Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore wait for an AWOL Morrison to arrive to lay down his vocals.

==Composition==
&quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; includes the band&#x27;s second chart topper, &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, one of the last remaining songs from Morrison&#x27;s 1965 batch of tunes. It had been demoed by the group for Aura Records in 1965 before guitarist Robby Krieger had joined the group, as had &quot;Summer&#x27;s Almost Gone&quot;. In the liner notes to &quot;The Doors: Box Set&quot;, Krieger denied the allegations that the song&#x27;s main riff and vocal melody were stolen from Ray Davies, with a similar riff having been featured in the Kinks&#x27; &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;. Instead, he said the song&#x27;s vibe was taken from Cream&#x27;s song &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. Densmore said that when recording the song, Krieger had advised him to imitate Ginger Baker&#x27;s drumming on &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;, and he followed that advice. The courts in the UK determined in favor of Davies and any UK-based royalties for the song were paid to him.

&quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; contains two songs with military themes: &quot;Five to One&quot; and &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. Journalists Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard speculate that &quot;Five to One&quot; seems to be a revolutionary anthem, spouted by the &quot;hippie/ flower child&quot; hordes Morrison saw in growing numbers. Regardless of this interpretation, Morrison confirmed that the lyrics were not political. The lines &quot;Night is drawing near/ Shadows of the evening/ crawl across the years&quot; may have been lifted by Morrison from the 19th-century hymnal and bedtime rhyme &quot;Now the Day is Over&quot; (&quot;Now the day is over/ Night is drawing nigh/ Shadows of the evening/ Steal across the sky&quot;).

&quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; exemplified the group&#x27;s cinematic approach to their music. In the beginning, as well as after the middle of the song, the mysterious sounds of the organ are heard, depicting the mystery of the &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot;. In the bridge, the Doors produced the sounds of a marching cadence. It begins with military drums, plus the sound of the sergeant counting off in 4 seconds (&quot;HUP, HUP, HUP, 2, 3, 4&quot;), until he shouts &quot;COMPANY! HALT! PRESENT! ARMS!&quot;, followed by the sounds of loading rifles and a long military drum roll, a pause and then rifle shots. After this middle section, the verses return, with Morrison, singing in a sadder tone to &quot;make a grave for the Unknown Soldier&quot;. The song ends with sounds of crowds cheering and bells tolling. The lyrics are generally viewed as Morrison&#x27;s reaction to the Vietnam War and the way that conflict was portrayed in American media at the time, with lines such as &quot;Breakfast where the news is read/ Television children fed/ Unborn living, living dead/ Bullets strike the helmet&#x27;s head&quot; reflecting how news of the war was being presented in the living rooms of ordinary people. The band also shot a promotional film for the single. 
The centerpiece of the album was supposed to be the lengthy theatrical piece &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot;, but in the end only the &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; section was used. In a 1969 interview with Jerry Hopkins for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Morrison said of the epic, &quot;It was pieced together on different occasions out of already existing elements rather than having any generative core from which it grew. I still think there&#x27;s hope for it.&quot; At the conclusion of &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot;, Morrison utters his iconic personal maxim, &quot;I am the Lizard King/ I can do anything.&quot; The opening lines of the song, &quot;Not to touch the earth/ not to see the sun&quot; were taken from the table of contents of &quot;The Golden Bough&quot;. Krieger&#x27;s skills with the flamenco guitar can be found on &quot;Spanish Caravan&quot;, with Granainas intro and a reworking of the melody from the classical piece Asturias (Leyenda) composed by Isaac Albéniz. The optimistic &quot;We Could Be So Good Together&quot; had been recorded during the sessions for &quot;Strange Days&quot;, even appearing on an early track listing. A review in &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; described the song as &quot;categorically pre-fame Morrison,&quot; pointing out that the line &quot;The time you wait subtracts from joy&quot; is the kind of hippie idealism the singer had long abandoned. It was issued as the B-side of the single &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; which peaked at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The single version quotes the opening theme from Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;Straight, No Chaser&quot;.

The whimsical &quot;Wintertime Love&quot; and the mournful &quot;Summer&#x27;s Almost Gone&quot; address seasonal themes, while the gentle &quot;Yes, the River Knows&quot; was written by Krieger. In the liner notes to the 1997 Doors retrospective &quot;Box Set&quot;, Manzarek praises the latter: &quot;The piano and guitar interplay is absolutely beautiful. I don&#x27;t think Robby and I ever played so sensitively together. It was the closest we ever came to being Bill Evans and Jim Hall.&quot; In the same essay, Manzarek refers to &quot;Summer&#x27;s Almost Gone&quot; as &quot;a cool Latino-Bolero kind of thing with a Bach-like bridge. It&#x27;s about the ephemeral nature of life. A season of joy and light and laughter is coming to an end.&quot; While recording &quot;My Wild Love&quot;, the band eventually gave up on the music and turned it into a work song by getting everyone in the studio to clap their hands, stamp their feet and chant in unison. Robby Krieger has cited &quot;My Wild Love&quot; as his least favorite Doors song, recalling that when a bodyguard said to him that his most-liked tune of the band is &quot;My Wild Love&quot;, Krieger responded: &quot;Oh shit, man, I hate that song&quot;. Morrison wrote &quot;Love Street&quot; for his girlfriend Pamela Courson and like all of his other songs about or dedicated to her, there was a hesitancy or biting refusal at the end (&quot;I guess I like it fine, so far&quot;).

==Releases==
&quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; was officially released on July 3, 1968, although some sources incorrectly noted on the day of 12. As of 2015, the album has sold over 7 million copies since its 1968 original release. Although &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; was not included on the original release of the album, a recording of the long piece was later included along with two early takes of &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot; as bonus tracks on the 40th anniversary expanded edition release of the album (subtitled &quot;An Experiment/Work in Progress&quot;).

===Reissues===
In 1988, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; was digitally remastered by sound engineer Bruce Botnick and Paul A. Rothchild at Digital Magnetics using the original master tapes. DCC Compact Classics reissued the album on 24kt gold CD in 1993 and on 180g vinyl in 1998, both versions were mastered by Steve Hoffman. It was remastered again in 1999 by Bernie Grundman and Botnick at Bernie Grundman Mastering for &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, using 96khz/24bit technology; it was also released as a standalone CD release. In 2006, the album was reissued on a CD/DVD set featuring both stereo and 5.1 remixes created by Botnick for the &quot;Perception&quot; box set. The 2006 stereo remix was also released on a standalone CD release in 2007 including five bonus tracks, mastered by Botnick at Uniteye. In 2009, it was reissued on 180g vinyl featuring the original mix; this edition was cut by Grundman. Analogue Productions also reissued the album on SACD and double 45 RPM vinyl, both editions were mastered by Doug Sax and Sangwook Nam at the Mastering Lab; the CD layer of the Super Audio CD contains the original stereo mix while the SACD layer contains Botnick&#x27;s 2006 5.1 surround mix.

In 2018, Rhino Records released a 1-LP/2-CD deluxe edition to commemorate the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary release, which was remastered by Botnick utilizing the Plangent Process. The CDs are encoded with MQA technology. The LP and first CD feature remastered versions of the same 11 tracks from the original 1968 release. The second CD features 14 previously unreleased tracks. The 50th anniversary edition omits the bonus tracks featured on the 40th anniversary edition and also features rough mixes of all the album&#x27;s tracks. Botnick recommended some of these versions, saying, &quot;I prefer some of these mixes as they represent all of the elements and additional background vocals and some intangible roughness, all quite attractive and refreshing.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Despite its commercial success, &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; divided critics and many derided it as pretentious and over-arranged. Journalist Mikal Gilmore noted that many criticisms were centered to the &quot;transparent commercial appeal&quot; of the album&#x27;s opener &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;, with &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; dismissing it as a &quot;jagged Kinks ripoff on which Morrison comes out like a rapist&quot;. Jim Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;After a year and a half of Jim Morrison&#x27;s posturing, one might logically hope for some sort of musical growth and if the new record isn&#x27;t really terrible, it isn&#x27;t particularly exciting either.&quot; Pete Johnson reviewing the record for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, wrote a positive review, remarking that &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; contains &quot;the smallest amount self-indulgent&quot; songs compared to the Doors previous albums. The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; declared &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; as the standout of side one and &quot;all on side two are gems, notably &#x27;My Wild Love&#x27; and the long finale &#x27;Five to One&#x27;.&quot;

In his retrospective review, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic wrote, &quot;The Doors&#x27; 1967 albums had raised expectations so high that their third effort was greeted as a major disappointment. With a few exceptions, the material was much mellower and while this yielded some fine melodic ballad rock... there was no denying that the songwriting was not as impressive as it had been on the first two records.&quot; Nevertheless, he concluded that &quot;time&#x27;s been fairly kind to the record, which is quite enjoyable and diverse, just not as powerful a full-length statement as the group&#x27;s best albums.&quot; In his review of the 2007 reissue, Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant&quot; praised the album, writing that &quot;Despite the fact that Morrison was becoming a self-destructing mess, Krieger, Manzarek and Densmore were never more lucidperhaps to compensate. This was a band at its most dexterous, creative and musically diverse.&quot;

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Max Bell overviewing the 50th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, gave &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; a positive rating of four out of five stars. &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked it the third best Doors album behind &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and &quot;The Doors&quot;, concluding: &quot;This is the Doors at their strangest, their most exploratory, their most stylistically expansive. &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; has examples of everything the Doors did well, and it has them doing it at, occasionally, their highest level.&quot;

<doc id="177906" wikidata="Q278053" url="?curid=177906" title="Labyrinth (1986 film)">
<text>Labyrinth is a 1986 musical fantasy film directed by Jim Henson with George Lucas as executive producer. Based on conceptual designs by Brian Froud, the film was written by Terry Jones, and many of its characters are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop. Starring Jennifer Connelly as 16-year-old Sarah and David Bowie as Jareth, Sarah must journey through a maze to save her baby brother from the Goblin King.

The film started as a collaboration between Henson and Froud following their previous collaboration &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982). Jones of Monty Python wrote the first draft of the film&#x27;s script early in 1984, drawing on Froud&#x27;s sketches for inspiration. Various other scriptwriters rewrote it and added to it, including Laura Phillips, Lucas, Dennis Lee, and Elaine May—although Jones received the film&#x27;s sole screenwriting credit. It was shot from April to September 1985 on location in Upper Nyack, Piermont, and Haverstraw, New York, and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; had a budget of $25 million. The film underperformed at the United States box office, grossing $12.9 million during its US theatrical run. However, it was a success in the United Kingdom and overseas, grossing over $34 million worldwide. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was first met with a mixed critical response upon its release, which contributed to a difficult period of Henson&#x27;s career, according to his son Brian Henson. It was the last feature film that Henson directed, and over the years it has been re-evaluated by many critics. A success on home video and television broadcasts, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; has gained a large cult following.

The film has been adapted into a variety of media, including books, video games, board games and comics. Tokyopop published a four-volume comic sequel &quot;Return to Labyrinth&quot; between 2006 and 2010, and Archaia Entertainment published a comic prequel &quot;&quot; between 2018 and 2019. In January 2016, it was announced that a sequel was in development, which screenwriter Nicole Perlman described as more of a &quot;spin-off&quot; in the same fictional universe.

==Plot==

While in the park with her dog Merlin, 16-year-old Sarah Williams recites from a book titled &quot;The Labyrinth&quot;, but is unable to remember the last line. Realizing that she is late to babysit her infant half-brother Toby, she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother who leaves for dinner with Sarah&#x27;s father. Frustrated that Toby was given her treasured teddy bear, Lancelot, and by his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes that Toby be taken away by the goblins from her book. Toby disappears and the Goblin King Jareth appears, offering Sarah her dreams in exchange for the baby. She refuses, instantly regretting her wish. Jareth reluctantly gives Sarah 13 hours to solve his labyrinth and find Toby before he is turned into a goblin forever. Sarah meets a dwarf named Hoggle who aids her to enter the labyrinth. She has trouble finding her way at first and meets a talking worm who inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction.

Sarah ends up in an oubliette where she reunites with Hoggle. The two are confronted by Jareth, escape one of his traps, and encounter a large beast named Ludo. Hoggle flees in a cowardly fashion, while Sarah befriends Ludo after freeing him from a trap but loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who instructs him to give an enchanted peach to Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to take her back to the beginning of the labyrinth. Sarah is harassed by a group of creatures called The Fire Gang, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and they fall through a trapdoor that sends them to a flatulent swamp called the &quot;Bog of Eternal Stench&quot; where they reunite with Ludo. The trio meet the guard of the swamp, the anthropomorphic fox terrier Sir Didymus and his Old English Sheepdog &quot;steed&quot; Ambrosius. Ludo summons a trail of rocks to save Sarah from falling into the bog, and Didymus joins the group. The group gets hungry, so Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and forgets her quest. She dreams that Jareth comes to her at a masquerade ball, proclaiming his love for her, but she rebuffs him and escapes, falling into a junkyard outside the Goblin City near Jareth&#x27;s castle. An old Junk Lady fails to brainwash her and she is rescued and has her memory restored by Ludo and Sir Didymus. They are confronted by the humongous robotic gate guard, but Hoggle comes to their rescue. Despite his feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and they enter the city together.

Jareth is alerted to the group&#x27;s presence and sends his goblin army to stop them. Ludo summons a multitude of rocks to chase the goblins away, and they enter the castle. Sarah insists she must face Jareth alone and promises to call the others if needed. In a room modeled after M. C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Relativity&quot;, she confronts Jareth while trying to retrieve Toby. She recites the lines from her book that mirror her adventure to that point, but she still cannot remember the last line. Jareth offers Sarah her dreams again, but she remembers the final line: &quot;You have no power over me!&quot; Defeated at the last second, Jareth returns Sarah and Toby home, turns into a barn owl and flies away.

Realizing how important Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot and returns to her room as her father and stepmother return home. She sees her friends in the mirror and admits that, even though she has grown up, she still needs them in her life, whereupon the labyrinth characters appear in her room for a raucous reunion party, hugging each other in joy. Jareth, in his barn owl form, watches their celebration from outside and then flies off into the moonlight.

==Cast==

==Influences==

Richard Corliss noted that the film appeared to have been influenced by &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; and the works of Maurice Sendak, writing that, &quot;&quot;Labyrinth&quot; lures a modern Dorothy Gale out of the drab Kansas of real life into a land where the wild things are&quot;. Nina Darnton of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the plot of Labyrinth &quot;is very similar to &quot;Outside Over There&quot; by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida&#x27;s baby sister is stolen by the goblins.&quot; This almost got the film into legal trouble, as the similarity caused Sendak&#x27;s lawyers to advise Jim Henson to stop production on the film. However, the legal complaint was eventually settled, with an end credit being added that states that, &quot;Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak&quot;. Sendak&#x27;s &quot;Outside Over There&quot; and &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; are shown briefly in Sarah&#x27;s room at the start of the film, along with copies of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;.

The film&#x27;s concept designer Brian Froud, who had previously collaborated with Henson on &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, has stated that the character of Jareth was influenced by a diverse range of literary sources. In his afterword to the 20th anniversary edition of &quot;The Goblins of Labyrinth&quot;, Froud wrote that Jareth references &quot;the romantic figures of Heathcliff in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and a brooding Rochester from &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s costumes were intentionally eclectic, drawing on the image of Marlon Brando&#x27;s leather jacket from &quot;The Wild One&quot; as well as that of a knight &quot;with the worms of death eating through his armor&quot; from &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;. In his audio commentary of &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, Froud said that Jareth also has influences from Kabuki theatre.

The dialogue starting with the phrase &quot;you remind me of the babe&quot; that occurs between Jareth and the goblins in the &quot;Magic Dance&quot; sequence in the film is a direct reference to an exchange between Cary Grant and Shirley Temple in the 1947 film &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot;.

&quot;Labyrinth&quot;″s &quot;Escher scene&quot; features an elaborate staircase set inspired by the art of Dutch artist M. C. Escher. A print of Escher&#x27;s lithograph &quot;Relativity&quot; is shown on Sarah&#x27;s bedroom wall in the film.

==Production==
===Origins and script===
Brian Froud says that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was first discussed between himself and director Jim Henson. Both agreed to work on another project together, and Froud suggested that the film should feature goblins. On the same journey, Froud &quot;pictured a baby surrounded by goblins&quot; and this strong visual image, along with Froud&#x27;s insight that goblins traditionally steal babies, provided the basis for the film&#x27;s plot.

Henson discussed the film&#x27;s origins to say that he and Froud &quot;wanted to do a lighter weight picture, with more of a sense of comedy since &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; got kind of heavy, heavier than we had intended. Now, I wanted to do a film with the characters having more personality and interacting more.&quot;

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; was being seriously discussed as early as March 1983, when Henson held a meeting with Froud and children&#x27;s author Dennis Lee. Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting it at the end of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film&#x27;s script, as &quot;his daughter Lisa had just read &quot;Erik the Viking&quot; and suggested that he try me as screenwriter&quot;. Jones was given Dennis Lee&#x27;s novella to use as a basis for his script but later told &quot;Empire&quot; that Lee had produced an unfinished &quot;poetic novella&quot; that he &quot;didn&#x27;t really get on with&quot;. In light of this, Jones &quot;discarded it and sat down with Brian [Froud]&#x27;s drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that I really liked, and started creating the story from them&quot;.

Jones is credited with writing the screenplay, while the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones has said that the finished film differs greatly from his original vision. Jones states that, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel that it was very much mine. I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else.&quot; Jones has said that his version of the script was &quot;about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all&quot;. In Jones&#x27; original script, Jareth merely seems &quot;all powerful to begin with&quot; and is actually using the Labyrinth to &quot;keep people from getting to his heart&quot;.

Jones has said that Bowie&#x27;s involvement in the project had a significant impact on the direction taken with the film. Jones had originally intended for the audience not to see the centre of the Labyrinth, prior to Sarah&#x27;s reaching it, as he felt that, in doing so, it robbed the film of a significant &quot;hook&quot;. Henson decided that he wanted Jareth to sing and appear throughout the film, which was something Jones considered the &quot;wrong&quot; decision, with the thought of Bowie starring in the film in mind. Despite his misgivings, Jones rewrote the script to allow for performing songs throughout the film. This draft of the script &quot;went away for about a year&quot;. During this time, it was redrafted first by Phillips and subsequently by Lucas.

An early draft of the script attributed to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah&#x27;s house in the guise of Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish her brother would be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this draft of the script. His final confrontation with Sarah tells her that he would &quot;much rather have a Queen&quot; than &quot;a little goblin prince&quot;. The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, and her blows transform him into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas, in the film, she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well as this, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas, in the film, there is none (though there is in the novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualised.

The redrafted script was sent to Bowie, who found that it lacked humour and considered withdrawing his involvement in the project as a result. To ensure Bowie&#x27;s involvement, Henson asked Jones to &quot;do a bit more&quot; to the script to make it more humorous. May met with Henson in several months, prior to the start of filming in April 1985, and was asked to polish the script. May&#x27;s changes &quot;humanised the characters&quot; and pleased Henson to the extent that they were incorporated into the film&#x27;s shooting script.

At least 25 treatments and scripts were drafted for &quot;Labyrinth&quot; between 1983 and 1985. The film&#x27;s shooting script was only ready shortly before filming began.

===Casting===
Henson intended the protagonist of the film, at different stages of its development, as a king whose baby had been put under an enchantment, a princess from a fantasy world, and a young girl from Victorian England. They made the lead a teenage girl from contemporary America to make the film more commercial. Henson noted that he wished to &quot;make the idea of taking responsibility for one&#x27;s life, which is one of the neat realisations a teenager experiences, a central thought of the film&quot;.

Auditions for the lead role of Sarah began in England in April 1984. Helena Bonham Carter auditioned for the role but was passed over in favour of an American actress. Monthly auditions were held in the US until January 1985, and Jane Krakowski, Yasmine Bleeth, Sarah Jessica Parker, Marisa Tomei, Laura Dern, Claudia Wells, Ally Sheedy, Maddie Corman, and Mia Sara all auditioned for the role. Out of these, Krakowski, Sheedy, and Corman were considered the top candidates. Fourteen-year-old actress Jennifer Connelly &quot;won Jim [Henson] over&quot;, and he cast her within a week. Henson states that Connelly was chosen, as she &quot;could act that kind of dawn-twilight time between childhood and womanhood&quot;. Connelly moved to England in February 1985, in advance of the film&#x27;s rehearsals, which began in March. Connelly discussed her understanding of her role with &quot;Elle&quot; magazine that the film is about &quot;a young girl growing out of her childhood, who is just now becoming aware of the responsibilities that come with growing up&quot;.

The character of Jareth also underwent some significant developments during the early stages of preproduction. Henson states that he originally intended him as another puppet creature in the same vein as his goblin subjects. Henson decided that the role should be filled by a live actor and initially considered offering it to Simon MacCorkindale or Kevin Kline. Henson eventually wanted a big, charismatic star &quot;who could change the film&#x27;s whole musical style&quot; to play the Goblin King and sought a contemporary musician for the role, considering Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson before choosing Bowie.

Henson stated that, &quot;I wanted to put two characters of flesh and bone in the middle of all these artificial creatures, and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterise the adult world.&quot; Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the US for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson pursued Bowie for the role of Jareth and sent him each revised draft of the film&#x27;s script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; and a selection of Brian Froud&#x27;s concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Bowie discussed why he was involved in the film, stating that, &quot;I&#x27;d always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies, so I was pretty hooked from the beginning.&quot;

Gates McFadden was originally offered the role of Sarah&#x27;s mother by Henson, and she signed up to do the choreography as well, but she was not allowed to act in the film and had to accept the choreography role alone due to union rules. She is credited in the film as Cheryl McFadden (her first name), as she usually is when being credited for choreography work. She said that, &quot;Even though that was the reason I took the job and had, for two years, been thinking that was what was going to happen. They would not allow us.&quot;

===Filming===
The team that worked on &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was largely assembled from talent who had been involved in various other projects with the Jim Henson Company. Veteran performers Dave Goelz and Steve Whitmire operated various puppets in the film, along with Karen Prell, Ron Mueck, Rob Mills, and Kathryn Mullen (as various goblins), who had all worked with Henson on &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;. Kevin Clash, a puppeteer from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; best known for performing the character Elmo, also worked on the film as various creatures, as did Frank Oz, who performed briefly as the Wiseman (while also directing &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; around that time). Members of Henson&#x27;s family also worked on the production, including son Brian (the voice and chief puppeteer for Hoggle) and daughter Cheryl (who assisted on one of the Fireys and is also credited for building the characters). Newcomers working on the production included puppeteers Anthony Asbury, Angie Passmore, Nigel Plaskitt, and Mak Wilson (the latter three of whom are credited for performing goblins) who had previously worked on the satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, while a few others, including David Barclay, David Greenaway, Toby Philpott, and Mike Quinn, were carried over from &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. Other goblin puppeteers included David Rudman (also known for his work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;), Robin Stevens, Don Austen, Robert Tygner, and, briefly, Jim Henson himself. Louise Gold, a veteran Muppet performer who had gotten her start on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, cameos in the film as a masked ballroom dancer during the &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; sequence, while Kenny Baker and Warwick Davis, best-known as the performers of &quot;Star Wars&#x27;&quot; R2-D2 and Wicket W. Warrick respectively, were credited as some of the &quot;Goblin Corps&quot;. &quot;Ambrosius&quot;, Sir Didymus&#x27; canine steed, was voiced by Percy Edwards, who had previously supplied the voice of &quot;Fizzgig&quot; in &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;.

Principal photography began on April 15, 1985, at Elstree Studios. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; took five months to film and was a complicated shoot due to the various puppets and animatronic creatures involved. In the making-of documentary &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot;, Henson stated that Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop had been building the puppets and characters required for around a year and a half, prior to shooting, but &quot;everything came together in the last couple weeks&quot;. Henson noted that, &quot;even if you have the characters together, the puppeteers start working with them, they find problems or they try to figure out what they&#x27;re going to do with these characters&quot;.

Each of the film&#x27;s key puppets required a small team of puppeteers to operate it, but Hoggle was the most complex puppet of the production. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle&#x27;s face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson (who also provided the character&#x27;s voice and performed a few goblins) and three additional puppeteers. Brian Henson stated that Weiser &quot;does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she&#x27;s doing with her face. The other four members of the crew are all radio crew, myself included,&quot; in the &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; documentary. Brian Henson also said of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle that, &quot;five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically, what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other.&quot; The film&#x27;s big, ogre-like monster Ludo, whose original build weighed over , was similarly challenging. It would have been too exhausting for performer Ron Mueck to inhabit the suit for all of his scenes, so Henson decided to have Mueck and Rob Mills exchange performances inside Ludo, as they were the same size and had a similar body shape.

At the early stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it difficult to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie said that, &quot;I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest, because, for one thing, what they say doesn&#x27;t come from their mouths, but from the side of the set or from behind you.&quot; Connelly remarked that, &quot;it was a bit strange [working almost exclusively with puppets in the film], but I think both Dave [Bowie] and I got over that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets, and, by the end of the film, it wasn&#x27;t a challenge anymore. They were there, and they were their characters.&quot;

The film required large and ambitious sets constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film&#x27;s climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was high, with a camera mounted on a forty-foot vertical camera track. Many grey, scaly hands integral to the scene were actually 150 live hands supplied by 75 performers and 200 foam-rubber hands. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene and spent time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.

The set of the Goblin City was built on Stage 6 at Elstree Studios near London and required the largest panoramic back cloth ever made. Production designer Elliot Scott states that the biggest challenge he faced was building the forest Sarah and her party pass through on their way to Jareth&#x27;s Castle. The film&#x27;s production notes state that, &quot;the entire forest required 120 truckloads of tree branches, 1,200 turfs of grass, of dried leaves, 133 bags of lichen, and 35 bundles of mossy old man&#x27;s beard&quot;.

Most filming was conducted at Elstree Studios, while a small amount of location shooting was carried out in England and the US. The park seen at the start of the film is part of the West Wycombe Park estate in Buckinghamshire, England. The scenes of Sarah running back home were filmed in various towns in New York State, namely Upper Nyack, Piermont, and Haverstraw.

Shooting wrapped on September 8, 1985.

===Post-production===
Most of the visual effects on &quot;Labyrinth&quot; were achieved in-camera with several notable exceptions. The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears at the opening of the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer at Digital Productions and marked the first use of a realistic CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette was rescued from a skip when the animation company &quot;Omnibus&quot; went bankrupt in 1987.

The scene where Sarah encounters the Fire Gang was altered in post-production, as it had been filmed against black velvet cloth to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing of the finished scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy including them.

Henson received help editing the film from executive producer George Lucas. Henson states that, &quot;When we hit the editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, I took it over again and did the next few months of post-production and audio.&quot; Henson went on to say that, &quot;When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight. I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. [In doing] so, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness.&quot;

===Music===

The soundtrack album features Trevor Jones&#x27; score, which is split into six tracks for the soundtrack: &quot;Into the Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Hallucination&quot;, &quot;The Goblin Battle&quot;, &quot;Thirteen O&#x27;Clock&quot;, and &quot;Home at Last&quot;.

Bowie recorded five songs for the film: &quot;Underground&quot;, &quot;Magic Dance&quot;, &quot;Chilly Down&quot;, &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot;, and &quot;Within You&quot;. &quot;Underground&quot; is featured on the soundtrack twice. The first version of &quot;Underground&quot; is played in an edited version that was played over the film&#x27;s opening sequence, while the second version is played full. &quot;Underground&quot; was released in various territories as a single and, in certain markets, was also released in an instrumental version and an extended dance mix. &quot;Magic Dance&quot; was released as a 12&quot; single in the US. &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; was initially slated for release as a follow-up single to &quot;Underground&quot; at Christmas in 1986, but this plan did not materialise. Bowie did not perform the lead vocals on &quot;Chilly Down&quot;, which was performed by Charles Augins, Richard Bodkin, Kevin Clash, and Danny John-Jules, the actors who voiced the &quot;Firey&quot; creatures in the film. A demo of &quot;Chilly Down&quot; under its original title &quot;Wild Things&quot;, which was performed by Bowie, was leaked in 2016 by Danny John-Jules shortly after Bowie&#x27;s death.

Steve Barron produced promotional music videos for &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot;. The music video for &quot;Underground&quot; features Bowie as a nightclub singer who stumbles upon the Labyrinth encountering many of the creatures seen in the film. The clip for &quot;As the World Falls Down&quot; integrates clips from the film. This video uses them, along with black and white shots of Bowie performing the song in an elegant room. Both were released on the 1993 VHS tape &quot;Bowie – The Video Collection&quot; and the 2002 two-disc DVD set &quot;Best of Bowie&quot;.

In 2017, Capitol Studios announced a reissue of the soundtrack on a vinyl record. This included all five original songs by David Bowie, along with Trevor Jones&#x27; score.

==Release==
===Promotion===
The production of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was covered in multiple high-profile magazines and newspapers, in anticipation of its release, with articles appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Starlog&quot; magazines. An article that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; shortly after filming wrapped in September 1985 focused heavily on the film&#x27;s large scale and emphasised the size of the production and selling &quot;Labyrinth&quot; as a more &quot;accessible&quot; film than &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; due to the casting of live actors in its key roles. An hour-long making-of documentary that covered the filming of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and included interviews with the key figures involved in its production was broadcast on television as &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot;.

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; was featured in music trade papers such as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine due to Bowie&#x27;s soundtrack for the film. Bowie was not heavily involved in promoting the film, but Jim Henson was nonetheless grateful that he produced a music video to accompany the song &quot;Underground&quot; from the soundtrack, saying that, &quot;I think it&#x27;s the best thing he could have done for the film.&quot; Commercial artist Steven Chorney provided the film&#x27;s teaser one-sheet, while Ted Coconis produced a one-sheet poster for the film&#x27;s North American release.

A range of merchandise was produced to accompany the film&#x27;s release, including plush toys of Sir Didymus and Ludo, a board game, a computer game, and multiple jigsaw puzzles. An exhibition of the film&#x27;s characters and sets toured across shopping malls in various cities in the US, including New York City, Dallas, and Chicago. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was featured in an exhibition titled &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Magic World&quot; that was shown at the Seibu Department Store in Tokyo in August 1986.

===Theatrical release===
&quot;Labyrinth&quot; opened in US theaters on June 27, 1986. The film received a Royal Charity premiere at the London Film Festival on December 1, 1986, with Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales in attendance. Jim Henson, Brian Henson, Brian Froud, Jennifer Connelly, and the animatronic creature Ludo were all present to support the film.

The film was rolled out in other European countries largely between December 1986 and February 1987 and premiered in France as &quot;Labyrinthe&quot; on December 2 and in West Germany as &quot;Die Reise ins Labyrinth&quot; (&quot;The Journey into the Labyrinth&quot;) on December 13. The film was released in Denmark as &quot;Labyrinten til troldkongens slot&quot; (&quot;The Labyrinth to the Troll King&#x27;s Castle&quot;) on February 20, 1987 and saw its last theatrical release in Hungary under the title &quot;Fantasztikus labirintus&quot; (&quot;Fantastic Labyrinth&quot;) when it premiered there on July 7, 1988. The film was also released in Brazil on December 25, 1986 where it was named &quot;Labirinto – A Magia do Tempo&quot; (&quot;Labyrinth – The Magic of Time&quot;).

In April 2012, a remastered re-release of the film was screened at the Astor Theatre in Melbourne, Australia.

===Home media===
&quot;Labyrinth&quot; was first released on VHS, Betamax, and pan and scan LaserDisc in 1987 by Embassy Home Entertainment in the US and by Channel 5 Video Distribution in the UK. After Embassy was sold to Coca-Cola in 1985, its home video line was renamed Nelson Entertainment, and a VHS release was also made under this label (re-using the same Embassy box artwork). New Line Home Video re-released the film on LaserDisc in Widescreen through Image Entertainment in 1994. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment reissued the film on VHS for the last time in 1999 in the US under the name of its subsidiary company Columbia-TriStar and in the UK the same year, with &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; included as a special feature.

The film made its DVD premiere in 1999 in the US and has since been re-released on DVD in 2003, 2007, and 2016. All DVD releases of the film feature the &quot;Inside the Labyrinth&quot; documentary as an extra. The 2003 re-release was described as a collector&#x27;s edition and featured a set of exclusive collectors cards that featured concept art by Brian Froud. The 2007 release was promoted as an Anniversary Edition and featured a commentary by Brian Froud and two newly produced making-of documentaries, &quot;Journey Through the Labyrinth: Kingdom of Characters&quot; and &quot;Journey Through the Labyrinth: The Quest for Goblin City&quot;, which featured interviews with producer George Lucas, choreographer Gates McFadden of &quot;Star Trek&quot; fame (listed as Cheryl McFadden) and Brian Henson.

The film was released on Blu-ray in a 2009 package, which replicated the extras featured on the 2007 Anniversary Edition DVD. The Blu-ray release featured one new special feature, a picture-in-picture track that lasts the length of the film, and interviews with the crew and several minor cast members including Warwick Davis.

A 30th anniversary edition of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Blu-ray in 2016. An Amazon exclusive gift set version with came with packaging similar to Jareth&#x27;s Escher-style stairs. New features included &quot;The Henson Legacy&quot; featuring Jennifer Connelly and members of the Henson family discussing Jim Henson&#x27;s puppetry style and includes a visit to the Center for Puppetry Arts, which houses many of Jim Henson&#x27;s puppets. Adam Savage from &quot;MythBusters&quot; hosts a Q&amp;A with Brian Henson, David Goelz, Karen Prell, and Sheri Weiser. Jennifer Connelly, Brian Henson, and Cheryl Henson pay tribute to David Bowie in &quot;The Goblin King&quot;.

In 2021, a 35th anniversary limited edition of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was released on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray as a set in a digibook designed to resemble Sarah&#x27;s book from the film. The 2021 Blu-ray disc is the same as the 2016 release, while the 2021 4K Blu-ray disc includes an upgraded 4K transfer with Dolby Vision HDR, and special features such as 25 minutes of deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by Brian Henson and 55 minutes of footage from the original auditions for the role of Sarah.

On January 1, 2024, a worldwide distribution agreement signed between Shout! Studios and the Jim Henson Company for &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; as well as associated content went into effect. The agreement grants Shout! Studios streaming, video-on-demand, broadcast, digital download, packaged media and limited non-theatrical rights to the films. The company released the films on all major digital entertainment platforms on February 6, 2024.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Labyrinth&quot; opened at number eight at the US box office with $3,549,243 from 1,141 theaters, which placed it behind &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;, &quot;Back to School&quot;, &quot;Legal Eagles&quot;, &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, and &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. In its next weekend at the box office, the film dropped to number 13 in the charts, only earning $1,836,177. By the end of its run in US cinemas, the film had grossed $12,729,917, just over half of its $25 million budget.

The film grossed $9 million in Japan during the summer. In December, the film opened in Europe, opening at number one at the UK box office. It was the highest-grossing film over the Christmas period in the UK, with a gross of $4.5 million in its first month, three times more than its competitors. It was also the highest-grossing film for the period in Spain, Bolivia, and Venezuela. By January 1987, it had grossed $7.5 million from eight other foreign territories (Australia, Brazil, Central America, Germany, Holland, Italy, Mexico, and Spain), for a total worldwide gross of over $34 million at that time.

===Critical response===

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;While it&#x27;s arguably more interesting on a visual level, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; provides further proof of director Jim Henson&#x27;s boundless imagination&quot;. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 50 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert acknowledged that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was made with &quot;infinite care and pains&quot;, and he gave the film two stars out of four, as he felt that the film &quot;never really comes alive&quot;. Ebert said that, as the film was set in an &quot;arbitrary world&quot;, none of the events in it had any consequences, robbing the film of any dramatic tension. Gene Siskel&#x27;s review of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was highly negative, and he referred to it as an &quot;awful&quot; film with a &quot;pathetic story&quot;, &quot;much too complicated plot&quot;, and &quot;visually ugly style&quot;. Siskel objected to the film&#x27;s &quot;violent&quot; plot, writing that, &quot;the sight of a baby in peril is one of sleaziest gimmicks a film can employ to gain our attention, but Henson does it&quot;.

Other critics were more positive. Kathryn Buxton of &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; found that it had &quot;excitement and thrills enough for audiences of all ages, as well as a fun and sometimes slightly naughty sense of humor&quot;. Roger Hurlburt of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; called &quot;Labyrinth&quot; &quot;a fantasy fan&#x27;s gourmet delight&quot;, writing that &quot;though plot aspects are obviously borrowed from other fantasy stories – Cinderella, Snow White and the fairy tale classics, events are served in unique form&quot;. Bruce Bailey of &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; admired the film&#x27;s script, stating that, &quot;Terry Jones has drawn on his dry wit and bizarre imagination and come up with a script that transforms these essentially familiar elements and plot structures into something that fairly throbs with new life&quot;. Bailey was also impressed by the film&#x27;s depth, writing that, &quot;adults will have the additional advantage of appreciating the story as a coming-of-age parable&quot;.

Several critics noted the film&#x27;s subtext and found it successful to varying degrees. Saw Tek Meng of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; acknowledged that &quot;Sarah&#x27;s experiences in the labyrinth are symbolic of her transition from child to woman&quot; but ultimately found the film &quot;too linear&quot; for its latent themes to come through. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Nina Darnton compared the film&#x27;s tone to the writings of E. T. A. Hoffmann, stating that Hoffman&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; &quot;is also about the voyage to womanhood, including the hint of sexual awakening, which Sarah experiences too in the presence of a goblin king&quot;. Darton enjoyed the film and considered it more successful than Henson&#x27;s previous collaboration with Brian Froud, &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Labyrinth&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #85, stating that, &quot;Like &quot;Time Bandits&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; is the story of a child trying to negotiate a dreamlike otherworld where logic is not all that it should be, and so it also borrows lavishly from &quot;The Princess and the Goblin&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;. A couple of scenes along the quest are truly eerie. Others are doggedly sentimental.&quot; Lynn Minton in &quot;Parade&quot; opined that &quot;what [&quot;Labyrinth&quot;] lacks in story and memorable music it makes up for, in part, with amusing special effects, loveable and funny &quot;people&quot; and an emotionally satisfying ending&quot;.

Connelly&#x27;s portrayal of Sarah polarised critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers. &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as &quot;a bland and minimally talented young actress&quot;. Jon Marlowe wrote for &quot;The Miami News&quot;, stating that, &quot;Connelly is simply the wrong person for the right job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, you can see the onions in her eyes.&quot; Hal Lipper of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; felt contrary to these negative views and praised her acting, saying that, &quot;Connelly makes the entire experience seem real. She acts so naturally around the puppets that you begin to believe in their life-like qualities.&quot;

Bowie&#x27;s performance was variously lauded and derided. In his largely positive review of the film for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss praised him as &quot;charismatic&quot; referring to his character as a &quot;Kabuki sorcerer who offers his ravishing young antagonist the gilded perks of adult servitude&quot;. Bruce Bailey enjoyed Bowie&#x27;s performance, writing that, &quot;the casting of Bowie can&#x27;t be faulted on any count. He has just the right look for a creature who&#x27;s the object of both loathing and secret desire.&quot; In a largely critical review, Hal Lipper found that, &quot;Bowie forgoes acting, preferring to prance around his lair while staring solemnly into the camera. He&#x27;s not exactly wooden. Plastic might be a more accurate description.&quot;

Henson came &quot;the closest I&#x27;ve seen him to turning in on himself and getting quite depressed&quot; following the film&#x27;s mixed reception, his son Brian told &quot;Life&quot; magazine. It was the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990.

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; has been re-evaluated by several notable publications after Henson&#x27;s death. A review from 2000 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine called the film &quot;a fabulous fantasy&quot; and wrote that, &quot;David Bowie cuts a spooky enough figure in that fright wig to fit right in with this extraordinary menagerie of Goth Muppets. And Jennifer Connelly, still in the flush of youth, makes for an appealingly together kind of heroine.&quot; Michael Wilmington described &quot;Labyrinth&quot; as &quot;dazzling&quot;, writing that it is &quot;a real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects, an absolutely gorgeous children&#x27;s fantasy movie&quot;, for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 2007. In 2010, &quot;Total Film&quot; ran a feature called &quot;Why We Love Labyrinth&quot;, which described &quot;Labyrinth&quot; as a &quot;hyper-real, vibrant daydream, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;″s main strength lies in its fairytale roots which give the fantastical story a platform from which to launch into some deliriously outlandish scenarios&quot;. In their February 2012 issue, &quot;Empire&quot; featured a four-page spread on &quot;Labyrinth&quot; as part of their Muppet Special.

===Accolades===
&quot;Labyrinth&quot; was nominated at the British Academy Film Awards for Best Special Visual Effects and received two Saturn Award nominations for Best Fantasy Film and Best Costumes. The film was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated &quot;Labyrinth&quot; for inclusion on its Top 10 Fantasy Films list. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; is ranked 72nd on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 80 best &#x27;80s movies&quot; and 26th on &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 50 best fantasy movies&quot;. In 2019, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named it as one of &quot;The 77 best kids&#x27; films of all time&quot;.

===Legacy===
Despite its poor performance at the American box office, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992 that, &quot;every Christmas a new flock of children comes up to me and says, &#x27;Oh! you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s in &quot;Labyrinth!&quot;&#x27;&quot; In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said that, &quot;I still get recognized for &quot;Labyrinth&quot; by little girls in the weirdest places. I can&#x27;t believe they still recognize me from that movie. It&#x27;s on TV all the time and I guess I pretty much look the same.&quot;

&quot;Labyrinth&quot; has become a cult film. Brian Henson remembered his father Jim Henson as being aware that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; both had cult followings by the time of his death in 1990, saying that &quot;he was able to see all that and know that it was appreciated&quot;. Academic Andrea Wright wrote that &quot;Labyrinth&quot; has managed to maintain audience popularity long after its initial release to a greater extent than &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. Since 1997, an annual two-day event called the &quot;Labyrinth of Jareth Masquerade Ball&quot;, in which revelers attend dressed in costumes inspired by the film, has been held in various locations, including San Diego, Hollywood, and Los Angeles. &quot;Labyrinth&quot; has developed a significant internet fan following since the early 1990s, and, as of 2021, FanFiction.Net hosts more than 10,000 stories in its &quot;Labyrinth&quot; section.

The strong DVD sales of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; prompted rights-holders the Jim Henson Company and Sony Pictures to look into making a sequel, and &quot;Curse of the Goblin King&quot; was briefly used as a placeholder title. However, the decision was ultimately taken to avoid making a direct sequel and instead produce a fantasy film with a similar atmosphere. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman and artist Dave McKean were called in to write and direct a film similar in spirit to &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, and &quot;MirrorMask&quot; was ultimately released in selected theaters in 2005 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. On January 22, 2016, Sony Pictures announced that a reboot is in development with Lisa Henson as producer and Nicole Perlman attached as the screenwriter. However, on January 25, Perlman confirmed on Twitter that, while she is working on a &quot;Labyrinth&quot; project with the Jim Henson Company, it is not a remake or reboot. Perlman also discussed the timing of the rumors in conjunction with David Bowie&#x27;s death and said that, &quot;Henson Co &amp; I started talking in late 2014, so the timing of these rumors is so upsetting. I would never seek to profit from Bowie&#x27;s death.&quot;

==In other media==
===Books===
Since its release, a number of books based on &quot;Labyrinth&quot; have been published. &quot;The Goblins of Labyrinth&quot; is a book containing Brian Froud&#x27;s concept art for the film with descriptions by Terry Jones. It was published in 1986 and reissued in a deluxe expanded 20th anniversary edition in 2006. A concurrent novelization of the film was written by A. C. H. Smith which, along with Smith&#x27;s novelization of &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, was reprinted with illustrations and Jim Henson&#x27;s notes by Archaia Publishing in 2014. The film was adapted into picture book form as &quot;Labyrinth: The Storybook&quot;, written by Louise Gikow with illustrations by Bruce McNally, and &quot;Labyrinth: The Photo Album&quot;, written by Rebecca Grand with photographs taken by John Brown from the film set.

The film was adapted for the Commodore 64 and Apple II home computers in 1986 as &quot;&quot;. Different versions were also released in Japan only the following year for the Family Computer console and MSX computer under the title of &quot;Labyrinth: Maō no Meikyū&quot; (&quot;Labyrinth: Maze of the Goblin King&quot;), developed by Atlus and published by Tokuma Shoten in association with Activision and Henson Associates.

=== Comic books ===
Marvel Comics published a three-issue comic book adaptation of &quot;Labyrinth&quot; which was first released in a single volume as &quot;Marvel Super Special #40&quot; in 1986.

Tokyopop published a manga-style four-volume comic sequel between 2006 and 2010 called &quot;Return to Labyrinth&quot;, written by Jake T. Forbes and illustrated by Chris Lie, with cover art by Kouyu Shurei and in partnership with The Jim Henson Company. &quot;Return to Labyrinth&quot; follows the adventures of Toby as a teenager when he is tricked into returning to the Labyrinth by Jareth.

Archaia Entertainment announced that it was developing a prequel graphic novel about the story of how Jareth became the Goblin King in 2011 in collaboration with The Jim Henson Company. Project editor Stephen Christy described the graphic novel as a &quot;very tragic story&quot; featuring a teenaged Jareth and said that it does not feature Sarah or Toby. In early stages of development, there were plans for the novel to integrate music into the plot in some way. David Bowie was approached by Archaia to seek permission to use his likeness and ascertain if he wished to have any involvement in the project. Brian Froud was set to design characters as a creative consultant on the project and produce covers for the graphic novel. Reported to be about a young Jareth who is taken into the Labyrinth by a witch, the novel&#x27;s official synopsis describes Jareth&#x27;s plot as his &quot;attempt to rescue his true love from the clutches of the wicked and beautiful Goblin Queen&quot;. The graphic novel was initially set for release at the end of 2012 but was repeatedly delayed. Its scheduled April 2014 release slot was replaced by Archaia&#x27;s reissue of the &quot;Labyrinth&quot; novelization.

Archaia released a &quot;Labyrinth&quot; short story titled &quot;Hoggle and the Worm&quot; for Free Comic Book Day on May 5, 2012 and another titled &quot;Sir Didymus&#x27; Grand Day&quot; on May 4, 2013. Archaia published &quot;Labyrinth: 30th Anniversary Special&quot;, a collection of seven short stories, in 2016 to mark the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Cory Godbey&#x27;s stories from this collection were also released in picture book form as &quot;Labyrinth Tales&quot;. Another six-story collection was released the following year, titled &quot;Labyrinth: 2017 Special&quot;. In 2018, the two were compiled as &quot;Labyrinth: Shortcuts&quot;, which also included two new stories, and another three-story collection was released as &quot;Labyrinth: Under the Spell&quot;.

Between 2018 and 2019, Archaia published &quot;&quot;, a 12-issue comic series written by Simon Spurrier and illustrated by Daniel Bayliss. The series is a prequel about how Jareth became the Goblin King. It began with officials of the 1790s Venice. The story revolves around an infant Jareth who has been stolen by the previous ruler of the labyrinth the Owl King and follows the quest of Jareth&#x27;s mother Maria to rescue her son. In 2020, Archaia published &quot;Labyrinth: Masquerade&quot;, a one-shot story set during the film&#x27;s masquerade dream sequence, written by Lara Elena Donnelly with art by Pius Bak, Samantha Dodge, and French Carlomango.

Archaia will publish a graphic novel adaptation of Smith&#x27;s &quot;Labyrinth&quot; novelization in September 2024, adapted by writer Kyla Vanderklugt and artist Giorgio Spalletta.

== Stage adaptation ==
In 2016, Brian Froud expressed that he would like to see &quot;Labyrinth&quot; adapted as a stage musical with live puppetry and special effects, remarking that it would be &quot;an absolute gift to do it on stage. People would come and sing the songs and dress up, I think.&quot; Brian Henson announced that the Jim Henson Company was working on a &quot;stage show, a big theatrical version&quot; of &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, in April 2018. He said that the production was not intended for Broadway theatre but could potentially take place on London&#x27;s West End.

== Sequel ==
In January 2016, Nicole Perlman announced that she had been hired to write the script for the sequel. By April 2017, Fede Álvarez signed on as director, as well as co-writer with Jay Basu. Henson&#x27;s daughter Lisa Henson was named as producer. By October 2018, Álvarez confirmed that the script was complete. In April 2020, however, Álvarez announced that he had stepped down as director. In May 2020, Scott Derrickson, known for directing &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, was announced as director. Maggie Levin joined him in writing the script for the film. The Jim Henson Company&#x27;s Brian Henson was set as the executive producer and confirmed Lisa Henson as producer.

In February 2021, Jennifer Connelly revealed that she &quot;had conversations&quot; about being involved in the &quot;Labyrinth&quot; sequel but was unsure about what is going to happen.

In October 2023, Derrickson stated he was unsure whether the sequel is going to be made, as the project was &quot;so imaginative and surreal&quot; that he believed it would be difficult to make commercially viable. In February 2024, Brian Henson confirmed that the sequel is still in development despite setbacks, although the project may be different from the Derrickson version. Lisa Henson revealed the same month that the reason for delay was that &quot;We just haven&#x27;t been able to get the script right. We&#x27;ve had a couple of scripts written, and we&#x27;re gonna start over again. We&#x27;re gonna start with a new script and a new director so it won&#x27;t be anytime soon.&quot; 

In December 2024, news broke of Robert Eggers being tapped to direct and co-write a follow-up to &quot;Labyrinth&quot; alongside Sjón. Chris Columbus, Eleanor Columbus, Lisa Henson were all confirmed to be producing with Brian Henson executive producing. In the same report, it was revealed that Alexander Skarsgård had been previously spoken with about taking up the mantle of Jareth in a prior version of the project.

<text>Harold Adams Innis (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a Canadian professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on media, communication theory, and Canadian economic history. He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada&#x27;s culture, political history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of &quot;staples&quot; such as fur, fish, lumber, wheat, mined metals, and coal. The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada from the 1930s to 1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian political economic tradition. Innis has been referred to as the &quot;father of communications theory&quot; and as the &quot;father of Canadian economic history&quot;.

Innis&#x27;s writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations. He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC. He warned, however, that Western civilization is now imperiled by powerful, advertising-driven media obsessed by &quot;present-mindedness&quot; and the &quot;continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.&quot; His intellectual bond with Eric A. Havelock formed the foundations of the Toronto School of communication theory, which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school Marshall McLuhan and Edmund Snow Carpenter.

Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the University of Toronto&#x27;s political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada&#x27;s history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.

As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. &quot;We are indeed fighting for our lives&quot;, he warned, pointing especially to the &quot;pernicious influence of American advertising... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.&quot; His views influenced some younger scholars, including Donald Creighton.

Innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential to the survival of Western civilization. His intellectual disciple and university colleague, Marshall McLuhan, lamented Innis&#x27;s premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: &quot;I am pleased to think of my own book &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing.&quot; Mel Watkins declared that Innis was &quot;without doubt the most distinguished social scientist and historian, and one of the most distinguished intellectuals, that Canada has ever produced&quot;.

Innis was born on November 5, 1894, on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of Otterville in southwestern Ontario&#x27;s Oxford County. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins. His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him &quot;Herald&quot;, hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical Baptist faith that she and her husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority. Innis became an agnostic in later life, but never lost his interest in religion. According to his friend and biographer Donald Creighton, Innis&#x27;s character was moulded by the church:
Innis attended the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community&#x27;s high school. He travelled by train to Woodstock, Ontario, to complete his secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers&#x27; college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him.

===University studies===
In October 1913, Innis started classes at McMaster University (then in Toronto). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster&#x27;s liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate. Innis was especially influenced by , the university&#x27;s one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life: &quot;Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?&quot;

Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him a sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W. S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one but that it went the deepest.

===First World War service===
After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was sent to France in the fall of 1916 to fight in the First World War. Trench warfare with its &quot;mud and lice and rats&quot; had a devastating effect on him.

Innis&#x27;s role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on Vimy Ridge. Signallers, or spotters, watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.

Innis&#x27;s war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis experienced recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service.

Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis&#x27;s intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian nationalism; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to &quot;sell&quot; the war; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.

==Graduate studies==
===McMaster and Chicago===
Harold Innis completed a Master of Arts degree at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called &quot;The Returned Soldier&quot;, &quot;was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction.&quot;

Innis did his postgraduate work at the University of Chicago and was awarded his PhD, with a dissertation on the history of Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.

Innis was influenced by the university&#x27;s two eminent communications scholars, George Herbert Mead and Robert E. Park. Although he did not attend any of those famous professors&#x27; classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. James W. Carey writes that Mead and Park &quot;characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions.&quot;

While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of Thorstein Veblen, the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veblen, Innis praised him for waging war against &quot;standardized static economics.&quot;

Innis got his first taste of university teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22. Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and Anne (1933). Mary Quayle Innis was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, &quot;An Economic History of Canada&quot;, was published in 1935. Her novel, &quot;Stand on a Rainbow&quot; appeared in 1943. Her other books include &quot;Mrs. Simcoe&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1965), &quot;The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times&quot; (1966) and &quot;Unfold the Years&quot; (1949), a history of the Young Women&#x27;s Christian Association. She also edited Harold Innis&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Essays in Canadian Economic History&quot; (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his &quot;Empire and Communications.&quot;

Donald Quayle Innis became a geography professor at the State University of New York. Mary married a surgeon and did graduate work in French literature. Hugh Innis became a professor at Ryerson University where he taught communications and economics. Anne Innis Dagg did doctoral work in biology and became an advisor for the independent studies program at the University of Waterloo and published books on zoology, feminism, and Canadian women&#x27;s history.

===History of the CPR===
Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The completion of Canada&#x27;s first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis&#x27;s thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway&#x27;s significance from an economic historian&#x27;s point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.

Innis argues that &quot;the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent.&quot; As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR&#x27;s equipment &quot;comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive &#x27;sign&#x27; dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.

Communications scholar Arthur Kroker argues that Innis&#x27;s study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that &quot;technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence.&quot; It also reflected Innis&#x27;s lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that the National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. &quot;Western Canada,&quot; Innis wrote, &quot;has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement.&quot;

==Staples thesis==
Harold Innis is considered the leading founder of a Canadian school of economic thought known as the staples theory. It holds that Canada&#x27;s culture, political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of &quot;staples&quot; such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels. Innis theorized that the reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce; and, as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others. Innis pointed out, for example, that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined, it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat, potash and especially lumber. The export of the new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals and later railways.

===&quot;Dirt&quot; research===
In 1920, Innis joined the department of political economy at the University of Toronto. He was assigned to teach courses in commerce, economic history and economic theory. He decided to focus his scholarly research on Canadian economic history, a hugely neglected subject, and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study. Furs had brought French and English traders to Canada, motivating them to travel west along the continent&#x27;s interlocking lake and river systems to the Pacific coast. Innis realized that he had to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade and also travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called &quot;dirt&quot; experience.

Thus, Innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the Peace River to Lake Athabasca; then down the Slave River to Great Slave Lake. They completed their journey down the Mackenzie, Canada&#x27;s longest river, to the Arctic Ocean on a small Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company tug. During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.

Everywhere that Innis went, his methods were the same: he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories.

===Fur trade in Canada===

Harold Innis&#x27;s interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, &quot;The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History&quot; (1930). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the &quot;heroic&quot; European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada&#x27;s political and economic destiny. He argues that the fur trade largely determined Canada&#x27;s boundaries, and he comes to the conclusion that the country &quot;emerged not in spite of geography but because of it.&quot;

In line with that observation, Innis notably proposes that European settlement of the Saint Lawrence River Valley followed the economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples, making for a Canadian historical and cultural continuity that predates and postdates European settlement. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples. &quot;We have not yet realized,&quot; he writes, &quot;that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions.&quot;

The Innisian perspective on the development of Canadian political, economic and social institutions was an early form of neo-institutionalism, which became an accepted part of the Canadian political science tradition well before American and European counterparts. &quot;The Fur Trade in Canada&quot; concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another—furs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals. Reliance on staples made Canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the &quot;cyclonic&quot; shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country&#x27;s economic life.

&quot;The Fur Trade in Canada&quot; also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor. Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed. However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. &quot;The new technology with its radical innovations,&quot; Innis writes, &quot;brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease.&quot; Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis &quot;was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism.&quot;

===Cod fishery===
After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple, the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America. The result was &quot;The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy&quot; published in 1940, 10 years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource, a history that ranges over 500 years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, &quot;The Cod Fisheries&quot; looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New England.

==Communications theories==
Innis&#x27;s study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications. During the 1940s, Innis also began studying pulp and paper, an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy. The research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis &quot;followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, from looking at a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it.&quot;

One of Innis&#x27;s primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding media are durable and include clay or stone tablets. Space-binding media are more ephemeral and include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.

Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire&#x27;s collapse. He tried to show that media &#x27;biases&#x27; toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. The interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of Ancient Greece in the time of Plato. The balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.

Innis&#x27;s analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of powerful communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as &quot;mechanized&quot; communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances. The new media had contributed to an obsession with &quot;present-mindedness&quot;, wiping out concerns about past or future. Innis wrote,
Western civilization could be saved, Innis argued, only by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, &quot;A Plea for Time&quot;, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.

Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in &quot;Empire and Communications&quot; has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively nonlinear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that the style may have been a result of Innis&#x27;s illness late in his career.

==Academic and public career==

===Influence in the 1930s===
Aside from his work on &quot;The Cod Fisheries&quot;, Innis wrote extensively in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada&#x27;s immense economic problems in the Great Depression. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see the effects of the Depression for himself. The next year, in an essay entitled, &quot;The Canadian Economy and the Depression&quot;, Innis outlined the plight of &quot;a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance&quot; but beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat but afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada&#x27;s growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal–provincial relations. &quot;We lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation,&quot; Innis warned, because of &quot;the weak position of the social sciences in Canada.&quot;

Innis&#x27;s reputation as a public intellectual was growing steadily and, in 1934, Premier Angus Lewis Macdonald invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine Nova Scotia&#x27;s economic problems. The next year, he helped establish &quot;The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science&quot;. In 1936, he was appointed a full University of Toronto professor and a year later, became the head of the university&#x27;s Department of Political Economy.

Innis was appointed president of the Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, &quot;The Penetrative Powers of the Price System&quot;, must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement. The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil, and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which &quot;threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication.&quot; Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.

Innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945. It was a series called &quot;The Relations of Canada and the United States&quot; overseen by James T. Shotwell, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by Canadian scholars. His own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series. His work with Shotwell enabled Innis to gain access to Carnegie money to further Canadian academic research. As John Watson points out, &quot;the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times.&quot;

===Politics and the Great Depression===
The era of the &quot;Dirty Thirties&quot; with its mass unemployment, poverty and despair gave rise to new Canadian political movements. In Alberta, for example, the radio evangelist William &quot;Bible Bill&quot; Aberhart led his populist Social Credit party to victory in 1935. Three years earlier in Calgary, Alberta, social reformers had founded a new political party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). It advocated democratic socialism and a mixed economy with public ownership of key industries. Frank Underhill, one of Innis&#x27;s colleagues at the University of Toronto was a founding member of the CCF. Innis and Underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself &quot;dissatisfied with the policies of the two major [political] parties in Canada&quot; and that aimed at &quot;forming a definite body of progressive opinion.&quot; In 1931, Innis presented a paper to the group on &quot;Economic Conditions in Canada&quot;, but he later recoiled from participating in party politics, denouncing partisans like Underhill as &quot;hot gospellers.&quot;

Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that they should instead devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. &quot;The university could provide an environment,&quot; he wrote, &quot;as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives.&quot;

Although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban, unemployed workers, Innis did not embrace socialism. Eric Havelock, a left-leaning colleague explained many years later that Innis distrusted political &quot;solutions&quot; imported from elsewhere, especially those based on Marxist analysis with its emphasis on class conflict. He worried, too, that as Canada&#x27;s ties with Britain weakened, the country would fall under the spell of American ideas instead of developing its own based on Canada&#x27;s unique circumstances. Havelock added:
===Late career and death===
In the 1940s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based Economic History Association and its &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot;. He later became the association&#x27;s second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).

In 1944, the University of New Brunswick awarded Innis an honorary degree, as did his alma mater, McMaster University. Université Laval, the University of Manitoba and the University of Glasgow would also confer honorary degrees in 1947–48. He received the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal in 1944.

In 1945, Innis spent nearly a month in the Soviet Union where he had been invited to attend the 220th anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country&#x27;s Academy of Sciences. Later, in his essay &quot;Reflections on Russia&quot;, he mused about the differences between the Soviet &quot;producer&quot; economy and the West&#x27;s &quot;consumer&quot; ethos:
Innis&#x27;s trip to Moscow and Leningrad came shortly before US–Soviet rivalry led to the hostility of the Cold War. Innis lamented the rise in international tensions. He saw the Soviet Union as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the nuclear arms race and saw it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval Inquisition. &quot;The Middle Ages burned its heretics,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs.&quot;

In 1946, Innis was elected president of the Royal Society of Canada, the country&#x27;s senior body of scientists and scholars. The same year, he served on the Manitoba Royal Commission on Adult Education and published &quot;Political Economy in the Modern State&quot;, a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications. In 1947, Innis was appointed the University of Toronto&#x27;s dean of graduate studies. In 1948, he delivered lectures at the University of London and Nottingham University. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society that same year. He also gave the prestigious Beit lectures at Oxford, later published in his book &quot;Empire and Communications&quot;. In 1949, Innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government&#x27;s Royal Commission on Transportation, a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail. The last decade of his career, during which he worked on his communications studies, was an unhappy time for Innis. He was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how the new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory. Biographer John Watson writes that &quot;the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works, contributed to his sense of overwork and depression.&quot;

Innis died of prostate cancer on November 8, 1952, a few days after his 58th birthday. In commemoration, Innis College at the University of Toronto and Innis Library at McMaster University were named in his honour.

Following his premature death, Innis&#x27; significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings. Marshall Poe&#x27;s general media theory that proposes two sub-theories were inspired by Innis. Douglas C. North expanded on Innis&#x27; &quot;vent for surplus&quot; theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the United States and underdeveloped countries. In addition, James W. Carey adopted Innis as a &quot;reference point in his conception of two models of communication.&quot;

==Innis and McLuhan==
Marshall McLuhan was a colleague of Innis&#x27;s at the University of Toronto. As a young English professor, McLuhan was flattered when he learned that Innis had put his book &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; on the reading list of the fourth-year economics course. McLuhan built on Innis&#x27;s idea that in studying the effects of communications media, technological form mattered more than content. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis&#x27;s concept of the &quot;bias&quot; of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a &quot;less flamboyant precursor to McLuhan&#x27;s legendary phrase &#x27;the medium is the message.&#x27;&quot; Innis, for example, tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were &quot;biased&quot; toward control over space and secular power, while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were &quot;biased&quot; in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge. McLuhan focused on what may be called a medium&#x27;s &quot;sensory bias&quot; arguing, for example, that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye, while radio played to the irrationality of the ear. The differences in the Innisian and McLuhanesque approaches were summarized by the late James W. Carey:
Biographer John Watson notes that Innis&#x27;s work was profoundly political while McLuhan&#x27;s was not. He writes that &quot;the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, is the key to Innis&#x27;s work. That also underlies the politicization of Innis&#x27;s position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan.&quot; Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. &quot;For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command.&quot; Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the &quot;dialectic of power and knowledge&quot; in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis&#x27;s work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan&#x27;s.

As scholars and teachers, Innis and McLuhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought; yet both produced many books. In his introduction to the 1964 reprint of &quot;The Bias of Communication&quot;, McLuhan marvelled at Innis&#x27;s technique of juxtaposing &quot;his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms.&quot; McLuhan argued that although that made reading Innis&#x27;s dense prose difficult (&quot;a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate&quot;), Innis&#x27;s method approximated &quot;the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse.&quot; Best of all, it yielded &quot;insight&quot; and &quot;pattern recognition&quot; rather than the &quot;classified knowledge&quot; so overvalued by print-trained scholars. &quot;How exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration,&quot; McLuhan added. McLuhan&#x27;s own books with their reliance on aphorisms, puns, quips, &quot;probes&quot; and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ that mosaic technique.

Innis&#x27;s theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he had a profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.

<text>The Progressive Socialist Party () is a Lebanese political party. Its confessional base is in the Druze sect and its regional base is in Mount Lebanon Governorate, especially the Chouf District. Founded by Kamal Jumblatt in 1949, the party was led by his son Walid Jumblatt between 1977 and 25 May 2023. On 25 June 2023 the son of Walid, Taymur Jumblatt, was officially consecrated as leader of the PSP.

==Origins==
From 1951 through 1972 the party had between three and six deputies in parliament.

==Emblem==
The white color in the logo and emblem symbolizes the idea of internal collective peace and global international peace, which it aims to achieve in accordance with what was stated in its charter when explaining doctrine and work.

The blue color symbolizes that the party does not deny the spiritual phenomenon in the life of the human being and in explaining the development of the individual and the group.On the contrary, it takes into account this phenomenon, believing that it is permanent throughout the ages in the life of the individual and the group.

The globe symbolizes the manifestation of human unity and its consolidation in this comprehensive popular movement that ultimately aims to unite the countries of the world in an international union that includes the entire globe, the unity of the human race, and the brotherhood and cooperation that must prevail among all peoples, regardless of their different colors, races, and beliefs.

The connection between the pen and the pickaxe symbolizes the two basic elements that operate in the development of systems, civilization, and history, “material labor and the effort of thought.” In the union of the social groups that belong to them, victory is guaranteed in the cause of socialist progressivism.

The red color symbolizes the idea of a comprehensive revolution in systems and mentalities, as stated in the party’s charter.

The triangle symbolizes the party’s adoption of moral force, that means the direct action, and the principle of sacrifice as an approach and goal for its struggle.

==The PSP in the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990)==
Under Kamal Jumblatt&#x27;s leadership, the PSP was a major element in the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), which supported Lebanon&#x27;s Arab identity and sympathised with the Palestinians. Despite Jumblatt&#x27;s initial reluctance to engage in paramilitarism, it built its own military wing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) which proved to be one of the strongest private armies in the Lebanese Civil War of 1975 to 1990. It conquered much of Mount Lebanon and the Chouf District. Its main adversaries were the Kataeb Regulatory Forces militia, and later the Lebanese Forces militia (which absorbed the Kataeb). The PSP suffered a setback in 1977, when Kamal Jumblatt was assassinated. His son Walid succeeded him as leader of the party.

From the Israeli withdrawal from the Chouf in 1983 to the end of the civil war, the PSP ran the Civil Administration of the Mountain in the area under its control. Tolls levied at PSP/PLA militia checkpoints provided a major source of income for the administration, which provided social and public services.

The PSP played an important role in the Mountain War under the leadership of Walid Jumblatt: after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) retreated from the Chouf District, important battles took place there between the PSP/PLA and the Lebanese Forces militia. Both the Lebanese Forces and the PSP/PLA were accused of committing massacres and atrocities against one another as tit-for-tat (revenge killings). The PSP also systematically displaced many Christian civilians in the Chouf region by committing massacres and mass executions.

During the war years, the PSP controlled the seaport at Jieh. In March 1989 General Michel Aoun established a blockade of the port which resulted in artillery exchanges between his forces and a combination of PSP, Amal and the Syrian Army in which at least 90 people were killed and several hundred wounded.

==The post-war years==
After the restoration of constitutional rule in 1989, the PSP was the major ally of Syria in Lebanon and its leader Walid Jumblatt was in close relations with the Syrian Army and intelligence generals in Lebanon, such as Ghazi Kanaan, and also with the Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam. In the 1992 general election it won four seats.

In the post-Civil War period, Jumblatt was known for switching allegiances and acting as a kingmaker in deals between factions. The PSP participated in a number of governments, but, after the Syria Accountability Act and the UN Resolution 1559 and the change of the balance of powers in the region after the occupation of Iraq, joined the opposition and took up a position opposed to the role of Syria in Lebanon&#x27;s politics. Unlike some opponents of the Syrian presence, Jumblatt did not oppose the presence of the Syrian army per se, but contended that the Syrian intelligence services were exerting undue influence.

Following the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 in September 2004, calling for a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon, Jumblatt was particularly prominent in the opposition. However, he was opposed to the demand that Hezbollah be disarmed, and insisted on maintaining relations with the Shia Islamist party. Later, he has drifted into sharp opposition towards the group, and has decided to support their disarmament, claiming that Syria and Iran are trying to take over Lebanon through Hezbollah. After the assassination of Rafic Hariri in February 2005, Jumblatt joined the anti-Syria camp, despite his long support to Syria. As part of the March 14 Alliance, the PSP won 16 seats in the general elections held in 2005. It won eleven seats in the 2009 Lebanese general election and had three ministers in the 2009 First Cabinet of Saad Hariri (Ghazi Aridi, Akram Chehayeb, and Wael Abou Faour, all Druze). However, after the March 8 Alliance regained power in 2011, the PSP positioned itself in the political centre, and gave allegiance to the new government. Under the banner of the Democratic Gathering bloc, had three ministers (Alaaeddine Terro, Sunni, plus Aridi and Faour) in the 2011 Second Cabinet of Najib Mikati.

In late January 2011, Jumblatt declared not to support the disarming of Hezbollah. In 2013, it endorsed the 15 March alliance-led Cabinet of Tammam Salam (it had two ministers in this government, Faour and Akram Chehayeb). By 2015, the PLP was allied with the Future Movement and it had two ministers (Marwan Hamadeh and Ayman Shkeir) in the 2016 Second Cabinet of Saad Hariri, led by the Future Movement and two ministers again (Chehayeb and Faour) in the 2019 Third Cabinet of Saad Hariri.

With the onset of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Jumblatt and the PSP clearly showed their support for the Syrian opposition, and urged the Syrian Druze community to stand against the Assad government, and join the rebels.

At the ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the killing of Kamal Jumblatt in Moukhtara on 19 February 2017, Walid Jumblatt symbolically gave his &quot;keffiyeh&quot; to his son Taymour Jumblatt, symbolically marking the generational shift in the party leadership. That year, Jumblatt again refrained from saying Hezbollah should be disarmed. In the 2018 Lebanese general election, the Democratic Gathering bloc, the PSP&#x27;s parliamentary platform, fielded 10 candidates across the country. For the first time since 1992, Walid Jumblatt did not stand as a candidate, with Taymour taking over as the party leader. The party fielded candidates for 3 out of 4 Druze seats in Mount Lebanon IV, keeping with the tradition of leaving a seat uncontested to help Lebanese Democratic Party chief Talal Arslan get elected. PSP joined joint lists with the Future Movement in Beirut II, Bekaa II and Mount Lebanon IV, and with Lebanese Forces in Mount Lebanon III and Mount Lebanon IV. It dropped to just nine seats in the 2018 election. The party served in the opposition to the short-lived 2019 Cabinet of Hassan Diab, returning to power as part of the Third Cabinet of Najib Mikati in 2021, with just one minister, Abbas Halabi.

In late May 2023, Walid Jumblatt declared his resignation as leader of the Progressive Socialist Party after a 46-year tenure. Around 2,000 supporters gathered in Ain Zhalta, a Druze town in the Chouf mountains, where members of the Progressive Socialist Party named political heir, Taymour Jumblatt, as their new leader. Taymour was the sole contender.

In February 2025, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced his government, which consists of 24 ministers; the Progressive Socialist Party controls two portfolios: the Public Works and Transport Ministry, headed by Fayez Rasamny, and Agriculture Ministry, under Nizar Hani.

<doc id="177912" wikidata="Q6532502" url="?curid=177912" title="Public housing">
<text>Public housing, also known as social housing, refers to subsidized or affordable housing provided in buildings that are usually owned and managed by local government, central government, nonprofit organizations or a combination thereof. The details, terminology, definitions of poverty, and other criteria for allocation may vary within different contexts, but the right to rent such a home is generally rationed through some form of means-testing or through administrative measures of housing needs. One can regard social housing as a potential remedy for housing inequality. Within the OECD, social housing represents an average of 7% of national housing stock (2020), ranging from ~34% in the Netherlands to less than 1% in Colombia.

In the United States, public housing developments are classified as housing projects that are owned by a housing authority or a low-income (project-based voucher) property. PBV are a component of a public housing agency. PBVs, administered by state and local housing agencies, are distinct from Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA), a program through which property owners&#x27; contract directly with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to rent units to families with low incomes.

Affordable housing goals can also be achieved through subsidies. Subsidized housing is owned and operated by private owners who receive subsidies in exchange for providing affordable housing. Owners may be individual landlords or for-profit or nonprofit corporations.

== History ==
Social housing had existed sporadically prior to modern developments. The oldest still in use is the 16th-century Fuggerei in Augsburg, Bavaria.

The origins of modern municipal housing lie in the dramatic urban population increase caused by the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. In the large cities of the period, many social commentators, such as Octavia Hill and Charles Booth reported on the squalor, sickness and immorality that arose. Henry Mayhew, visiting Bethnal Green, wrote in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;:
Some philanthropists began to provide housing in tenement blocks, and some factory owners built entire villages for their workers, such as Saltaire in 1853 and Port Sunlight in 1888. It was in 1885, after the report from a royal commission in England, that the state first took an interest. This led to the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1885, which empowered Local Government Boards to shut down unhealthy properties and encouraged them to improve the housing in their areas.

The City of London Corporation built tenements in the Farringdon Road in 1865. The world&#x27;s first large-scale housing project was built in London to replace one of the capital&#x27;s most notorious slums – the Old Nichol. Nearly 6,000 individuals were crammed into the packed streets, where one child in four died before his or her first birthday. Arthur Morrison wrote the influential &quot;A Child of the Jago&quot;, an account of the life of a child in the slum, which sparked a public outcry. Construction of the Boundary Estate was begun in 1890 by the Metropolitan Board of Works and completed by the then-recently formed London County Council in 1900.

The success of this project spurred many local councils to embark on similar construction schemes in the early 20th century. The Arts and Crafts movement and Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s garden city ideas led to the leafy London County Council cottage estates such as firstly Totterdown Fields and later Wormholt and Old Oak. The First World War indirectly provided a new impetus, when the poor physical health and condition of many urban recruits to the British Army was noted with alarm. In 1916, 41% of conscripts were unfit to serve. This led to a campaign known as &quot;Homes fit for heroes&quot; and in 1919 the Government first compelled councils to provide housing, helping them to do so through the provision of subsidies, under the Housing Act 1919. Public housing projects were tried out in some European countries and the United States in the 1930s, but only became widespread globally after the Second World War.

== Africa ==
=== South Africa ===
South African apartheid featured high poverty rates in Black South Africans due to racial segregation and discrimination, so the post-apartheid government has sought to build social housing for poor black households, in urban areas with economic opportunity. The Reconstruction and Development and Breaking New Ground programs have provided over 3.5 million houses from 1995 to 2020, but they did not fully meet demand, and were built away from inner urban areas, exacerbating racial divides. The housing shortage was estimated to be 3.7 million units in 2021. The Department of Human Settlements, which facilitates national housing development, has sought to transition from a housing-focused development model to a holistic view, including services.

== Americas ==
=== Brazil ===
 (&quot;My House, My Life&quot;), the Brazilian federal government&#x27;s social housing program, was launched in March 2009 with a budget of R$36 billion (US$18 billion) to build one million homes. The second stage of the program, included within the government Growth Acceleration Program (PAC, ) was announced in March 2010. This stage foresaw the construction of a further two million homes.

All funds for properties were provided by the Brazilian public bank, . The bank financed development and provided mortgages for qualifying families.

, 4.5 million homes were built and distributed to the population. The project has been criticized for its placement and quality of the houses. Houses are built far from the city centre to reduce housing costs which consequently reduces access to the labor market; a study of randomly selected houses of the MCMV project in Rio de Janeiro showed a reduced likelihood of being formally employed in job-seekers but income was not affected in those who were already employed.

In addition to addressing the housing deficit, Minha Casa Minha Vida sought to stimulate the economy by generating employment in the construction sector. According to the Brazilian Chamber of Construction Industry (CBIC), the program created millions of jobs, directly and indirectly, contributing to the country&#x27;s economic growth during its initial phases. However, critics argue that the program&#x27;s focus on mass production sometimes overlooked the importance of integrating new housing developments with adequate infrastructure, such as schools, healthcare facilities, and transportation networks, which are essential for fostering sustainable urban development.

=== Canada ===


In Canada, public housing is usually a block of purpose-built subsidized housing operated by a government agency, often simply referred to as community housing, with easier-to-manage townhouses. Many cities in Canada still maintain large high-rise clustered developments in working-class neighborhoods, a system that has fallen into disfavour in both the United States and the United Kingdom. However, many public housing corporations still offer a variety of buildings and communities ranging from individual houses to townhouse communities and mid-rise and high-rise apartments in both working-class and middle-class neighborhoods that house a significant number of low-income Canadians.

Following the decentralisation of public housing to local municipalities, Social Housing Services Corporation (SHSC) was created in the Province of Ontario in 2002 to provide group services for social housing providers (public housing, non-profit housing and co-operative housing). It is a non-profit corporation which provides Ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing, insurance, investment and information services that add significant value to their operations.

Recently, there has been a move toward the integration of public housing with market housing and other uses. Revitalization plans for properties such as in the notorious Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, Regent Park, in Toronto, and Rochester Heights in Ottawa, aim to provide better accommodations for low-income residents, and connect them to the greater community. The aim of the reconstruction plans are often to better integrate it into the traditional grid of streets, improve leisure and cultural amenities. However, the residents of these communities often have had little effective input in the plans and have had mixed reactions to the construction.

In 2014, Vancouver, long considered one of the least affordable cities in the world, changed the definition of social housing to mean rental housing in which a minimum of 30 percent of dwelling units are occupied by households that cannot pay market rents, due to lack of income.

=== Mexico ===

At the end of the Second World War, enriched by US investments and an oil boom, Mexico had its first demographic boom, in which the primary destination for rural immigrants was Mexico City. , a famous architect at time, was charged to build its first large-scale public housing project. Built for the (the National Pensions office, today ISSSTE), the (or ) (1947–50) in the Colonia del Valle and the (or ) (1951–52) in the , introduced formal ideas from Le Corbusier&#x27;s into the urban fabric.

His later project, the  built in 1960–65, was meant to develop one of the poorest parts of the city, , which was becoming a slum. Unfortunately, after a while, instead of giving the residences to the previous residents of , corruption took place and most of the dwellings were handed to state employees.

During the earthquake of 1985, both the and complexes suffered major damage, with some buildings collapsing. Today most of the has been demolished.

Mexico has had experience with housing projects since &#x27;s regime (1877–1880, 1884–1911). One of those still remains and is the of in in Mexico City, that was a project for a paper factory workers.

Another notable public housing project is the Conjunto Habitacional Independencia, located near Tizapán neighborhood, on most of the land that once was the Matsumoto Hacienda. The project was developed during Adolfo López Mateos presidential period, started in 1959 and completed in 1960. The development included an integral design considering landscaping, and premises that could provide basic services to the residents: a clinic, a sports complex, theater, movie theater, a supermarket, a kindergarten, three elementary schools, among others. It functioned as public housing until 1982, when the houses and apartments were sold to the residents.

=== Puerto Rico ===
Neighbourhoods in Puerto Rico are often divided into three types: , (urbanisation) and (public housing). An is a type of housing where land is developed into lots, often by a private developer, and where single-family homes are built.

More recently, non-single-family units, such as condominiums and townhouses are being built which also fall into this category. (In Puerto Rico, a condominium is a housing unit located in a high-rise building. It is popularly called an (English: &#x27;apartment&#x27;), whether or not its resident owns the unit or lives in it as a renter.)

Public housing, on the other hand, are housing units built with government funding, primarily through programs of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). These have traditionally been multi-family dwellings in housing complexes called a or a (and more recently a ), where all exterior grounds are shared areas.

Increasingly, however, public housing developments are being built that consist of other than the traditional multi-family dwellings with all exterior grounds consisting of shared outside area, for example, public housing may consist of single family garden apartments units. Finally, a home that is located in neither an nor of a public housing development is said to be located in (and to be a part of) a .

In Puerto Rico, a also has a second and very different meaning official meaning: the geographical area into which a is divided for official administrative purposes. In this sense, as well as public housing developments (as well as one or several in the popular sense) may be located in one of these 901 official geographic areas.

=== United States ===


In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, government involvement in housing for the poor was chiefly in the introduction of building standards. Atlanta, Georgia&#x27;s Techwood Homes, dedicated in 1935, was the nation&#x27;s first public housing project. Most housing communities were developed from the 1930s onward and initial public housing was largely slum clearance, with the requirement insisted upon by private builders that for every unit of public housing constructed, a unit of private housing would be demolished.

This also eased concerns of the establishment by eliminating or altering neighborhoods commonly considered a source of disease, and reflected progressive-era sanitation initiatives. Moreover, public housing, along with the Federal Highway Program, demolished the older, substandard housing of communities of color across the United States.

However, the advent of makeshift tent communities during the Great Depression caused concern in the Administration. The Federal public housing program was created by the 1937 Act, in which operations were &quot;sustained primarily by tenant rents.&quot; As a result, public housing in its earliest decades was usually much more working-class and middle-class and white than it was by the 1970s. Many Americans associate large, multi-story towers with public housing, but early projects were actually low-rise, though Le Corbusier superblocks caught on before World War II.

A unique US public housing initiative was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late New Deal (1940–42) under the auspices of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the direction of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook. These eight projects were purchased by the residents after the Second World War and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents. These projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the US public housing effort.

Public housing was only built with the blessing of the local government, and projects were almost never built on suburban greenfields, but through regeneration of older neighborhoods. The destruction of tenements and eviction of their low-income residents consistently created problems in nearby neighborhoods with &quot;soft&quot; real estate markets.

Initiatives in housing policy were implemented in ways that perpetuated stigma against African Americans. Initially, public housing was intended to be built widespread, and as such be mixed-income, but lobbyists who did not want to see public housing decrease their housing values blocked such housing from going up. These early NIMBY movements limited where public housing was concentrated: predominantly in low-income neighborhoods. With the introduction of suburbs and expansion of choices for the white working class, the demographics of public housing changed from more class and racially integrated to predominantly impoverished, single-parent, welfare, and people of color. This led to stigmatization of public housing, through pushing the narrative that people living in public housing were &quot;Welfare Queens&quot;, or otherwise living in a state of abject poverty and terrible conditions. These demographic changes also decreased support for housing, leading to the government cutting funding for the program. Because of funding cuts and mismanagement by public housing authorities, public housing started to reflect modern associated characteristics of &quot;soul-crushing&quot; buildings or &quot;humanitarian disasters&quot;—to which the 1993 HOPE VI project&#x27;s response was demolition.

The federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department&#x27;s 1993 HOPE VI program addressed concerns of distressed properties and blighted superblocks with revitalization and funding projects for the renewal of public housing to decrease its density and allow for tenants with mixed income levels. The project paired together the demolition of public housing stock and private development, leading to the displacement of many residents. One of the biggest components of this was the repealing of the &quot;one-for-one&quot; replacement rule, which said that for every unit of housing destroyed a new one must be built. HOPE VI&#x27;s reasoning for repealing this policy was that it was hindering the construction of new, mixed-income units: since the public housing buildings were so massive, those behind HOPE VI believed that trying to match the &#x27;one-for-one&#x27; rule would make building new housing extremely difficult. The long-term effect of this was that more housing was demolished than built, and many people were displaced without being guaranteed a spot in the new housing that would get built. This led to the widespread displacement and reshuffling of public house residents: namely, low-income, Black, single-parent families. Narratives that public housing projects were full of crime, drugs, and poverty were used to further justify demolition and destruction of public housing. Such associations between crime, surveillance and policing, and the projects increased in 1996.

Projects continue to have a reputation for violence, drug use, and prostitution, especially in New Orleans, Washington, D.C. 
Chicago and Detroit, leading to the passage of a 1996 federal &quot;one strike you&#x27;re out&quot; law, enabling the eviction of tenants convicted of crimes, especially drug-related, or merely as a result of being tried for some crimes. Specifically, the Clinton era established, through HUD, the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program, which led to the cracking down of public housing, leading to more policing and surveillance for low-income people of color.

==== Turn to subsidized housing ====
In the 60s and 70s, the popularization of neoliberalism caused a turn away from public sector solutions towards private or public-private solutions. This, in conjunction with the narrative of public housing being obsolete, led to both the turn away from public housing and towards subsidized housing solutions.

Houses, apartments or other residential units are usually subsidized on a rent-geared-to-income (RGI) basis. Some communities have now embraced a mixed income, with both assisted and market rents, when allocating homes as they become available.

A significant change in the program took place in 1969, with the passage of the Brooke Amendment. Rents now became set at 25% of a tenant&#x27;s income with the result that the program began serving the &quot;poorest tenants.&quot;

Other attempts to solve these problems include the 1974 Section 8 Housing Program, which encourages the private sector to construct affordable homes, and subsidized public housing. This assistance can be &quot;project-based&quot;, subsidizing properties, or &quot;tenant-based&quot;, which provides tenants with a voucher, accepted by some landlords. This policy option represented a turn away from the public-sector policy of public housing, instead turning towards the private market to address housing needs. The program, in conjunction with HOPE VI, was intended to create income-integrated communities, by giving residents the choice of where to move. However, the housing voucher program has historically had long wait times and limited choice on where one can actually move. Additionally, it was found that many people of color did not want to move away from their families, communities, and systems of support, as well as experiencing stigma and difficulties with landlords, safety, or expenses. This leads to the program doing little to actually create a more racially-integrated city demographics, mostly reproducing inequality while simultaneously not having enough valid housing units for the long list of applicants.

== Asia ==
=== China ===
The public-owned housing system was established when the Chinese Communist Party started a planned economy in the 1950s as part of its Great Leap Forward. The system was funded by the central government&#x27;s budget and were administered and distributed by state-owned enterprises. The occupants of the public housing were usually the employees of the enterprises and their family, who were subject to pay rent at a very low price. The size and the type of room the households received were dependent on their job title or administrative level. The central government found it difficult to upkeep the public housing due to the low rent it received; the distribution policy that was intended to be &quot;equalitarianism&quot; was actually corrupt.

The Chinese government commercialized the housing market after the economic reform started in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping. The public houses that were constructed before that the economic reforms were categorized as &quot;Old Public Houses&quot; (). &quot;Old Public Houses&quot; were, in principle, not supposed to be privately sold, but the household could sell it after purchasing the ownership of the building (not the property), and such transactions were subject to be review by local housing authorities and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. However, an informal filing system and unclear policies resulted in problems of corruption and family dispute.

The concept of the low-cost rental housing can be traced to a 1998 policy statement, but did not truly take off until 2006 due to limited funding and administrative problems. The provision of more affordable housing is one of the key components of China&#x27;s Twelfth Five-year Plan, which targets the construction of 36 million homes by 2015. That program&#x27;s costs will be split between the private and public sector and are estimated at five trillion yuan by China International Capital Corporation.

=== Hong Kong ===


In Hong Kong, public housing is one of the major housing policies of the government. Nearly half of Hong Kong&#x27;s 7.5 million population lives in public housing. The two main public housing providers are the Housing Authority and the Housing Society.

The most common types of public housing in Hong Kong are public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats produced under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS). In 2016, approximately 31 per cent of Hong Kong households lived in PRH flats while 15 per cent resided in subsidised sale flats (of all types).

The origin of large-scale public housing in Hong Kong can be traced to the resettlement programme launched by the Hong Kong government in the 1950s in response to the increasing prevalence of squatter settlements, which emerged as a result of a great influx of refugees following the Communist revolution in China. The squatter villages were considered unsafe as they were susceptible to disastrous fires, including a 1953 blaze in Shek Kip Mei that rendered over 50,000 people homeless overnight.

Large-scale resettlement estates were built throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, the government of Sir Murray MacLehose launched the Ten-Year Housing Programme, which aimed to provide the entire population with &quot;satisfactory housing&quot; within a decade. The government also launched the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) in 1976 to enable lower-income households to purchase flats.

Many public housing estates were built as part of new town development programmes. During the 1980s, most of the earliest resettlement estates (from the 1950s and early 1960s) were also rebuilt to modern standards. Public housing remains a key concern of the Hong Kong Government, which plans to construct some 330,000 units between 2022 and 2032.

=== India ===
86.6% of the Indian population lives in own houses. There are various public housing projects by both state and central governments in small scale.

Kerala has started an initiative of public housing called Life which is a part of their welfare mission, Nava Kerala Mission which aims to be one of the biggest public housing initiatives undertaken on a state level in India is schemed to build houses for an estimated 4.32 lakh (432,000) families in Kerala who do not own any land or houses. The handover of 3,23,894 houses were completed till date under the mission.

===Indonesia===
Indonesia has undertaken &quot;One Million Houses program&quot; for low-income people. The program has been implementing since 2015 to achieve an ambitious target of building 10 million houses. The proportion of the housing is 70 percent for low-income people and 30 percent for non-low-income people. This program is a joint movement between the Central Government, regional governments, real estate developers and the community. The program is targeted to reach one million housing units annually. In 2015, about 700,000 homes were built, increasing to approximately 800,000 in 2016 and around 904,000 by the end of 2017.

===Iran===
*
Iranian Minister of Road and Urban Development promised to deliver 4 millions apartment unit and flats and failed its aim.
Registration scheme is closed for only males aged 23–45 without prior land ownership history.

=== Japan ===

 is the Japanese word for a large cluster of apartment buildings or houses of a particular style and design, typically built as public housing by government authorities.

The Japan Housing Corporation (JHC), now known as the Urban Renaissance Agency (UR), was founded in 1955. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the JHC built many in suburban areas to offset the increasing housing demand during the post-World War II economic boom. It introduced the Japanese salaryman to a life around the nuclear family in contrast with the multi-generation homes before the war.

The rent payment for a is much cheaper than that of an apartment or a mortgage, but for a public the prospective tenant must usually participate in a lottery to be assigned an open apartment. Residents in UR danchi do not have to pay key money or contract renewal fees, making the residences cheaper than comparable housing even if the monthly rents are equivalent.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, the public housing program, particularly the planning and development of new public housing and the allocation of rental units and resale of existing ownership units, is managed by the Housing and Development Board. Day-to-day management of public housing communities has been delegated to Town Councils headed by the local members of parliament.

In 2018, 78.7% of Singaporean residents live in public residential developments, ranging from studio units to executive condominiums provided by the HDB, a major factor in Singapore having one of the highest home-ownership rates – over 90% of the resident population – in the world.

=== Taiwan ===

After Kuomintang&#x27;s retreat to Taiwan, Taiwan experienced a population surge and, beginning in the 1980s, faced issues with ageing military dependents&#x27; village. To address these housing needs, the government constructed various types of public housing projects across the country. Starting in 1976, approximately 390,000 housing units were built, providing accommodation for around 1.58 million people. These projects were largely managed by specialised local government agencies, such as the National Housing Bureau. Taiwan’s public housing is generally categorized into three types:

* Rebuilt Military-Dependent Villages: These communities were primarily named with the suffix &quot;New Village&quot; (新村) (e.g., Matsu New Village) and aimed at replacing deteriorating military housing.
* Housing for Civil Servants and their Families: These communities served public employees and their families.
* Public Housing for Private Purchase: A limited number of units were made available for public purchase by private citizens.

In the late 1990s, due to an oversupply of housing units in the private market, the government decided to halt large-scale public housing projects, except for the continued redevelopment of military-dependent villages. This shift aimed to prevent issues like collusion between officials and developers, as well as competition with private developers.

Since the 2010s, with real estate speculation driving urban housing prices up, the government has focused on new types of public housing initiatives. These include affordable housing units for sale through public-private partnerships and social housing projects intended for rental, such as Taiwan’s &quot;Social Housing&quot; (社會住宅) initiative. However, there have been recurring concerns about potential collusion between government officials and developers in these new projects.

=== Vietnam ===

From the 1960s to the 1980s, Vietnam built &quot;Khu tập thể&quot; (KTT), socialist-modeled apartment blocks on the periphery of cities for civil servants, state-owned companies&#x27; workers, and military personnel. Market reforms in the late 1980s resulted in the partial privatization of the KTT, which were sold to low- and low-middle income populations. The KTT have since become dilapidated, due to a lack of municipal funding for repairs and maintenance, and been the target of demolition, displacement, and redevelopment for high-income populations. 

In the 2010s, Vietnam has experienced a surge in property prices, with the affordable housing stock shrinking by 7% of the entire housing stock from 2014 to 2016, and apartment prices rising by 90% between 2017 and 2020. Developers are not interested in social housing projects since they are not profitable, even amidst rising demand from workers, so the Ministry of Construction requires funding to build 294,600 social housing units in the 2021 – 2025 period.

== Europe ==
=== European Union ===

According to a 2018 discussion paper of the European Commission, in 2015, 11.3% of the EU-population lived in households that spent 40% or more of their disposable income on housing.
In January 2019, the former European Commission President, Romano Prodi, declared that &quot;public investment in social infrastructure during the Eurocrisis reached a 20-year low. Current investment in social infrastructure in the EU is estimated at 170 billion euros per year. The minimum infrastructure investment gap in these sectors is estimated at 100 to 150 billion euros, representing a total gap of at least 1.5 trillion euros between 2018 and 2030.&quot;

Housing projects in Europe can be found in urban areas, as well as in suburban areas.

The EU was moving to support more affordable, energy-efficient and accessible housing with the financial contribution of the CEB and of the EIB through its European Fund for Strategic Investments. Public funding was planned to be directed primarily on affordable housing and secondly in the education and lifelong learning, health and long-term care sectors.

In Europe, there is a significant shortage of investment in social housing and a pressing need to renovate existing units. Annual investment in housing is predicted at €57 billion for new building and energy-efficiency modifications. The projections do not include the refugee situation caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Austria ===

Public housing was an important issue right from the foundation of the Republic of German-Austria in 1918. The population was faced with a great deal of uncertainty particularly as regards food and fuel. This led to a significant number of less affluent people to move to the periphery of towns, often building makeshift homes to be closer to where they could grow food. They were called (&#x27;settlers&#x27;). As the political situation became stabilised with foundation of the First Austrian Republic in September 1919, the movement started creating formal organizations like the Austrian Association for Settlements and Small Gardens. The electoral victory of the Social Democratic Party of Austria in the elections for the Viennese (city parliament) gave rise to Red Vienna. Part of their programme was the provision of decent homes for the Viennese working class who made up the core of their supporters. Hence the German word (plural: ) for &quot;municipality building&quot;. In Austria, it refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide public housing. These have been an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s.

=== Belgium ===
Social housing is a responsibility of the regions in Belgium. The regions do not directly own the houses, semi-private social housing corporations do. The government regulates and mostly finances this corporations. Below a certain income limit, people are eligible for social housing. Because there is a major shortage of social housing in Belgium, other priority conditions are often imposed, such as having children to care for. Social housing accounts for approximately 6.5% of the Belgian housing market. This is much lower than neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands and France. As of 2018 Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels are responsible for 280,687 social houses, 212,794 people are on the waiting list. For the people on the waiting list there are other possibilities such as subsidies and sociale rental agencies in Flanders.

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, public housing is called and is owned and administered by approximately 700 self-governing, democratic and non-profit organizations by and for the tenants themselves. Many of the public housing organizations in Denmark are rooted in the early history of the labor unions and currently forms about 20% of the total housing stock with about 7,500 departments countrywide. A membership of a housing organization is usually required to obtain a rental and they are granted with regard to length of membership.

Although the buildings are owned and administered by self-governing and economically independent organizations, the State of Denmark is strongly regulating public housing in the country. By law, the municipalities have access to 25% of the rentals, usually reserving them for the poor, the unemployed, the disabled or mentally ill or any other group dependent on social benefits from the municipality. Over the years, these regulations have created many &#x27;vulnerable residential areas&#x27; within the country. Danish public housing has never had any income restrictions, but in recent years new state regulations has made it mandatory for several of them to favor fully employed renters and disfavor unemployed or part-time employed people. This is a relatively new effort by the state to counter the ghettoisation, which is now an officially recognized problem countrywide.

As in Sweden, state and municipal policies carried out throughout the first decade of the 21st century, has led to an increased privatization of public housing. In many areas, residents have been offered to buy their own flats, thereby effectively changing the status of the property. The privatization of public housing was initiated as part of an ideological program by the right wing governments of the early 21st century and was launched a few years after the closure of the former Ministry of Housing Affairs in 2001. The former ministry was re-opened as Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs in October 2011, when a new coalition government led by social-democrats was formed.

=== Finland ===

The right to housing is guaranteed in the Finnish constitution, and public housing in Finland is largely funded through loans which are subsidized and guaranteed by the government. Roughly one third of Finland&#x27;s housing stock has been built this way. Rents for public housing apartments in Finland are typically significantly lower than market-rate housing. Eligibility to live in public housing in Finland is based on a need-based evaluation, and those with very low incomes and those who are experiencing homelessness are given priority.
The earliest public housing project in Finland was in Helsinki. In 1909, four wooden houses designed by the architect were built on (formerly ) for the city&#x27;s workers. The residents were mainly working-class families with several children. The apartments had an average of five people per room, sometimes up to eight. The tiny apartments were equipped with running water, a pantry and an attic cupboard. Every apartment had its own toilet in the cellar. Electric lighting was installed in 1918.

The homes and lives of worker families in Helsinki from 1909 to 1985 are presented in a museum near the amusement park.

In 2008, Helsinki launched its Housing First policy, with the goal of ending homelessness by prioritizing unconditional housing. With municipal, state, and NGO support, and coupled with health and medical services, the program reduced homelessness by 35% between 2008 and 2019.

=== France ===

After World War II, the population increased at a rate previously unknown, the rural exodus increased, while war damage had reduced the number of houses in many cities. Rental prices dramatically rose, and the government made a law in 1948 to block them, effectively ending the economic benefits of housing investment. Rents were gradually deregulated until debate in the 1980s led to the current rental law of 1989 theoretically balancing landlord and tenant relations. However, there was a major homelessness crisis in the winter of 1953–4 and the necessary laws were gradually mobilized producing high levels of construction almost continuously from the 1960s. Social landlords were a major source of expertise as well as construction actors with links to national and local bodies. The construction industry was at the time inadequate so political support was needed.

It is incorrect to refer to French social housing as public housing. The origins of French social housing lie in the private sector, with the first State aid provided to limited-profit companies by the in 1793. The originally socialist idea was promoted by some French employers in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Public housing companies followed before World War I. There are still different social housing movements, public, private and some cooperative. Social landlord organizations all have similar regulation and similar access to government loans but there are significant differences.

The government launched a series of major construction plans, including the creation of new towns () and new suburbs with HLM (, &quot;low-rent housing&quot;). The state had the funds and the legal means to acquire the land and could provide some advantages to the companies that then built its huge housing complexes of hundreds of apartments. Quality was also effectively regulated, resulting in decent or even top quality housing for the standard of the 1950s and 1960s. The construction of HLMs were subject to much political debate. Much smaller developments are now the norm. This housing is now generally referred to as , a slightly wider sphere than just housing.

France still retains this system, a recent law making it an obligation for every town to have at least 20% HLM. Nowadays HLM represents roughly half of the rental market (46% in 2006). Social housing is not all for disadvantaged people who are just one of the target groups. Part of the funding can be provided by employer-employee groups to provide housing for local employees. The 20% target can include intermediate housing for better off groups, although its object is to produce social mix. Gentrification and the very basis of social housing allocation are divisive issues as well as the extent of local control of housing. This housing has always been a multi-actor activity and recent local government reorganization continues to change the political landscape.

While they succeeded in giving lower-income families a place to live in the drive to provide popular housing, this system also led to the creation of suburban ghettos, with a problem of disrepair. There has been a long-term problem of gradual impoverishment of social tenants There, deprived strata of the population, mostly of immigrant origin and suffering massive under-employment, might in the past have been left to simmer away from the more affluent urban centres, sometimes becoming rife with social tensions and violence. This affects a minority of social housing but has a high profile and still produces serious tension.

Tackling this problem at its roots is all but simple, and social mix policies can break up populations seen as difficult by redevelopment. This has not had the hoped for results. It has also been sought to resolve the problem of access to the system by disadvantaged people by a new system where certain groups can apply to court to be housed if refused, the &quot;right to housing&quot;. This tends to intensify the controversy over social housing allocation, who should be housed. The French tradition of &#x27;universal&#x27; social housing allocation – housing for everyone is called into question by EU competition law restricting subsidy except for the disadvantaged. In any event, the system is certainly effective in producing construction, although not with the excesses seen in the recent credit crunch elsewhere.

=== Germany ===
Between 1925 and 1930 Germany was the site of innovative and extensive municipal public housing projects, mostly in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Frankfurt. These housing estates (), were made necessary by the dreadful living conditions of pre-war urban tenements. The 1919 Weimar Constitution in Article 155 stated that the state would &quot;promote the object of assuring to every German a healthful habitation&quot;, but few homes were built until the economy stabilised in 1925.

The new German housing estates were low-rise, no more than five stories, and in suburban settings. Residents were provided access to light, air, and sun. The size, shape, orientation and architectural style of Germany&#x27;s public housing were informed by the recent experience of the Viennese, the Dutch, the anti-urban Garden City Movement in Britain, the new industrialized mass-production and pre-fabrication building techniques, the novel use of steel and glass, and by the progressive-liberal policies of the Social Democrats.

In 1930 in the industrial city of , the (&#x27;Houses with Balcony Access&#x27;) were designed by Bauhaus director for a housing cooperative that wanted apartments it could let for no more than a quarter of the occupant&#x27;s income. Working on a tight budget inspired money and space saving innovations, such as using balcony walkways for access to the apartments rather than having internal corridors and clever use of the internal space in the apartments.

Architects , and others built the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates, now a World Heritage Site, consisting of thousands of homes built in and around Berlin, including the Horseshoe Estate (named for its shape), and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; estate (named after a local restaurant). In Frankfurt the architect lead the New Frankfurt public housing project, in which over 12,000 apartments were built 1925–1930. May ran his own sizable research facility to investigate, for instance, air-flow in various floorplan configurations, construction techniques, etc. The Austrian architect applied the principles of Taylorism to the kitchen workspace and developed the Frankfurt kitchen while working for .
Beyond technical research May also published two magazines and embarked on a significant public-relations project, with films and classes and public exhibitions, to make acceptable to the public. In the late 1920s the principles of equal access to (&#x27;light, air and sun&#x27;) and the social effects of a state-guaranteed (&quot;minimum subsistence level&quot;) became a matter of lively popular debate all over Germany. One indirect result of this publicity was the American housing movement: a young Catherine Bauer attended one of May&#x27;s conferences in 1930, and wrote her influential book &quot;Modern Housing&quot; (1934) based on research done in Frankfurt and with Dutch architect .

Increasing pressure from the rising Nazis brought this era to an end in 1933. A majority of the German public housing experts had social democrat or communist sympathies and were forced out of the country.

In East Germany, the communist administration built monolithic apartment blocks and estates. Most new residential buildings from the 1960s onward were built in this style, as it was a quick and relatively cheap way to solve the country&#x27;s severe housing shortage, which had been caused by wartime bombing raids and the large influx of German refugees from further east.

=== Hungary ===

 (short form: ) is the name of a type of block of flats (panel buildings) in Hungary. It was the main housing type built in the Socialist era. From 1959 to 1990 788,000 panel flats were built in Hungary. About 2 million people, about one fifth of the country&#x27;s total population, live in these flats. The Hungarian government and local municipalities began a renovation program during the 2000s. In the program they have insulated these buildings, replaced the old doors and windows with multi-layer thermo glass, renewed the heating system and colored the buildings in a more pleasant way.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, public housing and halting sites (sites used by semi-nomadic Traveller communities) have been built by local authorities and are known as Local Authority Accommodation. Dublin Corporation and the former Dublin County Council provided the lion&#x27;s share of Irish local authority housing, with County Longford having the largest ratio of local authority to private housing in the state.

Large-scale social housing was erected in the 1930s and 1960s, with both cases following slum clearance. Critics argue that the National Building Agency focused too much on housing delivery, and failed to deliver retail and other services.

The government has promoted tenant purchase on favourable terms, and many former social housing areas are now completely or almost completely privately owned. Housing associations, or independent, nonprofit charities, now play a significant role in rental social housing provision. As the Irish state&#x27;s ability to borrow is diminished government policy favours an increased role for private financing of housing associations instead of capital grants for local authorities. Ireland currently faces a severe shortage of social and council housing, and is experiencing a housing and homelessness crisis.

=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, the rent for the cheaper rental homes is kept low through governmental oversight and regulation. These types of homes are known as .

In practice this is accomplished by non-profit private housing foundations or associations (). Due to frequent mergers the number of these organizations dropped to around 430 by 2009. They manage 2.4 million dwellings. The majority of low-rent apartments in the Netherlands are owned by such organisations. Since the policy changed in 1995 the social housing organizations have become financially independent, focusing on their role as social entrepreneurs. In most Dutch municipalities there came to exist a certain minimum capacity of social housing throughout the last decades. In many cities such as Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht the percentage of social housing approaches or even passes 50 percent. The public (financial) supervision is done by the central fund for housing ().

The Dutch housing policy is based on a concept of universal access to affordable housing for all and the prevention of segregation. As of 2020, the Dutch government is attempting to build 10,000 housing units for the homeless, by 2022. There is a Homeownership Guarantee Fund to support the National Mortgage Guarantee, which provides access to finance and purchase owner-occupied housing.

A 2025 study found that the Dutch public housing system entails a misallocation of housing with welfare losses. The study found that the Dutch system of &quot;public housing induces a transfer of housing from younger households, single-person households and households from outside the region to older households, larger households and households from the region.&quot;

=== Romania ===

The skyline of many Romanian cities became dominated by standardized apartment blocks under the former communist government&#x27;s policy of tower bloc construction. Beginning in 1974, systematization consisted largely of the demolition and reconstruction of existing villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a &quot;multilaterally developed socialist society&quot;. In 2012, 2.7 million flats date from the communist period, accounting for 37% of total housing in Romania and for about 70% in cities and towns. Subsequent to post-communist privatization, the homeownership rate in this form of housing reached of 99.9%. The new Home Owner Associations (HOAs) were challenged internally by the cumulative effect of defaulting contributions, lack of affordability and the established practice of casual resident service in HOAs, which often triggered mismanagement. On the other hand, HOAs were challenged from outside by non-effective mechanisms to address their internal problems, such as non-existent fast court procedures against defaulting, poor financial assistance to socially disadvantaged households and a private sector unprepared to take on condominium management.

=== Spain ===

Spaniards&#x27; reluctance to home rental, and government spending cuts in the 1980s, reduced rented public housing in Spain to a minimum. Rented public houses were relatively common in the Franco era (1939–75). With the advent of democracy and the 1978 Constitution, the right to housing became guaranteed, and the management of social housing depended mostly on the autonomous regions. This resulted in a wide variety of laws, which make the issue highly dependent on the region.

In spite of this, a scheme for (VPO) has been widely used, consisting of local councils allowing for building contractors and developers to build in public sites or with public loans on condition that a certain percentage of apartments remain subsidized and under control of the local authorities. This is known as (&#x27;privately developed&#x27;), as opposed to the (&#x27;publicly developed&#x27;), in which the whole property is owned and managed by a government authority. Publicly developed housing is made almost exclusively for owner-occupation, not rent, and made up 11% of the housing stock in 2010.

A new plan () was put forward by the government, aiming to make near a million homes available for public housing, relying both on new construction and refurbishment of unused houses.
Major parts of Spanish cities have been expanded in the last 20 years with projects heavily dependent on public and collective housing projects, which has stressed its importance inside the main architecture schools, that have answered the challenge with the development of several specialized courses and formation plans, such as the Madrid UPM – ETH Zurich combined MCH Master in Collective Housing.

=== Sweden ===

Swedish public housing, handled by (public-good housing companies), consists mainly apartments owned by the local council. Unlike many other countries, Swedish public housing has never had any income restrictions. Instead, for large parts of the period between 1920 and 1990 (for instance, during the era of Million Programme), public housing companies such as were the major operators in housing projects as well as in projects aiming to acquire old and worn down buildings. Although not carrying out housebuilding nor acquisition projects in recent times, the policies lead to a ubiquitous presence of publicly owned buildings throughout the cities of Sweden, including attractive urban areas, with a rather wide range of income among the tenants.

New regulations, implemented in the first decade of the 21st century, have enabled tenants in public housing to buy their buildings, which has led to a significant loss of public housing in attractive urban areas.

=== Slovakia and Czechia ===
Forms of housing projects may vary in Slovakia. In the former Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic and Slovakia) during the communist era, a construction of large housing estates (, ) was an important part of building plans in the former Czechoslovakia. The government wanted to provide large quantities of fast and affordable housing and to slash costs by employing uniform designs over the whole country. They also sought to foster a &quot;collectivist nature&quot; in people. People living in these housing projects can either usually own their apartments or rent them, usually through a private landlord. There&#x27;s usually a mix of social classes in these housing projects.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom public housing is often referred to by the British public as &quot;council housing&quot; and &quot;council estates&quot;, based on the historical role of district and borough councils in running public housing. Mass council house building began in about 1920 in order to replace older and dilapidated properties. This followed the 1919 &#x27;Addison&#x27; Act and the provision of central state subsidies; some local authority or municipal housing was provided before 1914.

Housing was a major policy area under Wilson&#x27;s Labour government, 1964 to 1970, with an accelerated pace of new building, as there was still a great deal of unfit housing needing replacement. Tower blocks, first built in the 1950s, featured prominently in this era. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the nation&#x27;s housing total, while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966.

Allowing for demolitions, 1.3 million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970. To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income house buyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments). This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes.

Since the 1970s, non-profit housing associations have been operating an increasing share of social housing properties in the United Kingdom. From 1996 they have also been known as Registered Social Landlords (RSLs), and public housing has been referred to as &quot;social housing&quot; to encompass both councils and RSLs. Despite being non-profit based, RSLs generally charge higher rents than councils. However, the Westminster Government introduced a &quot;rent re-structuring&quot; policy for housing associations in England in 2002, which aimed to bring council and RSL rents into line in England by 2012. Local planning departments may require private-sector developers to offer &quot;affordable housing&quot; as a condition of planning permission (section 106 agreement). This accounts for another £700m of Government funding each year for tenants in part of the United Kingdom. As of 2012, Housing Associations are now also referred to as &quot;Private Registered Providers of Social Housing&quot; (PRPs).

Local authorities have been discouraged from building council housing since 1979 following the election of Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. The Parker Morris standard was abolished for those that were built, resulting in smaller room sizes and fewer facilities. The Right to Buy was introduced, resulting in the move of some of the best stock from public tenanted to private owner occupation.

Since the year 2000, &quot;choice-based lettings&quot; (CBL) have been introduced to help ensure social housing was occupied speedily as tenants moved. This can still favour the local over the non-local prospective tenant. In a number of local authority areas, due to the shortage of council housing, three out of four properties may be designated for priority cases (those living in poor overcrowded conditions, with medical or welfare needs, or needing family support) or homeless applicants in order to meet the councils&#x27; legal obligations to rehouse people in need. The percentage of properties set aside for vulnerable groups will vary dependent on the demand for council housing in the area. All local authorities have a Housing Strategy to ensure that council houses are let fairly and fulfil the council&#x27;s legal obligations; deal with people in need; and contribute to sustainability of housing estates, neighbourhood regeneration, and social inclusion.

The 1997–2010 Labour Government wished to move council housing away from local authority management. At first, this was through Large Scale Voluntary Transfers (LSVT) of stock from councils to Housing Associations (HAs). Not all council property could be transferred, as in some local authorities, their housing stock was in poor condition and had a capital value less than the remaining debts from construction costs—in effect, the council stock was in negative equity. In some local authority areas, the tenants rejected the transfer option.

The Labour Government introduced a &quot;third way&quot;: the Arms Length Management Organisation (ALMO), where the housing stock stays with the Local Authority but is managed by a not-for-profit organisation at arm&#x27;s length from the Local Authority. It also introduced the Decent Homes programme, a capital fund to bring social housing up to a modern physical standard. To use this fund, the manager, whether ALMO or HA, had to achieve a 2 or 3 star rating from its inspection by the Audit Commission. This was intended to drive up management standards. Council landlords cannot access this funding, another incentive to transfer management of council housing to an ALMO or HA.

Governments since the early 1990s have also encouraged &quot;mixed tenure&quot; in regeneration areas and on &quot;new-build&quot; housing estates, offering a range of ownership and rental options, with a view to engineering social harmony through including &quot;social housing&quot; and &quot;affordable housing&quot; options. A recent research report has argued that the evidence base for tenure mixing remains thin. Social housing occupants may be stigmatised and forced to use a poor door that is separate and less convenient than the door the unsubsidised occupants use and social housing may be less desirably situated.

After the adoption of austerity policies in 2010 the traditional &quot;safety net&quot; model was maintained by the devolved administrations like the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Most UK social housing tenants have the right to swap homes with another tenant even if their landlords are different. This is called a &quot;mutual exchange&quot;. As of 2017, in England, local authorities can destinate homeless households in local tenancies, whereas in Scotland social housing remained the first chosen policy. According to the Museum of Homelessness, in 2020 the UK recorded at least 976 deaths among homeless people. In 2019 England and Wales estimated 778 deaths with an increase of 7.2% on the previous year.

=== Former Soviet Union ===


In the Soviet Union, most of the houses built after World War II were usually 3–5 stories high, with small apartments. In these boroughs, the goal was saving space and creating as many apartments as possible. Construction starting in the 1970s favored 9- and 16-story concrete panel municipal housing in major cities, 7–12 stories in smaller urban areas. These housing projects are still used in some countries, especially in countries in central and eastern Europe, and most of them are slowly being renovated.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===

Public housing in Australia, also referred to as &quot;housing commission&quot;, is managed by the states, with funding provided by both the state and federal governments. Policies vary by state, but generally, eligibility is based on personal or household income, asset limits and residency requirements. The allocation of public housing is typically done through a priority system where the applicants in the greatest need are housed first.

There are over 300,000 public housing dwellings in Australia, consisting of low-density housing on master-planned estates located in suburban areas, and also inner-city high-rise apartments in Melbourne and Sydney.

In recent decades, rooming and relief housing for the homeless have both been privatised, and in recent years this housing has been sold off to avoid maintenance costs and capitalise on sales in Australia’s booming property market. In Melbourne, public housing stocks have been in decline for some time, sparking the 2016 Bendigo Street housing dispute in which homeless people are being housed by the community campaign in homes left empty by the state government.

In 2016, a study by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute found an interesting effect of providing public housing to those living in poverty and who are at risk of losing their homes. When poor Western Australians were granted access to public housing, they began to rely on the region&#x27;s healthcare system less, with immense savings for Western Australia. The reduction in the stress on hospitals, emergency rooms, and other forms of medical care projected to over $16 million saved for Western Australia per annum.

Recently, in a move to address the public housing crisis, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced an allocation of $2 billion to states and territories specifically for the development of social housing. This measure is part of the federal government&#x27;s commitment to tackling housing affordability and homelessness across Australia. The Housing Minister has proposed a guaranteed annual expenditure of $500 million on public housing. However, this policy is contingent on garnering crossbench support to ensure its implementation.

=== New Zealand ===

Private companies (such as the New Zealand Company) which fostered early organised European settlement in New Zealand constructed immigration barracks to serve as temporary accommodation for their new arrivals.

The Workers&#x27; Dwellings Act of 1905 resulted in the New Zealand Government commissioning the building of 646 houses.

In 1937 the First Labour Government launched a major public-housing system—it became known as &quot;state housing&quot;—for citizens unable to afford private rents. Most state housing built between 1937 and the mid-1950s consisted of detached two-to-three-bedroom cottage-style houses; only 1.5% of state houses in 1949 formed part of apartment blocks, all of them in Auckland or in greater Wellington. After World War II ended in 1945, local authorities also started providing social housing, mainly for elderly people with low incomes.

<doc id="177922" wikidata="Q741051" url="?curid=177922" title="Catacombs of Rome">
<text>The Catacombs of Rome () are ancient catacombs, underground burial places in and around Rome, of which there are at least forty, some rediscovered since 1578, others even as late as the 1950s. 

There are more than fifty catacombs in the underground of Rome in which about 150 km of tunnels run.

Though most famous for Christian burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together, Jews and also adherents of a variety of pagan Roman religions were buried in catacombs, beginning in the 2nd century AD, occasioned by the ancient Roman ban on burials within a city, and also as a response to overcrowding and shortage of land. The most extensive and perhaps the best known is the Christian Catacomb of Callixtus located near the Park of the Caffarella, but there are other sites, both Christian and not, scattered around the city, some of which are now engulfed by modern urban sprawl.

The Christian catacombs are extremely important for the history of Early Christian art, as they contain the great majority of examples from before about 400 AD, in fresco and sculpture, as well as gold glass medallions (these, like most bodies, have been removed). The Jewish catacombs are similarly important for the study of Jewish culture at this early period.
== Etymology ==
The word &quot;catacombs&quot; comes from the Latin root word &quot;catatumbas&quot; meaning either &quot;among the tombs&quot; or, according to other translations from the original Late Latin, &quot;next to the quarry&quot;. The later translation stems from the first excavations done to create the catacombs system, which was conducted outside of Rome near the quarry.

== Precursors ==

The Etruscan civilization dominated a territory including the area which now includes Rome from perhaps 900 to 100 BC. Like many other European peoples, it had buried its dead in excavated underground chambers, such as the Tomb of the Capitals, and less complex tumuli. In contrast, the original Roman custom had been cremation of the human body, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, urn, or ash-chest, often deposited in a columbarium or &quot;dovecote&quot;. Rome faced two problems in the 2nd century CE: overpopulation and a lack of land. The city was growing, and many of the buildings were four or five stories tall. Since burials were not allowed inside the city walls, and early Christians did not agree with the pagan practice of cremating their dead, communal underground cemeteries provided a practical alternative. From about the 2nd century AD, inhumation (burial of unburnt human remains) became customary, either in graves or, for those who could afford them, in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved. By the 4th century, burial had overtaken cremation as the usual practice, and the construction of tombs had grown greater and spread throughout the empire. Jews and Christians preferred burial due to the idea of preserving the dead body for the resurrection. Considerable tracts of the ancient roads leading out of Rome and other Roman cities, like the Via Appia to this day, had monumental tombs running alongside them. These would inevitably cost a fortune to construct, whereas clearly in digging out of the catacombs would be less expensive. 

Despite widespread popular modern ideas, these tunnels were probably not used for regular worship at first, but simply for burial. However, extending pre-existing Roman customs, memorial services, and celebrations of the anniversaries of Christian martyrs took place there. There are sixty known subterranean burial chambers in Rome. They were built outside the walls along main Roman roads, like the Via Appia, the Via Ostiense, the Via Labicana, the Via Tiburtina and the Via Nomentana. Names of the catacombs—like St. Calixtus and St. Sebastian, which is alongside Via Appia—refer to martyrs that may have been buried there. However, about 80% of the excavations used for Christian burials date to after the time of the persecutions.

== Discoveries ==
Through research, it has been found that the population&#x27;s diet consisted of freshwater fish. Sample D9-W-XVI-8, considered to be a two-year-old child, shows that children in Ancient Rome were breastfed and this child, in particular, had not yet been weaned off its mother. This results from the fact that the δ15N values had not begun to decline.

Fish had intertwined secular and religious aspects in Roman society. For one thing, it was a staple of the daily diet. It also had a variety of significance for Christians, for whom it was not only a common food, as for other Romans, but featured as a symbol in Christian iconography and was consumed at meals held to commemorate the dead.

== Christian catacombs ==
Roman law forbade burial places within city limits and so all burial places, including the catacombs, were located outside the walls of the city. The first large-scale catacombs in the vicinity of Rome were dug from the 2nd century onwards. They were carved in &quot;tufa&quot; (tuff), a type of volcanic rock which is relatively soft to dig into but subsequently hardens.

Christian catacombs existed as a burial ground for early Christians accompanied by inscriptions and early wall art. Although catacombs were of Jewish origin in the first century, by the end of the sixth century there were over sixty Christian catacombs. These catacombs served as a connector for various Christian communities through the underlying concepts of socio-economic status shown within the art. Additionally, the art showed a story of how Christians in the first couple of centuries viewed the world and their idealistic view of how it should be.

According to L. Michael White, the catacombs of Rome have a place in the historiography of how early Christianity developed. This is because it has often been said those catacombs were good hiding places, and that when Christians were persecuted by the Roman Empire, they would go there to hold their worship.

However, White believes Christians did not use the catacombs of Rome to secretly hold their worship during times of persecutions. He says that they did not do so, in the first place because Christians were not persecuted on a regular basis by the Roman Empire, and in the second place because the larger rooms or chambers within the catacombs were not used for regular worship, the Eucharist or assembly by Christians. White says that those catacombs&#x27; larger rooms, which had some benches along their walls and were appropriate to hold eucharistic assemblies, were in fact used by Christians to &quot;hol[d] meals for the dead&quot;. He states such &quot;funerary meals&quot; were practised among most families of the city of Rome. Therefore, he explains, Christians, in their everyday life, regularly went down into the catacombs of Rome, not to hold assemblies or the Eucharist, but &quot;to hold memorial meals with dead members of their families, just like their pagan neighbors&quot;. V. Rutgers considers that &quot;[r]esearchers have long debunked the myth that Christians used the catacombs as hiding places in times of persecution&quot;, because when those persecutions took place, the exact locations of the catacombs of Rome were widely known. Frank K. Flinn considers that during the period of Christian persecutions and shortly after it, Christians held &quot;memorial rites and Eucharist&quot; near the graves of the more famous Christian martyrs. He adds that &quot;[c]ontrary to novel and movie lore,&quot; the catacombs of Rome &quot;were not used as hiding places for Christians.&quot; Author J. Osbourne says that &quot;nothing could be further from the truth&quot; than the idea that Christians inhabited the Catacombs during the period of persecution.
Christian art in the catacombs is split into three categories: iconographic, stylistic and technical. From the first to the sixth century, the art in Roman Christian catacombs progressively went into phases as well: an early phase, an Old Testament phase and a New Testament phase.

Excavators (fossors) built vast systems of galleries and passages on top of each other. They lie below the surface in an area of more than . Narrow steps that descend as many as four stories join the levels. Passages are about . Burial niches (loculi) were carved into walls. They are high and long. Bodies were placed in chambers in stone sarcophagi in their clothes and bound in linen. Then the chamber was sealed with a slab bearing the name, age and the day of death. The fresco decorations provide the main surviving evidence for Early Christian art, and initially show typically Roman styles used for decorating homes—with secular iconography adapted to a religious function. The catacomb of Saint Agnes is a small church. Some families were able to construct &quot;cubicula&quot; which would house various loculi and the architectural elements of the space would offer support for decoration. Another excellent place for artistic programs were the arcosolia.

== History of original tunnelling ==
The complex system of tunnels that would later be known as the catacombs were first excavated by the Etruscan people that lived in the region predating the Romans. These tunnels were first excavated in the process of mining for various rock resources such as limestone and sandstone. These quarries became the basis for later excavation, first by the Romans for rock resources and then by the Christians and Jews for burial sites and mass graves.

==Decline and rediscovery==

After the Edict of Milan in 313, many Roman Christians flocked to the catacombs in order to find relics from the martyrs, and would pillage through the remains. Due to this, vandalism became rampant in the catacombs. In 380, Christianity became a state religion. At first, many still desired to be buried in chambers alongside the martyrs. However, the practice of catacomb burial declined slowly, and the dead were increasingly buried in church cemeteries. In the 6th century, catacombs were used only for martyrs&#x27; memorial services, though some paintings were added as late as the 7th century, for example, a &quot;Saint Stephen&quot; in the Catacomb of Commodilla. Apparently, Ostrogoths, Vandals and Lombards that sacked Rome also violated the catacombs, presumably looking for valuables. By the 10th century, catacombs were practically abandoned, and holy relics were transferred to above-ground basilicas. Osbourne disputes this characterization, suggesting that the catacombs fell into disrepair following the move out of Rome for the Avignon Papacy and it was only because of the lack of sufficient religious practice in Rome that led the catacombs to completely fall into disrepair.

In the intervening centuries they remained forgotten until they were accidentally rediscovered in 1578, after which Antonio Bosio spent decades exploring and researching them for his &quot;Roma Sotterranea&quot; (1632). Archeologist Giovanni Battista de Rossi (1822–1894) published the first extensive professional studies about catacombs. In 1956 and 1959 Italian authorities found more catacombs near Rome. The catacombs have become an important monument of the early Christian church.

==Today==
Responsibility for the Christian catacombs lies with the Holy See, which has set up active official organizations for this purpose: the Pontifical Commission of Sacred Archaeology (Pontificia Commissione di Archeologia Sacra) directs excavations and restoration works, while the study of the catacombs is directed in particular by the Pontifical Academy of Archaeology. The administration of some sites is entrusted on a day-to-day basis to local clergy or religious orders who have an activity on or adjacent to the site. The supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus by the Salesian Fathers is well known. In the last years, with the growth of the internet, updated information is often available online, with an indication of a current street address, opening hours, fees, availability of guides in the different languages, size of groups permitted, and public transport. Like other historical sites in Italy, the catacombs are often not accessible at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week and may require online pre-booking. There are currently only 5 Catacombs open to the public; San Sebastiano, San Callisto, Priscilla, Domitilla and Sant&#x27;Agnese.

==Typology==
Roman catacombs are made up of underground passages (&quot;ambulacra&quot;), in the walls of which horizontal niches (&quot;loculi&quot;) were dug. These loculi, generally laid out in sequences (&quot;pilae&quot;) one above the other from floor or waist level, could each contain one or more bodies. When placed inside of loculi, bodies were usually covered in a shroud and often covered in lime, which helped to cover the smell of the decaying process. In order to make more money, fossors would often sell occupied loculi to other people. A loculus large enough to contain two bodies were referred to as a &quot;bisomus&quot;. Another type of burial, typical of Roman catacombs, was the &quot;arcosolium&quot;, consisting of a curved niche, enclosed under a carved horizontal marble slab. &quot;Cubicula&quot; (burial rooms containing loculi all for one family) and &quot;cryptae&quot; (chapels decorated with frescoes) are also commonly found in catacomb passages. When space began to run out, other graves were also dug in the floor of the corridors—these graves are called &quot;formae&quot;.

==List of catacombs in Rome==
The Roman catacombs, of which there are forty in the suburbs or former suburbs, were built along the consular roads out of Rome, such as the Via Appia, the Via Ostiensis, the Via Labicana, the Via Tiburtina and the Via Nomentana. With the exception of the Via Ostiensis (Italian: &quot;Via Ostiense&quot;), these ancient Latin terms are also the current Italian names for these roads. 

===Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter===

These catacombs are situated on the ancient Via Labicana, today Via Casilina in Rome, Italy, near the church of Santi Marcellino e Pietro ad Duas Lauros. Their name refers to the Christian martyrs Marcellinus and Peter who, according to tradition, were buried here, near the body of St. Tiburtius.

===Catacombs of Domitilla===
Close to the Catacombs of San Callisto are the large and impressive Catacombs of Domitilla (named after Saint Domitilla), spread over of caves.

In the beginning of 2009, at the request of the Vatican, the Divine Word Missionaries, a Roman Catholic Society of priests and Brothers, assumed responsibility as an administrator of St. Domitilla Catacombs.

===Catacombs of Commodilla===
These catacombs, on the Via Ostiensis, contain one of the earliest images of a bearded Christ. They originally held the relics of Saints Felix and Adauctus. Excavations on the Commodilla were conducted by Franciscan archaeologist Bellarmino Bagatti (1933–34).

===Catacombs of Generosa===

Located on the Campana Road, these catacombs are said to have been the resting place, perhaps temporarily, of Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix, Christian Martyrs who died in Rome during the Diocletian persecution (302 or 303).

===Catacombs of Praetextatus===
These are found along the Via Appia and were built at the end of the 2nd century. They consist of a vast underground burial area, at first in pagan then in Christian use, housing various tombs of Christian martyrs. In the oldest parts of the complex may be found the &quot;cubiculum of the coronation&quot;, with a rare depiction for that period of Christ being crowned with thorns, and a 4th-century painting of Susanna and the old men in the allegorical guise of a lamb and wolves.

===Catacombs of Priscilla===

The Catacomb of Priscilla, situated at the Via Salaria across from the Villa Ada, probably derives its name from the name of the landowner on whose land they were built. They are looked after by the Benedictine nuns of Priscilla.

===Catacombs of San Callisto===

Sited along the Appian way, these catacombs were built after 150 AD, with some private Christian hypogea and a funereal area directly dependent on the Catholic Church. It takes its name from the deacon Saint Callixtus, appointed by Pope Zephyrinus to administer this cemetery. On Callixtus&#x27; accession as pope, he enlarged the complex, that quite soon became the official one for the Roman Church. The arcades, where more than fifty martyrs and sixteen popes were buried, form part of a cemetery complex that occupies fifteen hectares. The Catacombs of San Callisto are around 90 acres large, 12 miles long and contain four levels, extending to a depth of more than 20 meters underground. Because of the large number of popes buried inside the catacombs, it has on occasion been called the &quot;Little Vatican&quot;.

===Catacombs of San Lorenzo===
Built into the hill beside San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, these catacombs are said to have been the final resting place of St. Lawrence. The church was built by Pope Sixtus III and later remodeled into the present nave. Sixtus also redecorated the shrine in the catacomb and was buried there.

===Catacombs of San Pancrazio===

Established underneath the San Pacrazio basilica which was built by Pope Symmachus on the place where the body of the young martyr Saint Pancras, or Pancratius, had been buried. In the 17th century, it was given to the Discalced Carmelites, who completely remodeled it. The catacombs house fragments of sculpture and pagan and early Christian inscriptions.

===Catacombs of San Sebastiano===
One of the smallest Christian cemeteries, this has always been one of the most accessible catacombs and is thus one of the least preserved (of the four original floors, the first is almost completely gone). On the left-hand end of the right-hand wall of the nave of the primitive basilica, rebuilt in 1933 on ancient remains, arches to end the middle of the nave of the actual church, built in the 13th century, are visible, along with the outside of the apse of the Chapel of the Relics; whole and fragmentary collected sarcophagi (mostly of 4th-century date) were found in excavations. This is where the martyrs Sebastian and Eutychius were buried.

Via a staircase down, one finds the arcades where varied cubicula (including the cubiculum of Giona&#x27;s fine four stage cycle of paintings, dating to the end of the 4th century). One then arrives at the restored crypt of S. Sebastiano, with a table altar on the site of the ancient one (some remains of the original&#x27;s base still survive) and a bust of Saint Sebastian attributed to Bernini. From here one reaches a platform, under which is a sandstone cavity ad catacumbas which once may have been named &quot;ad catacumbas&quot;, thus giving this and all other tombs of this type their name. Three mausolea of the second half of the 2nd century (but also in later use) open off the platform. The first one on the right, decorated on the outside with paintings of funereal banquets and the miracle of the calling out of Cerasa&#x27;s demons, on the inside contains paintings (including a ceiling painting of a Gorgon&#x27;s head) and inhumation burials and has a surviving inscription reading &quot;Marcus Clodius Hermes&quot;, the name of its owner. The second, called by some &quot;tomb of the Innocentiores&quot; (a burial club which owned it), has a refined stucco ceiling, Latin inscriptions in Greek characters, and a graffito with the initials of the Greek words for &quot;Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour&quot;. On the left is the mausoleum of Ascia, with an exterior wall painting of vine shoots rising from kantharoi up trompe-l&#x27;œil pillars.

A room called the &quot;Triglia&quot; rises from the platform, roughly in the middle of the basilica and cut into from above by the present basilica. This covered room was used for funereal banquets; the plastered walls have hundreds of graffiti by the devotees at these banquets, carved in the second half of the 3rd to the beginnings of the 4th century, with appeals to the apostle&#x27;s Peter and Paul. From the &quot;Trigilia&quot; one passed into an ancient ambulatory, which turns around into an apse: here is a collection of epitaphs and a model of all the mausolei, of the &quot;Triglia&quot; and of the Constantinian basilica. From here one descends into the &quot;Platonica&quot;, construction at the rear of the basilica that was long believed to have been the temporary resting place for Peter and Paul, but was in fact (as proved by excavation) a tomb for the martyr Quirinus, bishop of Sescia in Pannonia, whose remains were brought here in the 5th century. To the right of the &quot;Platonica&quot; is the chapel of Honorius III, adapted as the vestibule of the mausoleum, with interesting 13th-century paintings of Peter and Paul, the Crucifixion, saints, the Massacre of the Innocents, Madonna and Child, and other subjects. On the left is an apsidal mausoleum with an altar built against the apse: on the left wall, a surviving graffito reading &quot;domus Petri&quot; either hints at Peter having been buried here or testifies to the belief at the time the graffito was written that Peter was buried here.

===Catacombs of San Valentino===

The catacombs of San Valentino were dedicated to Saint Valentine. In the 13th century, the martyr&#x27;s relics were transferred to Basilica of Saint Praxedes.

===Catacombs of Sant&#x27;Agnese===
Built for the conservation and veneration of the remains of Saint Agnes of Rome. Agnes&#x27; bones are now conserved in the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese fuori le mura in Rome, built over the catacomb. Her skull is preserved in a side chapel in the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone in Rome&#x27;s Piazza Navona.

===Catacombs of via Anapo===
On the via Salaria, the Catacombs of via Anapo are datable to the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 4th century and contain diverse frescoes of biblical subjects.

===Jewish catacombs===
There are six known Jewish catacombs in Rome, two of which are open to the public: Vigna Randanini and Villa Torlonia.

The Jewish catacombs were discovered in 1918, and archaeological excavations continued for twelve years. The structure has two entrances, one on via Syracuse and the other inside Villa Torlonia. The catacombs extend for more than , and date back to the period between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and possibly remained in use until the 5th century. There are almost a century of epitaphs, but these do not show any examples of a particular belief, beyond some rare frescoes showing the classic Jewish religious symbols. Jewish Catacombs are distinguished from their Christian counterparts by various signs as well as the fact that Jewish people did not visit the dead in the Catacombs. Parts of the Old Testament and the symbol of a candlestick with seven branches have been spotted on the walls of Jewish Catacombs.

Due to high levels of humidity and temperature, bone preservation has been negatively affected in the catacombs. Scientists are unable to identify the sex of the dead due to the lack of preservation in the bones.

The other catacombs are not open to the public because of the instability of their structure and the presence of radon.

==Gallery of paintings from the catacombs of Rome==
In the Catacombs of Rome, there are many different pieces of artwork. Most artworks are religious in nature, some depicting important Christian rites such as baptism, or scenes and stories such as the tale of &quot;The Three Hebrews and the Fiery Furnace,&quot; or biblical figures such as Adam and Eve.

<doc id="177925" wikidata="Q2882468" url="?curid=177925" title="Bangai-O">
<text>Bangai-O is a multidirectional shooter developed by Treasure and released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 in Japan. It was ported to the Dreamcast worldwide shortly after with some gameplay changes and updated graphics and audio. The game places the player in control of a weaponized mech that can hover across large stages and fire at enemies all around them. The player must reach the end of each stage and defeat the boss, while avoiding hazards scattered across the map such as enemy mechs and gun turrets.

The initial ideas for &quot;Bangai-O&quot; came from Treasure programmer Mitsuru Yaida who wanted to challenge himself by programming an extreme number of bullets on the screen at once. Journalists agree that Yaida was most likely inspired by the 1984 Japanese computer game &quot;Hover Attack&quot;. The team developed the game with a focus on creating enjoyable gameplay, and opted for simple graphical effects to preserve the game&#x27;s speed. &quot;Bangai-O&quot; was released on the Nintendo 64 and was limited to a run of 10,000 copies because of publisher Entertainment Software Publishing&#x27;s belief it had niche appeal. The team replaced most of the graphics and audio, changed some gameplay elements, and re-released it on the Dreamcast three months later, a version later released internationally.

&quot;Bangai-O&quot; received positive reviews from game journalists. Many critics compared it to shoot &#x27;em ups and action games of the past, praising its retro gameplay and aesthetics. They also commended the level design for keeping the game interesting throughout. Some reviews, especially those for the Dreamcast version, were more critical of the graphics and believed the game&#x27;s value was primarily in its nostalgic gameplay. The game received two sequels: &quot;Bangai-O Spirits&quot; (2008) for the Nintendo DS and &quot;Bangai-O HD: Missile Fury&quot; (2011) for the Xbox 360.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Bangai-O&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling multidirectional shooter. The player controls a weaponized mech that is piloted by the two main characters, Riki and his sister Mami. The story follows Riki and Mami in their efforts to stop criminals from smuggling fruit contraband to finance their evil deeds. The player can fly freely around each of the game&#x27;s 44 stages, and must find and destroy the boss in each stage to advance. The mech can shoot in eight directions, and the type of ammo is dependent on which character is piloting. The two pilots can be interchanged instantaneously, Riki fires homing missiles and Mami shoots reflecting projectiles which bounce off walls. The stages are populated with destroyable buildings and obstacles, as well as some walls that are opened by switches. There are also hazards such as gun turrets and enemy mechs which fire projectiles at the player. The player has a health meter but no brief invulnerability period after being hit, so can die instantly if hit with a barrage of fire. Destroyed enemies and objects yield fruit which replenishes a meter that is used to power the &quot;scatter bomb&quot; attack. This attack can be charged to release up to 100 shots scattered in all directions at once. Hitting all 100 shots on enemies will open a small portal to a shop where the player can get upgrades such as improved shot damage.

The Dreamcast version of &quot;Bangai-O&quot;, released after the initial Nintendo 64 version, features significant differences in gameplay which results in a more streamlined experience. In the Dreamcast version, the bullets are stronger, and destroying objects and enemies refills the bomb attack meter instead of fruit which now only add to the player&#x27;s score. The bomb attack also can no longer be charged to a specific number of missiles, but is dependent on the player&#x27;s proximity to enemy projectiles. In the Dreamcast version, up to 400 missiles can be shot at once in comparison to 100 on the Nintendo 64. Also, the shop is removed. Instead, the game includes power-ups that can be found among environment wreckage. There are also other minor differences such as scoring differences and more structure and enemy types.

== Development ==

The idea for &quot;Bangai-O&quot; came from Treasure employee Mitsuru Yaida (commonly known by the pseudonym &quot;Yaiman&quot;). He remembered playing an older shooting game that amazed him with the sheer number of bullets that could be rendered on the screen at once. Even though Yaiman and other staff behind the game have not identified the game, industry analysts agree that the game is almost certainly &quot;Hover Attack&quot; (1984) for Japanese computers. Yaiman began thinking about the programming challenges involved in detecting when the bullets collide with other objects, and started work on a prototype. He later received permission from company president Masato Maegawa to pull in other staff and work towards producing a full game. Yaiman served as the main programmer and &quot;General Manager&quot;. About ten people worked on &quot;Bangai-O&quot;.

Treasure developed the game with a focus on creating addictive and fast gameplay, with less focus on graphics. They opted for large and fast 2D graphical effects and anime artwork to preserve their style. One of the artists on the team, Koichi Kimura, had just finished working on &quot;Guardian Heroes&quot; (1996), another 2D game. With more powerful development hardware available, he wanted to challenge himself the possibilities and limits of 2D graphics. The story is based on typical Japanese yakuza revenge plays.

== Release ==
Treasure announced &quot;Bangai-O&quot; for the Nintendo 64 in June 1999. It was released on September 3 the same year. Because of the game&#x27;s niche appeal, the publisher Entertainment Software Publishing (ESP) only shipped 10,000 units.

The Dreamcast version was first released in Japan on December 9, 1999. This version had improved graphics and audio over the Nintendo 64 original. Many of the sprites were reworked, background animations were added, and the game now featured CD-quality music. By February 2000, publishers were researching the possibility of localizing the Dreamcast version for Western audiences. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in May that year, &quot;IGN&quot; reported that a company had begun localizing the game, and had given it English menus and renamed it &quot;Bangai-O&quot; from its obscure Japanese title, &quot;Bakuretsu Muteki Bangaioh&quot;. In December, industry newcomer Conspiracy Entertainment announced they were localizing &quot;Bangai-O&quot; along with another Dreamcast game, &quot;Record of Lodoss War&quot; (2000). The Dreamcast version was planned for release on February 27, 2001, but was eventually released on March 21.

== Reception ==
&quot;Bangai-O&quot; received positive reviews for its initial Nintendo 64 release. Critics enjoyed the manic and unique gameplay that they believed was characteristic of Treasure&#x27;s video games. Most compared it to older shoot &#x27;em ups and action games. Eric Mylonas of &quot;GameFan&quot; called it a mix between the free-floating gameplay of &quot;Sub-Terrania&quot; (1994) and the rotating shooting action of &quot;Omega Boost&quot; (1999). He appreciated it as one of the few shooters on the Nintendo 64, and compared its aesthetic missile shooting style to &quot;Macross&quot;. Peter Bartholow (&quot;GameSpot&quot;) wrote that the game was &quot;in typical Treasure fashion...an addictive and original hodgepodge of genres and game mechanics that defy easy explanation&quot;. Journalists commended the variety in the game&#x27;s design that kept it feeling fresh throughout. Anoop Gantayat (&quot;IGN&quot;) wrote that the level design made good use of each character&#x27;s shooting mode. Bartholow and Martin Kitts (&quot;N64 Magazine&quot;) both praised the level design for forcing the player to change their tactics level to level. Bartholow called the building elements for the levels &quot;versatile&quot;, and went on to say some levels were puzzles, others had racing aspects, and others were &quot;insane blastfests&quot;. Gantayat argued that &quot;Bangai-O&quot; is &quot;a game that you either love, or just don&#x27;t understand yet&quot;.

&quot;Bangai-O&quot; was praised for its retro gameplay and aesthetics. Kitts and Mylonas wrote that it looked and played like a Super NES game and pointed out how some effects were reminiscent of the 16-bit system&#x27;s Mode 7 rotation effects. Mylonas explained further that it looked like a Super NES game with less slowdown, a higher resolution, and more color. Rick Mears (&quot;GameFan&quot;) wrote that it felt like &quot;&quot; (1982) with its unique control style, and called it an &quot;old school 2D treat&quot;. Although the game was not in 3D like most other games at the time, critics felt the 2D graphics were satisfactory enough. Gantayat pointed out the scatter bomb attack that fills the screen with bullets &quot;a momentous occasion...one of the main parts of the &quot;Bangai-O&quot; experience&quot;. Mears praised the game for not slowing down when rendering scenes like this.

Reviews for the Dreamcast version carried the same sentiments as the Nintendo 64 version in regards to the frantic and unique gameplay. Gantayat (&quot;IGN&quot;) and Matt van Stone (&quot;GameFan&quot;) preferred this new version because of the updated graphics, new CD-quality soundtrack, and more streamlined gameplay. With this release, journalists were more critical of the graphics and audio, commenting more heavily on the game&#x27;s appeal primarily as a nostalgic shooter. The staff at &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; wrote that it was a fun in a nostalgic way, but will not hold a player&#x27;s attention for very long. A critic of &quot;PlanetDreamcast&quot; wrote that the graphics were bland and lacked polish, and the focus was on the gameplay. They argued that &quot;Bangai-O&quot; is a game designed for &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers and commented: &quot;Are games coming out today missing something from the glory days of twitch gameplay...Or am I just too jaded by the 3-D graphics, complex mission objectives, and controls of most modern games[?]&quot; In a brief but critical review, &quot;Dreamcast Magazine UK&quot; argued that it was a nearly direct port of the Nintendo 64 version, and called it &quot;unimaginative&quot;. Human Tornado of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;This well-designed 2D shooter will satisfy fans of old-school arcade ation games, but &quot;Bangai-O&quot; doesn&#x27;t break any new ground. Still, it&#x27;s a very challenging game that action gamers can groove to.&quot;

Despite never having been reviewed, the Dreamcast version was nominated at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for &quot;Best Console Shooter Game&quot;, but lost to &quot;&quot;.

== Sequels ==
&quot;Bangai-O&quot; received two sequels. The first, &quot;Bangai-O Spirits&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2008, and the second, &quot;Bangai-O HD: Missile Fury&quot;, was released exclusively on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade in 2011. The games feature most of the same core gameplay ideas as the first game, but evolve on them with more weapons and gameplay elements. Both games included level editors, and the latter features multiplayer modes.

<text>Kitengela is a municipality in the Kajiado County of Kenya, located 34 Kilometres south of the capital Nairobi, forming part of the greater Metropolitan Area. Kitengela began as The Kitengela group ranch, made up of 18,292 ha and 214 registered members which was subdivided in 1988 in efforts by the Government to encourage private land ownership in pastoral systems. This had the aim of intensifying and commercializing livestock production. After subdivision of the group ranch, land fragmentation and sales have continued at a steady and escalating pace. The human population within the Kitengela area has more than doubled in the last 10 years, from 6548 in 1989 to 17,347 in 1999 to 58,167 in 2009. There is also a town named Kitengela in the area.

Close to Nairobi National Park is also the Kitengela Game Conservation Area populated with buffalo, Masai giraffe, eastern black rhino, Common eland, impala, Grant&#x27;s and Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, common waterbuck and Defassa waterbuck, hippopotamus, common warthog, olive baboon, monkeys and the attendant carnivores – lion, spotted hyena, cheetah, side-striped and black-backed jackals, African golden wolves, bat-eared fox and smaller carnivores.

The diversity of species is decreasing in the Kitengela area adjacent to the Nairobi National Park,
where land-uses not compatible with wildlife are increasing.

== Kitengela town ==

Kitengela is a town in Kajiado County just south of Nairobi and is part of the Nairobi Metropolitan Area. Kitengela is one of the fastest growing urban areas of Kenya according to census data of 2019, having tripled in population inflows since 2009. It has an urban population of 154,436 people.

Kitengela is close to Athi River town in Machakos County in the former Eastern Province, while Kitengela belongs to Kajiado County in the former Rift Valley Province. Kitengela is growing quickly and is expanding with a huge influx of middle class Nairobians who have built lovely gated communities and businesses in an unprecedented construction boom, thanks to the affordable land compared to Nairobi city as well as availability of 5 cement companies and growing infrastructural amenities. Residents describe Kitengela as &quot;having the best of both worlds,&quot; given its close proximity to Nairobi but easy-going slow-paced rural feel, as well as the friendly, collaborative nature of the resident population.

Kitengela is famous for &quot;nyama choma&quot; (roast meat) – a Kenyan delicacy. The town has a wide variety of restaurants that serve this delicacy. Some of the most famous ones include the famous Yukos, Enkare, Arusha Meat Den and numerous more.

Kitengela has a wide variety of financial institutions and saccos (savings and credit cooperatives) that have flooded the town to finance the construction boom as well as cater to the soaring middle class population. It also has seen a boom in posh hotels, clubs and other entertainment facilities. In recent times Kitengela has developed a reputation for new, unique cutting-edge entertainment facilities such as Charlie&#x27;s Bistro, Sparrows, Quiver, Guru, and 034, a 5 star club nestled in an airplane have sprung up in the town – a first for Kenya.

As Kitengela&#x27;s middle class population has boomed, so has its wide variety of high end schools and universities to cater to the children of the middle classes. Some of the schools include Kitengela International Schools, Acacia Crest, Chuna Preparatory, Orchard Schools, Nova Pioneer Kitengela and numerous more. Some of the universities and colleges include KCA University Kitengela campus, Kitengela Institute of Management Studies, KAG East University, East African University, RAF International University among others.

Kitengela&#x27;s gated communities for the middle classes include Chuna, Milimani, Royal Gates, New Valley, Muigai Prestige, New World Gardens, Safaricom 1 &amp; 2 estates, Police Sacco Estate, EPZ estate, Fountain View, Riverside, Upper Valley, Kenpipe Gardens, Acacia and many more. These estates have seen an unprecedented boom due to the fact that most of them are controlled, not allowing unsightly flats or small businesses/kiosks within their gated walls. Chuna Estate, Royal Finesse and Royal Gates are considered among the best organised of them but many more are coming up each year. With the construction and completion of Isinya pipeline road, as well as the ongoing construction of the Mlolongo to Waiyaki Way expressway, as well as Konza City Metropolis nearby, Kitengela is poised to experience even more growth and development.

Kitengela is served by Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Athi River SGR station as well as a future commuter rail station that is currently under construction that will connect commuters to Nairobi CBD.

<text>A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called &quot;quicklime&quot; (calcium oxide). The chemical equation for this reaction is: CaCO3 + heat → CaO + CO2

This reaction can take place at anywhere above , but is generally considered to occur at (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO2 is 1 atmosphere), but a temperature around (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO2 is 3.8 atmospheres) is usually used to make the reaction proceed quickly. Excessive temperature is avoided because it produces unreactive, &quot;dead-burned&quot; lime.

Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) can be formed by mixing quicklime with water.

== History ==
=== Pre-pottery Neolithic ===

==== In plaster, proto-pottery, and mortar ====

Because it is so readily made by heating limestone, lime must have been known from the earliest times, and all the early civilizations used it in building mortars and as a stabilizer in mud renders and floors. According to finds at &#x27;Ain Ghazal in Jordan, Yiftahel in Palestine, and Abu Hureyra in Syria dating to 7500–6000 BCE, the earliest use of lime was mostly as a binder on floors and in plaster for coating walls. This use of plaster may in turn have led to the development of proto-pottery, made from lime and ash. In mortar, the oldest binder was mud. According to finds at Catal Hüyük in Turkey, mud was soon followed by clay, and then by lime in the 6th millennium BCE.

=== Lime use in agriculture and coal ===

Knowledge of its value in agriculture is also ancient, but agricultural use only became widely possible when the use of coal made it cheap in the coalfields in the late 13th century, and an account of agricultural use was given in 1523. The earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for small-scale manufacture a century ago. Because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the pre-industrial era, they were distributed by sea, and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports. Many preserved kilns are still to be seen on quaysides around the coasts of Britain.

=== Types of kilns ===
Permanent lime kilns fall into two broad categories: &quot;flare kilns&quot; also known as &quot;intermittent&quot; or &quot;periodic&quot; kilns; and &quot;draw kilns&quot; also known as &quot;perpetual&quot; or &quot;running&quot; kilns. In a flare kiln, a bottom layer of coal was built up and the kiln above filled solely with chalk. The fire was alight for several days, and then the entire kiln was emptied of the lime.

In a draw kiln, usually a stone structure, the chalk or limestone was layered with wood, coal or coke and lit. As it burnt through, lime was extracted from the bottom of the kiln, through the draw hole. Further layers of stone and fuel were added to the top.

=== Early kilns ===

The common feature of early kilns was an egg-cup shaped burning chamber, with an air inlet at the base (the &quot;eye&quot;), constructed of brick. Limestone was crushed (often by hand) to fairly uniform lumps – fine stone was rejected. Successive dome-shaped layers of limestone and wood or coal were built up in the kiln on grate bars across the eye. When loading was complete, the kiln was kindled at the bottom, and the fire gradually spread upwards through the charge. When burnt through, the lime was cooled and raked out through the base. Fine ash dropped out and was rejected with the &quot;riddlings&quot;.

Only lump stone could be used, because the charge needed to &quot;breathe&quot; during firing. This also limited the size of kilns and explains why kilns were all much the same size. Above a certain diameter, the half-burned charge would be likely to collapse under its own weight, extinguishing the fire. So kilns always made 25–30 tonnes of lime in a batch. Typically the kiln took a day to load, three days to fire, two days to cool and a day to unload, so a one-week turnaround was normal. The degree of burning was controlled by trial and error from batch to batch by varying the amount of fuel used. Because there were large temperature differences between the center of the charge and the material close to the wall, a mixture of underburned (i.e. high loss on ignition), well-burned and dead-burned lime was normally produced. Typical fuel efficiency was low, with 0.5 tonnes or more of coal being used per tonne of finished lime (15 MJ/kg).

=== Industrial scale production ===
Lime production was sometimes carried out on an industrial scale. One example at Annery in North Devon, England, near Great Torrington, was made up of three kilns grouped together in an &#x27;L&#x27; shape and was situated beside the Torrington canal and the River Torridge to bring in the limestone and coal, and to transport away the calcined lime in the days before properly metalled roads existed.

Sets of seven kilns were common. A loading gang and an unloading gang would work the kilns in rotation through the week.

A rarely used kiln was known as a &quot;lazy kiln&quot;.

===Australia===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the town of Waratah in Gippsland, Victoria, Australia produced a majority of the quicklime used in the city of Melbourne as well as around other parts of Gippsland. The town, now called Walkerville, was set on an isolated part of the Victorian coastline and exported the lime by ship. When this became unprofitable in 1926 the kilns were shut down. The present-day area, though having no town amenities as such, markets itself as a tourist destination. The ruins of the lime kilns can still be seen today.

A lime kiln also existed in Wool Bay, South Australia.
===Ukraine===
===United Kingdom===
The large kiln at Crindledykes near Haydon Bridge, Northumbria, was one of more than 300 in the county. It was unique to the area in having four draw arches to a single pot. As production was cut back, the two side arches were blocked up, but were restored in 1989 by English Heritage.

The development of the national rail network made the local small-scale kilns increasingly unprofitable, and they gradually died out through the 19th century. They were replaced by larger industrial plants. At the same time, new uses for lime in the chemical, steel and sugar industries led to large-scale plants. These also saw the development of more efficient kilns.

A lime kiln erected at Dudley, West Midlands (formerly Worcestershire) in 1842 survives as part of the Black Country Living Museum which opened in 1976, although the kilns were last used during the 1920s. It is now among the last in a region which was dominated by coalmining and limestone mining for generations until the 1960s.
===Other countries===
==Modern kilns==

===Shaft kilns===
The theoretical heat (the standard enthalpy) of reaction required to make high-calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple shaft kilns, similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current shaft kilns. Modern variants include regenerative and annular kilns. Output is usually in the range 100–500 tonnes per day.

====Counter-current shaft kilns====
The fuel is injected part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed in at the top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, in order to ensure uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical. Due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 °C in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime.

====Regenerative kilns====
These typically consist of a pair of shafts, operated alternately. First, when shaft A is the &quot;primary&quot; and B the &quot;secondary&quot; shaft, the combustion air is added from the top of shaft A, while fuel somewhat below via burner lances. The flame is top-bottom. The hot gases pass downward, cross to shaft B via the so-called &quot;channel&quot; and pass upward to exhaust of shaft B. At same time in both shafts cooling air is added from the bottom to cool the lime and to make exhaust of gases via the bottom of the kiln impossible via maintaining a positive pressure. The combustion air and cooling air leave the kiln jointly via exhaust on top of shaft B, preheating the stone. The direction of flow is reversed periodically (typically 5–10 times per hour) shaft A and B changing the role of &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; shaft. The kiln has three zones: preheating zone on the top, burning zone in the middle, and cooling zone close to the bottom. The cycling produces a long burning zone of constant, relatively low temperature (around 950 °C) that is ideal for the production of high quality soft burned reactive lime. With exhaust gas temperatures as low as 120 °C and lime temperature at kiln outlet in 80 °C range the heat loss of the regenerative kiln is minimal, fuel consumption is as low as 3.6 MJ/kg. Due to these features the regenerative kilns are today mainstream technology under conditions of substantial fuel costs. Regenerative kilns are built with 150 to 800 t/day output, 300 to 450 being typical.

====Annular kilns====
These contain a concentric internal cylinder. This gathers pre-heated air from the cooling zone, which is then used to pressurize the middle annular zone of the kiln. Air spreading outward from the pressurized zone causes counter-current flow upwards, and co-current flow downwards. This again produces a long, relatively cool calcining zone. Fuel consumption is in 4 to 4.5 MJ/kg range and the lime is typically medium burned.

===Rotary kilns===

Rotary kilns started to be used for lime manufacture at the start of the 20th century and now account for a large proportion of new installations if energy costs are less important. The early use of simple rotary kilns had the advantages that a much wider range of limestone size could be used, from fines upwards, and undesirable elements such as sulfur can be removed. On the other hand, fuel consumption was relatively high because of poor heat exchange compared with shaft kilns, leading to excessive heat loss in exhaust gases. Old fashioned &quot;long&quot; rotary kilns operate at 7 to 10 MJ/kg. Modern installations partially overcome this disadvantage by adding a preheater, which has the same good solids/gas contact as a shaft kiln, but fuel consumption is still somewhat higher, typically in range of 4.5 to 6 MJ/kg. In the design shown, a circle of shafts (typically 8–15) is arranged around the kiln riser duct. Hot limestone is discharged from the shafts in sequence, by the action of a hydraulic &quot;pusher plate&quot;. Kilns of 1000 tonnes per day output are typical. The rotary kiln is the most flexible of any lime kilns able to produce soft, medium, or hard burned as well as dead-burned lime or dolime.

===Gas cleaning===
All the above kiln designs produce exhaust gas that carries an appreciable amount of dust. Lime dust is particularly corrosive. Equipment is installed to trap this dust, typically in the form of electrostatic precipitators or bag filters. The dust usually contains a high concentration of elements such as alkali metals, halogens and sulfur.

==Carbon dioxide emissions==
The lime industry is a significant carbon dioxide emitter. The manufacture of one tonne of calcium oxide involves decomposing calcium carbonate, with the formation of 785 kg of CO2 in some applications, such as when used as mortar; this CO2 is later re-absorbed as the mortar goes off.

If the heat supplied to form the lime (3.75 MJ/kg in an efficient kiln) is obtained by burning fossil fuel it will release CO2: in the case of coal fuel 295 kg/t; in the case of natural gas fuel 206 kg/t. The electric power consumption of an efficient plant is around 20 kWh per tonne of lime. This additional input is the equivalent of around 20 kg CO2 per ton if the electricity is coal-generated. Thus, total emission may be around 1 tonne of CO2 for every tonne of lime even in efficient industrial plants, but is typically 1.3 t/t. However, if the source of heat energy used in its manufacture is a fully renewable power source, such as solar, wind, hydro or even nuclear; there may be no net emission of CO2 from the calcination process. Less energy is required in production per weight than portland cement, primarily because a lower temperature is required.

<text>Mosses are small, non-vascular flowerless plants in the taxonomic division Bryophyta (, ) &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. Bryophyta (&quot;sensu lato&quot;, Schimp. 1879) may also refer to the parent group bryophytes, which comprise liverworts, mosses, and hornworts. Mosses typically form dense green clumps or mats, often in damp or shady locations. The individual plants are usually composed of simple leaves that are generally only one cell thick, attached to a stem that may be branched or unbranched and has only a limited role in conducting water and nutrients. Although some species have conducting tissues, these are generally poorly developed and structurally different from similar tissue found in vascular plants. Mosses do not have seeds and after fertilisation develop sporophytes with unbranched stalks topped with single capsules containing spores. They are typically tall, though some species are much larger. &quot;Dawsonia&quot;, the tallest moss in the world, can grow to in height. There are approximately 12,000 species.

Mosses are commonly confused with liverworts, hornworts and lichens. Although often described as non-vascular plants, many mosses have advanced vascular systems. Like liverworts and hornworts, the haploid gametophyte generation of mosses is the dominant phase of the life cycle. This contrasts with the pattern in all vascular plants (seed plants and pteridophytes), where the diploid sporophyte generation is dominant. Lichens may superficially resemble mosses, and sometimes have common names that include the word &quot;moss&quot; (e.g., &quot;reindeer moss&quot; or &quot;Iceland moss&quot;), but they are fungal symbioses and not related to mosses.

The main commercial significance of mosses is as the main constituent of peat (mostly the genus &quot;Sphagnum&quot;), although they are also used for decorative purposes, such as in gardens and in the florist trade. Traditional uses of mosses included as insulation and for the ability to absorb liquids up to 20 times their weight. Moss is a keystone genus and benefits habitat restoration and reforestation.

==Physical characteristics==

===Description===

Botanically, mosses are non-vascular plants in the land plant division Bryophyta. They are usually small (a few centimeters tall) herbaceous (non-woody) plants that absorb water and nutrients mainly through their leaves and harvest carbon dioxide and sunlight to create food by photosynthesis. With the exception of the ancient group Takakiopsida, no known mosses form mycorrhiza, but bryophilous fungi is widespread in moss and other bryophytes, where they live as saprotrophs, parasites, pathogens and mutualists, some of them endophytes. Mosses differ from vascular plants in lacking water-bearing xylem tracheids or vessels. As in liverworts and hornworts, the haploid gametophyte generation is the dominant phase of the life cycle. This contrasts with the pattern in all vascular plants (seed plants and pteridophytes), where the diploid sporophyte generation is dominant. Mosses reproduce using spores, not seeds, and have no flowers.

Moss gametophytes have stems which may be simple or branched and upright (acrocarp) or prostrate (pleurocarp). The early divergent classes Takakiopsida, Sphagnopsida, Andreaeopsida and Andreaeobryopsida either lack stomata or have pseudostomata that do not form pores. In the remaining classes, stomata have been lost more than 60 times. Their leaves are simple, usually only a single layer of cells with no internal air spaces, often with thicker midribs (nerves). The nerve can run beyond the edge of the leaf tip, termed excurrent. The tip of the leaf blade can be extended as a hair point, made of colourless cells. These appear white against the dark green of the leaves. The edge of the leaf can be smooth or it may have teeth. There may be a distinct type of cell defining the edge of the leaf, distinct in shape and/or colour from the other leaf cells.

Moss has threadlike rhizoids that anchor them to their substrate, comparable to root hairs rather than the more substantial root structures of spermatophytes. Mosses do not absorb water or nutrients from their substrate through their rhizoids. They can be distinguished from liverworts (Marchantiophyta or Hepaticae) by their multi-cellular rhizoids. Spore-bearing capsules or sporangia of mosses are borne singly on long, unbranched stems, thereby distinguishing them from the polysporangiophytes, which include all vascular plants. The spore-producing sporophytes (i.e. the diploid multicellular generation) are short-lived and usually capable of photosynthesis, but are dependent on the gametophyte for water supply and most or all of its nutrients. Also, in the majority of mosses, the spore-bearing capsule enlarges and matures after its stalk elongates, while in liverworts the capsule enlarges and matures before its stalk elongates. Other differences are not universal for all mosses and all liverworts, but the presence of a clearly differentiated stem with simple-shaped, non-vascular leaves that are not arranged in three ranks, all point to the plant being a moss.

===Life cycle===
Vascular plants have two sets of chromosomes in their vegetative cells and are said to be diploid, i.e. each chromosome has a partner that contains the same, or similar, genetic information. By contrast, mosses and other bryophytes have only a single set of chromosomes and so are haploid (i.e. each chromosome exists in a unique copy within the cell). There is a period in the moss life cycle when they do have a double set of paired chromosomes, but this happens only during the sporophyte stage.

The moss life-cycle starts with a haploid spore that germinates to produce a protonema (&quot;pl.&quot; protonemata), which is either a mass of thread-like filaments or thalloid (flat and thallus-like). Massed moss protonemata typically look like a thin green felt, and may grow on damp soil, tree bark, rocks, concrete, or almost any other reasonably stable surface. This is a transitory stage in the life of a moss, but from the protonema grows the gametophore (&quot;gamete-bearer&quot;) that is structurally differentiated into stems and leaves. A single mat of protonemata may develop several gametophore shoots, resulting in a clump of moss.

From the tips of the gametophore stems or branches develop the sex organs of the mosses. The female organs are known as archegonia (&quot;sing.&quot; archegonium) and are protected by a group of modified leaves known as the perichaetum (plural, perichaeta). The archegonia are small flask-shaped clumps of cells with an open neck (venter) down which the male sperm swim. The male organs are known as antheridia (&quot;sing.&quot; antheridium) and are enclosed by modified leaves called the perigonium (&quot;pl.&quot; perigonia). The surrounding leaves in some mosses form a splash cup, allowing the sperm contained in the cup to be splashed to neighboring stalks by falling water droplets.

Gametophore tip growth is disrupted by fungal chitin. Galotto &quot;et al.&quot;, 2020 applied chitooctaose and found that tips detected and responded to this chitin derivative by changing gene expression. They concluded that this defense response was probably conserved from the most recent common ancestor of bryophytes and tracheophytes. Orr &quot;et al.&quot;, 2020 found that the microtubules of growing tip cells were structurally similar to F-actin and served a similar purpose.

Mosses can be either dioicous (compare dioecious in seed plants) or monoicous (compare monoecious). In dioicous mosses, male and female sex organs are borne on different gametophyte plants. In monoicous (also called autoicous) mosses, both are borne on the same plant. In the presence of water, sperm from the antheridia swim to the archegonia and fertilisation occurs, leading to the production of a diploid sporophyte. The sperm of mosses is biflagellate, i.e. they have two flagellae that aid in propulsion. Since the sperm must swim to the archegonium, fertilisation cannot occur without water. Some species (for example &quot;Mnium hornum&quot; or several species of &quot;Polytrichum&quot;) keep their antheridia in so called &#x27;splash cups&#x27;, bowl-like structures on the shoot tips that propel the sperm several decimeters when water droplets hit it, increasing the fertilization distance.

After fertilisation, the immature sporophyte pushes its way out of the archegonial venter. It takes several months for the sporophyte to mature. The sporophyte body comprises a long stalk, called a seta, and a capsule capped by a cap called the operculum. The capsule and operculum are in turn sheathed by a haploid calyptra which is the remains of the archegonial venter. The calyptra usually falls off when the capsule is mature. Within the capsule, spore-producing cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores, upon which the cycle can start again. The mouth of the capsule is usually ringed by a set of teeth called peristome. This may be absent in some mosses.

Most mosses rely on the wind to disperse the spores. In the genus &quot;Sphagnum&quot; the spores are projected about off the ground by compressed air contained in the capsules; the spores are accelerated to about 36,000 times the earth&#x27;s gravitational acceleration &quot;g&quot;.

It has recently been found that microarthropods, such as springtails and mites, can effect moss fertilization and that this process is mediated by moss-emitted scents. Male and female fire moss, for example emit different and complex volatile organic scents. Female plants emit more compounds than male plants. Springtails were found to choose female plants preferentially, and one study found that springtails enhance moss fertilization, suggesting a scent-mediated relationship analogous to the plant-pollinator relationship found in many seed plants. The stinkmoss species &quot;Splachnum sphaericum&quot; develops insect pollination further by attracting flies to its sporangia with a strong smell of carrion, and providing a strong visual cue in the form of red-coloured swollen collars beneath each spore capsule. Flies attracted to the moss carry its spores to fresh herbivore dung, which is the favoured habitat of the species of this genus.

In many mosses, e.g., &quot;Ulota phyllantha&quot;, green vegetative structures called gemmae are produced on leaves or branches, which can break off and form new plants without the need to go through the cycle of fertilization. This is a means of asexual reproduction, and the genetically identical units can lead to the formation of clonal populations.

===Dwarf males===
Moss dwarf males (also known as nannandry or phyllodioicy) originate from wind-dispersed male spores that settle and germinate on the female shoot where their growth is restricted to a few millimeters. In some species, dwarfness is genetically determined, in that all male spores become dwarf. More often, it is environmentally determined in that male spores that land on a female become dwarf, while those that land elsewhere develop into large, female-sized males. In the latter case, dwarf males that are transplanted from females to another substrate develop into large shoots, suggesting that the females emit a substance which inhibits the growth of germinating males and possibly also quickens their onset of sexual maturation. The nature of such a substance is unknown, but the phytohormone auxin may be involved

Having the males growing as dwarfs on the female is expected to increase the fertilization efficiency by minimizing the distance between male and female reproductive organs. Accordingly, it has been observed that fertilization frequency is positively associated with the presence of dwarf males in several phyllodioicous species.

Dwarf males occur in several unrelated lineages and may be more common than previously thought. For example, it is estimated that between one quarter and half of all dioicous pleurocarps have dwarf males.

===DNA repair===
The moss &quot;Physcomitrium patens&quot; has been used as a model organism to study how plants repair damage to their DNA, especially the repair mechanism known as homologous recombination. If the plant cannot repair DNA damage, e.g., double-strand breaks, in their somatic cells, the cells can lose normal functions or die. If this occurs during meiosis (part of sexual reproduction), they could become infertile. The genome of &quot;P. patens&quot; has been sequenced, which has allowed several genes involved in DNA repair to be identified. &quot;P. patens&quot; mutants that are defective in key steps of homologous recombination have been used to work out how the repair mechanism functions in plants. For example, a study of &quot;P. patens&quot; mutants defective in &quot;Rp&quot;RAD51, a gene that encodes a protein at the core of the recombinational repair reaction, indicated that homologous recombination is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks in this plant. Similarly, studies of mutants defective in &quot;Ppmre11&quot; or &quot;Pprad50&quot; (that encode key proteins of the MRN complex, the principal sensor of DNA double-strand breaks) showed that these genes are necessary for repair of DNA damage as well as for normal growth and development.

==Classification==
More recently, mosses have been grouped with the liverworts and hornworts in the division Bryophyta (bryophytes, or Bryophyta &quot;sensu lato&quot;). The bryophyte division itself contains three (former) divisions: Bryophyta (mosses), Marchantiophyta (liverworts) and Anthocerotophyta (hornworts); it has been proposed that these latter divisions are de-ranked to the classes Bryopsida, Marchantiopsida, and Anthocerotopsida, respectively. The mosses and liverworts are now considered to belong to a clade called Setaphyta.

The mosses, (Bryophyta sensu stricto), are divided into eight classes:


Six of the eight classes contain only one or two genera each. Polytrichopsida includes 23 genera, and Bryopsida includes the majority of moss diversity with over 95% of moss species belonging to this class.

The Sphagnopsida, the peat-mosses, comprise the two living genera &quot;Ambuchanania&quot; and &quot;Sphagnum&quot;, as well as fossil taxa. &quot;Sphagnum&quot; is a diverse, widespread, and economically important one. These large mosses form extensive acidic bogs in peat swamps. The leaves of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; have large dead cells alternating with living photosynthetic cells. The dead cells help to store water. Aside from this character, the unique branching, thallose (flat and expanded) protonema, and explosively rupturing sporangium place it apart from other mosses.

Andreaeopsida and Andreaeobryopsida are distinguished by the biseriate (two rows of cells) rhizoids, multiseriate (many rows of cells) protonema, and sporangium that splits along longitudinal lines. Most mosses have capsules that open at the top.

Polytrichopsida have leaves with sets of parallel lamellae, flaps of chloroplast-containing cells that look like the fins on a heat sink. These carry out photosynthesis and may help to conserve moisture by partially enclosing the gas exchange surfaces. The Polytrichopsida differ from other mosses in other details of their development and anatomy too, and can also become larger than most other mosses, with e.g., &quot;Polytrichum commune&quot; forming cushions up to high. The tallest land moss, a member of the Polytrichidae is probably &quot;Dawsonia superba&quot;, a native to New Zealand and other parts of Australasia.

==Geological history==

The fossil record of moss is sparse, due to their soft-walled and fragile nature. Unambiguous moss fossils have been recovered from as early as the Permian of Antarctica and Russia, and a case has been made for Carboniferous mosses. It has further been claimed that tube-like fossils from the Silurian are the macerated remains of moss calyptræ. Mosses also appear to evolve 2–3 times slower than ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms.

Recent research shows that ancient moss could explain why the Ordovician ice ages occurred. When the ancestors of today&#x27;s moss started to spread on land 470 million years ago, they absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere and extracted minerals by secreting organic acids that dissolved the rocks they were growing on. These chemically altered rocks in turn reacted with the atmospheric CO2 and formed new carbonate rocks in the ocean through the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks. The weathered rocks also released significant amounts of phosphorus and iron which ended up in the oceans, where it caused massive algal blooms, resulting in organic carbon burial, extracting more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Small organisms feeding on the nutrients created large areas without oxygen, which caused a mass extinction of marine species, while the levels of CO2 dropped all over the world, allowing the formation of ice caps on the poles.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
Mosses live in almost every terrestrial habitat type on Earth. Though mosses are particularly abundant in certain habitats such as peatlands, where Sphagnum mosses are the dominant organism, and in moist boreal, temperate, and montane tropical forests, mosses grow in many other habitats, including habitats with conditions too extreme for vascular plants to survive. Desiccation tolerant mosses are important in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where they help form biocrusts that mediate extremes of soil temperature, regulate soil moisture, and regulate the release and uptake of carbon. Mosses can live on substrates heated by geothermal activity to temperatures exceeding 50 degrees Celsius, on walls and pavement in urban areas, and in Antarctica. Moss diversity is generally not associated with latitude; boreal and temperate moss diversity is similar to tropical moss diversity. Moss diversity hotspots are found in the northern Andes mountains, Mexico, the Himalayan mountains, Madagascar, Japan, the highlands of eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, central Europe, Scandinavia, and British Columbia.

Moss gametophytes are autotrophic and require sunlight to perform photosynthesis. In most areas, mosses grow chiefly in moist, shaded areas, such as wooded areas and at the edges of streams, but shade tolerance varies by species. 

Different moss species grow on different substrates as well. Moss species can be classed as growing on: rocks, exposed mineral soil, disturbed soils, acid soil, calcareous soil, cliff seeps and waterfall spray areas, streamsides, shaded humusy soil, downed logs, burnt stumps, tree trunk bases, upper tree trunks, and tree branches or in bogs. Moss species growing on or under trees are often specific about the species of trees they grow on, such as preferring conifers over broadleaf trees, oaks over alders, or vice versa. While mosses often grow on trees as epiphytes, they are never parasitic on the tree.

Mosses are also found in cracks between paving stones in damp city streets, and on roofs. Some species adapted to disturbed, sunny areas are well adapted to urban conditions and are commonly found in cities. Examples would be &quot;Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus&quot;, a garden weed in Vancouver and Seattle areas; &quot;Bryum argenteum&quot;, the cosmopolitan sidewalk moss, and &quot;Ceratodon purpureus&quot;, red roof moss, another cosmopolitan species. A few species are wholly aquatic, such as &quot;Fontinalis antipyretica&quot;, common water moss; and others such as &quot;Sphagnum&quot; inhabit bogs, marshes and very slow-moving waterways. Such aquatic or semi-aquatic mosses can greatly exceed the normal range of lengths seen in terrestrial mosses. Individual plants or more long are common in &quot;Sphagnum&quot; species for example. But even aquatic species of moss and other bryophytes needs their mature capsules to be exposed to air by seta elongation or seasonal lowering of water level to be able to reproduce.

Wherever they occur, mosses require liquid water for at least part of the year to complete fertilisation. Many mosses can survive desiccation, sometimes for months, returning to life within a few hours of rehydration. Mosses in arid habitats, such as the moss &quot;Syntrichia caninervis&quot;, have adaptations for collecting non-rainfall sources of moisture like dew and fog, capturing condensation from the air.

It is generally believed that in the Northern Hemisphere, the north side of trees and rocks will generally have more luxuriant moss growth on average than other sides. The reason is assumed to be because sunshine on the south side causes a dry environment. The reverse would be true in the Southern Hemisphere. Some naturalists feel that mosses grow on the damper side of trees and rocks. In some cases, such as sunny climates in temperate northern latitudes, this will be the shaded north side of the tree or rock. On steep slopes, it may be the uphill side. For mosses that grow on tree branches, this is generally the upper side of the branch on horizontally growing sections or near the crotch. In cool, humid, cloudy climates, all sides of tree trunks and rocks may be equally moist enough for moss growth. Each species of moss requires certain amounts of moisture and sunlight and thus will grow on certain sections of the same tree or rock.

Some mosses grow underwater, or completely waterlogged. Many prefer well-drained locations. There are mosses that preferentially grow on rocks and tree trunks of various chemistries.

===Relationship with cyanobacteria===
In boreal forests, some species of moss play an important role in providing nitrogen for the ecosystem due to their relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria colonize moss and receive shelter in return for providing fixed nitrogen. Moss releases the fixed nitrogen, along with other nutrients, into the soil &quot;upon disturbances like drying-rewetting and fire events&quot;, making it available throughout the ecosystem.

==Cultivation==


Moss is often considered a weed in grass lawns, but is deliberately encouraged to grow under aesthetic principles exemplified by Japanese gardening. In old temple gardens, moss can carpet a forest scene. Moss is thought to add a sense of calm, age, and stillness to a garden scene. Moss is also used in bonsai to cover the soil and enhance the impression of age. Rules of cultivation are not widely established. Moss collections are quite often begun using samples transplanted from the wild in a water-retaining bag. Some species of moss can be extremely difficult to maintain away from their natural sites with their unique requirements of combinations of light, humidity, substrate chemistry, shelter from wind, etc.

Growing moss from spores is even less controlled. Moss spores fall in a constant rain on exposed surfaces; those surfaces which are hospitable to a certain species of moss will typically be colonised by that moss within a few years of exposure to wind and rain. Materials which are porous and moisture retentive, such as brick, wood, and certain coarse concrete mixtures, are hospitable to moss. Surfaces can also be prepared with acidic substances, including buttermilk, yogurt, urine, and gently puréed mixtures of moss samples, water and ericaceous compost.

In the cool, humid, cloudy Pacific Northwest, moss is sometimes allowed to grow naturally as a moss lawn, one that needs little or no mowing, fertilizing or watering. In this case, grass is considered to be the weed. Landscapers in the Seattle area sometimes collect boulders and downed logs growing mosses for installation in gardens and landscapes. Woodland gardens in many parts of the world can include a carpet of natural mosses. The Bloedel Reserve on Bainbridge Island, Washington State, is famous for its moss garden. The moss garden was created by removing shrubby underbrush and herbaceous groundcovers, thinning trees, and allowing mosses to fill in naturally.

=== Green roofs and walls ===

Mosses are sometimes used in green roofs. Advantages of mosses over higher plants in green roofs include reduced weight loads, increased water absorption, no fertilizer requirements, and high drought tolerance. Since mosses do not have true roots, they require less planting medium than higher plants with extensive root systems. With proper species selection for the local climate, mosses in green roofs require no irrigation once established and are low maintenance. Mosses are also used on green walls.

=== Mossery ===
A passing fad for moss-collecting in the late 19th century led to the establishment of mosseries in many British and American gardens. The mossery is typically constructed out of slatted wood, with a flat roof, open to the north side (maintaining shade). Samples of moss were installed in the cracks between wood slats. The whole mossery would then be regularly moistened to maintain growth.

=== Aquascaping ===
Aquascaping uses many aquatic mosses. They do best at low nutrient, light, and heat levels, and propagate fairly readily. They help maintain a water chemistry suitable for aquarium fish. They grow more slowly than many aquarium plants, and are fairly hardy.

===Growth inhibition===
Moss can be a troublesome weed in containerized nursery operations and greenhouses. Vigorous moss growth can inhibit seedling emergence and penetration of water and fertilizer to the plant roots.

Moss growth can be inhibited by a number of methods:
* Decreasing availability of water through drainage.
* Increasing direct sunlight.
* Increasing number and resources available for competitive plants like grasses.
* Increasing the soil pH with the application of lime.
* Heavy traffic or manually disturbing the moss bed with a rake
* Application of chemicals such as ferrous sulfate (e.g., in lawns) or bleach (e.g., on solid surfaces).
* In containerized nursery operations, coarse mineral materials such as sand, gravel, and rock chips are used as a fast-draining top dressing in plant containers to discourage moss growth.

The application of products containing ferrous sulfate or ferrous ammonium sulfate will kill moss; these ingredients are typically in commercial moss control products and fertilizers. Sulfur and iron are essential nutrients for some competing plants like grasses. Killing moss will not prevent regrowth unless conditions favorable to their growth are changed.

==Uses==
===Traditional===
Preindustrial societies made use of the mosses growing in their areas.

Sámi people, North American tribes, and other circumpolar peoples used mosses for bedding. Mosses have also been used as insulation both for dwellings and in clothing. Traditionally, dried moss was used in some Nordic countries and Russia as an insulator between logs in log cabins, and tribes of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada used moss to fill chinks in wooden longhouses. Circumpolar and alpine peoples have used mosses for insulation in boots and mittens. Ötzi the Iceman had moss-packed boots.

The capacity of dried mosses to absorb fluids has made their use practical in both medical and culinary uses. North American tribal people used mosses for diapers, wound dressing, and menstrual fluid absorption. Tribes of the Pacific Northwest in the United States and Canada used mosses to clean salmon prior to drying it, and packed wet moss into pit ovens for steaming camas bulbs. Food storage baskets and boiling baskets were also packed with mosses.

Recent research investigating the Neanderthals remains recovered from El Sidrón have provided evidence that their diet would have consisted primarily of pine nuts, moss and mushrooms. This is contrasted by evidence from other European locations, which point to a more carnivorous diet.

In Finland, peat mosses have been used to make bread during famines.

===Commercial===
There is a substantial market in mosses gathered from the wild. The uses for intact moss are principally in the florist trade and for home decoration. Decaying moss in the genus &quot;Sphagnum&quot; is also the major component of peat, which is &quot;mined&quot; for use as a fuel, as a horticultural soil additive, and in smoking malt in the production of Scotch whisky.

&quot;Sphagnum&quot; moss, generally the species &quot;S. cristatum&quot; and &quot;S. subnitens&quot;, is harvested while still growing and is dried out to be used in nurseries and horticulture as a plant growing medium.

Some &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses can absorb up to 20 times their own weight in water. In World War I, &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses were used as first-aid dressings on soldiers&#x27; wounds, as these mosses said to absorb liquids three times faster than cotton, retain liquids better, better distribute liquids uniformly throughout themselves, and are cooler, softer, and be less irritating. It is also claimed to have antibacterial properties. Native Americans were one of the peoples to use &quot;Sphagnum&quot; for diapers and menstrual pads, which is still done in Canada.

In rural UK, &quot;Fontinalis antipyretica&quot; was traditionally used to extinguish fires as it could be found in substantial quantities in slow-moving rivers and the moss retained large volumes of water which helped extinguish the flames. This historical use is reflected in its specific Latin/Greek name, which means &quot;against fire&quot;.

In Mexico, moss is used as a Christmas decoration.

&quot;Physcomitrium patens&quot; is increasingly used in biotechnology. Prominent examples are the identification of moss genes
with implications for crop improvement or human health and the safe production of complex biopharmaceuticals in the moss bioreactor, developed by Ralf Reski and his co-workers.

London installed several structures called &quot;City Trees&quot;: moss-filled walls, each of which is claimed to have &quot;the air-cleaning capability of 275 regular trees&quot; by consuming nitrogen oxides and other types of air pollution and producing oxygen.

<text>Molly dancing is a form of English Morris dance, traditionally done by out-of-work ploughboys in midwinter in the 19th century. It was largely ignored by folk dance collectors, who recorded only a handful of dances before the practice died out in the 1930s. The practice was revived in the 1970s.

==History==

Molly dancing is a dance tradition from East Anglia, first attested in the 1820s. The first recorded use of the word &quot;Molly&quot; in relation to this tradition was in 1866. The dance was performed on Boxing Day (26 December) and Plough Monday (the Monday after 6 January). The tradition had died out by 1940. The term &quot;Molly dancing&quot; probably derives from the word &quot;Molly&quot; meaning an effeminate, homosexual, or cross-dressing man, referring to the invariable presence of men dressed in women&#x27;s clothing among the dancers; an alternative possibility is that it is a corruption of Morris dance.

In 1911 Cecil Sharp interviewed a man from Little Downham about Plough Monday dancing, but he did not consider it worthy of further study, and the practice was largely ignored by collectors of folk dances until the 1930s. In 1930, Joseph Needham and Arthur Peck collected four Molly dances from a dancer from Girton and a concertina player from Histon, near Cambridge; they continued to collect information about Molly dancing over the following three years. William Palmer recorded a broom dance performed by the Little Downham dancers in 1933. In 1978, Russell Wortley and Cyril Papworth published four dances collected from the Comberton Molly dancers. The recorded dances are largely ordinary social dances of the period, rather than special molly dances. Needham and Peck proposed that a previous dance tradition, perhaps a kind of sword dance, had at some point been lost, and molly dancing had been revived using social dances.

==Traditions==
Traditionally Molly dancing took place over the Christmas season, particularly on Boxing Day and Plough Monday (the first Monday after Epiphany). Pre-revival molly dancing was an all-male tradition, though women sometimes joined in the dancing. Unemployed farmworkers danced both to entertain themselves and as a way of making some money in a season where there was little demand for agricultural labour. In some cases, the money raised was used for charity – as for instance in Brandon Creek, near Littleport, where until the 1850s it was used to buy food for local widows. 

Molly dancers dressed in ordinary clothes decorated with ribbons and rosettes, wore top hats, and blacked their faces as a form of disguise. One or more dancers dressed in women&#x27;s clothing – in some accounts half of the dancers were dressed as women. Along with the dancers, molly teams were accompanied by various other men who performed specific roles, including an umbrella man, to protect the musician from the weather, a sweeper who carried a broom and would clear a space for the dancers, and the man responsible for the money box. The Molly team seen by William Palmer at Little Downham in 1933 consisted of six men, one dressed as a woman; of the remaining five, one carried a broom and money box, and one played the accordion. The musician wore ordinary clothes, while the other men wore frock coats and top hats; all five had blackened faces and wore ribbons on their clothes.

==Revival==
Molly dancing was revived in the late 1970s, when teams began to once again perform the preserved dances. By 1976, Russell Wortley was teaching Molly dance based on the material he had collected, and in 1977 the Cambridge Morris Men resumed Molly dancing on Plough Monday. Another early molly side, the Mepal Molly Men, based their dancing off of the recollection of two of the dancers from Little Downham in the 1930s. By the year 2000, over 20 dance teams included molly dancing in their repertoire. 

The Cambridge Men still dance Molly during the day on Plough Monday. The Morris dance revival of the 1970s led to the creation of many new sides, which nowadays usually involve both men and women. In recent years, Molly dancing has enjoyed a popular revival both in East Anglia and the East Midlands, one of the best-known teams being the Ouse Washes Molly Dancers. The largest regular assemblage of Molly dancers is at the Whittlesea Straw Bear Festival, established 1980, which is held in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, every January.

Modern Molly dancing demonstrates the clearest distinction between &quot;re-enactment of tradition&quot; and &quot;modern interpretation of tradition&quot; of modern morris dancing. Elaine Bradtke wrote a PhD thesis on the inherent post-modernism of the Seven Champions, one of the first and best examples of modern Molly dance. Many other teams have developed Molly, inspired by the unhistorical but very effective military formations of Seven Champions (e.g. Ouse Washes, Gog Magog, Handsome Molly in New Jersey, Countess Isabella&#x27;s Automata) whilst others have taken it in new directions, equally unhistorical but at their best equally effective in very different ways; e.g. Norwich Shitwitches (now renamed Kit Witches) and Pig Dyke Molly.
