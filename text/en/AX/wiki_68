<text>The Canadian Army () is the command responsible for the operational readiness of the conventional ground forces of the Canadian Armed Forces. It maintains regular forces units at bases across Canada, and is also responsible for the Army Reserve, the largest component of the Primary Reserve. The army is headed by the Commander of the Canadian Army and Chief of the Army Staff, who is subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Staff. The army is also supported by 3,000 civilian employees from the public service.

The army was formed in 1855, as the Active Militia, in response to the threat of the United States to the Province of Canada after the British garrison left for the Crimean War. This militia was later subdivided into the Permanent Active Militia and the Non-Permanent Active Militia. Finally, in 1940, an order in council changed the name of the Active Militia to the Canadian Army.

On 1 April 1966, prior to the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, the land forces were placed under a new command called Mobile Command (). For two years following, the army existed as a distinct legal entity before its amalgamation with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force to form the Canadian Armed Forces. In the 1990s, the command was renamed Land Force Command (), until it reverted to its original name in August 2011.

During its history, the Canadian Army has fought in a variety of conflicts, including in the North-West Rebellion, the Second Boer War, the First and Second World Wars, Korean War, and more recently with the Gulf War, and in the War in Afghanistan.

==History==
=== Formation ===

Prior to Confederation in 1867, the British Army, which included both &quot;Fencible&quot; Regiments of the British Army—recruited within British North America exclusively for service in North America—and Canadian militia units, was responsible for the defence of Canada. Some current regiments of the Canadian Army trace their origins to these pre-Confederation militia and Fencible units. Following the passage of the &quot;Militia Act of 1855,&quot; the Permanent Active Militia was formed, and in later decades several regular bodies of troops were created, their descendants becoming the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, the Royal Canadian Dragoons, and the Royal Canadian Regiment. The major operations that regular Canadian troops, in the 19th century, participated in included: the North-West Rebellion in 1885, and the Second Boer War.
=== World Wars ===
During the First World War, the Canadian Army raised the volunteer Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) for service overseas, and was the primary Canadian participation to the war effort. 

The Canadian Army also fought during the Second World War. Following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany and her allies by the United Kingdom on 3 September 1939, with Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King consulting with the Parliament of Canada and declaring war on 10 September 1939, the Canadian Army raised the Canadian Active Service Force, which initially consisted of the 1st Canadian Division; later increased to form the First Canadian Army. On 19 November 1940, during Second World War, an Order in Council was issued that renamed the Permanent Active Militia as the Canadian Army (Active), supplemented by the Non-Permanent Active Militia, which was named the Canadian Army (Reserve).

=== Post-war era and recent history (1945-present)===
The Army participated in the Korean War, with the first elements of its participation landed in Korea in December 1950 and formed part of the forces who took part in Operation Killer and the Battle of Kapyong. Canadian troops were also committed to the NATO presence in West Germany during the Cold War.

In the years following its unification with the navy and air force in 1968, the size of Canada&#x27;s land forces was reduced, however, Canadian troops participated in a number of military actions with Canada&#x27;s allies. These operations included the Gulf War in 1991 and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, in addition to various peacekeeping operations under United Nations auspices in different parts of the world. Despite Canada&#x27;s usual support of British and American initiatives, Canada&#x27;s land forces did not directly participate in the Suez Crisis, the Vietnam War, or the Iraq War.

==Structure==
Command of the Army is exercised by the commander of the Canadian Army within National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa. The Army is divided into four geographical districts: the 2nd Canadian Division is based in Quebec, the 3rd Canadian Division is based in Western Canada, the 4th Canadian Division is based in Ontario, while the 5th Canadian Division is based in Atlantic Canada.

The single operational formation, 1st Canadian Division, is part of the Canadian Joint Operations Command and not part of the Canadian Army. It serves as a deployable headquarters to command a divisional-level deployment of Canadian or allied forces on operations, succeeding the previous Canadian Joint Forces HQ.

In addition to the four regional command areas, the Canadian Army Doctrine and Training Centre, commanded by a major-general and headquartered at McNaughton Barracks, CFB Kingston, Ontario, is responsible for the supervision, integration and delivery of Army training and doctrine development, including simulation and digitization. It includes a number of schools and training organizations, such as the Combat Training Centre at CFB Gagetown, New Brunswick, and the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre at CFB Wainwright, Alberta.

Canadian infantry and armoured regimental traditions are strongly rooted in the traditions and history of the British Army. Many regiments were patterned after regiments of the British Army, and a system of official &quot;alliances&quot;, or affiliations, was created to perpetuate a sense of shared history. Other regiments developed independently, resulting in a mixture of both colourful and historically familiar names. Other traditions such as battle honours and colours have been maintained by Canadian regiments as well.

The senior appointment within the Canadian Army was Chief of the General Staff until 1964 when the appointment became Commander, Mobile Command in advance of the unification of Canada&#x27;s military forces. The position was renamed Chief of the Land Staff in 1993. Following the reversion to the name &quot;Canadian Army&quot; in 2011, the position became Commander of the Canadian Army.

===Regular force===
There are three mechanized brigade groups in the Canadian Army&#x27;s Regular Force. Approximately two-thirds of the Regular Force is composed of anglophone units, while one third is francophone. The mechanized brigades include battalions from three infantry regiments, the Royal Canadian Regiment, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, and the Royal 22e Regiment.

Between 1953 and 1971, the Regular infantry consisted of seven regiments, each maintaining two battalions (except the Royal 22e Régiment, which had three; The Canadian Guards which had four battalions between 1953 and 1957; and the Canadian Airborne Regiment, which was divided into three commandos). In addition to the Canadian Guards, and the Canadian Airborne Regiment, the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, and the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada also fielded units that served in Regular Force.

In the years that followed the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, several units of Regular Force were disbanded, or reduced to nil strength. On 15 September 1968, the 2nd Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles was reduced to nil strength and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle. Several weeks later, the 1st Battalion of the Canadian Guards was disbanded on 1 October 1968.

In 1970, several more units were reduced to nil strength. The 1st Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles was reduced to nil strength and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle on 27 April 1970, with the unit&#x27;s personnel forming the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry. Further reductions occurred from mid-June to early-July 1970, with the Regular Force unit from the Fort Garry Horse being disbanded on 16 June 1970. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Black Watch were reduced to nil strength on 1 July 1970, and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle. Several days later, on 6 July 1970, the 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Guards was reduced to nil strength and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle; its personnel became a part of 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. After the Canadian Guards were reduced to nil strength, the role of the Household Troop reverted to the two seniormost infantry regiments of the Reserve. The respective battalions relinquished their numerical battalion designations in 1976.

During the 1990s, the Regular Force saw further organizational restructuring. The Canadian Airborne Regiment was disbanded in 1995, while the Regular Force regiment of the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise&#x27;s), formed in 1957, was converted to a mixed Regular and Reserve &quot;Total Force&quot; unit with the close-out of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group at Lahr, Germany, in 1994, before reverting to a Reserve regiment in 1997.

===Reserve===

The Army Reserve is the reserve element of the Canadian Army and the largest component of the Primary Reserve. The Army Reserve is organized into under-strength brigades (for purposes of administration) along geographic lines. The Army Reserve is very active and has participated heavily in all Regular Army deployments since 2002, in some cases contributing as much as 40 per cent of each deployment in either individual augmentation, as well as occasional formed sub-units (companies). LFR regiments have the theoretical administrative capacity to support an entire battalion, but typically have the deployable manpower of only one or two platoons. They are perpetuated as such for the timely absorption of recruits during times of war. Current strength of the Army Reserve is approximately 18,500. On 1 April 2008, the Army Reserve absorbed all units of the former Communications Reserve.

== Personnel ==

===Rank and insignia===

Military rank in the Canadian Army is granted based on a variety of factors including merit, qualification, training, and time in-rank. However, promotion up to the rank of corporal for non-commissioned members, and to captain for officers, is automatic based on time in previous rank. Some ranks are associated with specific appointments. For example, a regimental sergeant major is held by a chief warrant officer, or adjutant held by a captain. In some branches or specific units, rank titles may differ due to tradition. A trained private within the Royal Canadian Armoured Corps is a trooper, whereas the same rank within the artillery is gunner. Other titles for the rank of private include fusilier, sapper, rifleman, craftsman, and guardsman. The ranks of the Canadian Army are as follows:

===Meals===

Field kitchens and catering are used to provide Canadian Army personnel fresh-cooked meals at bases and overseas operation centres. When fresh rations are not practical or available, Individual Meal Packs (IMPs) are issued instead. There are also patrol packs, which are small high-protein snack-type foods (such as beef jerky or shredded cheese) and boxed lunches (consisting of assorted sandwiches, juice, fruit, pasta and a dessert) provided for soldiers to consume in situations in which meal preparation is not possible.

===Uniforms===

The Canadian Army maintains a variety of different uniforms, including a ceremonial full dress uniform, a mess dress uniform, a service dress uniform, operational/field uniforms, and occupational uniforms. Canada&#x27;s uniforms were developed parallel to British uniforms from 1900 to the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces in 1968, though maintained significant differences. The adoption of a number of separate uniforms for separate functions, also made its uniforms become distinctively &quot;Canadian&quot; in the process. 

Prior to unification in 1968, the uniforms between the three branches were similar to their counterparts in the forces of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, save for national identifiers and some regimental accoutrements. The Honourable Peter MacKay, Minister of National Defence, announced on 8 July 2013 the Government of Canada&#x27;s intent to restore Canadian Army rank insignia, names and badges to their traditional forms.

The Canadian Army&#x27;s universal full dress uniform includes a scarlet tunic, midnight blue trousers with a scarlet trouser stripe, and a Wolseley helmet. However, a number of regiments in the Canadian Army are authorized regimental deviations from the Army&#x27;s universal design; including some armoured, Canadian-Scottish regiments, and all rifle/voltigeur regiments. The full dress uniforms of the Army regiments originated from the Canadian militia, and was eventually relegated from combat to ceremonial use.

The present service dress uniform includes a rifle green tunic and trousers, similar to the older iteration of the service dress, although with a different cut, and an added shoulder strap. The present service dress uniforms were introduced in the late 1980s, alongside the other &quot;distinctive environmental uniforms&quot; issued to other branches of the Canadian Armed Forces. From the unification of the armed forces in 1968, to the introduction of the distinctive service uniforms in the 1980s, the branches of the Canadian Armed Forces wore a similar rifle green service uniform.

The Canadian Army began to issue combat specific uniforms in the early 1960s, with the introduction of &quot;combats,&quot; coloured olive-drab shirt. The olive-drab uniforms continued to be used with minor alterations until the Army adopted CADPAT camouflaged combat uniforms in the late-1990s. With the adoption of CADPAT, the Canadian Armed Forces became the first military force to adopt digital camouflage pattern for all its units.
=== Officer training ===
Officers are selected in several ways:

*The Regular Officer Training Plan, where candidates are educated at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) or at civilian Canadian universities.
* Direct Entry Officer Plan, for those who already hold a university degree or technology diploma.
* Continuing Education Officer Training Plan, addresses shortages in certain officer occupations, and is intended to attract candidates who are otherwise qualified for service as officers, but who lack a degree. Candidates complete their degrees while serving in the Army.
* University Training Plan (Non-Commissioned Members), designed to develop selected serving non-commissioned members for service as career officers in the Regular Force. Normally, candidates selected for this plan will attend RMC or a civilian university in Canada.
*Commissioning from the Ranks Plan, provides officers to augment the number of officers commissioned through other plans and applies exclusively to those who have acquired some military experience and possess the necessary qualities that make them suitable for employment as officers.
* Special Requirements Commissioning Plan, is designed to meet the needs of the officer occupations. It allows the Canadian Forces to profit from the skills and experience of senior non-commissioned members and may provide an opportunity for career advancement for selected deserving Chief Warrant Officers.
*Subsidized special education, which includes the Medical Officer Training Plan or Dental Officer Training Plan.
In addition, there were other commissioning plans such as the Officer Candidate Training Plan and Officer Candidate Training Plan (Men) for commissioning serving members which are no longer in effect.

Occupational training for Canadian Army officers takes place at one of the schools of the Combat Training Centre for Army controlled occupations (armour, artillery, infantry, electrical, and mechanical engineers, etc.), or at a Canadian Armed Forces school, such as the Canadian Forces School of Administration and Logistics, or the Defence Public Affairs Learning Centre for Officers from career fields controlled outside the Army.

==Equipment==

Canada is an industrial nation with a highly developed science and technology sector. Since the First World War, Canada has produced its own infantry fighting vehicle, anti-tank guided missile and small arms for the Army. Regular and reserve units operate state-of-the-art equipment able to handle modern threats through 2030–2035. Despite extensive financial cuts to the defence budget between the 1960s–2000s, the Army is relatively well equipped. The Army currently operates approximately 10,500 utility vehicles, including G-wagons and 7000-MVs, and also operates approximately 2,700 armoured fighting vehicles including the LAV-III and the Leopard 2. The Army also operates approximately 150 field artillery pieces including the M777 howitzer and the LG1 Mark II.

In 2016 the Army replaced the RG-31 Nyala and Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle with the Textron Tactical Armoured Patrol Vehicle.

The Army infantry uses the C7 Rifle or C8 Carbine as the basic assault rifle, with grenadiers using the C7 with an attached M203 grenade launcher, and the C9 squad automatic weapon. The Canadian Army also uses the SIG Sauer P320 and the SIG Sauer P226.

Newer variants of the C7/C8 family have since been integrated into common use throughout the Canadian Armed Forces. The C7 has most recently been updated in the form the C7A2. The major internal components remain the same, however, several changes have been made to increase versatility of the rifle.

Tactical communication is provided via the Iris Digital Communications System.

==Canadian Army Journal==
Since 1947, the Canadian Army has produced a peer-reviewed academic journal called the &quot;Canadian Army Journal.&quot; In 1965, prior to the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, the journal was merged with similar publications from across the services. In 1980, the &quot;Canadian Army Doctrine Bulletin&quot; began printing as the successor to the original journal, and in 2004 the publication returned to its original name.

<doc id="182807" wikidata="Q317220" url="?curid=182807" title="Chilean flamingo">
<text>The Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) is a species of large flamingo at a height of closely related to the American flamingo and the greater flamingo, with which it was sometimes considered conspecific. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

It breeds in South America from Ecuador and Peru to Chile and Argentina and east to Brazil; it has been introduced into Germany. Like all flamingos, it lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound. 

These flamingos are mainly restricted to salt lagoons and soda lakes but these areas are vulnerable to habitat loss and water pollution.

==Description==

The plumage is pinker than the slightly larger greater flamingo, but less so than the Caribbean flamingo. It can be differentiated from these species by its grayish legs with pink joints (tibiotarsal articulation), and also by the larger amount of black on the bill (more than half). Young chicks may have no sign of pink coloring whatsoever, but instead remain gray or peach.

==Diet==
The Chilean flamingo&#x27;s bill is equipped with comb-like structures that enable it to filter food—mainly algae and plankton—from the water of the coastal mudflats, estuaries, lagoons, and salt lakes where it lives.

==Breeding==
Chilean flamingos live in large flocks in the wild and require crowded conditions to stimulate breeding. During breeding season, males and females display a variety of behaviors to attract mates, including head flagging—swiveling their heads from side-to-side in tandem—and wing salutes, where the wings are repeatedly opened and closed. Flamingos in general have a poor record of successful breeding because they will delay reproduction until the environmental conditions are favorable for breeding. 

Males and females co-operate in building a pillar-shaped mud nest, and both incubate the egg laid by the female, taking turns to sit on the egg. Upon hatching, the chicks have gray plumage; they do not gain the typical pink adult coloration for 2–3 years. Both male and female flamingos can produce a nutritious fluid from glands in their crop to feed their young. Due to their diet, this crop milk is crimson in color.

==In captivity==
The first flamingo hatched in a European zoo was a Chilean flamingo at Zoo Basel (Switzerland) in 1958.

In 1988, a Chilean flamingo that lived in the Tracy Aviary in Salt Lake City, Utah, had mistakenly not received his routine wing clipping. The flamingo escaped, and became a local legend in the greater Salt Lake area known as Pink Floyd the Flamingo. Pink Floyd came to Utah in the winters to eat the brine shrimp that live in the Great Salt Lake, and flew north to Idaho and Montana in the spring and summer. Pink Floyd became a popular tourist attraction and local icon until his disappearance and presumed death after he flew north to Idaho in the spring of 2005 and was never seen again.

Since there is such a decline in the numbers of this species, breeding programs have been implemented in zoos to offset the decline of the wild stock numbers.

<text>Cotys I or Kotys I () was a king of the Odrysians in Thrace from 384 BC to his murder in 360 BC.

==Early life==
Cotys was known to have been born during the reign of Seuthes I, based on ancient sources and date of birth estimates for Cotys, his daughter who married the Athenian general Iphicrates, and her son Menestheus. According to Harpokration, he reigned for 24 years, which places his accession in 384 BC. Although his origins are actually unknown, an Athenian inscription dated to 330 BC honors Reboulas, brother of Cotys and son of king Seuthes. As the ordinal of Seuthes is not mentioned, it was unclear which of the preceding kings named Seuthes is meant by the inscription. While scholars originally believed Seuthes II to be the father of Cotys I, now it is known that Seuthes I was his father, as Seuthes II was only 7 years old at the time of Seuthes I&#x27;s abdication in 411 BC.

In 390 BC, the Athenian general Iphicrates joined his colleague Thrasybulus in Thrace, helping arrange peace between the Thracian rulers Amadocus I and Seuthes II, and making both Athenian allies. Iphicrates remained for about two years, and married the daughter of Cotys in opulent circumstances. Cotys&#x27; precise standing at the time remains obscure, but he is tentatively identified as a brother of Hebryzelmis, who was the Odrysian king in Thrace in 386/385 BC, when he was honored in an Athenian decree.

==Early reign==
Shortly afterwards, in 384 BC, Cotys I became king, perhaps at first in the interior parts of Thrace. With the help of Iphicrates, Cotys succeeded in establishing himself as the heir of Hebryzelmis, and eliminating the opposition of his rivals, possibly including Amadocus II and Saratocus. Archaeological finds of items inscribed for Cotys to the north and west suggest expansion and contacts in that direction that have escaped the narrative sources. The name of Cotys (in one instance described as a son of the god Apollon) appears several times on objects from the Rogozen Treasure, although the precise manner in which it came to be buried in northwestern Bulgaria, presumably in the territory of the Triballi, remains unclear.

==Conflict with Athens==
As Cotys tried to enlarge his kingdom, including towards the Aegean and the Chersonese, his actions led to increasing tensions with Athens. In the early 370s BC, the Second Athenian Confederacy was founded with a number of neighboring cities and islands joining the Confederacy as a safeguard against the threat from Cotys, among others.

In 375 BC Cotys probably supported Hales, leader of Triballi, a powerful Thracian tribe in northwestern Thrace, in their attack on the city of Abdera. According to Diodorus, the city was saved only after the intervention of the Athenian general, Chabrias, whose forces then garrisoned the city. In 367 BC Ariobarzanes, the Persian satrap of Phrygia, occupied Sestos. Following Ariobarzanes&#x27; revolt against the Persian king Artaxerxes II in 365 BC, Cotys apparently opposed Ariobarzanes and his ally, Athens, but his actions are ambivalent and unclear. The same year Cotys welcomed the return of his son-in-law, the dismissed Athenian general Iphicrates, and a new ally, the mercenary commander Charidemus, who married another daughter of Cotys. The Athenians under their general Timotheus were able to gain Sestos and Krithote. Soon after, in 363 or 362 BC, Cotys sent Miltokythes into the Thracian Chersonese to take Sestos. Miltokythes besieged the city and starved it into surrender, then attacked Krithote. Athenian generals sent to relieve the attacked towns were unsuccessful.

At this time, in 362 BC, however, Miltokythes rebelled against Cotys, seizing the royal treasury at Hieron Oros and, finding himself besieged there by Cotys, appealed for help to both Ariobarzanes and Athens. Cotys also appealed for help from Athens, and allied himself to the Persian satrap of Lydia Autophradates, enemy of Ariobarzanes. Athens chose to support Miltokythes, and sent a fleet to his aid, but this was defeated by Cotys with the help of his son-in-law Iphicrates. Miltokythes was forced to abandon Hieron Oros in spring 361 BC, and Cotys now besieged Sestos. Athens now allied with Sparta against Cotys. Ariobarzanes surrendered Sestos and Kritothe to the Athenian general Timotheus, and the Athenians dispatched two more commanders to aid Miltokythes against Cotys. Nevertheless, Cotys prevailed with the continued assistance of Iphicrates and Charidemus. According to Demosthenes, they bribed the Athenian military and naval commanders, and several were tried and condemned after being recalled to Athens. Despite an attempt for peace between Athens and Cotys, proclaiming him an ally, Charidemus is found besieging the last remaining Athenian fortresses in the southern Chersonese again in 360 BC.

==Death==
By 360 BC, Cotys controlled almost all of the Chersonese peninsula, and the Athenians dispatched a new commander, Charidemus&#x27; friend Cephisodotus to the area. By the time Cephisodotus arrived in the last week of September 360 BC, Cotys had been murdered by two of Plato’s students from Aenus, Python and Heraclides. Thought previously to be close to the king, they murdered him during a feast in his palace, under the pretext that he had wronged their father. Upon their return to Athens, they were proclaimed honorary citizens and rewarded with gold wreaths. Python is said to have told the Athenians that &quot;God did this, borrowing from me the hand that did the deed.&quot; Identifying an unnamed Thracian king met by Philip II of Macedon with Cotys, some authors had put Cotys&#x27; death in 359 BC, assuming it took place after Philip II&#x27;s accession; this is still found cited in the literature, but the chronology of Cephisodotus&#x27; arrival in 360 BC is certain. Philip may have met Cotys before becoming king of Macedon and, moreover, it is not certain that the Thracian king in question should be identified with Cotys.

==Legacy==
Cotys I was the last ruler of a relatively unified Thrace for centuries. On his death, his son and heir Cersobleptes found himself opposed by Amadocus II (son of Amadocus I and possibly already a rival to Cotys in the early 370s BC) and Berisades (son or descendant of Saratocus?), as well as Miltokythes and a certain Spokes. While Cersobleptes managed to eliminate some of these foes with the continued support of Charidemus (who captured and executed Miltokythes in 357 BC), he had to accept a partition of the kingdom with Amadocus II and Berisades. The division of Odrysian Thrace was exploited by Philip II of Macedon to impose his control over the area.

Cotys I had several children, including a daughter who married Iphicrates probably before 387 BC, another daughter who married Charidemus probably after 365 BC, a son named Cersobleptes who succeeded his father on the throne in 360 BC, and possibly a second son named Seuthes, who may have served as Cersobleptes&#x27; deputy (&quot;hyparkhos&quot;) and may have become king as Seuthes III (these identifications are hypothetical and debated).

==Character==
As a former ally of Athens who became a dangerous foe, Cotys I has been portrayed in a fairly negative light in our sources, depicted as irritable, intemperate, drunken, inordinately cruel, and perfidious, most notably in the polemics of Demosthenes. Plutarch provides a more nuanced depiction of Cotys&#x27; character in the following anecdote: 
&quot;Cotys, when one gave him a leopard, gave him a lion in return. He was naturally prone to anger, and punished the mistakes of his servants severely. When a stranger brought him some earthen vessels, thin and brittle, but delicately shaped and admirably adorned with carvings, he rewarded the stranger for them, and then broke them all into pieces, &quot;Lest (he said) my passion should provoke me to punish those that break them excessively.&quot;&quot; 

==In popular culture==
* Cotys I appears in the 2014 film &quot;Hercules&quot; portrayed by John Hurt. Here, Cotys is depicted as the main antagonist as King of Thrace during the year 361 BC. Unlike in the film, the actual Cotys I, never features in the mythology of Heracles/Hercules.

<text>Gush Emunim (, lit. &quot;Bloc of the Faithful&quot;) is an Israeli ultranationalist religious Zionist Orthodox Jewish right-wing fundamentalist activist movement committed to establishing Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights. 

While not formally established as an organization until 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, Gush Emunim sprang out of the conquests of the Six-Day War in 1967, encouraging Jewish settlement of the land of Israel based on two points, one religious and one practical. The religious point was a belief that, according to the Torah, God wants the Jewish people to live in the land of Israel and had returned lands such as the biblical Judea and Samaria as an opportunity for the Jewish people to return to their ancestral homeland. The second point stemmed from a concern that the pre-1967 borders, a mere wide at its narrowest point, were indefensible, especially in the long term, and it was therefore necessary to ensure that the land captured in the Six-Day War remained under Israeli control by creating a Jewish presence in the region and placing &quot;facts on the ground&quot;. While Gush Emunim no longer exists officially, vestiges of its influence remain in Israeli politics and society.

==Political affiliations==
Gush Emunim was closely associated with, and highly influential in, the National Religious Party (NRP). Nowadays, they refer to themselves – and are referred to by the Israeli media – as Ne&#x27;emanei Eretz Yisrael (English: &quot;Those who are loyal/faithful to the Land of Israel&quot;). It also had a close relationship with the Jewish Agency.

==History==
Gush Emunim was founded by students of Zvi Yehuda Kook in February 1974 in the living room of Haim Drukman, who is also credited with coining the term. For the founders of the organization, the Yom Kippur War confirmed what Kook already argued before the outbreak of the Six-Day War: that Jewish settlement in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights was required to hasten the process of redemption. In addition to Drukman, its ideological and political core consisted of other disciples such as Hanan Porat, Moshe Levinger, Shlomo Aviner, Menachem Froman, Eliezer Waldman, Yoel Bin-Nun, and Yaakov Ariel. Kook remained its leader until his death in 1982.

In 1974, an affiliated group named &quot;Garin Elon Moreh&quot;, led by Menachem Felix and Benjamin (Beni) Katzover, attempted to establish a settlement on the ruins of the Sebastia train station dating from the Ottoman period. After seven attempts and six removals from the site by the Israel Defense Forces, an agreement was reached according to which the Israeli government allowed 25 families to settle in the Kadum army camp southwest of Nablus/Shechem. The Sebastia agreement was a turning point that opened up the northern West Bank to Jewish settlement. The small mobile home site housing 25 families eventually became the municipality of Kedumim, one of the major settlements in the West Bank. The Sebastia model was subsequently copied in Beit El, Shavei Shomron, and other settlements.

In 1976, Gush Emunim founded the settlement-building arm Amana, which soon became independent and is still active. In 1979-80, a group of members from Gush Emunim radicalised and formed the Jewish Underground. This organization conducted several terror attacks and plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock. The uncovering of the terrorist organization led to a severe blow to the settler movement&#x27;s reputation. Following the crisis, Gush Emunim&#x27;s role as the formal umbrella organization of the settler movement was gradually taken over by the Yesha Council, although Gush Emunim never formally ceased to exist. Despite being rooted in Gush Emunim, the Yesha Council is considered more practical and pragmatic than its predecessor. The Yesha Council, in its role as the political umbrella organization, and Amana, as the executive, settler-building branch, nowadays form the two main institutions of the settler movement.

Yoel Bin-Nun, one of the founding members of Gush Emunim, broke off from the organization in the aftermath of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.

==Ideology==

The ideological outlook of Gush Emunim has been described as messianic, fundamentalist, theocratic, and right-wing. Its beliefs were based heavily on the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook and his son, Zvi Yehuda Kook, who taught that secular Zionists, through their conquests of &quot;Eretz Israel&quot;, had unwittingly brought about the beginning of the Messianic Age, which would culminate in the coming of the messiah, which Gush Emunim supporters believe can be hastened through Jewish settlement on land they believe God has allotted to the Jewish people as set forth in the Hebrew Bible. The organization supported attempts to co-exist with the Arab population, rejecting the population transfers proposed by Meir Kahane and his followers.

== Impact ==

=== Political impact ===
The overall practical aim of preventing territorial compromise and annexation of occupied territories has only partly been accomplished. Prominent failures include the demolishing and evacuation of settlements in the Sinai peninsula following the Camp David Accords, the phased transfer of jurisdiction to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank as part of the Oslo Accords, and the 2005 Gaza Disengagement.

Gush Emunim and its successors have successfully attracted billions of US dollars for the building and supporting of settlements. The 2005 Sasson Report revealed that the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Defense and the World Zionist Organization spent millions of shekels to support illegal outposts. Between 2013 and 2015, Amana received government funding of approximately 100 million shekels ($29 million). On 31 December 2019, the Israeli High Court of Justice decided that any government donations to the executive branch of the settler movement required approval from the court.

The settler movement has successfully appealed to sentiments related to Israeli identity, making it difficult for government officials and political leaders on the right to distance themselves from the settlers. Support for the settlement project has become mainstream in the US Republican Party, and almost all parties on the right of the political spectrum in Israel have settlers within its leadership. Settlers have been disproportionately represented in government positions. The 2013 government was dubbed the &#x27;settler government&#x27; in a &quot;Haaretz&quot; editorial, due to the number of officials associated with the settler movement in powerful positions within the ministries of Housing and Defense. In October 2017, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pinchas Wallerstein, one of the founders of Gush Emunim, was appointed to head a new government committee created for the purpose of legalising illegal outposts and other types of unauthorised settlements in the West Bank.

=== Societal impact ===
The establishment of Gush Emunim correlated with the revival of the Greater Israel ideology within the national religious community. The settler movement is also accused of provoking a culture of violence, with the Israeli government condoning its actions. The perpetrator of the 1994 Hebron massacre as well as the assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin were proponents of the Greater Israel ideology, with the latter being educated in the Gush Emunim-oriented Yeshivat Kerem B&#x27;Yavneh. The murder of Yitzak Rabin is widely regarded to have been a breaking point in the Oslo peace process.

Since the founding of Gush Emunim in 1974, the number of settlers living in the West Bank has grown from close to zero in 1974 to approximately 440,000 in 2019. The number of settlements until 2020 stood at 132, and the number of illegal outposts at 135.

<text>Thomas Kennerly Wolfe Jr. (March 2, 1930 – May 14, 2018) was an American author and journalist widely known for his association with New Journalism, a style of news writing and journalism developed in the 1960s and 1970s that incorporated literary techniques. Much of Wolfe&#x27;s work is satirical and centres on the counterculture of the 1960s and issues related to class, social status, and the lifestyles of the economic and intellectual elites of New York City.

Wolfe began his career as a regional newspaper reporter in the 1950s, achieving national prominence in the 1960s following the publication of such best-selling books as &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (an account of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters) and two collections of articles and essays, &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot; and &quot;Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers&quot;. In 1979, he published the influential book &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; about the Mercury Seven astronauts, which was made into a 1983 film of the same name directed by Philip Kaufman.

His first novel, &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, published in 1987, was met with critical acclaim and also became a commercial success. Its adaptation as a motion picture of the same name, directed by Brian De Palma, was a critical and commercial failure.

==Early life and education==
Wolfe was born on March 2, 1930, in Richmond, Virginia, the son of Helen Perkins Hughes Wolfe, a garden designer, and Thomas Kennerly Wolfe Sr. (1893–1972), an agronomist and editor of &quot;The Southern Planter&quot;.

He grew up on Gloucester Road in the Richmond North Side neighborhood of Sherwood Park. He recounted childhood memories in a foreword to a book about the nearby historic Ginter Park neighborhood. He was student council president, editor of the school newspaper, and a star baseball player at St. Christopher&#x27;s School, an Episcopal all-boys school in Richmond. In 1991, he wrote another touching remembrance of his childhood in Sherwood Park in a letter to a man who purchased the Wolfe home place.

Upon graduation in 1947, he turned down admission to Princeton University to attend Washington and Lee University. At Washington and Lee, Wolfe was a member of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity. He majored in English, was sports editor of the college newspaper, and helped found a literary magazine, &quot;Shenandoah,&quot; giving him opportunities to practice his writing both inside and outside the classroom. Of particular influence was his professor Marshall Fishwick, a teacher of American studies educated at UVA and Yale. More in the tradition of anthropology than literary scholarship, Fishwick taught his students to look at the whole of a culture, including those elements considered profane. Wolfe&#x27;s undergraduate thesis, entitled &quot;A Zoo Full of Zebras: Anti-Intellectualism in America,&quot; evinced his fondness for words and aspirations toward cultural criticism. Wolfe graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1951.

While still in college, Wolfe continued playing baseball as a pitcher and began to play semi-professionally. In 1952, he earned a tryout with the New York Giants, but was cut after three days, which he blamed on his inability to throw good fastballs. Wolfe abandoned baseball and instead followed his professor Fishwick&#x27;s example, enrolling in Yale University&#x27;s American studies doctoral program. His Ph.D. thesis was titled &quot;The League of American Writers: Communist Organizational Activity Among American Writers, 1929–1942.&quot; In the course of his research, Wolfe interviewed Malcolm Cowley, Archibald MacLeish, and James T. Farrell. A biographer remarked on the thesis: &quot;Reading it, one sees what has been the most baleful influence of graduate education on many who have suffered through it: It deadens all sense of style.&quot; Originally rejected, his thesis was finally accepted after he rewrote it in an objective rather than a subjective style. Upon leaving Yale, he wrote a friend, explaining through expletives his personal opinions about his thesis.

==Journalism and New Journalism==
Though Wolfe was offered teaching jobs in academia, he opted to work as a reporter. In 1956, while still preparing his thesis, Wolfe became a reporter for the &quot;Springfield Union&quot; in Springfield, Massachusetts. Wolfe finished his thesis in 1957.

In 1959, he was hired by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Wolfe has said that part of the reason he was hired by the &quot;Post&quot; was his lack of interest in politics. The Post&#x27;s city editor was &quot;amazed that Wolfe preferred cityside to Capitol Hill, the beat every reporter wanted.&quot; He won an award from The Newspaper Guild for foreign reporting in Cuba in 1961 and also won the Guild&#x27;s award for humor. While there, Wolfe experimented with fiction-writing techniques in feature stories.

In 1962, Wolfe left Washington D.C. for New York City, taking a position with the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; as a general assignment reporter and feature writer. The editors of the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, including Clay Felker of the Sunday section supplement &quot;New York&quot; magazine, encouraged their writers to break the conventions of newspaper writing. Wolfe attracted attention in 1963 when, three months before the JFK assassination, he published an article on George Ohsawa and the sanpaku condition foretelling death.

During the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike, Wolfe approached &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine about an article on the hot rod and custom car culture of southern California. He struggled with the article until his editor, Byron Dobell, suggested that Wolfe send him his notes so they could piece the story together. Wolfe procrastinated. The evening before the deadline, he typed a letter to Dobell explaining what he wanted to say on the subject, ignoring all journalistic conventions. Dobell&#x27;s response was to remove the salutation &quot;Dear Byron&quot; from the top of the letter and publish it intact as reportage. The result, published in 1963, was &quot;There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby.&quot; The article was widely discussed—loved by some, hated by others. Its notoriety helped Wolfe gain publication of his first book, &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;, a collection of his writings from the &quot;Herald-Tribune&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and other publications.

This was what Wolfe called New Journalism, in which some journalists and essayists experimented with a variety of literary techniques, mixing them with the traditional ideal of dispassionate, even-handed reporting. Wolfe experimented with four literary devices not normally associated with feature writing: scene-by-scene construction, extensive dialogue, multiple points of view, and detailed description of individuals&#x27; status-life symbols (the material choices people make) in writing this stylized form of journalism. He later referred to this style as literary journalism. Of the use of status symbols, Wolfe has said, &quot;I think every living moment of a human being&#x27;s life, unless the person is starving or in immediate danger of death in some other way, is controlled by a concern for status.&quot;

Wolfe also championed what he called &quot;saturation reporting,&quot; a reportorial approach in which the journalist &quot;shadows&quot; and observes the subject over an extended period of time. &quot;To pull it off,&quot; says Wolfe, &quot;you casually have to stay with the people you are writing about for long stretches ... long enough so that you are actually there when revealing scenes take place in their lives.&quot; Saturation reporting differs from &quot;in-depth&quot; and &quot;investigative&quot; reporting, which involve the direct interviewing of numerous sources and/or the extensive analyzing of external documents relating to the story. Saturation reporting, according to communication professor Richard Kallan, &quot;entails a more complex set of relationships wherein the journalist becomes an involved, more fully reactive witness, no longer distanced and detached from the people and events reported.&quot;

Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; is considered a striking example of New Journalism. This account of the Merry Pranksters, a famous sixties counter-culture group, was highly experimental in Wolfe&#x27;s use of onomatopoeia, free association, and eccentric punctuation—such as multiple exclamation marks and italics—to convey the manic ideas and personalities of Ken Kesey and his followers.

In addition to his own work, Wolfe edited a collection of New Journalism with E. W. Johnson, published in 1973 and titled &quot;The New Journalism&quot;. This book published pieces by Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer, Gay Talese, Joan Didion, and several other well-known writers, with the common theme of journalism that incorporated literary techniques and which could be considered literature.

==Non-fiction books==
In 1965, Wolfe published a collection of his articles in this style, &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;, adding to his notability. He published a second collection of articles, &quot;The Pump House Gang&quot;, in 1968. Wolfe wrote on popular culture, architecture, politics, and other topics that underscored, among other things, how American life in the 1960s had been transformed by post-WWII economic prosperity. His defining work from this era is &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (published the same day as &quot;The Pump House Gang&quot; in 1968), which for many epitomized the 1960s. Although a conservative in many ways (in 2008, he claimed never to have used LSD and to have tried marijuana only once), Wolfe became one of the notable figures of the decade.

In 1970, he published two essays in book form as &quot;Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers&quot;. &quot;Radical Chic&quot; was a biting account of a party given by composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein to raise money for the Black Panther Party. &quot;Mau-Mauing The Flak Catchers&quot; was about the practice by some African Americans of using racial intimidation (&quot;mau-mauing&quot;) to extract funds from government welfare bureaucrats (&quot;flak catchers&quot;). Wolfe&#x27;s phrase, &quot;radical chic&quot;, soon became a popular derogatory term for critics to apply to upper-class leftism. His &quot;Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine&quot; (1977) included Wolfe&#x27;s noted essay, &quot;The &quot;Me&quot; Decade and the Third Great Awakening&quot;.
In 1979, Wolfe published &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, an account of the pilots who became America&#x27;s first astronauts. Following their training and unofficial, even foolhardy, exploits, he likened these heroes to &quot;single combat warriors&quot; of a bygone era, going forth to battle in the Space Race on behalf of their country. In 1983, the book was adapted into an Academy Award-winning feature film.

Wolfe also wrote two critiques of and social histories of modern art and modern architecture, &quot;The Painted Word&quot; and &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House&quot;, published in 1975 and 1981, respectively. &quot;The Painted Word&quot; mocked the excessive insularity of the art world and its dependence on what he saw as faddish critical theory. In &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House&quot; he explored what he said were the negative effects of the Bauhaus style on the evolution of modern architecture.

In 2016, Wolfe published &quot;The Kingdom of Speech&quot;, a critique of the work of Charles Darwin and Noam Chomsky. Wolfe synthesized what he construed as the views of Alfred Russel Wallace and Chomsky on the language organ as not being a product of natural selection to suggest that speech is an invention that is responsible for establishing our humanity. Some critics claimed that Wolfe&#x27;s view on how humans developed speech were not supported by research and were opinionated.

== Made-for-TV movie ==
In 1977, PBS produced &quot;Tom Wolfe&#x27;s Los Angeles&quot;, a fictional, satirical TV movie set in Los Angeles. Wolfe appears in the movie as himself.

==Novels==
Throughout his early career, Wolfe had planned to write a novel to capture the wide reach of American society. Among his models was William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, which described the society of 19th-century England. In 1981, he ceased his other work to concentrate on the novel.

Wolfe began researching the novel by observing cases at the Manhattan Criminal Court and shadowing members of the homicide squad in The Bronx. While the research came easily, he encountered difficulty in writing. To overcome his writer&#x27;s block, Wolfe wrote to Jann Wenner, editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, to propose an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and Thackeray: to serialize his novel. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to serialize his work. The frequent deadline pressure gave him the motivation he had sought, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Later Wolfe was unhappy with his &quot;very public first draft&quot; and thoroughly revised his work, even changing his protagonist, Sherman McCoy. Wolfe had originally made him a writer, but recast him as a bond salesman. Wolfe researched and revised for two years, and his &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; was published in 1987. The book was a commercial and critical success, spending weeks on bestseller lists and earning praise from the very literary establishment on which Wolfe had long heaped scorn.

Because of the success of Wolfe&#x27;s first novel, there was widespread interest in his second. This novel took him more than 11 years to complete; &quot;A Man in Full&quot; was published in 1998. The book&#x27;s reception was not universally favorable, though it received glowing reviews in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and elsewhere. An initial printing of 1.2 million copies was announced and the book stayed at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ bestseller list for ten weeks. Noted author John Updike wrote a critical review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, complaining that the novel &quot;amounts to entertainment, not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.&quot; His comments sparked an intense war of words in the print and broadcast media among Wolfe and Updike, and authors John Irving and Norman Mailer, who also entered the fray. The novel was selected to be adapted into a television series by Netflix in 2021.

In 2001, Wolfe published an essay referring to his three main literary critics as &quot;My Three Stooges.&quot; That year he also published &quot;Hooking Up&quot; (a collection of short pieces, including the 1997 novella &quot;Ambush at Fort Bragg&quot;).

He published his third novel, &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot; (2004), chronicling the decline of a poor, bright scholarship student from Alleghany County, North Carolina, after attending an elite university. He conveys an institution filled with snobbery, materialism, anti-intellectualism, and sexual promiscuity. The novel met with a mostly tepid response by critics. Many social conservatives praised it in the belief that its portrayal revealed widespread moral decline. The novel won a Bad Sex in Fiction Award from the London-based &quot;Literary Review&quot;, a prize established &quot;to draw attention to the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel&quot;. Wolfe later explained that such sexual references were deliberately clinical.

Wolfe wrote that his goal in writing fiction was to document contemporary society in the tradition of Charles Dickens, Émile Zola, and John Steinbeck.

Wolfe announced in early 2008 that he was leaving his longtime publisher, Farrar, Straus and Giroux. His fourth novel, &quot;Back to Blood&quot;, was published in October 2012 by Little, Brown and Company. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wolfe was paid close to US$7 million for the book. According to the publisher, &quot;Back to Blood&quot; is about &quot;class, family, wealth, race, crime, sex, corruption and ambition in Miami, the city where America&#x27;s future has arrived first.&quot; The book was released to mixed reviews. &quot;Back to Blood&quot; was an even bigger commercial failure than &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Kurt Vonnegut said Wolfe is &quot;the most exciting—or, at least, the most jangling—journalist to appear in some time,&quot; and &quot;a genius who will do anything to get attention.&quot; Paul Fussell called Wolfe a splendid writer and stated &quot;Reading him is exhilarating not because he makes us hopeful of the human future but because he makes us share the enthusiasm with which he perceives the actual.&quot; Critic Dwight Garner praised Wolfe as &quot;a brilliantly gifted social observer and satirist&quot; who &quot;made a fetish of close and often comically slashing detail&quot; and was &quot;unafraid of kicking up at the pretensions of the literary establishment.&quot; Harold Bloom described Wolfe as &quot;a fierce storyteller, and a vastly adequate social satirist&quot;. Novelist Louis Auchincloss praised Wolfe, describing &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; as &quot;a marvelous book&quot;.

Critic James Wood disparaged Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;big subjects, big people, and yards of flapping exaggeration. No one of average size emerges from his shop; in fact, no real human variety can be found in his fiction, because everyone has the same enormous excitability.&quot;

In 2000, Wolfe was criticised by Norman Mailer, John Updike and John Irving, after they were asked if they believed that his books were deserving of their critical acclaim. Mailer compared reading a Wolfe novel to having sex with a 300 lb woman, saying, &quot;Once she gets to the top it&#x27;s all over. Fall in love or be asphyxiated.&quot; Updike was more literary in his reservedness: He claimed that &quot;A Man in Full&quot; &quot;amounts to entertainment, not literature, even literature in a modest aspirant form.&quot; Irving was perhaps the most dismissive, saying &quot;It&#x27;s like reading a bad newspaper or a bad piece in a magazine... read sentences and watch yourself gag.&quot; Wolfe responded, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a tantrum. It&#x27;s a wonderful tantrum. &quot;A Man in Full&quot; panicked Irving the same way it panicked Updike and Norman. Frightened them. Panicked them.&quot; He later called Updike and Mailer &quot;two old piles of bones&quot; and said again that Irving was frightened by the quality of his work. Later that year he published an essay titled &quot;My Three Stooges&quot; about the critics.

==Recurring themes==
Wolfe&#x27;s writing throughout his career showed an interest in social status competition.

Much of Wolfe&#x27;s later work addresses neuroscience. He notes his fascination in &quot;Sorry, Your Soul Just Died&quot;, one of the essays in &quot;Hooking Up&quot;. This topic is also featured in &quot;I Am Charlotte Simmons&quot;, as the title character is a student of neuroscience. Wolfe describes the characters&#x27; thought and emotional processes, such as fear, humiliation and lust, in the clinical terminology of brain chemistry. Wolfe also frequently gives detailed descriptions of various aspects of his characters&#x27; anatomies.

==White suit==
Wolfe adopted wearing a white suit as a trademark in 1962. He bought his first white suit, planning to wear it in the summer, in the style of Southern gentlemen. He found that the suit he had bought was too heavy for summer use, so he wore it in winter, which created a sensation. At the time, white suits were supposed to be reserved for summer wear. Wolfe maintained this as a trademark. He sometimes accompanied it with a white tie, white homburg hat, and two-tone spectator shoes. Wolfe said that the outfit disarmed the people he observed, making him, in their eyes, &quot;a man from Mars, the man who didn&#x27;t know anything and was eager to know.&quot;

==Views==

In 1989, Wolfe wrote an essay for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, titled &quot;Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast&quot;. It criticized modern American novelists for failing to engage fully with their subjects, and suggested that modern literature could be saved by a greater reliance on journalistic technique.

Asked to comment by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on blogs in 2007 to mark the tenth anniversary of their advent, Wolfe wrote that &quot;the universe of blogs is a universe of rumors&quot; and that &quot;blogs are an advance guard to the rear.&quot; He also took the opportunity to criticize Wikipedia, saying that &quot;only a primitive would believe a word of&quot; it. He noted a story about him in his Wikipedia bio article at the time which he said had never happened.

===Politics===
Wolfe&#x27;s views and choice of subject material, such as mocking left-wing intellectuals in &quot;Radical Chic&quot;, glorifying astronauts in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, and critiquing Noam Chomsky in &quot;The Kingdom of Speech&quot; sometimes resulted in his being labeled conservative. Wolfe has been labeled a conservative by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;. Editor Byron Dobell labelled Wolfe a reactionary; while a member of the Black Panther Party called him a racist, due to his portrayal of the party in &quot;Radical Chic&quot;.

Wolfe rejected such labels, saying, &quot;If I have been judged to be right wing, I think this is because of the things I have mocked.&quot; Wolfe opposed the American two-party system. In an October 2012 interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, he stated that he had &quot;voted for every [presidential election] winner since I’ve been old enough to vote&quot;, with the exception of Bill Clinton in the 1992 election. Later in the interview, Wolfe said: &quot;Our federal government is like a train on the track... There are people on the right and people on the left, they’re yelling at it. The train has no choice; it’s on its track! Everyone gets forced to the center, which is fine with me... I read all these things about the country fading, but if you really think about it, we’re still giants!&quot;

Wolfe supported George W. Bush as a political candidate and said he voted for him for president in 2004 because of what he called Bush&#x27;s &quot;great decisiveness and willingness to fight&quot;. Bush reciprocated the admiration, and is said to have read all of Wolfe&#x27;s books, according to friends in 2005. Wolfe supported the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, but opposed the Iraq War.

In a 2004 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Wolfe said that his &quot;idol&quot; in writing about society and culture is Émile Zola. Wolfe described Zola as &quot;a man of the left&quot;, one who &quot;went out, and found a lot of ambitious, drunk, slothful and mean people out there. Zola simply could not—and was not interested in—telling a lie.&quot; In the same interview, Wolfe said that political correctness &quot;has probably had a good effect because it is now bad manners to use racial epithets.&quot; However, in 2017, he attacked political correctness, mocking it as perpetual outrage.

In 2016, Wolfe described Donald Trump as a &quot;lovable megalomaniac...The childishness makes him seem honest.&quot; Wolfe later compared Trump to literary character Jay Gatsby.

===Religion===
Wolfe was an atheist but said that &quot;I hate people who go around saying they&#x27;re atheists&quot;. Of his religious upbringing, Wolfe observed that he &quot;was raised as a Presbyterian&quot;. He sometimes referred to himself as a &quot;lapsed Presbyterian.&quot; Wolfe was a defender of Catholic schools. Wolfe was also critical of the sexual revolution, describing it as a &quot;sexual carnival.&quot; He expressed sympathy towards Puritanical-Christian views on sexuality.

==Personal life==
Wolfe lived in New York City with his wife Sheila, who designed covers for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. They had two children: a daughter, Alexandra; and a son, Thomas Kennerly III.

==Death and legacy==
Wolfe died from an infection in Manhattan on May 14, 2018, at the age of 88.

The historian Meredith Hindley credits Wolfe with introducing the terms &quot;statusphere&quot;, &quot;the right stuff&quot;, &quot;radical chic&quot;, &quot;the Me Decade&quot; and &quot;good ol&#x27; boy&quot; into the English lexicon.

Wolfe was at times incorrectly credited with coining the term &quot;trophy wife&quot;. His term for extremely thin women in his novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; was &quot;social X-rays&quot;.

According to journalism professor Ben Yagoda, Wolfe is also responsible for the use of the present tense in magazine profile pieces; before he began doing so in the early 1960s, profile articles had always been written in the past tense.

Wolfe is the subject of the 2023 documentary film &quot;Radical Wolfe&quot;. The film was based on a 2015 article by Michael Lewis and directed by Richard Dewey. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a sprightly look at what made the reporter-trained Wolfe into the insider&#x27;s outsider, how he made the leap to explicating — in supercharged, acrobatic sentences — our fast-changing, roving world of cliques, castes and subgroups&quot;.

<doc id="182821" wikidata="Q175653" url="?curid=182821" title="Siege of Sarajevo">
<text>The siege of Sarajevo () was a prolonged blockade of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the ethnically charged Bosnian War. After it was initially besieged by Serbian forces of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, the city was then besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska. Lasting from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996 (1,425 days), it was three times longer than the Battle of Stalingrad, more than a year longer than the siege of Leningrad, and was therefore the longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare.

When Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia after the 1992 Bosnian independence referendum, the Bosnian Serbs—whose strategic goal was to create a new Bosnian Serb state of Republika Srpska (RS) that would include Bosniak-majority areas—encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 13,000 stationed in the surrounding hills. From there they blockaded the city, and assaulted it with artillery, tanks, and small arms, dropping at least 500,000 bombs.

Units of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) inside the city, who numbered around 70,000 troops, without heavy weapons or armor, defended much of the urban area of the city throughout the war but were unable to break the siege, which was lifted following the signing of the Dayton Agreement on 14 December 1995.

A total of 13,952 people were killed during the siege, including 5,434 civilians. The ARBiH sustained 6,137 fatalities, while Bosnian Serb military casualties numbered 2,241 killed soldiers. The 1991 census indicates that before the siege, the city and its surrounding areas had a total population of 525,980. According to some estimates, the total population of the city proper prior to the siege was 435,000. Estimates of the population of Sarajevo after the siege ranged from 300,000 to 380,000. Sarajevo&#x27;s population endured up to six months without gas, electricity or water supply during certain stages of the siege.

After the war, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted four Serb officials for numerous counts of crimes against humanity which they committed during the siege, including terrorism. Stanislav Galić and Dragomir Milošević were sentenced to life imprisonment and 29 years imprisonment respectively. Their superiors, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, were also convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Background==
From its establishment after World War II until its breakup in 1991 and 1992, the government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia suppressed the nationalist sentiments which existed among the many ethnic and religious groups which comprised the population of the country, a policy which prevented the occurrence of chaos and the breakup of the state. When Yugoslavia&#x27;s longtime leader Marshal Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, this policy of containment underwent a dramatic reversal. Nationalism experienced a renaissance in the following decade after violence erupted in Kosovo. While the goal of Serbian nationalists was the centralization of a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, other nationalities in Yugoslavia aspired to federalization and the decentralization of the state.

On 18 November 1990, the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina (with a second round on 25 November). They resulted in a national assembly dominated by three ethnically based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power. Croatia and Slovenia&#x27;s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the Yugoslav federation (overwhelmingly favoured among Serbs) or to seek independence (overwhelmingly favoured among Bosniaks and Croats).

Throughout 1990, the RAM Plan was developed by the State Security Administration (SDB or SDS) and a group of selected Serb officers of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) with the purpose of organizing Serbs outside Serbia, consolidating control of the fledgling SDP, and the prepositioning of arms and ammunition. The plan was meant to prepare the framework for a third Yugoslavia in which all Serbs with their territories would live together in the same state. Alarmed, the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia on 15 October 1991, shortly followed by the establishment of the Serbian National Assembly by Bosnian Serbs.

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of Serb Democratic Party (SDP) members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that had governed after the 1990 elections. This Assembly established the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, which became the Republika Srpska in August 1992.

The declaration of Bosnian sovereignty was followed by a referendum for independence on 29 February and 1 March 1992, which was boycotted by the vast majority of Serbs. The turnout in the referendum was 63.4% with 99.7% of voters choosing independence.

Violence broke out in many places during and after the referendum. On 1 March, a gunman opened fire at a Bosnian Serb wedding procession in Baščaršija, Sarajevo&#x27;s historical centre and a Bosniak section of the city. The guests were carrying and waving Serbian flags, an act which the Bosniaks, who mostly supported independence, interpreted as a deliberate provocation. The groom&#x27;s father was killed, and an Orthodox priest was wounded. Some of the witnesses identified the shooter as Ramiz Delalić, a Bosniak gangster who had become increasingly brazen since the collapse of communism. Arrest warrants were issued for him and another assailant, but little effort was made by the Sarajevo police to apprehend them. The killing was denounced by the SDS, who charged that the SDA or the government was complicit in the shooting, as evidenced by their failure to arrest the suspects. An SDS spokesman claimed the wedding attack was evidence of the mortal danger Serbs would be subject to in an independent Bosnia. This statement was rejected by the founder of the Patriotic League, Sefer Halilović, who stated that the procession was not a wedding but was in fact intended as a provocation.

On 2 March, Serb paramilitaries set up barricades and positioned snipers near Sarajevo&#x27;s parliament building, but their &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was thwarted by thousands of Sarajevo citizens who took to the streets and placed themselves in front of the snipers. Armed Bosniaks known as &quot;Green Berets&quot; also erected barricades in and around Sarajevo. More barricades appeared near Banja Luka, and a motorist was killed by armed Serbs in Doboj. By the end of the day, twelve people had been killed in the fighting. Following Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s official declaration of independence from Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992, sporadic fighting broke out between Serbs and government forces all across the territory. It continued through the run-up to Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s recognition as an independent state.

On 3 March, Bosnia&#x27;s Bosniak President Alija Izetbegović claimed that Serbs from Pale were marching on Sarajevo. Fighting soon broke out in the town of Bosanski Brod. Eleven Serbs were killed in the village of Sijekovac outside of Brod on 26 March, and the SDS claimed they were massacred by a Croat-Bosniak militia. The town was besieged and shelled by the JNA and Serbian paramilitaries on 29 March. There were further clashes in Bijeljina, which was attacked by a Serb force led by Serb Volunteer Guard. On 4 April, as the information of the killings in Bijeljina came to light, the Bosnian government announced a general mobilisation call. The SDS responded that this call brought Sarajevo one step closer to war.

On 4 April 1992, when Izetbegović ordered all reservists and police in Sarajevo to mobilize, and the SDS called for evacuation of the city&#x27;s Serbs, there came the &quot;definite rupture between the Bosnian government and Serbs&quot;. The following day, ethnic Serb policemen attacked police stations and an Interior Ministry training school. The attack killed two officers and one civilian. The Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared a state of emergency the following day. Later that day, Serb paramilitaries in Sarajevo repeated their action of the previous month. A crowd of peace marchers, between 50,000 and 100,000 comprising all ethnic groups, rallied in protest. When a huge crowd approached a barricade, a demonstrator was killed by Serb forces. Six Serb snipers were arrested, but were exchanged when the Serbs threatened to kill the commandant of the Bosnian police academy arrested the previous day with the takeover of the academy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina received international recognition on 6 April 1992. The most common view is that the war started that day.

On 6 April, Serb forces began shelling Sarajevo, and in the next two days crossed the Drina from Serbia proper and besieged Bosniak-majority Zvornik, Višegrad and Foča. All of Bosnia was engulfed in war by mid-April. There were some efforts to halt violence. On 27 April, the Bosnian government ordered the JNA to be put under civilian control or expelled, which was followed by a series of conflicts in early May between the two. On 2 May, the Green Berets and local gang members fought back a disorganized Serb attack aimed at cutting Sarajevo in two. On 3 May, Izetbegović was kidnapped at Sarajevo Airport by JNA officers, and used to gain safe passage of JNA troops from downtown Sarajevo. However, Bosnian forces dishonoured the agreement and ambushed the departing JNA convoy, which embittered all sides. A ceasefire and agreement on evacuation of the JNA was signed on 18 May, while on 20 May the Bosnian presidency declared the JNA an occupation force.

The JNA attacked the Ministry of Training Academy in Vraca, the central tramway depot, and the Old Town district with mortars, artillery and tank fire. The Bosnian government had expected the international community to deploy a peacekeeping force following recognition, but it did not materialize in time to prevent war from breaking out across the country.

Bosnian Serb and JNA troops overwhelmed the poorly equipped and unprepared Bosnian security forces to take control of large areas of Bosnian territory, beginning with attacks on Bosniak civilians in the east. Serb military, police and paramilitary forces attacked towns and villages and then, sometimes assisted by local Serb residents, applied what soon became their standard operating procedure: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burned; civilians were rounded up, some beaten or killed; and men were separated from the women. Many of the men were forcibly removed to prison camps. The women were incarcerated in detention centres in extremely unhygienic conditions and suffered numerous severe abuses. Many were repeatedly raped. Survivors testified that Serb soldiers and police would visit the detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.

On 22 April, a peace rally in front of the Republic Assembly building was broken up by shots that came from the nearby Holiday Inn. By the end of April, the form of the siege was largely established. The Serb-inhabited Sarajevan suburb of Ilidža saw heavy fighting between the local Serb forces on one side and various Bosniak forces on the other. The local Serbs soon formed the Ilidža Brigade, which became a part of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps of the VRS.

====Early fighting for control of the city====
In the months leading up to the war, JNA forces in the region began to mobilize in the hills surrounding Sarajevo. Artillery, together with other ordnance and equipment that would prove key in the coming siege of the city, was deployed at this time. In April 1992, the Bosnian government under Izetbegović demanded that the Yugoslav government remove these forces. Slobodan Milošević, the president of Serbia, agreed only to withdraw individuals who originated from outside Bosnia&#x27;s borders, an insignificant number. JNA soldiers who were ethnic Serbs from Bosnia were transferred to the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić, with the VRS having rescinded its allegiance to Bosnia a few days after Bosnia seceded from Yugoslavia.

On 5 April 1992, a unit of the Yugoslav Peoples Army (JNA) seized the airport of Sarajevo. It was under the direct control of Belgrade.

In May 1992, units of the JNA stationed in Sarajevo found themselves repeatedly under attack. On 2 May, Bosniak forces consisting of the Green Berets and the Patriotic League, opened fire on a column of eight JNA MEDEVAC vehicles in Vojvode Stepe street. This attack caused the JNA to retreat to Serb-held positions in Lukavica district.

On 2 May 1992, Bosnian Serb forces established a total blockade of the city. They blocked the major access roads, cutting supplies of food and medicine, and also cut off the city&#x27;s utilities (e.g., water, electricity and heating). Although they possessed superior weaponry, they were greatly outnumbered by ARBiH soldiers who were defending the city. After numerous JNA armored columns failed to take the city, the Serbs began to concentrate their efforts on weakening it by using continual bombardment from at least 200 reinforced positions and bunkers in the surrounding hills.

On 3 May 1992, members of the ARBiH attacked a convoy of withdrawing JNA soldiers on Dobrovoljačka Street in Sarajevo. The attack is thought to have been in retaliation for the arrest of Izetbegović, who was detained at Sarajevo Airport by Yugoslav police the previous day. The attack started with the convoy being separated when a car was driven into it. Then sporadic and disorganized fighting took place for several minutes in and around the convoy. 6–42 soldiers were killed in the incident. General Milutin Kukanjac, the commander of the JNA in Sarajevo, confirmed that just in Dobrovoljačka street alone four officers, one soldier and one civilian were killed in the attack. General Lewis MacKenzie, the UN peacekeeper in Sarajevo and who was in the convoy described what he saw: &quot;I could see the Territorial Defense soldiers push the rifles through the windows of civilians&#x27; cars, which were part of the convoy, and shoot [...] I saw blood flow down the windshields. It was definitely the worst day of my life.&quot; In the Documentary &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; Lewis MacKenzie described how the convoy split in half: &quot;I believe a red Volkswagen took off and driven across the intersection and blocked and split the convoy in two.&quot; General Jovan Divijak, a commander for the ARBiH in Sarajevo, tried to stop the shooting and calm things down.

Shellings of Sarajevo on 24, 26, 28 and 29 May were attributed to Mladić by Boutros-Ghali. Civilian casualties of a 27 May shelling of the city led to Western intervention, in the form of sanctions imposed on 30 May through United Nations Security Council Resolution 757. That same day Bosnian forces attacked the JNA barracks in the city, which was followed by heavy shelling. On 5 and 6 June the last JNA personnel left the city during heavy street fighting and shelling. The 20 June cease-fire, executed to allow the UN takeover of Sarajevo Airport for humanitarian flights, was broken as both sides battled for control of the territory between the city and airport. The airport crisis led to Boutros-Ghali&#x27;s ultimatum on 26 June, that the Serbs stop attacks on the city, allow the UN to take control of the airport, and place their heavy weapons under UN supervision. Meanwhile, media reported that President George H. W. Bush considered the use of force in Bosnia. French President Francois Mitterrand visited Sarajevo on 28–29 June. Undramatically, the Serbs handed over the airport to UNPROFOR on 29 June. World public opinion was &#x27;decisively and permanently against the Serbs&#x27; following media reports on the sniping and shelling.

From 25 to 26 August, under command of Colonel Tomislav Šipčić, the Sarajevo City Hall was burned down by cannon fire from Serb positions.

On 30 August 1992, an artillery shell crashed into a crowded marketplace on the western edge of Sarajevo. The resulting explosion killed 15 people and wounded 100 others.
===1993===
On 8 January 1993, Hakija Turajlić, the Deputy Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb soldier. Turajlić, who had gone to Sarajevo Airport to greet a Turkish delegation, was returning to the city in a United Nations armored vehicle that had taken him there when a force of two tanks and 40–50 Bosnian Serb soldiers blockaded the road. The Serbs, acting on radioed information from a Serbian military liaison officer at the airport that &quot;Turkish fighters&quot; were on their way to reinforce the Bosnian defenders, accused the three French soldiers manning the armored vehicle of transporting &quot;Turkish mujahedeen&quot;. After a Serbian military liaison officer identified the passenger as Turajlić, the Serbs ordered the UN soldiers to hand him over. The rear door was opened, and one of the Serbs fired seven shots at Turajlić from an automatic weapon. Six bullets struck him in the chest and arms, killing him instantly. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Goran Vasić, was eventually charged with Turajlić&#x27;s murder but was ultimately acquitted of that charge in 2002.

On 6 May 1993, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 824 declared that Sarajevo be a UN Safe Area (along with Žepa, Goražde, Tuzla, and Bihać). These cities and territories were placed under the protection of UNPROFOR peacekeeping units.

===1994===

====Markale massacres====
On 5 February 1994 at 12:10–12:15, a 120-millimeter mortar shell landed in the center of the crowded marketplace and killed 68 and injured 144. The perpetrators were the Army of Republika Srpska. In December 2003, the ICTY convicted Bosnian Serb General Stanislav Galić, concluded that the Serb forces around Sarajevo committed the massacre.

In February 1994 (when air strikes were originally threatened), NATO had created a heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons at a number of sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.

On 22 September, UNPROFOR again requested NATO air support in the Sarajevo area after Serb forces attacked a French armored personnel carrier. In response, two British SEPECAT Jaguar aircraft struck near a Serb tank, destroying it.

===1995===
From 15 to 22 June, the ARBiH would launch an offensive into the Sarajevo Region to try to recapture lost territories from the Serbs. In the north, the 16th Division/1st Corps attacked Cemerska Hills and recaptured it. The Serbs would attack and capture Cemerska hills from the ARBiH. From the center, the 12th Division/1st Corps attacked Serb position of Debelo Brdo. In the south, the 14 Division/1st managed to push the Serbs back to Route Viper and captured the most land from the offensive.

On 28 August 1995 at around 11:00 (Central European Time), five shells were fired onto the Markale Market, causing the 2nd Markale massacre. Casualties were fewer however, 43 died and 73 were wounded. But just several hours prior to the attack, Bosnian Serb authorities tentatively expressed their will to accept Richard Holbrooke&#x27;s peace plan. Again the perpetrator was the VRS.

== Humanitarian airlift ==
UNPROFOR launched its humanitarian airlift operations, providing Sarajevo with much-needed supplies from mid-1992 to the beginning of 1995. More than 13,000 flights were made over the course of more than three years. It was the most airlifts to a capital city since the Berlin airlifts.

While capitalizing on the fact that the airport was under the control of UNPROFOR, defenders of Sarajevo began digging a tunnel beneath the runway that ran between the Sarajevo neighborhoods of Dobrinja and Butmir. It would be known as the &quot;Sarajevo Tunnel&quot;. It would become the only land link besieged Sarajevo had with the rest of the world. Several hundred people died while running across the airstrip, which was the only way in or out of besieged Sarajevo before the Sarajevo War Tunnel was dug.

==Atrocities==
The second half of 1992 and the first half of 1993 were the height of the siege of Sarajevo, and atrocities were committed during heavy fighting. Serb forces outside the city continuously shelled the government defenders. Inside the city, the Serbs controlled most of the major military positions and the supply of arms. With snipers taking up positions in the city, signs reading &quot;Pazite, Snajper!&quot; (&quot;Beware, Sniper!&quot;) became commonplace and certain particularly dangerous streets, most notably Ulica Zmaja od Bosne, the main street which eventually leads to the airport, were known as &quot;sniper alleys&quot;. The sniper killings of Admira Ismić and Boško Brkić, a mixed Bosnian-Serbian couple who tried to cross the lines, became a symbol of the suffering in the city and the basis of &quot;Romeo and Juliet in Sarajevo&quot;, but it is unknown from which side the snipers opened fire.

Within Bosniak-held areas of Sarajevo, public services quickly collapsed and the crime rate skyrocketed. During the first year of the siege, the 10th Mountain Division of the ARBiH, led by a rogue commander, Mušan Topalović, engaged in a campaign of mass executions of Serb civilians who still lived within the Bosniak-held areas. Many of the victims were transported to the Kazani pit near Sarajevo, where they were executed and buried in a mass grave.

Bosnian Serb offensives were mounted to take over some neighbourhoods, especially in Novo Sarajevo. Compared with the siege force, the Bosnian government forces were very poorly armed. Bosnian black market criminals who joined the army at the outset of the war illegally smuggled arms into the city through Serb lines, and raids on Serb-held positions within the city yielded more.
Reports indicated an average of approximately 329 shell impacts per day during the course of the siege, with a maximum of 3,777 on 22 July 1993. This urbicide by shellfire extensively damaged the city&#x27;s structures, both residential and cultural. By September 1993 it was estimated that virtually all the buildings in Sarajevo had suffered some degree of damage, and 35,000 were completely destroyed. Among buildings targeted and destroyed were hospitals and medical complexes, media and communication centres, industrial complexes, government buildings and military and UN facilities. Other significant buildings damaged or destroyed included the Parliament buildings and the City Hall/National Library, which was set on fire and burned to the ground, destroying over 1,500,000 volumes and 600,000 serials.

The shelling took a heavy toll on residents. Mass killings of civilians, primarily by mortar attacks, made headline news in the West. On 1 June 1993, 11 people were killed and 133 were wounded in an attack on a football game. On 12 July, twelve people were killed while waiting in line for water.

The biggest single loss of life was the first Markale marketplace massacre on 5 February 1994, in which 68 civilians were killed and 200 were wounded. Medical facilities were overwhelmed by the scale of the civilian casualties, and only a small number of the wounded benefited from medical evacuation programmes like 1993&#x27;s Operation Irma.

==NATO&#x27;s intervention==
On 6 February 1994, a day after the first Markale marketplace massacre, UN Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali formally requested NATO&#x27;s confirmation that air strikes would be carried out immediately. On 9 February 1994, agreeing to the request of the UN, the North Atlantic Council of NATO authorized the Commander of Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH), U.S. Admiral Jeremy Boorda, to launch air strikes against artillery and mortar positions in and around Sarajevo that were determined by UNPROFOR to be responsible for attacks against civilian targets. Only Greece failed to support the use of airstrikes, but did not veto the proposal. The council also issued an ultimatum at the 9 February meeting to the Bosnian Serbs demanding that they remove heavy weapons around Sarajevo by midnight of 20–21 February or face air strikes. There was some confusion surrounding compliance with the ultimatum, and Hungarian Prime Minister Péter Boross announced that his country&#x27;s air space would be closed to NATO aircraft in the event of airstrikes. On 12 February 1994, Sarajevo enjoyed its first casualty-free day in 22 months (since April 1992).

As many as 400 NATO aircraft participated in the air campaign.
On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, the Serbs injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, prompting the Serbs to return the seized weapons to the collection site.
On 22 September, UNPROFOR again requested NATO air support in the Sarajevo area after Serb forces attacked a French armored personnel carrier. In response, two British Jaguar aircraft struck and destroyed a Serb tank.

As the fighting gradually widened in 1995, Bosnian Muslim forces launched a large-scale offensive in the area of Sarajevo. In response to the attack, the Bosnian Serbs seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot, and began shelling targets. As a retaliation for these actions, the UN commander, Lt. General Rupert Smith, requested NATO air strikes. NATO honored the request on 25 May and 26 May 1995 by bombing a Serb ammunition dump near Pale. The mission was carried out by USAF F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. The Serbs then seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of targets in Bosnia, forcing NATO to end its strikes.

On 27 May 1995, Serb soldiers posing as French troops captured two UN observation posts at either end of the front-line Vrbanja bridge without firing a shot. They wore French uniforms, flak jackets and helmets, were armed with French weapons and drove a French armoured personnel carrier – all stolen from UN troops detained outside the city. The soldiers disarmed the 12 peacekeepers at gunpoint. Ten were taken to an unknown destination while two remained on the bridge as human shields. The French responded by sending 30 troops, backed by six light tanks, to storm the northern end of the bridge. Two French soldiers were killed in the clash and five were wounded, while four Serb soldiers were killed and four were taken prisoner. At the end of the day, the Serbs remained in control of the southern portion of the bridge, while the French occupied the northern portion. The Serbs later abandoned the southern portion of the bridge.

In 1995, the international forces firmly turned against the besiegers after the second Markale massacre of 28 August. On 30 August, the Secretary General of NATO announced the start of air strikes, supported by UNPROFOR rapid reaction force artillery attacks. On that same day, a French Mirage 2000 was downed by a Bosnian Serb shoulder-fired SAM near Pale.

On 1 September, NATO and the UN demanded the lifting of the siege, removal of heavy weapons from the heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and complete security of other UN safe areas. The Bosnian Serb leaders were given a deadline of 4 September, and the Operation Deliberate Force bombing campaign was suspended. Heavy weapons had not been removed when the deadline passed. On 5 September, air strikes resumed on Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo and near the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale.

On 14 September, they were again suspended, this time to allow the implementation of an agreement with the Bosnian Serbs which included the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the exclusion zone. Finally, on 20 September 1995, French General Bernard Janvier (Commander of UNPROFOR) and U.S. Admiral Leighton W. Smith Jr. (CINCSOUTH) agreed that it was not necessary to resume the strikes as the Bosnian Serbs had complied with the UN&#x27;s conditions. Operation Deliberate Force was terminated.

==Lifting of the siege==
Fighting escalated on the ground as joint Bosnian and Croatian forces went on the offensive with Operations Mistral 2, Sana and Southern Move in September–October 1995. The Serbs were slowly driven back in Sarajevo and elsewhere, which eventually allowed the city&#x27;s heating, electricity and water supplies to be restored. A ceasefire was reached in October 1995. On 14 December, the Dayton Agreement brought peace to the country and led to stabilization.

One of the last acts of hostility of the siege occurred at around 6 pm on 9 January 1996, when a single rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a tram running down the main street of Sarajevo, killing a 55-year-old woman, Mirsada Durić, and wounding 19 others. The grenade was fired from the neighbourhood of Grbavica, which was held by the Serbs at the time. After the attack, French troops from the Implementation Force (IFOR) searched the building from which the grenade was launched but did not capture the perpetrator(s).

The Bosnian government officially declared an end to the siege of Sarajevo on 29 February 1996, when Bosnian Serb forces left positions in and around the city. More than 70,000 Sarajevan Serbs subsequently left the Muslim-controlled districts of the city and moved to the Republika Srpska, taking all of their belongings with them.

==Aftermath==
===Casualties===
The besieged population comprised not only Bosniaks and Croats, but also Serbs that had remained in the town and who were killed by fire from the besieging VRS forces. The 1991 census indicates that before the siege the city and its surrounding areas had a population of 525,980. There are estimates that prior to the siege the population in the city proper was 435,000. Estimates of the current population range between 300,000 and 380,000. In 1994, a report filed on the total number of deaths over a span of 315 days concluded that 2,474 people died, with an average of approximately eight killed in the city per day. A report on the total number of wounded over a span of 306 days concluded that 13,472 were wounded, an average of approximately 44 per day. This same report estimated the number of people killed or missing in the city to be nearly 10,000, including over 1,500 children. An additional 56,000 people were wounded, including nearly 15,000 children. A report produced by the ICTY after the war put the death toll of the siege at 4,548 ARBiH soldiers and 4,954 Sarajevan civilians killed. The Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo (RDC) found that the siege left a total of 13,952 people dead: 9,429 Bosniaks, 3,573 Serbs, 810 Croats and 140 others. Of these, 6,137 were ARBiH soldiers and 2,241 were soldiers fighting either for the JNA or the VRS. On the other hand, according to historian Smail Čekić, the ARBiH suffered 3,587 casualties within the besieged city of Sarajevo, with 1,114 soldiers being killed in 1992 alone. The RDC estimates that a total of 5,434 civilians were killed during the siege, including 3,855 Bosniaks, 1,097 Serbs and 482 Croats. More than 66 percent of those killed during the siege were Bosniaks, 25.6 percent were Serbs, 5.8 percent were Croats and 1 percent were others. About 14.5 percent of all Bosnian War fatalities occurred in besieged Sarajevo. Officials of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina have estimated that at least 150 Sarajevan Serb civilians were killed by government forces, while some nationalistic groups among Serbs and Republika Srpska officials have put the number at &quot;many thousands&quot;. However, efforts to substantiate Bosnian Serb claims have been unconvincing.

UNICEF reported that of the estimated 65,000 to 80,000 children in the city, at least 40% had been directly shot at by snipers; 51% had seen someone killed; 39% had seen one or more family members killed; 19% had witnessed a massacre; 48% had their home occupied by someone else; 73% had their home attacked or shelled; and 89% had lived in underground shelters. It is probable that the psychological trauma suffered during the siege will bear heavily on the lives of these children in the years to come. As a result of the high number of casualties and the wartime conditions, there are makeshift cemeteries throughout Sarajevo and its surrounding areas. Parks, athletic fields and other open spaces were utilized as graveyards. One such site is the sports complex built for the 1984 Winter Olympics. A 1994 report stated that &quot;the siege has also had a profound effect on the psyche and future of the city&#x27;s population. The Bosnian Government has reported a soaring suicide rate by Sarajevans, a near doubling of abortions and a 50% drop in births since the siege began.&quot;

A memorial with the names of 521 children killed during the siege was unveiled on 9 May 2010. The cases of another 500 children are being verified.

===Structural and property damage and destruction===
The structural and property damage in Sarajevo as a result of the siege included specifically protected targets such as hospitals and medical complexes, medical facilities (including ambulances) and medical personnel, as well as cultural property, such as the manuscript collection of the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo, one of the richest collections of Oriental manuscripts in the world. For foreigners, an event that defined the besiegers&#x27; cultural objectives occurred during the night of 25 August 1992. This was the bombardment – with incendiary shells – that resulted in the total destruction of the irreplaceable National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the central repository of Bosnian written culture and a major cultural center for all the Balkans. Among the losses were about 700 manuscripts and incunabula, and a unique collection of Bosnian serial publications, some from the middle of the 19th-century Bosnian cultural revival. Libraries all over the world cooperated afterwards to restore some of the lost heritage, through donations and e-texts, rebuilding the Library in cyberspace.

Also unjustified by any military necessity, and equally prohibited, were the attacks on civilian property. The Bosnian government estimated that shelling destroyed over 10,000 apartments and damaged over 100,000 others. Of the other buildings in the city, 23% were reported as seriously damaged, 64% as partially damaged and 10% as slightly damaged. In its report, the Council of Europe&#x27;s Committee on Culture and Education commented on the structural damage in the city. The Committee stated:

Sarajevo has made a substantial recovery in terms of the number of buildings that have been fully restored and reoccupied. However, as of 2017, many buildings remained heavily damaged and scarred.

Although the city had been a model for inter-ethnic relations, the siege brought dramatic population shifts. In addition to the thousands of refugees who left the city, many Sarajevo Serbs left for the Republika Srpska, and the percentage of Serbs in Sarajevo decreased from more than 30% in 1991 to slightly over 10% in 2002. Regions of Novo Sarajevo that are now part of the Republika Srpska have formed East Sarajevo, where much of the pre-war Serbian population lives today.

New construction projects and foreign capital investment have made Sarajevo perhaps the fastest-growing city in the former Yugoslavia. The population grew to 401,000 in 2002, which is 20,000 fewer than the pre-1991 census estimate.

==Convictions by the ICTY==
On 5 December 2003, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted the first commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, General Stanislav Galić, of the shelling and sniper terror campaign against Sarajevo, including the first Markale massacre. Galić was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crimes against humanity during the siege.

In the case against Galić, the prosecution alleged in an opening statement that:

In 2007, General Dragomir Milošević, who replaced Galić as commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, was found guilty of the shelling and sniper terror campaign against Sarajevo and its citizens from August 1994 to late 1995, including the second Markale massacre. He was sentenced to 29 years in prison. The ICTY concluded that the Markale town market was hit on 28 August 1995 by a 120 mm mortar shell fired from Sarajevo-Romanija Corps positions.
In 2011, the former Chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, General Momčilo Perišić, was sentenced to 27 years in prison for aiding and abetting murder because the army under his supervision provided &quot;large-scale logistic support in ammunition, fuel and spare parts&quot; as well as &quot;necessary expert assistance&quot; to the VRS during the siege. According to an estimate of the Main Staff from 1994, the VRS received about 25 million bullets and over 7,500 shells from the Yugoslav army to wage the war in Bosnia. However, the judges ruled that Perišić did not have effective control over the VRS officers, who largely fought independently of his instructions, yet still received payment and benefits from Belgrade. In 2013, Perišić&#x27;s conviction was overturned and he was released from prison.

In 2016, Republika Srpska leader Radovan Karadžić was found guilty of the Srebrenica massacre as well as 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. In 2019, the appeal he filed against his conviction was rejected and the sentence was increased to life imprisonment.

On 22 November 2017, general Ratko Mladić was also sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty on 10 counts.

<doc id="182822" wikidata="Q1057336" url="?curid=182822" title="Teegarden's Star">
<text>Teegarden&#x27;s Star (&quot;SO J025300.5+165258&quot;, &quot;2MASS J02530084+1652532&quot;, &quot;LSPM J0253+1652&quot;) is an M-type red dwarf star in the constellation Aries, from the Solar System. Although it is near Earth it is a dim magnitude 15 and can only be seen through large telescopes. This star was found to have a very large proper motion of about 5 arcseconds per year. Only seven stars with such large proper motions are currently known. Teegarden&#x27;s Star hosts a planetary system with at least three planets.

== Discovery ==

Teegarden&#x27;s Star was discovered in 2003 using asteroid-tracking data that had been collected years earlier. This data set is a digital archive created from optical images taken over a five-year period by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program using two 1 m telescopes on Maui, Hawaii. The star is named after the discovery team leader, Bonnard J. Teegarden, an astrophysicist at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center.

Astronomers have long thought it was quite likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars exist within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden&#x27;s team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then precovered on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery.

== Properties ==
Teegarden&#x27;s Star is classified as a red dwarf as its approximate calculated mass of just over 0.09 times that of the Sun is narrowly above the limit of brown dwarfs. The inherently low temperature of such objects explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum.

The parallax was initially measured as 0.43 ± 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making Teegarden&#x27;s Star only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between Barnard&#x27;s Star and Wolf 359. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the Sun&#x27;s nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding a distance of 12.578 light-years, very close to the value now accepted.

== Planetary system ==

Observations by the ROPS survey in 2010, published in 2012, showed variation in the radial velocity of Teegarden&#x27;s Star, though there was insufficient data to make claims of planet detection at that time. 

In June 2019, scientists conducting the CARMENES survey at the Calar Alto Observatory announced evidence of two Earth-mass exoplanets orbiting the star within its habitable zone; Teegarden&#x27;s Star b orbits inside the optimistic habitable zone—the equivalent in the Solar System would be in between Earth and Venus—whereas Teegarden&#x27;s Star c orbits on the outer edge of the conservative habitable zone, similarly to Mars.

A 2024 study refined the parameters of the two previously known planets, and detected a third planet orbiting farther out, with a period of 26 days and a minimum mass slightly less than Earth&#x27;s mass. This third planet, Teegarden&#x27;s Star d, orbits beyond the habitable zone and would have temperatures similar to the icy moons of Jupiter. Two longer-period radial velocity signals were also detected; a 96-day signal corresponds to the star&#x27;s rotation, while the origin of a 172-day signal is uncertain.

According to one group of researchers, who were specifically studying this star, both habitable-zone planets could have maintained a dense atmosphere and so therefore there would be a high likelihood that at least one may harbour liquid water. However, another group of scientists, looking at Earth-sized planets in general in the habitable zones of stars, specifically in a likely tidally locked scenario, give Teegarden&#x27;s Star b a 3% chance, and Teegarden&#x27;s Star c only a 2% chance, of having even retained an atmosphere.

While TESS observations confirm that the planets of Teegarden&#x27;s Star do not transit their star as seen from Earth, during the period from 2044-2496, Earth would transit the Sun as seen from Teegarden&#x27;s Star.

<text>Johan Asplund (May 19, 1937 – November 13, 2018) was a Swedish sociologist interested in social interaction and ethnomethodology. At present, his works are not widely translated from the original Swedish. Until his retirement, he held the chair of Sociology at Lund University.

Two of his most widely read books are &quot;Det sociala livets elementära former&quot; (1987, approximately &quot;Elementary forms of social life&quot;), in which he introduces his theory about humans as essentially &quot;socially responsive&quot; (&quot;socialt responsiva&quot;), and &quot;Essä om Gemeinschaft och Gesellschaft&quot; (1991, &quot;Essay about Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft&quot;), in which he explains and discusses this concept, originally developed by the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies, 1887. Johan Asplund&#x27;s writings on cities are summarized in English by Bo Gronlund in New Urban Theory.

<doc id="182833" wikidata="Q170294" url="?curid=182833" title="Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester">
<text>Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester (Richard Alexander Walter George; born 26 August 1944) is a member of the British royal family. He is the second son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, the youngest of the nine grandchildren of George V, nephew of Edward VIII and George VI, and first cousin of Elizabeth II. He is 32nd in the line of succession to the British throne, and the highest person on the list who is not a descendant of George VI. At the time of his birth, he was 5th in line to the throne.

Richard practised as an architect until the death of his elder brother, William, placed him in direct line to inherit his father&#x27;s dukedom of Gloucester, to which he succeeded in 1974. He married Birgitte van Deurs Henriksen on 8 July 1972. They have three children.

==Early life==
Prince Richard was born on 26 August 1944 at 12:15 pm at St Matthew&#x27;s Nursing Home in Northampton, the second son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Alice, Duchess of Gloucester. His father was the third son of King George V and Queen Mary. His mother was the third daughter of John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Margaret Bridgeman. At the time of his birth, he was second in line to his father&#x27;s dukedom, behind his elder brother, Prince William of Gloucester, who was accidentally killed in 1972 before inheriting the title and having any children of his own.

Richard was baptised at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park on 20 October 1944 by the retired Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon Lang. His godparents were his paternal aunt, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Marie Louise (his first cousin twice removed), Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone (his grandaunt and first cousin twice removed, for whom her daughter, Lady May Abel Smith stood proxy), the Duke of Buccleuch (his maternal uncle), the Marquess of Cambridge (his cousin), Lady Sybil Phipps (his maternal aunt), and General the Earl Alexander of Tunis (for whom his wife, then Lady Margaret Alexander, stood proxy). Because of the War, newspapers did not identify the precise location of the christening, saying only that it took place at &quot;a private chapel in the country&quot;. When Richard was four months old, he accompanied his parents to Australia, where his father served as governor-general from 1945 to 1947. The family returned to Barnwell Manor in 1947, where Richard spent most of his childhood.

== Education and career ==
Prince Richard&#x27;s early education took place at home, under the instruction of Rosalind Ramirez, who had also tutored young King Faisal II of Iraq; later, he attended Wellesley House School at Broadstairs and Eton College. In 1963, he matriculated at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he read architecture, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in June 1966. As is customary at Cambridge, this proceeded to MA (Cantab) in 1971.

In 1966, Richard joined the Offices Development Group in the Ministry of Public Building and Works for a year of practical work. He returned to Cambridge in 1967, completing both parts of the Diploma in Architecture degree in June 1969. Upon passing his exams, he became a practising partner with Hunt Thompson Associates, Architects, in London.

==Marriage and family==
On 8 July 1972, Prince Richard married Danish-born Birgitte van Deurs Henriksen at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Barnwell, Northamptonshire; the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester have three children:
* Alexander Patrick Gregers Richard Windsor, Earl of Ulster (born 24 October 1974 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London)
* Lady Davina Elizabeth Alice Benedikte Windsor (born 19 November 1977 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London)
* Lady Rose Victoria Birgitte Louise Gilman (born 1 March 1980 at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London)
The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester&#x27;s official residence is at Kensington Palace in London. They have leased their private home, Barnwell Manor, since 1994. In September 2022, the Duke put the manor up for sale for £4.75 million.

==Activities==
Prince Richard ended his architectural career in 1972, after the death of his elder brother Prince William, who crashed his plane in a flying competition. Richard became heir apparent to his father&#x27;s dukedom and had to take on additional family obligations and royal duties on behalf of the Queen. He became Duke of Gloucester on his father&#x27;s death on 10 June 1974.

Prince Richard was elected as a corporate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (and FRIBA) in 1972. He is president of the Society of Architect Artists. He also serves as a commissioner of the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England (English Heritage). He has been patron of construction charity Construction Youth Trust for many years. With his background in architecture, the Duke of Gloucester takes interest in the work of the trust and visits their projects, in addition to giving his name to their long standing Duke of Gloucester Young Achiever&#x27;s Scheme Awards. The Duke is also patron of the Architects Benevolent Society. The Duke is also vice president of Lepra, a UK-based leprosy charity; as part of this role, he attends national and international events in support of the charity&#x27;s work. He is royal patron of the Society of Antiquaries of London (and elected FSA) since 2001, royal patron of the UK branch of the charity Habitat for Humanity, royal patron of the St George&#x27;s Society of New York, and president of The London Society. A keen motorist, Richard passed the Advanced Driving Test of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, of which he was president for more than 32 years. On his appointment in 1971, it was recorded that the new president was &quot;currently [driving] an Austin 1300&quot;, reflecting the modest image with which he has always been identified. He stood down as president in January 2005.

The Duke of Gloucester, accompanied by the Duchess, represented his cousin Elizabeth II at the Solomon Islands independence celebrations on 7 July 1978. He served as a judge in Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; on 15 June 1987.

On 10 April 2008, the Duke of Gloucester was officially installed as inaugural Chancellor of the University of Worcester during a ceremony at Worcester Cathedral. In this role, the Prince officiates at degree ceremonies and major events, as well as promoting the university overseas. The Duke carried out the first of these duties on 5 and 6 November 2008 at the Graduation Award Ceremonies. The Duke is also patron of the Severn Valley Railway and the Pestalozzi International Village Trust. He is patron of the British Homeopathic Association. He shares a name with an earlier Duke of Gloucester, Richard III, and has been patron of the Richard III Society since 1980. He is also a member of the international advisory board of the Royal United Services Institute. Since 1972, the Duke has been a corporate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He is also an honorary fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers.

During 2009, the Duke became patron of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre in support of its bid to raise funds through private means and through a bid for Heritage Lottery Funding. Other patronages include: British Society of Soil Science, the International Council on Monuments and Sites, Action on Smoking and Health, British Association of Friends of Museums, British Mexican Society, St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, as well as numerous other organisations and charities. In July 2011, the Duke visited the Isle of Man to meet with the representative of Manx National Heritage and the Council of Cancer Charities. On 8 November 2011, he opened the new Law School Building at the University of Hertfordshire on the de Havilland campus site of the former de Havilland Aircraft factory. On 19 March 2013, the Duke represented Elizabeth II at the Vatican for the inauguration of Pope Francis.

On 11 March 2015, the Duke visited the Royal School Dungannon in Dungannon, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of the school; presenting a commemorative plaque and raising an anniversary flag on the grounds. On 22 and 26 March 2015, the Duke represented the Queen at the ceremonies marking the reburial and commemorations of King Richard III in Leicester Cathedral. Richard III had held the title Duke of Gloucester before his ascension to the English throne. In March 2018, the Duke travelled to Malawi to attend the Commonwealth Day celebrations, and visited projects related to health services, wildlife, and climate change. He missed the celebrations in March 2022 after testing positive for COVID-19.

On 14 September 2022, after the death of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September, the Duke joined her children, grandsons, nephew, and son-in-law, in walking in the state cortege from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall, for her lying in state.
In 2023 the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester attended the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla in Westminster Abbey, and (in common with other working members of the Royal Family) took part in the Coronation Procession following the service.

<text>A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of &quot;patterns&quot;, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise. The term was coined by architect Christopher Alexander and popularized by his 1977 book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;.

A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. Aliveness is one placeholder term for &quot;the quality that has no name&quot;: a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable. Alexander claims that ordinary people can use this design approach to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.

==What is a pattern?==

When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the syntax), and use (the grammar) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in dictionaries. Each such entry is a single design pattern. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern&#x27;s contexts.

Elemental or universal &quot;patterns&quot; such as &quot;door&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.

Like all languages, a pattern language has vocabulary, syntax, and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
* The language description – the &quot;vocabulary&quot; – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called &quot;design patterns&quot;. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
* Each solution includes &quot;syntax&quot;, a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
* The solution includes &quot;grammar&quot; that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
* In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander&#x27;s book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;, the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
* The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside.

==Many patterns form a language==
Just as words must have grammatical and semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful, design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language. Christopher Alexander&#x27;s work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. Occasionally, the smaller problems have no solution, and a different larger solution must be selected. Eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders, and the &quot;design&quot; is done.

The actual organizational structure (hierarchical, iterative, etc.) is left to the discretion of the designer, depending on the problem. This explicitly lets a designer explore a design, starting from some small part. When this happens, it&#x27;s common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution. At this point, the design almost always becomes a better design.

In the language, therefore, each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole. This gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved.

The most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, empowered users, as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to empower users of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.

==Design problems in a context==
An important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system (that may be a house, a computer program or an object of daily use), and to assist in the design of future systems. The idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context, but still specific enough to give constructive guidance.

The range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context. An important part in each pattern is to describe this context. Examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation.

For instance, Alexander&#x27;s pattern &quot;A PLACE TO WAIT&quot; addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery, while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions. The &quot;Gang-of-Four&quot; book &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by Gamma et al. proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language, and the program&#x27;s application domain.

Still, the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side, and specificity on the other side. In the end this depends on the author&#x27;s preferences. However, even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are, by nature, absolutely concrete and specific.

Patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world. Alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero, one or two stars, indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples. It is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples. It is, however, conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern-like format.

The patterns in Alexander&#x27;s book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood, others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms. Alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world, so they can be connected to a hierarchic network.

===Balancing of forces===
A pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve, the context or situation where these problems arise, and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended.

Often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or &quot;forces&quot;. A pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision.

For instance, there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone. The forces would be the need to communicate, and the need to get other things done at the same time (cooking, inspecting the bookshelf). A very specific pattern would be just &quot;WIRELESS TELEPHONE&quot;. More general patterns would be &quot;WIRELESS DEVICE&quot; or &quot;SECONDARY ACTIVITY&quot;, suggesting that a secondary activity (such as talking on the phone, or inspecting the pockets of your jeans) should not interfere with other activities.

Though quite unspecific in its context, the forces in the &quot;SECONDARY ACTIVITY&quot; pattern are very similar to those in &quot;WIRELESS TELEPHONE&quot;. Thus, the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern.

===Patterns contain their own rationale===
Usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values. For Christopher Alexander, it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture. One of his key values is making these people feel more alive. He talks about the &quot;quality without a name&quot; (QWAN).

More generally, we could say that a good system should be accepted, welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it, or – even better – by all people it affects. For instance, when discussing a street café, Alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest, but also mentions people who just walk by.

The same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars, to social structures like a team working on a project, or to the user interface of a computer program. The qualities of a software system, for instance, could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system.

By focusing on the impacts on human life, we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology, and thus find &quot;timeless quality&quot; (Alexander).

==Generic structure and layout==
Usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains, breaking each into generic sections like context, problem statement, solution etc.

Christopher Alexander&#x27;s patterns, for instance, each consist of a short name, a rating (up to two &#x27;*&#x27; symbols), a sensitizing picture, the context description, the problem statement, a longer part of text with examples and explanations, a solution statement, a sketch and further references. This structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Alexandrian form&quot;.

Alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns. For instance, the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font, the latter is always preceded by the &quot;Therefore:&quot; keyword. Some authors instead use explicit labels, which creates some degree of redundancy.

===Meaningful names===
When design is done by a team, pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share. This makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive. Some examples from Alexander&#x27;s works are WINDOW PLACE (helps define where windows should go in a room) and A PLACE TO WAIT (helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms, for example).

==Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)==
A pattern language, as conceived by Alexander, contains links from one pattern to another, so when trying to apply one pattern in a project, a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context.

In Alexander&#x27;s book, such links are collected in the &quot;references&quot; part, and echoed in the linked pattern&#x27;s &quot;context&quot; part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph. A pattern that is linked to in the &quot;references&quot; usually addresses a problem of lower scale, that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem. For instance, the &quot;PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM&quot; pattern has a reference to &quot;STAIR SEATS&quot;.

Even without the pattern description, these links, along with meaningful names, carry a message: When building a place outside where people can spend time (&quot;PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM&quot;), consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit (&quot;STAIR SEATS&quot;). If you are planning an office (&quot;WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES&quot;), consider to arrange workspaces in small groups (&quot;SMALL WORKING GROUPS&quot;). Alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves.

The links in Alexander&#x27;s book clearly result in a hierarchic network. Alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern &quot;language&quot;.

The idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors, though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary. Some authors, however, like Gamma et al. in &quot;Design Patterns&quot;, make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns. In such a case we would speak of a &quot;pattern catalogue&quot; rather than a &quot;pattern language&quot;.

===Usage===
Alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own. In order to enable this, his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering; he also explains the general method of pattern languages. The original concept for the book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder, so that pages could easily be added later; this proved impractical in publishing. The pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields. Some examples are architectural patterns, computer science patterns, interaction design patterns, pedagogical patterns, pattern gardening, social action patterns, and group facilitation patterns. The pattern language approach has also been recommended as a way to promote civic intelligence by helping to coordinate actions for diverse people and communities who are working together on significant shared problems. Alexander&#x27;s specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential, and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields.

It is important to note that notations such as UML or the flowchart symbol collection are not pattern languages. They could more closely be compared to an alphabet: their symbols could be used to document a pattern language, but they are not a language by themselves. A recipe or other sequential set of steps to be followed, with only one correct path from start to finish, is also not a pattern language. However, the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language.

===Simple example of a pattern===
*&quot;Name&quot;: ChocolateChipRatio
*&quot;Context&quot;: You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
*&quot;Consider these patterns first&quot;: SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
*&quot;Problem&quot;: Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
*&quot;Solution&quot;: Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.
*&quot;Consider next&quot;: NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod

==Origin==
Christopher Alexander, an architect and author, coined the term pattern language. He used it to refer to common problems of the design and construction of buildings and towns and how they should be solved. The solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room.

The framework and philosophy of the &quot;pattern language&quot; approach was initially popularized in the book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; that was written by Christopher Alexander and five colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California in the late 1970s. While &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; contains 253 &quot;patterns&quot; from the first pattern, &quot;Independent Regions&quot; (the most general) to the last, &quot;Things from Your Life&quot;, Alexander&#x27;s book &quot;The Timeless Way of Building&quot; goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work. The following definitions of &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;pattern language&quot; are paraphrased from &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;:
&quot;A &quot;pattern&quot; is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context, describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.&quot;

A &quot;pattern language&quot; is a network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions.

== Application domains ==
Christopher Alexander&#x27;s idea has been adopted in other disciplines, often much more heavily than the original application of patterns to architecture as depicted in the book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot;. Examples since the 1990s include software design patterns in software engineering and, more generally, architectural patterns in computer science, as well as interaction design patterns. Since the late 1990s, pedagogical patterns have been used to document good practices in teaching. Since at least the mid-2000s, the idea of pattern language was introduced into systems architecture design and Design science (methodology) patterns in a book authored by Vijay Vaishnavi and William Kuechler with 66 patterns; the second revised and expanded edition of this book has been published in 2015 with 84 patterns. The book &quot;Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution&quot;, containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability, democracy and positive social change, was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns. The deck &quot;Group Works: A Pattern Language for Bringing Life to Meetings and Other Gatherings&quot; was published in 2011. The idea of a pattern language has also been applied in permaculture design. 

Ward Cunningham, the inventor of wiki, coauthored a paper with Michael Mehaffy arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages, and that wikis &quot;were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns&quot;.

<doc id="182839" wikidata="Q910257" url="?curid=182839" title="Filter paper">
<text>Filter paper is a semi-permeable paper barrier placed perpendicular to a liquid or air flow. It is used to separate fine solid particles from liquids or gases.

The raw materials are typically different paper pulps. The pulp may be made from softwood, hardwood, fiber crops, or mineral fibers.

==Properties==
Filter paper has various properties. The important parameters are wet strength, porosity, particle retention, volumetric flow rate, compatibility, efficiency and capacity.

There are two mechanisms of filtration with paper; volume, and surface. By volume filtration, the particles are caught in the bulk of the filter paper. By surface filtration, the particles are caught on the paper surface. Filter paper is mostly used because of the ability of a small piece of filter paper to absorb a significant volume of liquid.

==Manufacture==

The raw materials are different paper pulps. The pulp may be from softwood, hardwood, fiber crops, mineral fibers. For high quality filters, dissolving pulp and mercerised pulp are used. Most filter papers are made using small paper machines. For laboratory filters, the machines may be as small as 50 cm in width. The paper is often crêped to improve porosity. The filter papers may also be treated with reagents or impregnation to get the right properties.

==Types==
===Air filters===
The main application for air filters are combustion air to engines. The filter papers are transformed into filter cartridges, which then is fitted to a holder. The construction of the cartridges mostly requires that the paper is stiff enough to be self-supporting. A paper for air filters needs to be very porous and have a weight of 100–200 g/m2. Normally particularly long fibrous pulp that is mercerised is used to get these properties. The paper is normally impregnated to improve the resistance to moisture. Some heavy duty qualities are made to be rinsed and thereby extend the life of the filter.

===Coffee and tea===

Historically, blotting paper or cloth were used to extract filter coffee.

Modern coffee filters of paper are made from about 100 g/m2 crêped paper. The crêping allows the coffee to flow freely between the filter and the filtration funnel. The raw materials (pulp) for the filter paper are coarse long fiber, often from fast growing trees. For example, Melitta uses up to 60% of bambus in their filters since 1998. Both bleached and unbleached qualities are made. Coffee filters are made in different shapes and sizes to fit into different holders.
Most notable are the (paper) coffee filter systems introduced by Melitta (1908, 1932, 1936, 1965), Chemex (1941) and Hario (2004). 

Important parameters are strength, compatibility, efficiency and capacity.

Tea bags also work as a kind of paper filter. They are made from abacá fibers, a very thin and long fiber manilla hemp. Often the paper is augmented with a minor portion of synthetic fibers. The bag paper is very porous and thin and has high wet strength.

===Fuel filters===

The paper used for fuel filters is a crêped paper with controlled porosity, which is pleated and wound to cartridges. The raw material for filter paper used in fuel filters are made of a mixture of hardwood and softwood fibres. The basis weight of the paper is 50–80 g/m2.

===Horizontal plate filters===
Horizontal plate filter paper is commonly utilized in industrial processing. Filter paper typically is designed to fit the manufacturers specifications. Absolute micron retention can range from 1–100 microns but Diatomaceous earth is commonly used with filter paper to obtain sub-micron filtration. Activated carbon or other filter aids can be used with the filter paper to form a filter cake to achieve specific results. Filter paper can be impregnated with DE or activated carbon.

=== Oil filters ===

Engine oil is filtered to remove impurities. Filtration of oil is normally done with volume filtration. Filter papers for lubrication oils are impregnated to resist high temperatures.

==Laboratory-grade paper filters==

Filter papers are widely used in laboratory experiments across many different fields, from biology to chemistry. The type of filter used will differ according to the purpose of the procedure and the chemicals involved. Generally, filter papers are used with laboratory techniques such as gravity or vacuum filtration.

Historically, a type of soft, porous paper called &quot;charta emporetica&quot; was used in pharmacy as a filter and as packing paper.

=== Qualitative filter paper ===
Qualitative filter paper is used in qualitative analytical techniques to determine materials. There are different grades of qualitative filter paper according to different pore size. There are total 13 different grades of qualitative filter paper. The largest pore size is grade 4; the smallest pore size is grade 602 h; the most commonly used grades are grade 1 to grade 4.

Grade 1 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 11 μm. This grade of filter paper is widely used for many different fields in agricultural analysis, air pollution monitoring and other similar experiments.

Grade 2 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 8 μm. This grade of filter paper requires more filtration time than Grade 1 filter paper. This filter paper is used for monitoring specific contaminants in the atmosphere and soil testing.

Grade 3 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 6 μm. This grade of filter paper is very suitable for carrying samples after filtration.

Grade 4 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 20~25 μm. This grade of filter paper has the largest pore size among all standard qualitative filter papers. It is very useful as rapid filter for cleanup of geological fluids or organic extracts during experiment.

Grade 602 h qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 2 μm. This grade of filter paper has the smallest pore size among all standard qualitative filter papers. It is used for collecting or removing fine particles.

=== Quantitative filter paper ===
Quantitative filter paper, also called ash-free filter paper, is used for quantitative and gravimetric analysis. During the manufacturing, producers use acid to make the paper ash-less and achieve high purity.
=== Chromatography papers ===
Chromatography is a method chemists use to separate compounds. This type of filter paper has specific water flow rate and absorption speed to maximize the result of paper chromatography. The absorption speed of this type of filter paper is from 6 cm to 18 cm and the thickness is from 0.17 mm from 0.93 mm.

=== Extraction thimbles ===
Extraction thimbles are rod-shape filter paper often used in soxhlet extractors or atomized extractors. It is ideal for very sensitive detection, the performance depends on the thickness of inner diameter. Also, it is usually used in areas of food control and environmental monitoring.

=== Glass fiber filters ===
Glass fiber filter has the pore size of 1 μm, it is useful for filtering highly contaminated solutions or difficult-to-filter solution. Also, glass fiber filter has extends filter life, wide range of particulate loads and can prevent sample contamination. In addition, different types of glass fiber filter are suitable for different filtration situation. There are 7 different types of glass fiber filters and the major difference is thickness.

=== Quartz fiber filter ===
Quartz fiber filter paper has a high resistance to chemicals, does not absorb NOx and SOx dioxides, is unaffected by humidity and is easily sterilized. Thus, it is mostly used for air pollution analysis.

=== PTFE filter ===
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter has wide operating temperature (−120 °C ~ 260 °C) with high air permeability. The resistance to high temperature makes PTFE filter paper suitable for use in autoclaves. It is often used to filter hot oils, strong solvents and collecting airborne particulates.

<doc id="182842" wikidata="Q5372452" url="?curid=182842" title="Nernst heat theorem">
<text>The Nernst heat theorem was formulated by Walther Nernst early in the twentieth century and was used in the development of the third law of thermodynamics.

== The theorem ==
The Nernst heat theorem says that as absolute zero is approached, the entropy change Δ&quot;S&quot; for a chemical or physical transformation approaches 0. This can be expressed mathematically as follows:

:formula_1

&lt;br&gt;The above equation is a modern statement of the theorem. Nernst often used a form that avoided the concept of entropy.

Another way of looking at the theorem is to start with the definition of the Gibbs free energy (&quot;G&quot;), formula_2, where &quot;H&quot; stands for enthalpy. For a change from reactants to products at constant temperature and pressure the equation becomes formula_3.

In the limit of &quot;T&quot; = 0 the equation reduces to just Δ&quot;G&quot; = Δ&quot;H&quot;, as illustrated in the figure shown here, which is supported by experimental data. However, it is known from thermodynamics that the slope of the Δ&quot;G&quot; curve is −Δ&quot;S&quot;. Since the slope shown here reaches the horizontal limit of 0 as &quot;T&quot; → 0 then the implication is that Δ&quot;S&quot; → 0, which is the Nernst heat theorem.

The significance of the Nernst heat theorem is that it was later used by Max Planck to give the third law of thermodynamics, which is that the entropy of all pure, perfectly crystalline homogeneous materials in complete internal equilibrium is 0 at absolute zero.

<doc id="182845" wikidata="Q203968" url="?curid=182845" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1963">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1963 was the eighth edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest and took place in London, United Kingdom. It was organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), who agreed to stage the event after , who had won the edition, declined to host it due to financial shortcomings, also having hosted the competition in and . The contest was held at the BBC Television Centre on Saturday 23 March 1963 and was hosted by Katie Boyle for a second time.

Sixteen countries participated in the contest, the same countries that had also participated the previous two years.

The contest this year was won by with the song &quot;&quot;, performed by Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann. This was the first victory for any of the Nordic countries. Four countries got nul points, with , and failing to score any points for the first time and the for the second time, becoming the first country to go two years in a row without scoring a single point.

== Location ==

The BBC was willing to host the contest instead of the previous year&#x27;s winner France, as was the case in . They would do so again in , and because the winning broadcasters from the year before could not afford to produce the contest. The host venue was the BBC Television Centre, White City, London, which opened in 1960. It is one of the most readily recognisable facilities of its type having appeared as the backdrop for many BBC programmes. It remained one of the largest broadcasting facilities in the world until the property was redeveloped in March 2013.

== Participating countries ==

All countries which participated in the edition also participated in the 1963 edition.

Only one of the performing artists had previously competed representing the same country in past editions: Ronnie Carroll had represented the .

== Production and format ==
The production mode was unusual in comparison with other Eurovision Song Contests: In contrast to most previous and following editions which were filmed in concert halls or theatres, the staging of 1963 was done in television studios. Two studios (TC3 and TC4) were used: one for the mistress of ceremonies Katie Boyle, the audience, and the scoreboard (TC3); the other for the performers and the orchestra accompanying them (TC4). Unusually, a boom microphone (normally used for drama and comedy shows) was employedthe viewer could not see this, so it appeared as if the artists were miming to their vocals. This was not the case, but this innovation was to create a new look for the contest. The use of television studios allowed a broader variety of staging elements not seen before in the contest, and the use of close-ups so to create an atmosphere of intimacy for television viewers.

After the was the only one to be held on a Sunday, the contest was held on a Saturday again in 1963.

== Contest overview ==

=== Spokespersons ===

Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1963 contest are listed below.
* 

== Detailed voting results ==

Each participating broadcaster assembled a 20-member jury panel who awarded their five favourite songs 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 points in order. All those points would then be added up and the five songs with the most points got 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 votes in order. Errors in the Norwegian (see below) and the Monegasque votes meant their scores had to be announced twice, with an adjustment to the scores being made in each case before the final score was verified.

One controversy this year was during the voting. When it was &#x27;s turn to announce their votes, the spokesman in Oslo did not use the correct procedure in that the song number, followed by the name of the country, should have been announced before awarding the points. Boyle asked Norway to repeat their results, but the Norwegian spokesman asked Boyle to return to them after all the other results were in. When Boyle went back to Norway again the votes had been altered, thus changing the outcome of the contest and giving the victory to at &#x27;s expense. In fact, the Norwegian spokesman had not given the correct votes on the first occasion, because votes from the 20 jury members were still being tallied. The Swiss participating broadcaster, SRG SSR, reportedly intended to appeal and following numerous complaints, checked the transmissions of the votes made. It was confirmed a month after the contest that the Norwegian jury didn&#x27;t change their votes.

Monaco was also asked to repeat their voting a second time as initially Monaco gave one point to both the United Kingdom and Luxembourg. However, when Boyle went back to Monaco to receive the votes again Monaco&#x27;s one vote to Luxembourg was efficiently discarded (although this did not have any effect on the positions of the countries).

=== 5 points ===
Below is a summary of all 5 points received:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Reports estimate that 50 million people would see the contest.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="182855" wikidata="Q133" url="?curid=182855" title="Mixed-member proportional representation">
<text>Mixed-member proportional representation (MMP or MMPR) is a type of representation provided by some mixed electoral systems which combine local winner-take-all elections with a compensatory tier with party lists, in a way that produces proportional representation overall. Like proportional representation, MMP is not a single system, but a principle and goal of several similar systems. Some systems designed to achieve proportionality are still called mixed-member proportional, even if they generally fall short of full proportionality. In this case, they provide semi-proportional representation.

In typical MMP systems, voters get two votes: one to decide the representative for their single-seat constituency, and one for a political party, but some countries use single vote variants. Seats in the legislature are filled first by the successful constituency candidates, and second, by party candidates based on the percentage of nationwide or region-wide votes that each party received. The constituency representatives are usually elected using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP). The nationwide or regional party representatives are, in most jurisdictions, drawn from published party lists, similar to party-list proportional representation. To gain a nationwide representative, parties may be required to achieve a minimum number of constituency seats, a minimum percentage of the nationwide party vote, or both.

MMP differs from mixed-member majoritarian representation (often achieved by parallel voting) in that the nationwide seats are allocated to political parties in a compensatory manner in order to achieve proportional election results across all seats (not just the additional seats). Under MMP, two parties that each receive 25% of the votes end up with about 25% of the seats, even if one party wins more constituency seats than the other. Depending on the exact system implemented in a country and the results of a particular election, the proportionality of an election may vary. Overhang seats may reduce the proportionality of the system, although this can be compensated for by allocating additional party list seats to cover any proportionality gap.

The specific system of New Zealand for electing its parliament is called MMP, while in other countries similar systems are known under other names.

== Other names ==
The seat linkage compensatory mixed system often referred to as MMP originates in Germany. (It was later adopted with modifications under the name of MMP in New Zealand.) In Germany, it was differentiated from a different compensatory mixed system by always being known as &quot;personalized proportional representation (PPR)&quot; (). 

Since the variants used in Germany almost always produce very proportional results, the proportionality is emphasized over the mixed nature of the electoral system, and it is essentially considered a localized or personalized form of PR, used instead of conventional open-list systems. Germany&#x27;s new modified federal election system does not allow overhang seats at all (such seats are re-allocated to other parties), therefore not all local districts are guaranteed to elect the plurality winner. In German, this localized list system now shares the name of PPR with the mixed systems still used in the federal states of Germany that are referred to as MMP in English. In English, due to this change, the system is no longer considered to be MMP in the sense of a mixed member system combining proportional and district-level first-past-the-post voting, but it is seen as a personalized/localized version of PR. As it retains the individual candidate vote in a clearly distinct fashion from open-list systems, it may still be considered mixed-member proportional in the sense of a proportional system having two kinds of elected members: some (may be) elected by personal (candidate) votes, some elected by (closed list) party votes. 

Previously, the federal elections used a flexible number of additional compensatory seats, also known as leveling seats, which essentially guaranteed mixed-member proportional representation even with extremely disproportional constituency results, but dramatically increased the size of the Bundestag. This meant that it was potentially the most proportional MMP system used after the one in New Zealand, where only top ups are seats given to other parties to compensate for a party taking overhang seats, which resulted in minor flexibility of the parliament size.

In the Canadian province of Quebec, where an MMP model was studied in 2007, it is called the &quot;compensatory mixed-member&quot; voting system ( or SMAC). In the United Kingdom the sometimes less proportional implementation of MMP used in Scotland and the London Assembly is referred to as the additional member system. In South Africa, MMP is generally referred to as a &quot;mixed-system&quot;. The Scandinavian countries have a long history of using both multi-member districts (members elected through party-list PR) and nationally-based compensatory top-up seats using the same method as MMP, however because the local MPs are also elected using PR, these systems are not usually considered MMP as they are not mixed systems. 

Some mixed electoral systems are so different that there is no consensus on their classification as mixed-member proportional (MMP), mixed majoritarian or something between the two. These cases include partially or conditionally compensatory systems such as those of Hungary, Mexico and South Korea, which are typically said to be supermixed systems or partially compensatory systems, but sometimes inaccurately referred to as MMP even though they are highly disproportional.

== Procedures ==

In MMP, the voter casts two votes: one for a constituency representative and one for a party. In the original variant used in Germany, citizens gave only one vote, so that voting for a representative automatically meant also voting for the representative&#x27;s party, which is still used in some MMP elections today and is more robust against tactical voting than typical two-vote versions. Most of Germany changed to the two-vote variant to make local members of parliament (MPs) more personally accountable. Voters can thus vote for the local person they prefer for local MP without regard for party affiliation, since the partisan make-up of the legislature is determined only by the party vote. In the 2017 New Zealand election, 27.33% of voters split their vote (voted for a local candidate of a different party than their party vote) compared to 31.64% in 2014.

In each constituency, the representative is by default chosen using a single winner method (though this is not strictly necessary), typically first-past-the-post: that is, the candidate with the most votes (plurality) wins.

Most systems used closed party lists to elect the non-constituency MPs (also called list MPs). In most jurisdictions, candidates may stand for both a constituency and on a party list (referred to in New Zealand as &quot;dual candidacy&quot;). In Wales between 2006 and 2014 dual candidacy was banned, i.e. candidates were restricted to contend either for a constituency or for a party list, but not both. If a candidate is on the party list, but wins a constituency seat, they do not receive two seats; they are instead crossed off the party list and the party seat goes to the next candidate down.

In Bavaria, the second vote is not simply for the party but for one of the candidates on the party&#x27;s regional list: Bavaria uses seven regions for this purpose. A regional open-list method was recommended for the United Kingdom by the Jenkins Commission (where it is known as AMS) and for Canada by the Law Commission of Canada; neither recommendation was ever implemented.

In contrast, the open-list method of MMP was chosen in November 2016 by voters in the 2016 Prince Edward Island electoral reform referendum.

In Baden-Württemberg, there were no closed lists prior to 2022; they used the &quot;best near-winner&quot; method in a four-region model, where the regional members are the local candidates of the under-represented party in that region who received the most votes in their local constituency without being elected in it (Zweitmandat, literally &quot;second mandate&quot;).

=== Apportionment methods===
At the regional or national level (i.e. above the constituency level) several different calculation methods have been used, but the basic characteristic of the MMP is that the total number of seats in the assembly, including the single-member seats and not only the party-list ones, are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes the party received in the party portion of the ballot. This can be done by different apportionment methods: such as the D&#x27;Hondt method or the Sainte-Laguë method. Subtracted from each party&#x27;s allocation is the number of constituency seats that party won, so that the additional seats are compensatory (top-up).

===Dealing with overhang seats===

If a party wins more FPTP district seats than the proportional quota received by the party-list vote, these surplus seats are called overhang seats ( in German), which may be an obstacle to achieving proportionality.

When a party wins more constituency seats than it would be entitled to from its proportion of (party list) votes, most systems allow for these overhang seats to be kept by those candidates who earned it in the constituency elections. 

A counter-example is the &quot;Bundestag&quot; in Germany, where constituency winners may not always keep their seats in accordance with the latest modification of Germany&#x27;s electoral law. 

In the MMP variant used in Romania in the 2008 and 2012 legislative elections, constituency seats were only earned by the leading candidate if the candidate also achieved an absolute majority of votes in their district, thereby preventing overhang seats.

In New Zealand House of Representatives, all members elected for constituencies keep their seats. For example, in the 2008 New Zealand general election the Māori Party won 2.4% of the party vote, which entitled it to 3 seats in the House but won 5 constituency seats, leaving an overhang of 2 seats. This was compensated for giving two additional seats to other parties, which resulted in a 122-member house. If the constituency seats won had been in proportion to the party vote for the Māori Party, there would have been a normal 120-member house.

To combat disproportionalities caused by overhang seats in most German states, leveling seats (&quot;Ausgleichsmandate&quot; in German) are added to compensate for overhang seats and thereby achieve proportionality. Usually 50 percent of total seats are compensatory seats, but that proportion varies. For example, in the provincial parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;) of North Rhine Westphalia, 29% of the seats are levelling seats, which compensate for difference between district results based on local votes and the party&#x27;s share of the party vote. More may be added to balance overhangs. If a party wins more local seats than its proportion of the total party vote justifies, the size of the &quot;Landtag&quot; increases so that the total outcome is proportional to the party votes, with other parties receiving additional list seats to achieve proportionality. The leveling seats are added to the normal number of seats for the duration of the electoral period. In the German state of Bavaria, the constituency votes and party votes are combined to determine the proportional allocation of seats.

Scotland uses a modified variant of MMP known as the additional member system where due to the nature of the calculations used to distribute the regional list seats, overhang seats are not possible; the list allocation works like a mixed-member majoritarian system, but in using the d&#x27;Hondt method&#x27;s divisors to find the averages for the allocation, the first divisor for each party takes into account the number of constituency seats won by the party. Wales is similar.) 

For example, a party that won 7 constituency seats would start with a divisor of 8 (7 seats + 1 per the method&#x27;s divisor formula) instead of 1. The resulting table would then give 7 seats for Scotland (and 4 seats for Wales) to the parties possessing the highest averages on the table, (Neither devolved parliament uses a table, instead using a sequential method.) MMP&#x27;s compensatory effect is in the fact that a party that won constituency seats would have lower averages on the table than it would if the election used mixed-member majoritarian. Because there is no provision for overhang seats, there have been cases in Scotland where a party ended up with more seats and others with fewer total seats than their proportional entitlement. This occurred, for example, in the South East Wales electoral region in 2007 and 2016. In 2007 Welsh Conservatives were under-represented while Independents got one more seat than they were due. In 2016 in that same electoral region, Welsh Labour was over-represented, while Plaid Cymru was under-represented. 

Welsh Labour has also been over-represented on this basis in every election in the South Wales West region, and every election in the South Wales Central region, apart from the 2003 election. This situation arose because Labour held an overwhelming majority of constituency seats in these regions, more than its due share proportionally. Only around one-third of the total number of seats are top-up, in the form of additional regional seats, so that is insufficient to fully compensate for Welsh Labor&#x27;s over-representation
===Threshold===

As in numerous proportional systems, in many MMP systems, in order to be eligible for list seats, a party must earn at least a certain percentage of the party vote, or no candidates will be elected from the party list. Candidates having won a constituency will still have won their seat. In New Zealand the threshold is 5% and in Bolivia 3%. 

in Germany the threshold is 5% for elections for federal parliament and most state parliaments. And under recent changes to Germany&#x27;s election law, the constituency seat may be taken away from the party. 

A party that does not achieve the threshold can also be eligible for list seats if it wins at least three constituency seats in Germany, or at least one in New Zealand. Having a member with a &#x27;safe&#x27; constituency seat is therefore a tremendous asset to a minor party in New Zealand.

In elections for the Scottish Parliament, no threshold is set. The district magnitude of each electoral region is small enough to impose an inherent threshold in the seat distribution calculations. In 2021, with regional DM of 16, the effective threshold was about 7 percent of the region&#x27;s votes, or about 17,000 to 20,000 votes of the total 2.7 million valid votes cast, but each region is discrete from the other regions so if a party is spread across multiple regions, it may not win even one seat even if it has more than 40,000 votes in total. Such happened to the Alba Party in 2021.

=== By-elections and replacement of list representatives ===
==List of countries==
=== Countries with MMP ===
The following countries currently have MMP representation. Countries which nominally use or have used MMP, but in practice had highly disproportional representation or it as otherwise not implemented are discussed in the next section.
=== Other countries ===
MMP replaced (modified):

* Germany: Referred to as &quot;personalized proportional representation&quot; (see electoral system of Germany). Came about in 1949 as a result of inter-party bargaining. Originally used single vote version, switched to two vote version before the 1953 election. Levelling seats were established for the 2013 federal election after a ruling of Federal Constitutional Court, with a minor modification for the 2021 federal election to reduce the size of the Bundestag. The system was recently modified to an essentially (non-mixed) closed list proportional system with a local constituency vote to eliminate the need for overhang seats. In the new system, the number of seats a party can win is capped, if they &quot;won&quot; more seats by plurality, not all of their winners will be elected.
* Wales - Senedd (Welsh Parliament): Wales has used AMS since 1999 with 40 constituency seats, and 20 list seats in 5 regions, however, starting in 2026, the additional member system will be replaced by a closed-list proportional representation system following the approval of the Senedd Reform Bill, which will also increase the total number of seats from 60, to 96.

There are several other countries which attempted to introduce MMP by seat linkage compensation, but either not enough leveling seats were provided to achieve it, or the compensation mechanism was manipulated by decoy lists.

* Albania (formerly): A two-vote seat linkage compensation electoral system for the Parliament (Kuvendi) was used from 2001 to 2005 (after having used parallel voting in the 1996 and 1997 elections), but it was manipulated with decoy lists.
* Tigray State Council in Ethiopia: a General Election was supposed to be held in Ethiopia on 29 August 2020, but they were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the government of Tigray dismissed the postponement and decided to create its own electoral commission and hold a regional election. On August 6, 2020, the State Council of Tigray decided to amend its constitution and change the electoral system to MMP, this will affect the upcoming regional elections. The amendment increases the number of seats in the council from 152 to 190 (+38), 80% of the seats will be filled with first-past-the-post voting and the rest 20% by proportional voting. This Tigray National Regional States law is annulled by House of Federation which is empowered to interpret the constitution for violation of the provisions of the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
* Republic of Korea (South Korea): From 2019 elections for the National Assembly used a two-vote hybrid system with 253 single-member constituency seats, 17 supplementary seats (a la parallel voting) and 30 compensatory seats (seat linkage). Major parties used decoy lists to neutralize compensation. Though all list seats are compensatory since 2024, but widespread use of decoy lists is expected continue and mixed-member proportional representation is not to be achieved.
* Romania (formerly): Single vote system used in 2008 and 2012 where local candidates who did not win at least 50% of votes in their districts did not get a direct mandate, but these seats were added to the list seats allocated proportionally. Failed to achieve mixed-member proportional representation in 2012. From the 2016 elections, closed party-list proportional representation was used instead.
* Thailand (formerly): A single vote seat linkage system referred to as &quot;mixed-member apportionment&quot; was used in 2019. It used a mixed single vote for both the constituency and the party list. The 350 constituency seats are won by first-past-the-post voting as in previous elections. However, the 150 party-list seats served a compensatory function, and are allocated so as to give each party a total number of seats proportional to the nationwide number of votes they received (top-up). Overhang seats were not compensated for. The next elections were again held under parallel voting due to a change in the constitution.
* Venezuela (formerly): The two vote seat linkage compensatory system introduced was designed to provide MMP, but the system was manipulated with decoy lists. The seat linkage between list and constituency representatives was removed in 2009, which changed the system to parallel voting.
Countries with systems which have been confused with mixed-member proportional representation:

* Hungary: Hungary was using a mixed system since the 1990s, that due to its partially compensatory nature has been sometimes inaccurately referred to as an MMP system, but it was a mixed majoritarian system, mostly independent combination of two-round voting and party-list PR. Changes after 2010 have made the system more clearly mixed-member majoritarian.
* Mexico: Mexico has a clearly mixed-member majoritarian system which is mostly parallel voting, however, there is a cap on how many seats any single party may get and a cap on the maximum difference of seat shares to the list vote share result. This makes it partially (conditionally) compensatory, but not MMP.

==== Local ====

* South Africa: Local elections in all municipalities designated as metropolitan, district/county council (DC) or local/borough council (LC)

===Proposals for use===
====Canada====
In March 2004, the Law Commission of Canada proposed a system of MMP, with only 33% of MPs elected from regional open lists, for the House of Commons of Canada but Parliament&#x27;s consideration of the Report in 2004–05 was stopped after the 2006 election. The New Democratic Party has been a longtime supporter of MMP. The Green Party of Canada has generally been a staunch supporter of a move to a proportional electoral system. In June 2016, the Canadian House of Commons Special Committee on Electoral Reform was formed to examine potential changes to the voting system with MMP being one of the options examined. The committee presented its report to Parliament on 1 December of the same year. In early 2017, the Government announced that it would accept only some of the committee&#x27;s recommendations, and would not pursue the issue of electoral reform any further.

* Prince Edward Island: A proposal to adopt MMP with closed province-wide lists for elections to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island was defeated in a referendum in 2005, and in a subsequent referendum in 2019. In a non-binding plebiscite between 27 October and 7 November 2016, Prince Edward Islanders voted for MMP over FPTP in the final round of counting, 52%–43%; however, the provincial government, despite having set no voter turnout threshold, subsequently claimed that the 36 percent turnout was insufficient to change the electoral system. A second referendum, held simultaneously with the provincial election, saw MMP rejected by a margin of 48% in favor to 52% against, with 76% turnout.
* Ontario: In 2007, the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform in Ontario, Canada, also recommended the use of MMP in future elections to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, with a ballot similar to New Zealand&#x27;s, and with the closed province-wide lists used in New Zealand but with only 30% compensatory members. A binding referendum on the proposal, held in conjunction with the provincial election on 10 October 2007, saw it defeated.
* British Columbia: During October–December 2018, British Columbia held a referendum on proportional representation, promised as part of the election platform of the British Columbia New Democratic Party who took office following the May 2017 provincial election. In the referendum citizens were presented with two questions. The first question asked them to choose whether they would like to keep first-past-the-post voting or change to proportional representation. The second question asked them to rank three types of proportional voting systems in order of preference; one of those was MMP. Citizens could still rank the voting systems even if they selected first-past-the-post voting in the first question. According to official results, voters chose FPTP over PR by 61.3% to 38.7% on the first question. While the first question was not successful for PR, the second question resulted in MMP winning over the two other systems on the ballot. If PR had been successful on the first question, MMP would have been adopted in time for the next provincial election and would have been subject to a second referendum after two election cycles.
* Quebec: In September 2019, Quebec&#x27;s government, supported by two of the three opposition parties (PQ and Quebec Solidaire), introduced a referendum on MMP to be held in 2022. However, on April 28, 2021, Justice Minister Sonia LeBel informed a legislative committee hearing that the government would not move forward with a referendum on electoral reform in 2022. LeBel blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for altering the government&#x27;s timeline and could not or would not commit to providing an alternate date for the referendum, effectively ending discussions about electoral reform in Quebec.

==== Other countries ====
* Costa Rica: Costa Rica was debating the switch from the current closed party list proportional representation system to a mixed member proportional representation based on the German model. The bill presented by the Citizen Power Now movement and endorsed by the majority of parliamentary groups would create two types of deputies; 42 elected proportionally by lists presented by the political parties and would be called &quot;national&quot; deputies, while another 42 deputies would be elected directly by population-based electoral districts on a First past the post basis. As the bill requires a constitutional reform it would require a two-thirds majority of votes, however as of 2019 the caucuses of the four main parties supported the reform.
* Hungary: In 2017, the Common Country Movement (KOM) proposed introducing seat linkage to achieve MMP in the National Assembly, but the bill brought to parliament by five opposition parties was dismissed by the governing coalition.

* Sri Lanka: In September 2015, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced that they will change the country&#x27;s system to MMP.

* South Africa: The Van Zyl Slabbert Commission on Electoral Reform (published in January 2003) recommended that a multi-member system, which has been adopted for municipal elections, be expanded to elections for the National Assembly. It proposed that 300 of 400 members be elected from closed-constituency lists (from 69 national multi-member constituencies) and 100 members from closed, national-level party lists. Parliament&#x27;s High Level Panel report of 2017, chaired by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, validated the Van Zyl Slabbert mixed-system and recommended its adoption, stating: &quot;Such a system will serve to limit the power of individual party leaders and encourage MPs to vote in accordance with the needs and desires of their constituencies rather than only following party lines&quot;. Although a constitutional amendment is not required, and a simple majority in parliament can amend the Electoral Act (No. 73 of 1998) it seems unlikely that such an amendment will come before parliament before the 2019 General Elections. A former MP, Michael Louis, who wishes to stand as an independent, is actively pursuing a judicial route to force an amendment. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has stated that it is not opposed to an amendment but there is simply not enough time to implement it in time for the 2019 elections. After the Constitutional Court of South Africa declared the Electoral Act unconstitutional in 2020 because there was no way for independent candidates to be elected and in 2021, Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi told Parliament that a new electoral system must be put in place, calls for MMP intensified and a Motsoaledi-appointed, Valli Moosa-led ministerial advisory committee was formed to determine the new system.

==== European Union (European Parliament) ====
The pan-European party VOLT Europa proposes transnational mixed-member proportional representation with the combination of Majority Judgment and party-list PR.

==Tactical manipulation==

=== Split ticket voting ===
In other cases, a party may be so certain of winning a large number of constituency seats that it expects no extra seats in the proportional top-up (list seats). Some voters may therefore seek to achieve double representation by voting tactically for another party in the regional vote, as a vote for their preferred party in the regional vote would be wasted. This tactic is much less effective in MMP models with a relatively large share of list seats (50% in most German states, and 40% in the New Zealand House of Representatives) and/or ones which add &quot;balancing seats&quot;, leading to fewer opportunities for overhangs and maintaining full proportionality, even when a party wins too many constituency seats.

==== Solutions ====
The problem of ticket splitting strategies can be solved either by eliminating at least one of the two mechanisms that create the opportunity for abuse: 

# Either the double vote can be abolished, returning to a mixed single vote (the original version of MMP used in Germany), in which case voters cannot split their ticket, even if it is a sincere preference. 
# Another solution is to eliminate the seat linkage mechanism and use a vote linkage one instead, in which case most likely more compensatory seats would be needed. A negative vote transfer based system (scorporo) retains the flaw that decoy lists can be used to abuse it, but if the two votes were tied in a mixed ballot transferable vote, the potential this kind of strategic manipulation would be eliminated. However, in this a case party proportionality is not likely and overall equality of votes would depend largely on the specifics of the system (the amount of compensation).
===Splitting parties===

This sort of strategy for a coalition of parties to capture a larger share of list seats may be adopted formally as a strategy. By way of example, in Albania&#x27;s 2005 parliamentary election, the two main parties did not expect to win any list seats, so they encouraged voters to use their list votes for allied minor parties. This tactic distorted the working of the model to the point that the parties that won list seats were almost always different from the parties that won constituency seats. Only one constituency member was elected from parties that won list seats. The election was condemned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe which said it failed to comply with international standards because of &quot;serious irregularities&quot;, intimidation, vote-buying and &quot;violence committed by extremists on both sides.&quot; Rather than increasing the number of list seats or &quot;overhang&quot; seats, Albania subsequently decided to change to a pure-list system.

In an abusive gambit similar to that used in Albania, major parties feeling that they are unlikely to win a large number of list seats because of their advantage at the constituency level might choose to split their party in two, with one subdivision of the party contesting the constituency seats, while the other contests the list seats—assuming this is allowed by electoral law. The two linked parties could then co-ordinate their campaign and work together within the legislature, while remaining legally separate entities. The result of this approach, if it is used by all parties, would be to transform MMP into a &quot;de facto&quot; parallel voting mechanism.

An example could be seen in the 2007 Lesotho general election. In this case the two leading parties, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and the All Basotho Convention (ABC) used decoy lists, respectively named the National Independent Party and the Lesotho Workers&#x27; Party to avoid the compensatory mechanisms of MMP. As a result, the LCD and its decoy were able to take 69.1% of the seats with only 51.8% of the vote. ABC leader Tom Thabane called the vote &quot;free, but not fair.&quot; In the 2012 election, the voting system was adjusted to link the local and list seats to limit the decoy lists&#x27; effectiveness, resulting in an almost perfectly proportionate election result for the competing parties.

Another interesting case is that of Venezuela, which also ended up changing its system, in this case by formally adopting a parallel voting system and legitimizing party efforts to game the MMP approach. Venezuela introduced an MMP electoral system in 1993, but the tactic of creating a decoy party was introduced only in 2000, by the opposition governor of Yaracuy. The tactic was later adopted by pro-Chavez parties at the national level in 2005. After the decoy list tactic withstood a constitutional challenge, Venezuela eventually formally reverted to a parallel voting system, which yields a lesser degree of proportionality compared to MMP. On September 26, 2010, Chavez&#x27; party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, took 57.4% of parliamentary seats with only 48.2% of the vote under the new system (ignoring the role of small allied parties). One can see to what extent parallel voting had nonetheless helped to redress the balance toward proportionality somewhat by noting that Chavez&#x27; party would have taken an even larger share of assembly seats under a strict single-winner approach (71 constituency seats out of 109, or 65%).

Another example is that of the 2001 Italian general election, in which one of the two main coalitions (the House of Freedoms), which opposed the scorporo system (a system compensatory system similar to MMP), linked many of their constituency candidates to a decoy list () in the proportional parts, under the name . As a defensive move, the other coalition, Olive Tree, felt obliged to do the same, under the name . This meant that the constituency seats won by each coalition would not reduce the number of list seats available to them. In the case the House of Freedoms list faction Forza Italia, the tactic was so successful that it did not have enough candidates in the proportional part to receive as many seats as it in fact won, missing out on 12 seats. Italy subsequently changed its system.

Ahead of the 2020 South Korean legislative election, the electoral system was changed from parallel voting to a hybrid mixed-member proportional system, with 30 seats allocated in a compensatory manner. The opposition Liberty Korea Party subsequently set up a decoy list, the Future Korea Party, to win extra proportional seats. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea condemned them for exploiting the electoral law, but nonetheless set up its own decoy list, the Platform Party, in response. The decoy lists were successful on election day, with Future Korea winning 12 compensatory seats and Platform winning 11. After the election, both decoy lists merged into their mother parties. The tactic was used again in the 2024 legislative election.

=== Electoral thresholds ===
In systems with a threshold, people who prefer a larger party may tactically vote for a minor party that is predicted to poll close to or slightly below the threshold. Some voters may be afraid the minor party will poll below the threshold, and that that would weaken the larger political camp to which the minor party belongs. For example, the German moderate-right Free Democratic Party (FDP) has often received votes from voters who preferred the larger Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, because they feared that if the FDP received less than 5% of the votes, the CDU would have no parliamentary allies and would be unable to form a government on its own. This tactical voting also ensures that fewer votes are wasted, but at the cost of giving the FDP more seats than CDU voters would ideally have preferred. This tactic is the same in any method of proportional representation with a threshold.

Similarly, in New Zealand, some voters who preferred a large party have voted for the minor party&#x27;s local candidate to ensure it qualifies for list seats on the back of winning a single electorate. This notably occurred in the right-wing inner Auckland electorate of Epsom in 2008 and 2011, where the National Party voters gave their local vote to the ACT Party. In this case the tactic maintained some proportionality by bypassing the 5% threshold, but is largely disfavoured by the public due to it awarding smaller parties extra list seats while parties with a higher party vote percentage that do not win an electorate receive no seats; this occurred in 2008 when ACT was awarded 5 seats on the back of one electorate seat and 3.7% of the party vote, while New Zealand First with no electorate seats and 4.1% of the party vote were awarded none. In 2011, some Epsom voters voting for the left-wing Labour and Green parties tried to block the tactic by giving their local vote to the National candidate; while it was unsuccessful, it did reduce ACT&#x27;s majority over National from 12,900 to 2,300. In August 2012, the initial report on a review of the MMP system by the Electoral Commission recommended abolishing the one electorate seat threshold, meaning a party winning an electorate seat but not crossing the 5% threshold (which the same report recommends lowering to 4%) is only awarded that electorate seat.

<text>Sticks and Stones is the third studio album by American rock band New Found Glory.

==Background==
New Found Glory released their self-titled second album in September 2000 as a joint release between MCA and Drive-Thru Records. MCA had a distribution deal that allowed them to acquire Drive-Thru Records&#x27; bands over a period of time. Lead single &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; received heavy airplay rotation from the US&#x27;s biggest rock radio stations. By April 2001, the band had been moved to MCA. Shortly after this, guitarist Chad Gilbert moved to Los Angeles, California, while the rest of the band moved to San Diego, close to their manager and their label. Appearing on the Warped Tour and featuring in the film &quot;American Pie 2&quot; (2001) helped increase the band&#x27;s profile.

Blink-182 bassist Mark Hoppus was highly impressed by New Found Glory&#x27;s self-titled album, going as far as to champion them in an issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. They eventually supported Blink-182 on their summer tour. Blink-182&#x27;s manager Rick DeVoe met New Found Glory, and soon afterwards, began managing them. By September 2001, the group were making plans to release a new album by mid-2002. At the end of the year, bassist Ian Grushka got married. He was unable to go on a honeymoon due to their record label paying for a bus to transport the band from Florida to California two days later. The group set up residence in apartments in La Jolla, a community within San Diego, California, for the next three months.

==Production==
In February 2002, the band began recording with Neal Avron, who acted as producer. Sessions took place at DML and Signature Sound Studios in San Diego, California, Larrabee West Studios in West Hollywood, California, and NRG Studios in North Hollywood, California. He was assisted by engineers Sam Bukas, Mike Harris, Juan Jose Ayala, Ted Regier and Mark Kiczula. For the group&#x27;s self-titled, Avron wanted a laidback approach for the drums. For &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;, he had more confidence in letting drummer Cyrus Bolooki played what he wanted. Bolooki tracked his parts with the tom on his left side. He started playing with this set up while on tour with Fenix TX, whose drummer had a tom and China cymbal on his left side. Bolooki liked the setup, but thought he wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it as he was right-handed. After setting up his kit in that manner, he found it easier for certain parts.

Several members of contemporary bands contributed to the recordings: Rusty Pistachio and Toby Morse of H2O (backing vocals on &quot;Understatement&quot;), Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 (bass on &quot;Something I Call Personality&quot;), Bane and What Feeds the Fire (backing vocals on &quot;Something I Call Personality&quot; and &quot;Belated&quot;), and Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano of Alkaline Trio (backing vocals on &quot;Forget My Name&quot;). In addition, Chris Georggin of the group&#x27;s management team Rick DeVoe Management added backing vocals on &quot;Something I Call Personality&quot;. Hoppus was initially brought in to add vocals, but after Grushka was unable to do bass for &quot;Something I Call Personality&quot;, Hoppus did it instead. Jay Baumgardner mixed the recordings, before they were mastered by Tom Baker at Precision Mastering in Hollywood.

==Composition==
Gilbert would typically write rough ideas and then jam them out with the rest of the band. After a while, guitarist Steve Klein would take the instrumental and begin adding lyrics to it. Klein and vocalist Jordan Pundik would work on the melody, before sharing it with the rest of the group. Bolooki, who initially started out as a guitarist, contributed a few ideas that Gilbert or Klein would build a whole song around. According to Klein, they attempted to move away from lyrical nature of their self-titled, on which, every song was about girls. He added that since becoming a full-time touring act, it was difficult for them to maintain relationships, which had an influence on the lyrics. Musically, it retains the pop punk sound found on the self-titled, drawing comparison to Green Day. It incorporated new elements to the group&#x27;s sound, such as hardcore punk-influenced breakdowns. Avron said the group experimented with different tempos, specifically naming &quot;Sonny&quot; and &quot;Head on Collision&quot;.

Discussing the album&#x27;s title, Gilbert said &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; &quot;fit[ted] perfectly with the sound of the record and what a lot of the lyrics are about&quot;. The group wanted a track that would match the popularity of &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;; they came up with &quot;My Friends Over You&quot;. It was the last song written for the album, and evolved from a sole riff to a full song within a day or two. It talks about a guy going out with a girl, who hates his friends. She wanted to take their relationship the next step, but due to past experiences, the guy picks his friends over her. &quot;Sonny&quot; sees Pundik discuss the death of his grandad. &quot;Head on Collision&quot; is about someone you continually get into arguments with, and feeling that you&#x27;re at a loss as a result. &quot;Singled Out&quot; opens with an electro intro, and features Gilbert screaming in the manner that he did while he fronted hardcore band Shai Hulud. The opening two snare hits that begin &quot;The Story So Far&quot; were done by Grushka. Similarly, the four bass notes that follow were done by Bolooki.

==Release==
On March 13, 2002, &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; was announced for release in June. In March and April, the group went on a tour of Australia. On April 12, the album&#x27;s artwork was revealed. It features a boy and a girl fighting. Klein explained that when the band was younger, their relationships with girls were &quot;a lot easier. You could hit each other and it would be fun. And I think as you get older everything gets a little more serious. When you have an argument with a girl it can actually break your heart or ruin your life.&quot; Following this, the band performed at Skate and Surf Fest. &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; was released on June 11 through MCA and Drive-Thru Records. The UK edition, which was released a week later, includes the bonus tracks &quot;Anniversary&quot;, &quot;Forget Everything&quot; an acoustic version of &quot;The Story So Far&quot;. Between late June and mid-August, the group went on the Warped Tour. On July 9, the band appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

On July 16, a music video was filmed for &quot;Head on Collison&quot; on the Universal Studios backlot. The video, directed by the Malloys, features the band on a 1930s movie set. While the video progresses, the group realize they are on the wrong film set, before taking the stage and beginning to perform. On August 27, &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; was released as a single. While the track was doing well at radio, the president of the group&#x27;s label stopped funding the track, and decided to reinvest the money in Shaggy. In September, the band performed at the Inland Invasion festival, and appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. In October and November, the band went on tour across the US alongside Something Corporate, Finch and Further Seems Forever. On November 12, the band performed on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;.

On November 26, &quot;Head on Collision&quot; was released as a single. On the same day, &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; was reissued with an extra CD consisting of the group&#x27;s contemporaries. In December, the band performed at KROQ-FM&#x27;s Almost Acoustic Christmas festival. In January 2003, the group went on a tour of Japan with Good Charlotte and The Starting Line. On April 7, a music video for &quot;Understatement&quot; was posted online. Between April and June, they co-headlined the Honda Civic Tour with Good Charlotte. First half the tour was supported by Less Than Jake, with MxPx supporting the second half. In August, the band played the Summer Sonic Festival in Japan, before supporting Sum 41 on their headlining Australian tour. To coincide with the Australian shows, the album was reissued in that territory with a bonus disc. It included radio performances of &quot;Head on Collision&quot; and &quot;Something I Call Personality&quot;, and music videos for &quot;Head on Collision&quot; and &quot;Understatement&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; charted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, after selling 91,000 copies in its first week. On July 30, 2020, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over one million units in the United States.

The group celebrated the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary by playing it in its entirety on two separate US tours, one in 2012 and the other in 2013. They played it in its entirety again on a tour in 2017 to celebrate the 20th anniversary since they formed. Cassie Whitt of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; said &quot;Understatement&quot;, &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; and &quot;Head on Collision&quot; had become &quot;staples across a couple generations of pop-punk fans—and bands, too.&quot; All Time Low and The Story So Far took their name from songs on the album, &quot;Head on Collision&quot; and &quot;The Story So Far&quot; respectively. In 2016, Gilbert ranked &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; as his fourth favorite New Found Glory album. Cleveland.com ranked &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; at number 12 on their list of the top 100 pop-punk songs. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;My Friends Over You&quot; at number 32 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>Marlee Matlin (born August 24, 1965) is an American actress, activist, and author. Deaf since she was 18 months old, Matlin is known for her portrayals of disabled women, and for her activism towards disabled individuals in Hollywood and other industries. She is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, in addition to nominations for a British Academy Film Award and four Emmy Awards. In 2009, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Matlin made her acting debut playing Sarah Norman in the romantic drama film &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986), winning the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama; she is the first deaf performer to win an Academy Award, the youngest winner in the Best Actress category, and one of four women to win the award for their screen debut. For playing a district attorney in the police drama series &quot;Reasonable Doubts&quot; (1991–1993), she was twice nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. She received a nomination for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her guest role in the comedy series &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1993), and received three more nominations for &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1993), &quot;The Practice&quot; (2000), and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2004–2005) in the drama category. 

Matlin has primarily worked in television, as she has found more roles for deaf actors. She played Joey Lucas on the political drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot; (2000–2006), appeared in the drama series &quot;The L Word&quot; (2007–2009) and &quot;Switched at Birth&quot; (2011–2017), and voiced Stella in the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot; (2012–2021). She made her Broadway debut in the 2015 revival of &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. For her role in the coming-of-age film &quot;CODA&quot; (2021), she won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. 

Outside of acting, Matlin is a prominent member of the National Association of the Deaf, and her interpreter is Jack Jason. She has published four works and won recognitions for her advocacy. A documentary about her life and work, &quot;Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore&quot;, was released in 2025.

==Early life ==
Matlin was born in Morton Grove, Illinois, on August 24, 1965, to Libby (née Hammer; 1930–2020) and Donald Matlin (1930–2013), who was an automobile dealer. Matlin lost all hearing in her right ear and 80% of the hearing in her left ear at the age of 18 months due to illness and fevers. In her autobiography &quot;I&#x27;ll Scream Later&quot;, she suggests that her hearing loss may have been due to a genetically malformed cochlea. She is the only member of her family who is deaf. She has a sense of humor about her deafness: &quot;Often I&#x27;m talking to people through my speakerphone, and after 10 minutes or so they say, &#x27;Wait a minute, Marlee, how can you hear me?&#x27; They forget I have an interpreter there who is signing to me as they talk. So I say, &#x27;You know what? I can hear on Wednesdays.

Matlin and her two older brothers, Eric and Marc, grew up in a Reform Jewish household. Her family roots are in Poland and Russia. Matlin attended a synagogue for the Deaf (Congregation Bene Shalom), and after studying Hebrew phonetically, was able to learn her Torah portion for her Bat Mitzvah. She was later interviewed for the book &quot;Mazel Tov: Celebrities&#x27; Bar and Bat Mitzvah Memories&quot;. She graduated from John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights and attended Harper College in Palatine, Illinois. She had planned a career in criminal justice. In her autobiography, Matlin described two instances in which she was molested: by a babysitter at age 11, and by a teacher in high school.

==Career==

=== 1980s: Debut and film stardom ===

Matlin made her stage debut at the age of seven, as Dorothy in an International Center on Deafness and the Arts (ICODA) children&#x27;s theatre production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, and continued to appear with the ICODA children&#x27;s theatre group throughout her childhood. At the age of thirteen, she won second prize in the Chicago Center&#x27;s Annual International Creative Arts Festival for an essay titled, &quot;If I Was not a Movie Star.&quot;

She was discovered by Henry Winkler during one of her ICODA theater performances, which ultimately led to her film debut in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986). The film received generally positive reviews and Matlin&#x27;s performance as Sarah Norman, a reluctant-to-speak deaf woman who falls for a hearing man, drew high praise: Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;[Matlin] has an unusual talent for concentrating her emotions -- and an audience&#x27;s -- in her signing. But there is something more here, an ironic intelligence, a fierce but not distancing wit, that the movies, with their famous ability to photograph thought, discover in very few performances.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was also impressed with Matlin, writing, &quot;She holds her own against the powerhouse she&#x27;s acting with, carrying scenes with a passion and almost painful fear of being rejected and hurt, which is really what her rebellion is about,&quot; and Paul Attasanio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;The most obvious challenge of the role is to communicate without speaking, but Matlin rises to it in the same way the stars of the silent era did -- she acts with her eyes, her gestures.&quot; &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; brought her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and an Academy Award for Best Actress. Only 21 years old at the time, Matlin remains the youngest actress to receive the Oscar in the Best Actress category. She was the only Deaf nominee and recipient in any category for 36 years until 2022, when deaf actor and filmmaker Troy Kotsur won for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;CODA&quot;, in which Matlin also played a supporting role.

Two years later, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with Billy Joel performing a revised version of &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; with lyrics by Tony Geiss. Matlin used sign language during the song and hugged Oscar the Grouch during the song&#x27;s conclusion. One year after that, Billy Joel invited her to perform in his video for &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;. In 1989, Matlin portrayed a deaf widow in the television movie &quot;Bridge to Silence&quot;. In that role, she spoke in addition to using sign language. &quot;People&quot; magazine did not like the film, but praised Matlin&#x27;s work, writing, &quot;the beautiful, emotionally moving Matlin is too good for this well-intentioned but sentimental slop.&quot; Matlin attended the 1988 Oscars to present the Academy Award for Best Actor. After signing her introduction in ASL, she spoke aloud the names of the nominees and of Michael Douglas, the winner.

She starred in the role of ex-FBI agent Jocelyn Turner. In 2019, Matlin was mentioned in an article by &quot;Hearing Like Me&quot; as somebody that could bring more #DeafTalent to &quot;Life and Deaf,&quot; a new comedy show set in the 1970s that aims to explore the life of a kid with deaf parents. This show was to be executive produced by Marlee Matlin according to &quot;Deadline&quot;.

She has been a strong advocate for the rights of deaf people, accepting television roles only if producers commit to caption the films, remaining openminded and respectful of both signed and spoken communication preferences, and promoting telephone equipment specifically designed for deaf persons. She has testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources in support of the establishment of the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders. Matlin has also been active in the fight against AIDS, the &quot;Victory Awards&quot; for the National Rehabilitation Hospital, and other causes. She is also a lifetime member of Hadassah Women&#x27;s Zionist Organization of America. Matlin has been a frequent guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World.
Matlin received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degree from Gallaudet University in 1987. In 1988, Matlin received the Samuel S. Beard Award for Greatest Public Service by an Individual 35 Years or Under, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards. In 1991, Matlin received the Bernard Bragg Young Artists Achievement Award at the Annual International Creative Arts Festival sponsored by the Center on Deafness in Chicago. Matlin was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation for National and Community Service and served as chair of National Volunteer Week. Matlin was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured &quot;film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community&quot; and included Greg Grunberg, Joshua Malina, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.

In October 2007, she was appointed to the Gallaudet University Board of Trustees. On July 26, 2010, Matlin signed a speech at an event commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. In the following year, Matlin was a finalist on the NBC show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice,&quot; competing to win money for her charity, The Starkey Hearing Foundation, finishing in second place. However, on one episode of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot;, which was transmitted on April 3, 2011, she raised more funds than had ever been raised for charity in a single event on any television show before, $986,000. Donald Trump, who was then hosting &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice,&quot; donated an additional $14,000 to make the contribution an even million.

, Matlin acts as the ACLU&#x27;s celebrity ambassador for disability rights. As a &quot;celebrity ambassador&quot; for the ACLU, in attempts to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the deaf community, Matlin discussed the communication barriers when deaf individuals are stopped by the police. In recognition of her philanthropic work and her advocacy for the inclusion of people with disabilities, Matlin received the 2016 Morton E. Ruderman Award in Inclusion, a $120,000 prize given annually by Jay Ruderman of the Ruderman Family Foundation to one individual whose work excels at promoting disability inclusion. She won the Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards for disability advocacy in 2014. 

== Personal life ==
Matlin married Burbank police officer Kevin Grandalski on August 29, 1993, at the home of actor Henry Winkler. The couple first met while she was filming a scene from &quot;Reasonable Doubts&quot; outside the studio grounds; the police department had assigned Grandalski to provide security and control traffic. They have four children: Sarah (born 1996), Brandon (born 2000), Tyler (born 2002), and Isabelle (born 2003).

In 2002, Matlin published her first novel, titled &quot;Deaf Child Crossing,&quot; which was loosely based on her own childhood. She later wrote and published a sequel titled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, produced on stage at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in partnership with VSA Arts in October 2007.

On April 14, 2009, Matlin&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;ll Scream Later&quot;, was published. In it, she describes her drug abuse and how it drove her to check herself into the Betty Ford Center. She also tells about her rocky, two-year relationship with her significantly older &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; co-star William Hurt, who she says physically abused and raped her. She also addresses the sexual abuse she suffered as a child at the hands of her female babysitter.

== Works and accolades ==

Following her breakout role in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;, Matlin has made occasional film appearances (mostly due to lack of substantial roles for deaf actors), but has focused most of her work in television. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot;. She was the only deaf performer to have won an Academy Award until 2022 when Troy Kotsur received the award for best supporting actor. Matlin received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009.

<text>John Constantine (), also known as Hellblazer, is an antihero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. He was created by Alan Moore, Steve Bissette, and John Totleben, and first appeared in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #37 (June 1985). Initially a supporting character who played a pivotal role in the &quot;American Gothic&quot; &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; storyline, Constantine became popular with readers. As a result, he received his own comic in 1988 titled &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, which became the longest-running and most successful title of DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint. In the DC Universe, Constantine, the titular Hellblazer, is portrayed as a working-class warlock, occult detective, exorcist, and con man from Liverpool who is stationed in London. Known for his cynicism, deadpan wit, ruthless cunning, and constant chain smoking, he is also a passionate humanitarian with a deep desire to make a positive impact. 

The character has received a mix of acclaim and criticism over the years. He won the Eagle Award for &#x27;Favourite Supporting Character&#x27; twice in 1986 and 1987, and has been listed among the greatest comic book characters. He was praised for his charm and resilience despite his flawed nature. However, he has faced criticism for his portrayal in certain contexts, including controversial depictions of his bisexuality and relationships.

The character made his live-action debut in the film &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), played by Keanu Reeves. On television, Constantine was played in the television series &quot;Constantine&quot; by Matt Ryan, who later reprised the character in the Arrowverse series &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;The Flash&quot;, and several animated productions. Jenna Coleman later portrayed a female version of the character (and her ancestor) in the television series &quot;The Sandman&quot;, adapting both Constantines&#x27; roles from the comic series.

==Publication history==
John Constantine first appeared in 1985 as a recurring character in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, in which he acted as a &quot;supernatural advisor&quot; to the main character.
In these early appearances, Constantine was depicted as a sorcerer of questionable morality, whose appearance was based on that of the musician Sting (specifically, as Sting appeared in the films &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;). Alan Moore created the character after artists Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben, who were fans of The Police, expressed a desire to draw a character who looked like Sting. They had already drawn at least one character in Sting&#x27;s likeness, a briefly glimpsed background figure wearing a black-and-red-striped T-shirt in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #25. In his earliest Swamp Thing appearances, the character is drawn with a marked resemblance to Sting, and in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #51, Constantine appears on a boat with the name &quot;The Honourable Gordon Sumner&quot; on the bow.

John Constantine&#x27;s official debut was not until &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #37, when he was drawn by Rick Veitch and Totleben. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #4, his second official appearance in a cameo role, shipped two weeks after the release of &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #37. In that issue, written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by George Pérez, Constantine is wearing a green suit as opposed to his more traditional black suit and tan trenchcoat ensemble. Moore describes Constantine as being drawn from a number of &quot;really good ideas ... about serial killers, the Winchester House, and ... want[ing] to draw Sting in a story&quot;. Calling these disparate strands a &quot;big intellectual puzzle&quot;, Constantine was the result of &quot;fit[ting] it all together&quot;. Initially created &quot;purely to get Sting into the story&quot;, by the time of the 1985 San Diego ComicCon, Moore stated, &quot;It&#x27;s turning into something more than that now.&quot; Veitch&#x27;s contribution was to give Constantine an earring, something he considered risque for 1985.

Asked in 1985 about the similarities between John Constantine and the character Baron Winters (from Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan&#x27;s &quot;Night Force&quot;), Moore revealed that he was a &quot;big fan&quot; of Wolfman and &quot;Night Force&quot;, but that &quot;no intention to rip off Baron Winters&quot; existed. He said:
Constantine and Winters met each other during Moore&#x27;s run on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and again in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;.

Speaking to comics magazine &quot;Wizard&quot; in 1993, Moore elaborated:
In 1988, Constantine was given his own title, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. In 1993, at the launch of DC&#x27;s Vertigo Comics imprint, &quot;Hellblazer&quot; was made an official Vertigo publication. It was the longest continuously published Vertigo title. Before the launch of the Vertigo line, Constantine appeared in several DC Universe titles, but for many years afterwards, editorial policy forbade him from appearing outside the Vertigo line. The policy was reversed in 2011, when a version of Constantine appeared in the DC Universe crossover series &quot;Brightest Day&quot;. In 2011, Peter Milligan added him to the inaugural key roster of The New 52 series &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. Milligan began writing &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; while also writing the Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Hellblazer&quot; series, being a writer of both series at the same time. In an interview, Milligan told Newsarama:
Beginning in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; #9, Jeff Lemire assumed writing duties on the series, replacing Milligan, who had remained on the Vertigo title. Lemire said he considers &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; his dream gig at DC Comics because Constantine is one of his all-time favourite characters not just in comics, but in all fiction. Lemire also teased that while Constantine, Zatanna, and Deadman would remain on the roster, the team would change in his opening arc and expand.

==Fictional character biography==
===Youth===
In John Constantine&#x27;s early appearances in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, his past was a mystery; his life as a child and young adult was not developed until Jamie Delano&#x27;s &quot;Hellblazer&quot; stories. He was born in Liverpool on 10 May 1953, the son of Mary Anne and Thomas Constantine. Mary Anne died giving birth to him and his stillborn twin brother because an earlier abortion, forced on her by Thomas, had weakened her womb. Since he was unable to accept responsibility for his wife&#x27;s death, Thomas blamed John and the pair grew up with a deep dislike for each other. While in the womb, John strangled his twin brother with his own umbilical cord; in a parallel universe, the twin survives to become the well-loved and well-adjusted magician John never was.

In their childhood, John and his older sister Cheryl lived briefly with their aunt and uncle in Northampton to escape from their father&#x27;s alcoholism and subsequent imprisonment for stealing a female neighbour&#x27;s underwear. They moved back to Liverpool when their father was released. John&#x27;s bloodline and ancestry were known as the Laughing Magicians, legendary mages who have the power over synchronicity and were infamous for bluffing and tricking gods. This ancestry later drives John to partake in his lineage and practice magic. One of John&#x27;s first acts of magic, as a child, was to hide all of his childhood innocence and vulnerability in a box to rid himself of it. Later, in the 1960s, a teenaged John ran away from home after a botched curse caused his father to become withered and frail. John eventually made his permanent home in London in 1969, rooming with Chas Chandler, who would later become his closest and longest-surviving friend.

During the 1970s, John became involved in occult circles in London. He travelled to other countries and visited San Francisco, where he began dating Zatanna Zatara, a female magician he had previously met in New York City. He also became a fan of punk rock; after seeing the Sex Pistols at the Roxy Club in London in 1977, he cut his long hair short, called himself Johnny Con-Job, and formed a band called Mucous Membrane. Its members included Chandler (as a roadie), a drummer named Beano, and fellow Liverpool native Gary Lester. They released an album called &quot;Venus of the Hardsell&quot;. John also performed as a stage magician in the 1980s, where he became famous for predicting the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan.

John&#x27;s first venture into occult &quot;heroism&quot; was a disaster. On tour with Mucous Membrane at the Casanova Club in Newcastle upon Tyne, he found the aftermath of a magical orgy gone horribly wrong; an abused child named Astra Logue had conjured a hideous monster that took revenge on her father, the club&#x27;s debauched owner, and the other adults who were tormenting her, but the monster refused to leave. With typical recklessness, John convinced some members of the band and several occultist friends to try destroying the creature by summoning a demon of their own. Unfortunately, this demon was not under their control and tormented John&#x27;s friends after it had destroyed the other demon before taking Astra to Hell. John had summoned the demon by one of its names, but not its true name of Nergal, which would have been required to bind and control the demon. Nergal went on to be a regular antagonist throughout the series. John suffered a nervous breakdown after this incident, and was committed to Ravenscar Psychiatric Hospital, which he drifted in and out of over the years.

The guilt of Astra hung over John for many years. In his mid-40s, he used some magic and trickery to free not only her but also the souls of all the other children trapped in Hell. As for the rest of the &quot;Newcastle Crew&quot;, the incident left the group both physically and psychologically scarred. After helping Dream retrieve his sands from John&#x27;s own dying ex-girlfriend Rachel, Dream in turn relieves Constantine of the nightmares that had plagued him since the incident.

===Occult &quot;hero&quot;===
John is later freed from Ravenscar by London gangsters, threatening to torture and kill his sister and her family unless he helps to resurrect a mob boss&#x27;s dead son. Knowing that resurrection is impossible even by magical means, John instead summons a demon to take the boy&#x27;s place; a desperate act that has bloody consequences many years later. Years later, John was able to reconvene the surviving members of the &quot;Newcastle Crew&quot; to help with his investigation of the Brujería cult, as seen in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #37–49. The cult murdered most of them, including John&#x27;s then-lover, Emma. These people, and others who have died due to John&#x27;s carelessness, have continued to appear to him as silent, reproachful ghosts. Chas is the most prominent one of very few human friends to have survived a long-term association with John.

John first met Swamp Thing in 1985 after being interested in the creature. John later acts as the Swamp Thing&#x27;s protector, guide, and voice of omen, even teaching the Thing to amplify his powers. Both would have further adventure with each other, such as John introducing the Thing to the Parliament of Trees, Thing using John&#x27;s body to make love to his wife and father a child named Tefe, and fighting off the Damnation Army from summoning the Anti-Christ. Both carry a dull, but nevertheless fruitful friendship with each other. Constantine even invites Swamp Thing to his 40th birthday and assures the Thing he will try not to bother him again. In 1991 while in his late 30s, John contracted terminal lung cancer. During this time, he sought the help of a dying friend, Brendan, who had sold his soul to the First of the Fallen, the most powerful lord of Hell. When the First came to collect the soul, John tricked him into drinking holy water, which rendered him helpless and prevented him from collecting the friend&#x27;s soul at the appointed time.

For this, the First promised to make John suffer unprecedented torment in Hell when he dies. Slowly dying from cancer, John hatched a plan to save himself from eternal torment. He secretly sold his soul to the other two Lords of Hell. When they discovered Constantine&#x27;s actions, they realized that they could not allow him to die, or else they would be forced to go to all-out war over his soul, a war whose only winner would be &quot;the Lord of the Hosts&quot;, i.e., God and his angels. They were also far too stubborn and proud, however, to enter anything resembling an alliance. As a result, they were forced to cure John of his cancer. This led to the First plotting a grand revenge on Constantine, who manipulated the demon via his ally Ellie, a succubus, into coming into a trap; the plan only barely succeeded, and while the First was temporarily defeated, many of John&#x27;s friends were killed.

Constantine then went on to have a series of adventures and misadventures playing the role of puppet and puppeteer with his signature style and profane sarcasm. He managed to free Astra and every other child in Hell, but at the cost of the First returning to power; also, as part of the scheme, John&#x27;s worst attributes were given separate existence as &quot;Demon Constantine&quot;, which meant he himself could not go to Hell. As part of an attempt to regain his nastier edge, he used Ellie, and this led to her taking out a revenge scheme in 1998 that forced him to turn to the First for help; Ellie ended up in Hell, and several of John&#x27;s oldest friends left him. John, being tired of all this, contacted God. God appears and the two converse in a campfire. John then tells him his reason for contacting Him. He warns God that if his soul is ever sent to Hell, he would easily take over, and do nasty things such as unleashing the demons and locking away Hell so that the damned cannot enter and have no resting place. John blackmails God to do his bidding, and that is to keep his soul away from Hell. God, knowing of John&#x27;s abilities, does so, but warns him of what will come next.

===The 21st century===
On return to Britain in 2003, and after reconciling with his sister (who believed he was dead), he went on to be involved in a magic war in London, and was horrified to find his niece Gemma, whom he had wanted to keep out of this life, had become a witch. He soon ended up organising a counterstrike against a creature known as the Shadow Dog, having been warned of its coming and believing it was an entity that brought death and madness; instead, it was a guardian against the true enemy, the Beast, who was manipulating John into giving it free access to humanity. In the process, he was rendered an amnesiac, leaving him vulnerable to the schemes of the demon Rosacarnis. To get his memories back, he had to spend a day in her service, in which she had him father three demonic children, who went on to massacre anyone who knew Constantine, from friends to enemies to people who had only briefly met him. Among them was his sister Cheryl; one of his sons had exploited her husband&#x27;s religious fanaticism to make him see his wife as a witch — and thus a person to be killed. This forced Constantine to go on journey to Hell in the hopes to return his sister&#x27;s soul. Accompanying him was Nergal, the demon he thought he had killed by sending him to the border of Heaven.

While in Hell, John and Nergal met Demon Constantine, who tried to kill the original one. John was forced to let Nergal enter his body to finish him. Later, they also encountered Ellie, who seemed to have quite pardoned John for him selling her out to the First. She was not subject to any torture or punishment, either. The couple finally arrived at Rosacarnis&#x27; hall, where there was a feast with all three of Constantine&#x27;s children, the First, and many demons from all Hell. Because of Nergal&#x27;s earlier possession of his body, any damage done to John would be mirrored on Nergal. Nergal, however, calls the bluff, showing that the effect goes both ways by clawing at his chest slightly. John begs Rosacarnis to kill him to save his sister, but just as she is about to, the First of the Fallen intervenes and immediately kills Rosacarnis, since Constantine&#x27;s soul is his by &quot;right of insult&quot; and will only be taken when he deems fit. The First also kills Rosacarnis&#x27; two sons, but spares the daughter, who had been dealing with issues of identity and had doubts about whether she wanted to continue to exist.

Following this, the First commands Nergal to release the soul he is holding. Cheryl&#x27;s soul is pure and innocent, and does not belong in Hell, but the First offers her a truly devilish deal. He informs her that her husband, Constantine&#x27;s brother-in-law Tony, has killed himself with her blood still staining his hands, thus making him twice damned, and offers to fairly divide her husband&#x27;s punishment between the two of them if she stays of her own free will. Constantine attempts in vain to argue that Tony murdered her and does not deserve that mercy. Despite all that has happened, Cheryl still loves her husband enough to accept the First&#x27;s deal and decides to stay. Constantine can do nothing, as the First gloats over his victory and then sends him back home. Unable to look at his niece Gemma&#x27;s tear-filled eyes because of his failure, Constantine runs barefoot down the stairs and into the Liverpool night.

===Lost brother===
John later revisits Ravenscar Asylum, the place where he was thrown after being framed for Astra&#x27;s murder. John remembers all the maltreatment he suffered, and remembers every suffering and guilt he had for the past years. At first, it appears as though it is too much for him and that he will be overtaken by the images of the ones he has hurt, but the being turns into the form of a baby. This baby, who is the sum of all his guilt and self-hatred, is then promptly thrown off a cliff near the asylum and into the sea. After killing the creature, Constantine is now free, and becomes even a bit more cocky and picks back up his earlier style from the beginning of his book and his appearances from Swamp Thing: a double-breasted blue suit underneath his trench coat, and slicked-back, gelled hair.

Later on, a Sudanese shaman who had first bound the hunger demon Mnemoth has been having dreams of Constantine and a war-mage named Mako, who is coming to kill him and devour his being. Constantine is a specific target of the war-mage because he is the &quot;Laughing Magician&quot;, who is also known as the &quot;Constant One&quot;. Mako wants to devour him so he can absorb that power and have his being made a fixture of the universe. To counter this attack to come, the African magus puts a dream of his into a tree root, with Constantine&#x27;s true nature in those dreams. After doing this, a young man is sent as a messenger to find John and deliver the message. Constantine later notices that something is wrong on the synchronicity lines, and, seemingly, he is going head first against the traffic. Remembering that Mako mentioned Ravenscar when he found out about Constantine, he tries to summon his unborn brother, but instead is summoned to his brother. The soul of Constantine&#x27;s brother tells John that he was not to be born and that it should have been he who had been born, instead, as he is the Laughing Magician; he requests that John and he merge their souls so they become one and can fix the world. They had previously attempted this, but John was apparently too strong-willed. John then makes the link that the soul of his unborn brother caused him to get cancer and for his relationships to fail, and that anytime he tried to take control of his life, something bad would happen to make John weaker, so their souls might be able to merge. After realizing this, John cuts the soul of his brother out of his own soul, so he can control his life and live his way.

===Later life===
In the 2010s, John entangles himself in further adventures. He goes to India and fights a ghost of a British soldier of the Sepoy rebellion, fights a Babylonian shape shifter named Julian, gets his thumb cut off to contact Shade, the Changing Man, marrying a young girl named Epiphany Greaves, who was also the daughter of an infamous gangster, looking for his lost trench coat that his niece sold, finding his sister&#x27;s long-lost son named Finn, and finally getting his sister&#x27;s soul from Hell.

By 2013, John was contacted by the Three Fates, who tell him that he will finally die in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, John happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the fifth day comes, John Constantine is murdered in his own home, when he is ambushed and killed by a gangster. His funeral is attended by many of his friends and family, but it later turns out that he had faked his death yet again. Constantine decides he should keep a low profile, because he does not want to hurt the people around him again. He bids farewell to Finn and Epiphany, and finally visits Gemma. In the meanwhile, Gemma, hearing about her uncle&#x27;s return from the Fates, tries to kill herself with a poisonous revolver, but Constantine sneaks the last remaining dart from his niece. Gemma says her life will be better without him, because he takes up too much of it and she is either hating him or loving him too much. John suggests he let her be, but Gemma fears he will return and put her life to misery. John tells Gemma to make her own decision, and she reluctantly points the revolver at him. Gemma closes her eyes before muttering, &quot;Damn you, John Constantine&quot; and pulls the trigger, but when she opens her eyes again, Constantine has vanished. The last scene shows Constantine in the Long Journey&#x27;s End bar, holding a glass of liquor with a vacant look.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Constantine appears as one of the lead characters in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;. His history is slightly altered, such as meeting Zatanna in New York instead of San Francisco, and the origins of how he got his trademark trenchcoat. During the gap where he travels the world to learn magic, the &quot;New 52&quot; added the history of him meeting Nick Necro, who was implied to be John&#x27;s mentor and original owner of the trenchcoat. The &quot;Forever Evil: Blight&quot; storyline would establish that the three characters were all involved in a magical pact and a love triangle, which fell apart due to Zatanna ending her relationship with Nick to pursue John. Nick states &quot;We were all in love, and you two shut me out!&quot; The character also stars in the ongoing series &quot;Constantine&quot;, which replaces &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. He is still an unsavory trickster in the &quot;New 52&quot; universe, as, while during the Trinity War between the three Justice Leagues, he tries to trick Shazam (15-year-old Billy Batson) so that he can steal his magic. He fails, causing Billy to become even more distrustful of other people than he already was.

In &quot;Constantine&quot; #14, it was revealed that John Constantine, as a boy, was taught and cast his first magical spell—at the cost of the lives of his parents and his house burning down (it was implied that his mother, unlike in &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, survived the childbirth). It was also revealed that he spent his childhood in the &#x27;80s in Liverpool, England (it is not shown if he had any siblings, like Cheryl Constantine in &quot;Hellblazer&quot;). The one who taught John his first spell was Tannarak from the Cult of the Cold Flame (&quot;Constantine&quot; #15).

His primary enemies in &quot;Constantine&quot; are Mister E, Sargon the Sorceress (the original Sargon&#x27;s daughter), and Tannarak: all are members of the Cult of the Cold Flame. Together with his allies Papa Midnite, the psychic mage Spellbinder, and a witch called Julia Everheart, Constantine attempts to destroy the Cult by conspiring a scam to take Sargon and Tannarak by surprise. However, prior to the planned battle, Constantine is thrown into the battlefield in Dar es Salaam in World War I because of a ritual going wrong, making his plan fail. An encounter with Doctor Occult there results in Constantine being transported to Earth-2 - a world dying under siege from Darkseid and his Parademons.

In Earth-2, he is assaulted by the Parademons, but Wotan comes and rescues him, before trapping him to open a gateway to escape the dying Earth. Constantine manages to convince Wotan to spare his life, then works with the ancient sorcerer to open a door through his body to Earth-0. As Wotan enters the doorway, he is split into two halves, because there are two John Constantines in this world: the original Constantine and the native one of Earth-2, who is surrounded by his friends and even gets married. After the death of Wotan, Constantine resolves to find his Earth-2 counterpart. He travels to Liverpool and witnesses all the horror and despair of the dying world. As soon as John reached the destination, he is shocked to find his &quot;parents&quot; (actually the Earth-2 John&#x27;s parents), his friends Gary Lester, Chas Chandler and his former love interest Maureen still alive.

The Earth-2 John quickly attacks him by grabbing him in the neck, but they are engulfed in visions of their lives in parallel right after: a dangerous life marred with sorcery, adventures and regrets of Earth-0 John and a much quieter, much happier life of Earth-2 John. Constantine quickly earns the trust of the Earth-2 family, who consider him to be a wonder. Together, they escape to a warehouse where John instructs them to draw sigils to cast a complex spell. As John is lecturing about the unpredictability and the price of magic, Doctor Fate appears, claims to have foreseen his arrival, and offers to help him.

Doctor Fate reminds John of an incoming horde of Parademons and tells him to quickly cast the spell to escape from the dying world, himself hoping to flee with John and the family too. John discovers that the spell requires one Constantine to die: either himself or the Earth-2 John. As the Parademons storm in and take each family member down one by one, John is torn over between saving his own life and let the good, honest Earth-2 John live by sacrificing himself. Finally, he chooses to save his own skin: as he is kissing the other John, he holds his hand and drives the knife into his heart, killing the &quot;other John&quot;. As the spells start working, John casts an additional spell to trick Doctor Fate, which masks his presence from the ancient sorcerer, then departs, brings along the family members and many other people.

By killing the &quot;proper&quot; Constantine, he earns the wrath and hatred of the Earth-2 family. Being called &quot;Devil&quot;, John corrects the family when they reach Heaven while peeling through the layers of the dying world: Heaven itself, also under assault from Darkseid&#x27;s force, has closed its door and started departing, deeming this world beyond salvation. Later, John and his entourage are attacked by Doctor Fate, who managed to detect Constantine&#x27;s whereabout. Despite succeeding in countering the assault, John loses his &quot;mother&quot; Mary-Anne, who is dragged back by Fate&#x27;s chain. This greatly traumatizes Thomas Constantine, John&#x27;s father, who even attempts to commit suicide, but is talked out of it by John.

After a long and hard trip, Constantine finally makes it back home, but Darkseid has sensed him and is in hot pursuit. As the menacing hand of the Apokolips God is reaching out for him, Constantine enacts his &quot;last trick&quot;: by sacrificing some souls of his entourage, John manages to get enough power to cast the &quot;Ring of Dolus&quot; spell, which uses every happy memory, every pleasant thought, every piece of hope in John Constantine to swirl a magical &quot;web&quot; made of lies. This powerful spell helps John project an illusion of an already dead universe to fool Darkseid, while John manages to bring himself, the family and the Earth-2 civilians to safety, and even pickpockets some survivors back from Darkseid&#x27;s clutch.

As Constantine lands in the Jurassic Coast, England, he is confronted by Thomas, who points a gun at his head. Tired of everything, John yells at his father, and begs him to kill him off for good. Unable to do it, Thomas drops the gun, but Maureen quickly puts it up and prepares to shoot John, while questioning his actions. John contemplates and sees that while he is no hero, he is the only one willing to sacrifice the &quot;proper John&quot; to save his family, or to trade a hundred people for the safety of 6 billion. He magically teleports away, leaving the family and the survivors behind. Later, John goes back to New York and visits his old friend Lloyd at his bar to tell him about his latest adventures.

The &quot;New 52&quot; &quot;Constantine&quot; series ends at issue #23 and was relaunched as &quot;Constantine: The Hellblazer&quot; written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV in June 2015.

The &quot;Constantine&quot; &quot;Futures End&quot; tie-in tells the story of John Constantine five years into a possible future of the &quot;New 52&quot; universe. He somehow obtains the ultimate occult artifact, the Helmet of Fate, and manages to trick and kill the ancient magician Nabu with the help of an old ifrit.

John Constantine&#x27;s origin in the &quot;New 52&quot; universe is seemingly retconned in the &quot;Secret Origins&quot; series. In the story, a group of kids in Liverpool manages to get their hands on an occult book and uses it to summon a magical creature called &quot;Legendbreaker&quot; to discover Constantine&#x27;s true origin. Instead, the creature tells three conflicting stories: one featuring John&#x27;s mother dead in childbirth, leaving him to his abusive father; another having John Constantine being born in a loving family with proud and doting parents; and last one with John born in an unremarkable family, but with a mad older sister who is (probably) possessed by a dark force. They all lead to the death of his entire family and set the path for John Constantine into the world of magic and to the fateful incident in Newcastle, although the actions and consequences are different. The creature tries to claim the souls of the young &quot;mystics&quot;, but the real John Constantine shows up and chases it away. He tells the kids to go back home, forget what has just happened, and that his true origins will forever remain unknown - but it does not matter.

John Constantine stars in the DC You title &quot;Constantine: The Hellblazer&quot; written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV. The title introduces John in a new outfit and new hairstyle, in his own adventures, unrelated to superheroes business.

Constantine uses magic to trick a cashier in a clothes store and gets himself a new suit. He pickpockets a passenger, uses the money to buy a meal in a small restaurant and gets acquainted with its owner Oliver, a single father of two daughters. As John is busy chatting and flirting with Oliver an old &quot;friend&quot;, the demon Blythe, pulls John away and convinces him to help them solve their problems in their latest business place, a soul farm. They want John to eliminate their business partner, which John completes, and he also cons Blythe into banishing herself back to Hell. Suddenly, John sees his entire ghost entourage, and Gary Lester&#x27;s ghost - who has tried to warn him since the beginning - tells him that Frank North&#x27;s spirit has vanished completely, and something has been after John&#x27;s ghosts. John tries to set up a scheme to lure and trap the entity which had been after his ghosts, by ramping up quite a number of ghosts from &#x27;haunted sites&#x27;. The plan fails and Gary Lester&#x27;s ghost is also taken by the being. After a few flashbacks and meeting with an old acquaintance named Georgie, John begins to unravel the true identity of the ghost-hunting entity, as his (and Georgie&#x27;s) old time lover, Veronica. After releasing Veronica&#x27;s soul, Constantine starts to notice (and is also warned by other beings whom he deems as &#x27;friends&#x27;) the increasing number of supernatural activities in New York city. Being part of Neron&#x27;s grand scheme, John manages to (after quite a bit of struggle) con Neron into thinking that the souls he had claimed were worthless, and leaving New York city for good. Albeit the cost of Oliver&#x27;s soul, which Blythe had claimed by previously blackmailing him and John with the souls of his daughters.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In &quot;The Hellblazer: Rebirth&quot;, John gets back to London to remove the curse placed upon him (originally shown in &quot;Constantine&quot; #3, which makes him physically sick whenever he sets foot on London soil) and resumes his adventures in the new &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;-initiative &quot;The Hellblazer&quot;. The series restores many of the traditional aspects of the original &quot;Hellblazer&quot; run while still remaining firmly in the larger DC Universe, restoring his original backstory and featuring old allies such as Chas, Mercury and the Swamp Thing.

John Constantine returns to England and is greeted by his old time friend, Chas Chandler, at the airport. He resolves to dispel the curse, set on him by a demon called &quot;Laughing Boy&quot;, whom he once crossed in the past, by using a ritual that deflects the curse from him to 8 million souls in London. Shazam and Wonder Woman make an appearance - they notice the ravens in London dying and prepare to intervene, while the Swamp Thing appears before them and tells them that they should trust Constantine on this one. The &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; demon tells John that he will return Astra&#x27;s soul if John agrees to cancel his spell. However, it turns out that John is buying time for the psychic Mercury, who is now a young woman, to arrive and tell him the real name of &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; (Nybbas). John takes control of the demon, cancels the curse and London returns to normal.

In the past, it is shown that the djinn have tried to hide away the secret of their existence from humans. One djinn, named Marid, was stopped by his brother when he tried to prevent the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered World War I. In South London, present day, John Constantine is staying in Chas&#x27;s house when he is contacted by Swamp Thing. Abigail Arcane, the Avatar of the Rot and the Swamp Thing&#x27;s lover, is missing. John enlists Mercury&#x27;s help, who is eager to help the Swamp Thing despite disliking John. Meanwhile, in Paris, Marid resurfaces and attacks his brother.

John tells Chas which horse to bet on and makes the cabbie drive him to the Tate Club. Clarice Sackville offers him a deal with &quot;someone&quot;, but John flatly refuses. That &quot;someone&quot; turns out to be Marid, who is shown working with Clarice, with Constantine seeming to be an obstacle to their plans. John is tracked down by two djinn but manages to escape to the London Underground. He meets Map, who behaves oddly and warns John of an upcoming danger in town: the djinn, and that Clarice actually wants John to stop the djinn from finding the Swamp Thing. John returns home only to find Chas tied up and gagged by a gang of white supremacists, who have managed to deduce that Chas&#x27;s winning bet was due to John, and force the con man to tell them how to win bets. While John is &quot;doing magick&quot;, Marid and his djinns arrive and kill off the gang, and John and Chas manage to escape.

Mercury and the Swamp Thing travel in the Rot to find Abigail Arcane. Mercury jumps into a &quot;wormhole&quot; while the Swamp Thing stays behind and battles the forces of the Rot. Mercury returns and rescues the Swamp Thing. When asked what she found, Constantine arrives and answers &quot;djinn&quot;.

===The Sandman Universe===
In another universe first seen in Books of Magic, Constantine is caught in the middle of a magical war that will destroy the universe at the hands of Timothy Hunter. Constantine sacrifices Chas to buy himself time, but is fatally wounded by Chas&#x27; taxi sign. Constantine encounters the prime Tim Hunter and tells him that all of this destruction is his fault and he wishes that he had listened to Mister E and killed him. After Tim leaves, Constantine meet an alternate, older version of himself who offers to save him for a price, which is that John has to be the best version of himself. As John starts to lose consciousness, he realizes that he is not ready to die yet and agrees to the deal. He later wakes up in Ravenscar Asylum, back in the prime DC universe.

Once in this new universe, John discovered that Chas is dying of lung cancer and is plagued by various demons and spirits, caused by spending so much time around John. Chas angrily renounced their friendship. After visiting Chandler, John tried to kill the Timothy Hunter of this universe to prevent Hunter&#x27;s supposed descent to darkness, but stopped midway. He managed to gain the reluctant service of Vestibullan - a former angel who had refused to take side during the war between Hell and Heaven, and had been punished ever since.

After being thrown out of a bar for making jokes ridiculing the British Royal family, John made acquaintance with its bouncer, Nat, a Glaswegian girl who was an excellent martial artist. John was kidnapped by the &quot;mob boss&quot; called K-Mag, the leader of a street gang consisted of wayward immigrant youngsters. His henchmen, the &quot;Ri-Boys&quot;, had been trying to sell drugs in a nearby park, but were killed by what they thought to be angels.

K-Mag employed Constantine, who he knew was a magician, to deal with these &quot;angels&quot;, by blackmailing John over one of his gangster&#x27;s (Noah) life. John agreed, and discovered that these were not really angels, but magical beings created by a homeless man who was obsessed with William Blake. Constantine tricks the man into killing himself, hence destroying the &quot;angels&quot;. He also managed to bring Noah out of the gang and made the young man his personal driver like his former friend Chas. However, the residual energy of the encounter was later revealed to be absorbed by the old Constantine.

John then met a fellow sorcerer, the hippie Tommy Willowtree (formerly Thomas Spugg), who tells him that the angels in the park were just one of a series of magical occurrences that have happened since John&#x27;s return. Willowtree revered John and offered him back his &quot;birthright&quot; as the &quot;Magelord of England&quot;. It turned out that due to Constantine&#x27;s sudden disappearance, the Tate Club&#x27;s leader, Clarice Sackville, and her associate resorted to find and brand the young Willowtree as their &quot;champion&quot;. Together, the reluctant Constantine and Willowtree managed to solve a minor problem by one of Constantine&#x27;s former associate turned enemy, and stopped the ravens of the Tower of London from attacking foreign visitors. Unknown to them, these events were caused by the alternate old John, who managed to attack and crucify the young Willowtree.

John visited Noah&#x27;s mother, who had been comatose for seven years, in a hospital. He encountered a ghostly presence of a young xenophobic British woman who attacked and murdered all patients in the critical ward who had foreign background - but not Constantine, a British man. It turned out to be a hateful projection of an old lady who had been bedridden for three years and could do nothing but watched and directed her hatred, especially immigrants, which Noah solved by visiting her room and putting flower next to her deathbed.

John tried to track down his old version&#x27;s signal, which led him to a fishing town. He discovered Freddie, an young fisherman who found himself out of luck with his business as well as being held with contempt by his fellow fishermen, all of whom were subscribing to xenophobic ideals from a British Conservative politician called Clem Thurso. The old John gave Freddie a whistle, which he used to summon a mermaid who was madly in love with him. Freddie used the mermaid to fish and to kill his rival French fishermen. When the fish resource started to dry up, Freddie turned to capture the mermaid and slice off her flesh to sell, as he found out she had self-healing powers, despite her pleas and her being pregnant with his offspring. John rescued the mermaid and waited until she finally delivered and died from childbirth, to catch Freddie and kick him down the river for his monstrous human-mermaid hybrid children to eat him alive.

The old John had also made acquaintance with a Duke (an allegory to Prince Andrew), who was desperate to gain the favor of his mother, the Queen. Old John supplied him with horse semen and promised of a majestic, fast, powerful being. The Duke ordered his men to bring Constantine in to help with the birth of the creature, only to capture the younger John. John warned the Duke of the creature but was ignored. The creature, supposed to be a beautiful unicorn, turned out to be absolutely grotesque; it stabbed its way out of its mother&#x27;s womb and killed all the other mares at the stable. John explained that the creature was born purely out of an idea and was supposed to represent one thing: purity, and it could only be calmed down by purity of a barely legal virgin readily in the Duke&#x27;s car, before John euthanized it. Later, John was chased down by one assassin sent by the Royal family due to fear of embarrassment by this scandal, but he thwarted the attempt on his life.

== Characterization ==

Although a compassionate humanist who struggles to overcome the influence of both Heaven and Hell over humanity, and despite his occasional forays into heroism, Constantine is a foul-mouthed, disillusioned British cynic who pursues a life of sorcery and danger. His motivation has been attributed to an adrenaline addiction that only the strange and mysterious can satiate. He also seems to be something of a &quot;Weirdness Magnet&quot; (a term also used to describe Constantine). He is shown to be someone with a wide and international circle of contacts and allies, and is adept at making friends. At the same time, his close friends inevitably suffer or are outright killed simply by being in his life; this has left a severe mark on him. In #69, when the King of Vampires killed the man sleeping beside him and casually asked if he had been a friend, John replied, &quot;Must be. He&#x27;s dead.&quot;

=== Magical powers ===
Constantine also has a reputation as being one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. Despite this, he rarely uses magic, instead choosing to use his wits to trick his opponents. Constantine is also referred to as &quot;The Constant One&quot; because of his whole family tree being somewhat connected to the occult. Many of his ancestors are sorcerers from different eras of history, and have taken part in many known historical events. Some of his ancestors have roles in other works outside &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, such as &quot;Batman: The Order of Beasts&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;.

=== Sexuality ===
Constantine is bisexual, which was first established in a 1992 comic that referred offhandedly to his having male and female exes. Early stories exclusively showed him dating women, although &quot;Ashes &amp; Dust in the City of Angels&quot; showed him as having relationships with men, as well. His romantic relationships in the New 52 have included numerous partners, most significantly Zatanna, as well as the sorcerer Nick Necro; all have been fraught with distrust and mutual disappointments. The relaunch &quot;Constantine the Hellblazer&quot; #1 (2015) reaffirmed Constantine&#x27;s bisexuality through his interactions with male and female characters in the issue. Later issues of &quot;Constantine the Hellblazer&quot; depicted John falling in love with a male bartender named Oliver, whom he dated.

=== Attire ===
While Constantine has worn many clothes over the years, he was originally portrayed as often wearing a blue pin-stripe suit, tan trench coat, and occasionally gloves. As the series progressed, his trademark attire became a grungier (or perhaps the same, just older) trench coat, white shirt, and black or red tie, but eventually returned more to his earlier fashion. Constantine smokes Silk Cut cigarettes, consuming 30 or so a day. Constantine also occasionally breaks the fourth wall, where he talks to the reader and narrates the story himself.

=== Real-time aging ===
Constantine is unusual among comic-book characters in that he has aged in real time since his creation. During the first year of his solo series, Constantine celebrated his 35th birthday. In the relevant issue, Constantine is reading a newspaper when he notices the date on the cover is his birthday, making his date of birth May 10, 1953. Five years later, on May 10, 1993, he turned 40. In &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, it was mentioned multiple times that the demon blood he obtained from Nergal may have affected his aging. In a 2011 interview, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio said, &quot;Constantine in the Vertigo universe is in his 60s, and what you have in the DC Universe is a character who is markedly younger&quot;.

==Analogues==
* The character of Jack Carter in Warren Ellis and John Cassaday&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Planetary&quot; is an analogue of John Constantine; he fakes his death and turns into an analogue of Ellis&#x27; Spider Jerusalem, stating that with the 1980s over, it&#x27;s &quot;time to be someone else&quot;: this has been interpreted as Ellis criticizing the Constantine character for being too tied to his origins as a reaction to 1980s politics and stating that more modern characters have since taken on his mantle.
* Constance Johanssen, a blonde, chain-smoking British woman in a trenchcoat was also created by Ellis for his &quot;Pryde and Wisdom&quot; series for Marvel Comics, described as &quot;Constance Johanssen. Excellent occult detective. Has a habit of getting her friends killed. Two hundred at last count.&quot;
* Grant Morrison originally wanted Constantine to become a supporting character in their &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; series, but DC&#x27;s editorial policy at the time prevented Constantine from making extended appearances in superhero comics, for fear of spoiling the realism of &quot;Hellblazer&quot;. As a result, Morrison created the magus Willoughby Kipling. It was revealed in &quot;Hellblazer&quot; #51 that they and Constantine have met, and they had a brief voice-over cameo in Warren Ellis&#x27; &quot;&quot; story &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;.
* Ambrose Bierce is the name of a character intended to be John Constantine in Phil Foglio&#x27;s &quot;Stanley and His Monster&quot; limited series, but changed at the last minute due to editorial policy. Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin played a similar role for Firestorm and Captain Atom as Constantine did for the Swamp Thing, while Hellblazer was a Jack Kirby-style reinterpretation of the character who appeared in &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; #53 and &quot;The Books of Magic Annual&quot; #3.
* According to actor Misha Collins, the wardrobe of the character Castiel on the TV show &quot;Supernatural&quot; is based on that of John Constantine.
* In the CrossGen title &quot;Mystic No. 15&quot;, magical characters from different literature, including DC and Marvel&#x27;s sorcerers, made some appearances in a bar. John Constantine appears in the background.

== Other versions ==

* A Bat-Mite version of John Constantine appears in &quot;Batman: Mitefall&quot;.
* An alternate universe variant of John Constantine appears in &quot;&quot;.
* A young, alternate universe variant of John Constantine appears in the graphic novel &quot;The Mystery of the Meanest Teacher&quot;.
==Powers, abilities, and resources==
John Constantine&#x27;s magical abilities, prior to the New 52 era and onward, were considered average in terms of spell-casting proficiency. However, he relied more on his intelligence, extensive knowledge of the occult, manipulation skills, and extensive network of contacts. Despite this, Constantine specialized in various areas of magic, including demonology, illusions, divination, and demonic summoning. He also had some proficiency in necromancy and spiritual communication. In his use of sorcery, Constantine possessed a vast repertoire of magical spells, rituals, and curses. These abilities encompassed evocation, necromancy, illusions, invisibility, and even time travel. He was skilled in employing protective magic through the use of sigils and magic circles, providing defense against physical and supernatural attacks. Constantine also displayed resistance to psychic attacks and had the ability to block omnipresence using magic, as demonstrated by his use of sigils to hide from powerful entities. After the New 52 reboot, Constantine&#x27;s magical abilities underwent expansion, becoming more formidable.

Additionally, he possesses a notable supernatural ability called synchronicity wave traveling, which grants him exceptional luck and the power to shape events in his favor. He has a talent for evading harm, finding suitable allies, and altering the course of battles. Furthermore, Constantine is recognized as a practitioner of &quot;Blood Magic,&quot; a classification that encompasses individuals who possess the blood of magical beings either through birth or external means. In Constantine&#x27;s case, he falls into the latter category. This unique characteristic grants him the ability to tap into magical forces and alleviate many of the negative effects associated with magic. His blood carries a demonic taint acquired through a blood transfusion from Nergal and contact with a succubus. This tainted blood has demonstrated healing properties, age-managing effects, and acts as a defensive mechanism, being highly corrosive and poisonous against powerful adversaries like the King of the Vampires.

In addition to his proficiency in sorcery, Constantine possesses exceptional manipulation skills, having successfully deceived powerful entities within the DC Universe, including The First of the Fallen, The Presence, Batman, and Superman. He is widely regarded as the world&#x27;s greatest con man. Constantine holds extensive knowledge of the routes to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife, allowing him to escape and teleport without being pursued by adversaries. In the graphic novel &quot;Pandemonium&quot;, he deliberately allows himself to be killed but later resurrects by departing from the afterlife. Furthermore, Constantine demonstrates considerable expertise in stage magic skills such as hypnosis, sleight of hand, pickpocketing, and escapology. His proficiency in unarmed combat varies depending on the writer, with some portraying him as a less skilled physical fighter and others depicting him as a capable hand-to-hand combatant. In certain instances, Constantine emerges victorious in fights through the utilization of magical weapons, unorthodox tactics, or quick thinking. After tricking the Lords of Hell into curing his lung cancer, he was perpetually in good health and physicality.

John also carries with him an arsenal of powerful magical artifacts to aid him in battle, such as The House of Mystery, which also serves as his transport to different realms of the universe, and his trademark trench coat that possesses powerful demonic powers.

==In real life==
Alan Moore claims to have met his creation on two occasions. In 1993, he told &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine:
His second meeting with his creation was illustrated in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;, an adaptation by Eddie Campbell of one of Moore&#x27;s performance art pieces:
They met a third time in fiction, when Moore was written into issue #120 of &quot;Hellblazer&quot; by then-author Paul Jenkins. Moore is seen sitting in silhouette at the back of a bar as John Constantine (who is on a pub crawl with the reader) raises a drink to him.

Writers who had their run on the &quot;Hellblazer&quot; series have also claimed to have met the character in real life. A rumour has persisted for many years that the Liverpool occult writer Tom Slemen served as a model for Constantine. Slemen has always denied this. Original &quot;Hellblazer&quot; writer Jamie Delano also claims to have encountered Constantine, during his run on the character, outside the British Museum. Peter Milligan saw Constantine at a party around 2009 and rushed after him, only to find he&#x27;d disappeared. Brian Azzarello once saw him in a Chicago bar but avoided him, saying that &quot;the thing about John is, the last thing you&#x27;d want to be is his friend.&quot;

== Reception and legacy ==
The character won the 1986 &quot;Favourite Supporting Character&quot; by Eagle Award, followed by winning it again in the same category a year later. In addition to being ranked third in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 Greatest Comic Characters and being ranked No. 10 in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time, he is also listed in IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes as No. 29, stating that &quot;John Constantine is pretty low on the totem pole as far as DC&#x27;s magical players go. But through a combination of guile, trickery, and plain old ornery charm, Constantine battles the worst Hell has to offer and lives to tell the tale. Constantine is a byproduct of both the punk rock era and Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain. He isn&#x27;t very nice, he drinks and smokes like they&#x27;re both going out of style, and his friends always seem to pay for his own magical misdeeds. And yet we can&#x27;t help but love this crusty old magician all the same.&quot; In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Constantine as #30 on their list of the &quot;50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics&quot;.

The character also garnered some negative reception, where UGO.com listed both Constantine and Zatanna in UGO&#x27;s the Dirtiest Comic Book Sex Scenes, where they comment that, &quot;One DC heroine who often finds herself unlucky in love is the backwards magician Zatanna, who can never seem to find a quality dude. One of the most fulfilling relationships she&#x27;s had to date is with that reprobate John Constantine, who is the very definition of a &quot;love &#x27;em and leave &#x27;em&quot; kind of dude. The pair hooked up a number of times but their respective worldviews were just too different, plus he&#x27;s straight Vertigo and she&#x27;s wiping minds in the Justice League. The commute would be hideous.&quot; During Brian Azzarello&#x27;s run on the series, the Ashes &amp; Dust in the City of Angels story arc gained controversy for portraying Constantine in a bisexual relationship, though it wouldn&#x27;t be the last time Constantine&#x27;s bisexuality was explored.

Fandomania.com ranked the film &quot;Constantine&quot; in No. 13 of their Ultimate 20 Comic Book Film Adaptations, stating that Keanu Reeves&#x27;s performance &quot;was good&quot;, although saying it might have been better if &quot;played by the person the character was originally modelled after: Sting of the Police.&quot; &quot;TopTenz.net&quot; ranked him No. 5 in Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes, saying that &quot;Just knowing John Constantine is likely to get you killed: during his comic&#x27;s run just about every member of his supporting cast has either been killed, maimed, mutilated, tortured and coerced into making deals with fiends from the Pit. And yet Constantine goes on, a supernatural warrior willing to pay almost any price to keep the darkest evil at bay. In recent times Constantine has got rid of the guilt and self-loathing plaguing him by magically giving it the physical form of a baby and throwing it off a cliff. What a magnificent bastard...&quot;

Sonia Harris from &quot;Comics Should Be Good&quot; praised &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, saying that &quot;watching John delve into his past in order to exorcise his (and the worlds [&quot;sic&quot;]) literal and metaphorical demons is a delight. Simon Bisley does an incredible job of visually contrasting the pretty young version of Constantine with the imposing man he has become. Time and misadventure have scarred and hardened John, and the man he has become has the strength and will to transform his environment by channelling the anger that pained him so much as a young, fresh-faced, suicidal punk kid.&quot; Constantine ranked 30th on ComicsAlliance&#x27;s 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics list that even though almost all of his relationships end badly, they can&#x27;t warn others against his wily charms. Furthermore, Constantine has been analyzed as a stereotypical depiction of a European in fiction.

&quot;Hellblazer&quot; boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it into its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as &quot;Hellboy&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Grimm&quot;, &quot;The Originals&quot;, and &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; have been influenced by the character. Many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as &quot;Criminal Macabre&quot;, &quot;Gravel&quot;, &quot;Planetary&quot;, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.

Furthermore, Constantine&#x27;s exorcisms are motivated by a desire to redeem himself for his past suicide, but he is constantly doomed to fail as everything he has done has benefited himself rather than others.

<text>John Constantine, Hellblazer is an American contemporary horror comic-book series published by DC Comics since January 1988, and subsequently by its Vertigo imprint since March 1993, when the imprint was introduced. Its central character is the streetwise English sorcerer and con man John Constantine, who was created by Alan Moore and Stephen R. Bissette, and first appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (vol. 2) #37 (June 1985), during that creative team&#x27;s run on that title. &quot;Hellblazer&quot; had been published continuously since January 1988, and was Vertigo&#x27;s longest-running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint&#x27;s launch. In 2013, the series concluded with issue 300, and was replaced by &quot;Constantine&quot;, which returned the character to the mainstream DC Universe. The original series was revived in November 2019 for twelve issues as part of &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot; line of comics, under the DC Black Label brand. Well known for its extremely pessimistic tone and social/political commentary, the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.

The series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone for many British writers. Notable writers who have contributed to the series include Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Eddie Campbell, Paul Jenkins, Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, Brian Azzarello, Mike Carey, Denise Mina, Andy Diggle, and Peter Milligan. &quot;Hellblazer&quot; was one of the first modern occult detective fiction works and heavily influenced the genre to come.

==Production history==
After favorable reader reaction to John Constantine&#x27;s appearances in the comic-book series &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, where he had been introduced by writer Alan Moore, the character was given his own comic-book series in 1988. The series was intended to bear the title &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, but this title was revised before publication due to the contemporaneous release of Clive Barker&#x27;s unrelated film of the same name. Initial writer Jamie Delano was, in his own words, &quot;fairly ambivalent&quot; about the change of title.

The initial creative team was writer Jamie Delano and artist John Ridgway, with Dave McKean supplying distinctive painted and collage covers. Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: &quot;...generally I was interested in commenting on 1980s Britain. That was where I was living, it was shit, and I wanted to tell everybody.&quot; The book, originally published as a regular DC Comics title, became a Vertigo title with the imprint&#x27;s launch in March 1993 (issue #63 of the series). In October 2011, it was announced that this would join DC titles in being published digitally on the same day as its physical release, starting in January 2012.

===Creative personnel===
Many writers had lengthy runs on the series, such as Garth Ennis and Mike Carey, who respectively had the second- and third-longest runs on the book (only behind Peter Milligan). Other writers who wrote for the series include Paul Jenkins, Warren Ellis, Brian Azzarello, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison, Denise Mina, and Andy Diggle.

Numerous artists worked on the series, as well, such as John Ridgway (the original series artist), Simon Bisley, Mark Buckingham, Richard Corben, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin, Jock, David Lloyd, Leonardo Manco, and Sean Phillips. Cover artists included Dave McKean (who designed the first run of the series&#x27; covers), Tim Bradstreet (who designed the most), Glenn Fabry, Kent Williams, David Lloyd, and Sean Phillips.

== In the comics ==
===Setting and protagonist===
&quot;Hellblazer&quot; was set in a contemporary world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. Although the official setting of the series was the DC Universe, well-known DC characters were rarely seen or mentioned. However, some DC Comics charactersmost notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, the Phantom Stranger, Shade, the Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and the Swamp Thingmade appearances.

John Constantine, the main character of &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, was portrayed as a kind of confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.

Constantine made appearances in other comic-book titles, such as &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, &quot;Green Arrow&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;The Sandman&quot;, &quot;Lucifer&quot;, and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;. He was a recurring supporting character in both &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; throughout their numerous incarnations. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family-friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as &quot;Gregori Eilovotich Rasputin&quot; in &quot;Firestorm&quot; and &quot;Captain Atom&quot; (who refers to Constantine as &quot;an impertinent bumbler in England&quot;). Grant Morrison created &quot;Willoughby Kipling&quot; for &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of Richard E. Grant in &quot;Withnail and I&quot;, following which Phil Foglio was forced to create &quot;Ambroise Bierce&quot; in &quot;Stanley and His Monster&quot;, having been refused both Constantine &quot;and&quot; Willoughby Kipling.

John Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; crossover event title &quot;Search for the Swamp Thing&quot;, and in the ongoing The New 52 title &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;.

===1988–1991===
====Jamie Delano (#1–24, #28–40, #84, #250)====
Having previously worked on &quot;D.R. &amp; Quinch&quot; for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, a title made popular by John Constantine&#x27;s creator Alan Moore, Delano was selected to start the character&#x27;s first run in his own comic by then editor Karen Berger in 1988. Delano&#x27;s run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late-1980s and -90s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with Freemasons from the Houses of Parliament. He also had environmentalist issues crop up, especially in &quot;The Fear Machine&quot; (issues #15–22), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor Karen Berger noted on Delano&#x27;s departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that Thatcher was forced out of office.

Five main storylines were in the run. The first, collected as &quot;Original Sins&quot;, deals with John travelling to America to exorcise a demon, Mnemoth, and investigate a strange cult known as Damnation&#x27;s Army, crossing paths with a demon called Nergal (from whom he gains demon blood), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, Gary Lester, and betraying another friend, called Zed, in the process. The following four issues, &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; finally explain John&#x27;s failure to save a young girl, Astra, from a demon in Newcastle, an event that left him near insane and incarcerated in an asylum known as Ravenscar, and still haunted him to the comic&#x27;s end. He eventually discovers that the demon responsible for this was Nergal, and uses a technological scheme to trap him, and lead him back to hell. It also contains a crossover with &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to procreate.

This was followed by a lengthy nine-issue story arc, &quot;The Fear Machine&quot;, revolving around a masonic plot to collect people&#x27;s fears, to raise a dormant god known as Juntakillokian, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including Mercury, a young psychic girl, and Marj, her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano&#x27;s tenure was &quot;The Family Man&quot;, which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine&#x27;s nemesis is not supernatural (beyond an opening metafictional encounter with a fictional fence), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John&#x27;s ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his coping with the murder of his father, Thomas, frames this story. During this run on the title, Grant Morrison (issues #25 &amp; 26) and Neil Gaiman (issue #27) both filled in during a three-month break, with Morrison&#x27;s story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman&#x27;s being a ghost story about homelessness.

Delano&#x27;s run ended with &quot;The Golden Child&quot;, where John is reunited with Marj and Mercury, who help him discover that he murdered his more perfect twin in the womb, culminating in an extended story, in which what would have occurred had the other twin survived in his place is revealed. During his run, there was also a stand-alone issue, &quot;Hellblazer Annual&quot; #1, exploring Constantine&#x27;s ancestry, and featuring the video to John&#x27;s punk band, Mucous Membrane&#x27;s song &quot;Venus of the Hardsell&quot;.

Jamie Delano returned to the title on several occasions. Between the Garth Ennis and Paul Jenkins runs on &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, he finally told the story of why John&#x27;s best friend Chas &#x27;owes&#x27; him (issue #84), and he returned again for one of the five Christmas stories in issue #250. He also wrote the miniseries &quot;The Horrorist&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; in 2000, both featuring John Constantine. A more substantial return was made in 2010 for a hardcover graphic novel &quot;&quot; with artist Jock to commemorate the 25th anniversary of John Constantine&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;.

===1991–1995===
====Garth Ennis (#41–50, #52–83, #129–133)====
Irish writer Garth Ennis then took over the title in 1991, again from &quot;2000 AD&quot;, where he had been working on &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. He proceeded to write the second-longest run for any writer on the title. His take on the title was more personal than Jamie Delano&#x27;s, with John&#x27;s relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John&#x27;s dealings with the First of the Fallen, and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a succubus demon, Ellie, would go on to be used again as a major plot device in &quot;Preacher&quot;, one of his most popular works. He also references the music of The Pogues and the poetry of Brendan Behan, both of these being relevant to Ennis&#x27; Irish heritage.

His run started with &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot; (41–46), which was the basis for the 2005 film &quot;Constantine&quot;, and dealt with John Constantine contracting lung cancer, and the desperate deal he makes with the First of the Fallen, and various other lords of Hell, to save himself. In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, and later becomes reacquainted with Kit Ryan, an old friend of Irish origin. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline &quot;Royal Blood&quot;, and in the extended issue #50, his first meeting with the King of the Vampires. One minor story in this arc (issue #51) was written by guest writer John Smith.

The next major arc, &quot;Fear and Loathing&quot; (issues 62–67), covers a high point of John&#x27;s personal life, with his relationship with Kit going well, and a 40th birthday party where his friends Ellie, Zatanna, and the Swamp Thing attend, and use their various abilities to create a large quantity of Bushmills whiskey and marijuana. The story then takes him to his lowest point, through his dealings with the National Front, their threats towards Kit, and her leaving him to return to Ireland. Following this, John is defeated, and lives homeless on the streets, drinking to forget his life. This remains the case until the King of the Vampires hunts him out, and is poisoned by his demon blood, leaving him out in the sun at dawn, killing him. Following his recovery, the storyline &quot;Damnation&#x27;s Flame&quot; (Issues #72–77) follows a trip to the US, where Constantine is put into an alternative America by his old adversary Papa Midnite, a Vodun shaman. He is accompanied by the spirit of JFK, who has to hold his brain in place from his infamous wound. He eventually learns how to escape, shortly before running into the First of the Fallen, in the guise of Abraham Lincoln. There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems. Ennis&#x27; run ends with &quot;Rake at the Gates of Hell&quot;, a story which finally brings together the racism storyline, with riots in Mile End, echoing the real-life Brixton and Broadwater Farm riots in London, the revenge attempt of the First of the Fallen, started in &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot;, and the end of John&#x27;s relationship with Kit Ryan. John&#x27;s eventual Pyrrhic victory leaves this run with closure, and a relatively clean slate for a new writer to take over.

Ennis briefly returned to the title in 1998 with &quot;Son of Man&quot;, filling the gaps between Paul Jenkins&#x27;s and Warren Ellis&#x27;s runs on the title. This more irreverent story is about the consequences of Constantine resurrecting the dead son of an East London gangster, using the spirit of a demon. He also had two specials published during his run on the title, the &quot;Hellblazer Special&quot; and &quot;Heartland&quot;, which follows Kit Ryan&#x27;s return to Ireland.

===1995-1999===
====Paul Jenkins (#89–128)====
Following issue #84 by Jamie Delano and a brief interlude by &quot;From Hell&quot; artist Eddie Campbell (issues #85-88), the series&#x27; direction was taken over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been the former editor of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins&#x27; run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, and even an appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the &#x27;man from Porlock&#x27; may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano&#x27;s coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.

Major storylines in this run include &quot;Critical Mass&quot;, where Constantine is forced to use magic to purge his darker side into another human body, to avoid being damned to Hell as part of a trade to save the possessed son of a friend, thus creating the antagonistic character, Demon Constantine, with the assistance of Aleister Crowley. The landmark hundredth issue gave more detail on John Constantine&#x27;s father, and the abusive relationship that they had shared. However, it is unclear as to whether this is happening in reality, or in his mind as John convalesces in a coma. &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; reveals that his friend Rich is the current descendant of King Arthur, and Merlin&#x27;s attempt to discover God&#x27;s secret, an act which would destroy England, using John&#x27;s few remaining friends as bait.

The 10th-anniversary issue breaks from the usual format, in breaking the fourth wall, and addressing readers as if they are in a pub with Constantine for a monthly get-together to hear his stories. Over the course of the issue, most of the characters from Constantine&#x27;s history appear, along with Death of the Endless from &quot;Sandman&quot;. Also, appearances are made by writers and artists, including series creator Alan Moore, Garth Ennis, and Jenkins himself. Jenkins&#x27; run then draws to a close with two storylines, &quot;Up the Down Staircase&quot; and &quot;How to Play With Fire&quot;, which relate the First of the Fallen&#x27;s new plan, to essentially let mankind ruin itself through television and consumerism, and Ellie&#x27;s plot to leave Constantine friendless and alone. John eventually saves himself, through a literal &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, in a campfire conversation with God. However, at that time Rich and his family finally sever their friendship with John, and the latter ends the run alone.

===1999–2000===
==== Warren Ellis (#134–143) ====
Warren Ellis took over the title in 1999, after his work on &quot;Transmetropolitan&quot; which had moved to the Vertigo imprint, following the closure of Helix Comics. He was meant to become a full-time writer for several years, as Delano, Ennis and Jenkins before him, but left the title early after DC refused to publish the story &quot;Shoot&quot;, about high school shootings, following the Columbine High School massacre, despite the fact it had been written and submitted prior to the event. The story was finally published in 2010.

His brief run began with &quot;Haunted&quot;, a London-based story in which John investigates the brutal murder of a former girlfriend, Isabel by an Aleister Crowley style magician, Josh Wright. The story introduces, or reintroduces many characters who became an important part of the Hellblazer universe, including Inspector Watford (originally from Jamie Delano&#x27;s run on the title), aging magician Clarice, and Map, a powerful magician who works on tube renovations in his part as custodian of London. The remainder of Ellis&#x27; brief tenure was taken up with single issue stories, collected as &quot;Setting Sun&quot;.

===2000-2002===
====Brian Azzarello (#146–174)====
Following a brief interlude by Croatian writer Darko Macan, the series was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired on the strength of his own series for Vertigo, &quot;100 Bullets&quot;. Azzarello&#x27;s run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, catching a serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled pastiche of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250. This arc attracted minor controversy for its depiction of Constantine in a same-sex relationship.

===2002–2006===
====Mike Carey (#175–215, #229)====
Following Azzarello&#x27;s run, writer Mike Carey took over the title, following his Eisner award-winning title &quot;Lucifer&quot;, set in the &quot;Sandman&quot; universe. Carey&#x27;s run attempted to return John Constantine to his roots, with the title largely set back in London, and featuring many characters from former runs on the title. Mike Carey also has the honour of being the first Liverpudlian to write the Liverpudlian character. His was the second longest run by any single author on the title up to that time, second only to Garth Ennis, until Peter Milligan&#x27;s run.

The start of his run introduces Angie Spatchcock, a fellow magician, and reintroduces his niece, Gemma Constantine, who has also fallen into magic use, to her uncle&#x27;s consternation. After ridding his sister&#x27;s house of an evil spirit, and finding out Gemma has gone missing, John returns to London, to find his old colleagues and enemies are all taking sides in the hunt for a mythical item, known as the Red Sepulchre. John eventually locates the item, and finds Gemma, freeing her from his old enemy Josh Wright. Following several forewarnings, Constantine then travels the world to set up a plan for a forthcoming tragedy, which will occur when &quot;Three doors are opened&quot;, involving Swamp Thing and the Garden of Eden amongst others.

John&#x27;s preparations have no effect, however, as he is tricked into killing the guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the events leading up to the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis&#x27;s time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano&#x27;s, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.

Carey&#x27;s final run followed the attempts of John&#x27;s three new children attempting to kill all of his family and friends, culminating in the death of his sister, Cheryl, at the hands of her possessed husband. John then travels into Hell to try to rescue her soul, with the assistance of Rosacarnis&#x27;s father, Nergal. The plan ultimately fails, and John returns broken, and intending to renounce magic.

Mike Carey returned to the title for a single issue between Denise Mina and Andy Diggle&#x27;s runs on the title, and also wrote the well-received &quot;Hellblazer&quot; graphic novel &quot;All His Engines&quot; about a strange illness sweeping the globe.

===2006–2007===
==== Denise Mina (#216–228) ====
Denise Mina had not written for comics when she took over the title in 2006, but had three acclaimed crime novels to her name, the Garnethill trilogy, the first of which won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they&#x27;re forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England&#x27;s loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there&#x27;s no source of joy like Schadenfreude.

===2007–2009===
==== Andy Diggle (#230–244, #247–249)====
Andy Diggle, having previously written the &quot;Hellblazer&quot; special, &quot;Lady Constantine&quot;, and Vertigo titles &quot;The Losers&quot; and &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, took over the title in 2007, another former writer for &quot;2000 AD&quot; to have done this. He left the title in 2009 after accepting an exclusive contract with Marvel.

The run starts by introducing two main antagonists, an aging politician, who is using a strange portal to enter other people&#x27;s minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians in order to obtain their power. Constantine&#x27;s attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the &#x27;Golden Child&#x27;, his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin&#x27;s offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.

===2009–2013===
==== Peter Milligan (#250–300)====
Peter Milligan, a veteran of the Vertigo line, having written both &quot;Shade, The Changing Man&quot; and &quot;Animal Man&quot; at the publisher&#x27;s inception (and another former &quot;2000 AD&quot; writer), then took over, starting with a short story in the landmark 250th issue, and taking over full-time following this. His run implemented several major changes, including John Constantine&#x27;s wedding and the loss of his thumb.

In a rare change, Milligan&#x27;s run on the title starts with John living in domestic bliss with a nurse, Phoebe. Over the course of the first storyline, several new characters are introduced, including Epiphany Greaves, the alchemist daughter of a notorious London gangster, and Julian, a Babylonian demon. Over the course of the run, John dealt with a demon taking revenge on people involved in the Liverpool dockers&#x27; strike gone insane and sought help from Shade, The Changing Man, after chopping off his own thumb, seen Phoebe die at the hands of Julian, and traveled to India to try to find a way of saving her. Following this, he realised that he was in love with Epiphany, and married her in the 275th issue. However, the events of this wedding turned Constantine&#x27;s niece Gemma against him, due to the Demon Constantine sexually assaulting her in the restroom. The strain of this traumatic incident turned her against John, and she enlisted the help of a coven of witches to kill him, which later came to a head when John was forced to fight off a brutal Demon summoned by them using John&#x27;s iconic trenchcoat to target him.

Afterwards, John&#x27;s coat (which Gemma sold on eBay) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John&#x27;s magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re-united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very shaky relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany&#x27;s crime-boss father Terry in order to &quot;punish&quot; John. When he confronted her about this relationship though, she told him that she would not stop unless he was able to retrieve her mother&#x27;s soul from Hell. John agreed. In order to get his sister to leave Hell, John agreed to track down her son, his adopted nephew, in Ireland.

On October 8, 2012, the series was announced as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, &quot;Constantine&quot;, started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who tell him that he will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John&#x27;s ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn&#x27;t going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn&#x27;t last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.

So John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the concoction that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him, but be consumed with guilt for killing him or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we&#x27;d previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called &quot;A Long Journey&#x27;s End&quot; surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic&#x27;s staff over the years.

===Other writers===
Guest writers were Grant Morrison (#25–26), Neil Gaiman (#27), John Smith (#51), Eddie Campbell (#85–88), Darko Macan (#144–145), and Jason Aaron (#245–246).

===&quot;Justice League Dark, Constantine&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In 2011, it was announced that a younger John Constantine would feature in &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, one of the new titles launched as part of September 2011&#x27;s DC Universe reboot. He was to be part of a team including Shade, The Changing Man, Deadman and Madame Xanadu, known as Justice League Dark. As part of the DC universe reboot in September 2011, Peter Milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of John Constantine as a prominent part of the team. Milligan wrote eight issues of &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, with writer Jeff Lemire taking over on issue nine.

On November 8, 2012, DC announced that &quot;Hellblazer&quot; would be cancelled following its 300th issue, and would be replaced by &quot;Constantine&quot; written by Jeff Lemire and Ray Fawkes for issues #1-3 and Ray Fawkes alone for issues #4-23, and drawn by Renato Guedes starring the younger New 52 John Constantine, rather than the version from Hellblazer, depicted as being in his late 50s. The &quot;Constantine&quot; series ended its run with its 23rd issue in May 2015. Nonetheless, the character would again star in another solo series entitled &quot;Constantine: The Hellblazer&quot;, co-written by Ming Doyle and James Tynion IV with art by Riley Rossmo, released on June 10, 2015. Writer Ming Doyle expressed excitement in her chance to write Constantine, stating that the reason of putting the term &quot;Hellblazer&quot; back to the character&#x27;s title was to &quot;take Constantine back to what he was at the start.&quot; On July 20, 2016, a new comic book entitled &quot;The Hellblazer: Rebirth&quot; was released as part of &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, a major relaunch in an effort to return famous DC stories from before the New 52 into the reboot. The plot concerns John Constantine finally returning to London after being cursed by a demon that forced him to leave the city. Former &quot;Hellblazer&quot; characters such as Chas Chandler and Mercury made appearances in the series, and the comic was written by Simon Oliver who previously wrote the spin-off series &quot;Hellblazer Presents: Chas - The Knowledge&quot;.

=== Relaunch (2019) ===

In July 2019, DC announced that &quot;Hellblazer&quot; would be relaunched as part of &quot;The Sandman Universe&quot; line of comics. The relaunched series, written by Simon Spurrier and illustrated by Aaron Campbell, begins after the events of the 1990 miniseries &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;. &quot;Hellblazer&quot; began with a one-shot on Halloween 2019, before becoming a regular series in November. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series ended after 12 issues. However, during New York Comic Con 2023, it was revealed that the series would be getting a revival miniseries called &quot;John Constantine, Hellblazer: Dead in America,&quot; with Spurrier and Campbell returning and publication beginning in January 2024. The series came to an end in December 2024. 

==Themes and style==
&quot;Hellblazer&quot; was first published during the early days of the Modern Age of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, and politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often place their era&#x27;s culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano would be the first to put his political views in the series, such as his negative views of Thatcher&#x27;s regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.

When Garth Ennis took over writing, he included his trademark representation of racism and religious fanaticism, as well his depictions of the Falklands War. The most controversial writer, Brian Azzarello, tackled issues such as neo-Nazism, prison rape and homosexuality. During Warren Ellis&#x27; run, he included American school shootings in a one-shot issue which led to a major controversy. In his run, Peter Milligan managed to put punk ideology in the series, with the protagonist trying to reacquire his former punk self, while also characterizing the Conservative government as a demon infestation with the punk subculture fighting against this supposed subversion and abuse. As such, much of Hellblazer&#x27;s horror often comes in the crisis and controversies of its time. Being set in the UK, many famous British personalities have appeared or made cameos such as Sid Vicious, Margaret Thatcher, Aleister Crowley and Alan Moore.

As stated by Warren Ellis, Hellblazer&#x27;s major themes were cynicism, nihilism and &quot;sudden violence&quot;, with the protagonist often narrating the story in dark proses with occasional breaking of the fourth wall. In many story arcs every victory Constantine makes has a negative side effect and often leads to tragedy. His friends, family, and others would be sacrificed or be caught in the crossfire, many of them are dead or have left him. John tries his best to make something good in his life, but most of it leading to failure.

==Reception==

Over the two decades that it had been published, &quot;Hellblazer&quot; had normally been quite well received. While not attaining the sales of &#x27;mainstream&#x27; comics, it had sustained healthy figures, consistently being one of the top selling Vertigo titles, and was sustained by healthy sales of trade paperbacks. Hillary Goldstein of IGN described it as, &quot;Sometimes surreal, often provocative and almost always entertaining, the adventures of the Hellblazer are among the best Vertigo has to offer.&quot; Well-known comic book writer Warren Ellis also praised the series as his favorite, calling it as &quot;among the very best horror works of the 1990s.&quot; Andre Borges from &quot;DNA India&quot; listed it in the &quot;15 Must Read Graphic Novels&quot;, describing it as &quot;one of the first of its kind&quot;, and that its &quot;writing and art work have been praised throughout its run.&quot; Robert Tutton of &quot;Paste&quot; listed the series at #4 in its &quot;13 Terrifying Modern Horror Comics&quot;, stating that &quot;Constantine’s most frightening encounters have hewn close enough to that kernel of truth to remind readers that real life can be as terrifying as any succubus or demon spawn.&quot;

Jamie Delano&#x27;s original run on the title is looked on fondly, with journalist Helen Braithwaite stating, &quot;His take on the character of John Constantine has never been equalled. Delano&#x27;s &quot;Original Sins&quot; graphic novel should be in every comic book fan&#x27;s collection.&quot; She added that, &quot;His writing evokes an incredible sense of dread and terror in a reader.&quot; IGN listed the title as one of the 25 Best Vertigo Books, calling John Constantine as &quot;one of Vertigo&#x27;s best characters.&quot;

Garth Ennis&#x27; run is also much loved, particularly &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot;, which was voted the best Garth Ennis story on Comic Book Resources, ahead of his work on &quot;Preacher&quot;, &quot;The Boys&quot; and &quot;The Punisher&quot;. In the same article Brian Cronin describes John&#x27;s one time love, Kit Ryan, as one of the series&#x27; most memorable characters. The popularity of Ennis and Dillon&#x27;s run on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; is also credited for Vertigo agreeing to publish their seminal series &quot;Preacher&quot;. Empire called &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot; storyline as &quot;rightly one of the most celebrated in comic book history.&quot; Glenn Fabry who was the cover artist during Ennis&#x27; run, won an Eisner Award for &quot;Best Cover Artist&quot; in 1995.

The creator of the protagonist, Alan Moore, praised Jamie Delano&#x27;s portrayal of the character, commenting &quot;[Delano] demonstrates brilliantly that English horror didn&#x27;t vanish with the fog and gas lit cobblestones at the end of the Victorian era.&quot; Moore also liked Brian Azzarello&#x27;s run on the series, commenting that Azzarello and Corben captured the character &quot;down, cold and to the life.&quot;

The character received positive critical reception while starring in the series. Empire ranked Constantine third in their 50 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time, while IGN ranked him #29 in their Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, and the character ranked #10 in Wizard Magazine&#x27;s Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time.

===Legacy===

The comic book&#x27;s initial cancellation, and the introduction of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception. &quot;I, Vampire&quot; writer Joshua Hale Fialkov expressed sadness he would never get to write &quot;the &#x27;real&#x27; John Constantine&quot;, noted crime author and former &quot;Hellblazer&quot; writer Ian Rankin stated that Constantine was the only comic book character he ever wanted to write for, and Alan Moore&#x27;s daughter, Leah Moore expressing doubt that &quot;Constantine&quot; could replace &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, among others. As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, &quot;Hellblazer&#x27;s had a long and incredibly successful run and that&#x27;s a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run.&quot; &quot;Comic Alliance&quot; described &quot;Hellblazer&#x27;s&quot; cancellation as marking &quot;the end of an era for Vertigo&quot; while adding it to be &quot;one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up.&quot;

&quot;Hellblazer&quot; boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form. Many modern examples of the genre such as &quot;Hellboy&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;Grimm&quot;, &quot;The Originals&quot;, and &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; have been influenced by it, and many imitators of both the series and its character flourished such as &quot;Criminal Macabre&quot;, &quot;Gravel&quot;, &quot;Planetary&quot;, and others. Its elements and style have been used countless of times in other works and many analogues of the cynical John Constantine have appeared.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

The first filmed adaptation of &quot;Hellblazer&quot; is one of the scenes in the documentary feature film &quot;The Mindscape of Alan Moore&quot;, which was shot in early 2002. The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and, in the film ending, experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts.

In 2005, &quot;Constantine&quot; was released, a feature film that did not use the same title as the comic book, in order to avoid confusion with the &quot;Hellraiser&quot; horror franchise. The only links to the character of John Constantine were the name and a plotline loosely based on the &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot; story arc (&quot;Hellblazer&quot; #41–46). DC Comics announced a sequel to the 2005 &quot;Constantine&quot; film was in the works, with producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura linked to the project. He stated: &quot;I&#x27;d love to do it... We want to do a hard, R-rated version of it. We&#x27;re going to scale back the size of the movie to try and persuade the studio to go ahead and make a tough version of it.&quot; In late 2012, director Guillermo del Toro discussed the notion of creating a film that would star John Constantine alongside other DC/Vertigo characters such as Zatanna, Swamp Thing, and more.

Constantine appears in the animated films &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; and &quot;Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&quot;, with Matt Ryan reprising his role from the Arrowverse.

===Television===

In January 2014 it was announced that David Goyer and Daniel Cerone were developing a TV series based on &quot;Hellblazer&quot; to air on NBC&quot;.&quot; Neil Marshall directed the pilot episode. The series follows Constantine in defending humanity against dark forces from beyond. On February, 21 it was announced that Welsh actor Matt Ryan was cast as the titular Constantine. The show ran for 13 episodes in Fall 2014, and on May 8, 2015, NBC cancelled &quot;Constantine&quot; midway through its first season.

Ryan reprised his role as John Constantine in the fourth season of The CW&#x27;s &quot;Arrow&quot; and in multiple episodes of the third season of &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. In March 2018 it was announced Ryan&#x27;s Constantine would join the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. An animated series featuring Ryan as the voice of John Constantine, &quot;,&quot; was announced in January 2017 and was released to The CW&#x27;s streaming platform in March 2018. The series was developed by Warner Bros. Animation and Blue Ribbon Content, with Greg Berlanti, Schechter and David S. Goyer (one of the creators of the live-action series) serving as executive producers, and Butch Lukic served as producer. J. M. DeMatteis wrote the series, and it was directed by Doug Murphy. Warner Bros Animation and Blue Ribbon Content Vice President Peter Girardi said the series aimed to be &quot;darker&quot; than the live-action series, and closer to the Hellblazer comics published by Vertigo.

Constantine appears in &quot;Justice League Action&quot;, voiced by Damian O&#x27;Hare

===Others===
THQ released a video game tie-in of the film &quot;Constantine&quot;. The song &quot;Stranger in the Mirror&quot; by Ookla the Mok is written from Constantine&#x27;s point of view, including a lyrical reference to &#x27;the Newcastle incident&#x27;. The song &quot;Venus of the Hardsell&quot;, which first appeared in &quot;Hellblazer Annual #1&quot; and written by Jamie Delano, was adapted by the rock group Spiderlegs.

Fantasy fiction author John Shirley is credited in writing three &quot;Hellblazer&quot; novels, including the novelisation of the &quot;Constantine&quot; film. The novel &quot;Hellblazer: War Lord&quot; features Constantine talking about &quot;another John Constantine in an alternate universe, [who] has black hair and lives most of his life in Los Angeles&quot; whilst giving a brief summary of the film&#x27;s plot.

<text>Granada plc (previously called Granada Ltd., Granada Group plc, and Granada Media plc) was a British conglomerate best known as the parent from 1954 to 2004 of the Manchester-based Granada Television.

The company agreed a corporate takeover of Carlton Communications in 2004 and Granada plc subsequently became ITV plc on 2 February 2004. It was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

== History ==
=== Media business ===

Granada has its origins in Sidney Bernstein&#x27;s Granada Theatres Ltd, a cinema company founded in Dover in 1930. The company was incorporated as Granada Ltd in 1934, with Granada Theatres Ltd turned into a subsidiary. Granada has been listed on the London Stock Exchange in one form or another since 1935. It was awarded the North of England ITV franchise in 1954, broadcasting as Granada Television. The company also established a chain of television rental shops from 1959 onwards, expanding in 1968 by purchasing Robinson Rentals for £8 million from David Robinson.

Granada entered the publishing business in the 1960s: it bought Mayflower Books from their founding U.S. publisher, Dell Publishing, and Panther Books (including Paladin Books, founded 1966 by Sonny Mehta) by 1968, which imprints continued to be run separately editorially, and added Rupert Hart-Davis and MacGibbon and Kee which it combined to form Hart-Davis, MacGibbon in 1972. Eventually the various publishing companies were combined as Granada Publishing. William Collins, Sons acquired Granada Publishing in 1983, renaming it Grafton Books after the editorial offices&#x27; address.

During the 1980s, Granada became involved in the British Satellite Broadcasting satellite television company. This went on air in March 1990, but merged with Sky Television in November 1990 to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB), in which Granada had a minority shareholding for some time. In 1991, Granada Theatres Ltd was sold to Bass. In 1994, Granada acquired London Weekend Television. Two years later, Granada, LWT and a British consortium of cable channels formed Granada Media Group plc, which a year later acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc. In 1997, Granada expanded onto the North American market by launching Granada Entertainment USA.

In March 1998, Granada announced their plans to launch a home video unit, eventually signing a five-year deal with Video Collection International to launch Granada Video in September.

Granada also bid together with Carlton Communications and BSkyB for one of the UK digital terrestrial television licences. They won the licence, though BSkyB was excluded from the company, ONdigital, on competition grounds. It went on air in 1998, was rebranded to ITV Digital in 2001, then entered voluntary liquidation before closing in 2002.

In 2000, Granada purchased United News &amp; Media&#x27;s television interests, namely Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television; Granada was forced to sell the HTV broadcasting business (to Carlton) for competition reasons, though it held onto HTV&#x27;s network production business. It also acquired Border Television in 2001, from Capital Radio plc.

=== Red Arrow (later Granada) TV Rental ===
Until 2000, there was a widespread high street chain called Granada TV Rental in the UK, Canada and in the US. The UK headquarters were originally in Manchester. The company started life as Red Arrow TV Rental, using a red version of Granada&#x27;s north-pointing arrow as its logo. This was a home entertainment equipment rental chain, similar to Radio Rentals and Rediffusion. The mainstay of the business from the late 1950s, and through the 1960s and 70s, was television set rental; during this period television receivers were expensive to purchase and were often unreliable.

In 1978, the company expanded its operations into the domestic videocassette recorder (VCR) rental market. This new household item was also a high-cost purchase: for example, a JVC HR-3300 VHS recorder cost £680 in 1978, . In the 1980s, the rental of satellite TV reception equipment became another opportunity for the company to supplement its declining income.

As electronic product prices fell and their reliability improved, consumer behaviour changed from renting to buying electrical goods. This drift away from rental eventually resulted in the decline of this chain and others. Granada purchased Telefusion (a Blackpool-based rental company) and DVR. It went on to merge with Robinson Rentals, moving the Granada base from Sharston Road, Manchester, to the Robinson building on Ampthill Road, Bedford. The two main players at this time were Granada TV Rental (GTVR) and Radio Rentals. Both were experiencing a decline in business and in 2000 they merged to form Boxclever.

Red Arrow was one of a number of experimental companies launched by Sidney and Alex Bernstein&#x27;s Granada Group and was, apart from Granada Cinemas and Granada Television, by far the most successful. Others included Green Arrow – artificial plant and flower leasing to companies – and Black Arrow – office furniture and equipment leasing. This company was disposed of and has no connection with any other venture of a similar name.

=== Catering business ===
Aside from media, Granada&#x27;s other main strength was in the catering business. It opened its first motorway service area in 1964, and established a chain of service areas across the British motorway network. Granada was the first British service station operator to move away from fancy dining and instead offer a basic but quicker service. Soon, all the other operators took on this idea. Granada&#x27;s hospitality arm was at its strongest in the 1990s under Gerry Robinson&#x27;s chairmanship of the group. At one time the company owned and operated 75% of the motorway service areas. It expanded into other areas of catering, including most notably the acquisition in 1996 of Forte Group. This included rival operator Welcome Break (later sold due to regulations), roadside chains Little Chef and Happy Eater, and Forte&#x27;s hotels (including Travelodge and Le Méridien).

In July 2000, Granada merged with Compass Group plc to form Granada Compass plc, as part of a strategy to separate Granada&#x27;s media and catering interests. The demerger took place in early 2001, with the media business becoming Granada Ltd. The motorway service stations were soon rebranded as Moto.

=== Other ventures ===
* In the 1960s, when bingo was at its most popular, Granada turned some of their cinema chains into bingo halls. This business was sold to Bass in 1991 and was rebranded as Gala Bingo.
* From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, Granada operated three theme parks:
** Camelot was purchased by Granada in 1986 along with Park Hall Leisure. The park near Charnock Richard, Lancashire, had a medieval theme and featured a jousting arena. It was sold by Granada in 1998 and closed in 2012.
** The American Adventure was opened by Granada in 1987 in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The site had been sold by Derbyshire County Council after a failed theme park called Britannia Park closed 10 weeks after opening. The park was successful for several years and was known for having the tallest log flume in the United Kingdom. Granada sold the park in 1997 after its business started to decline; it eventually closed at the end of 2006.
** The Granada Studios Tour was opened in 1988. It was a Granada Television themed park that featured sets, props and techniques used by the company. In 1997 the park gained Skytrak Total, the world&#x27;s first flying roller coaster. The park closed to the public in 1999 and fully in 2001, during the company&#x27;s difficulties with ITV Digital.
* From 1988, Granada opened and operated a chain of bowling alleys under the name GX Superbowl. In 1995, the chain was sold to Allied Leisure.
* Granada purchased the Madison chain of nightclubs from Taz Leisure Group in 1989.
* In 1983, Granada Microcomputer Services were set up to supply computer hardware to businesses. These services were originally marketed as shops but later became &quot;business centres&quot;. This business was sold in 1987.
* Granada expanded into book publishing in 1961, but sold the business in 1983. They also owned publishers Leckie and Leckie.

== Merger with Carlton ==
In 2002 speculation began to centre on when, not if, Carlton and Granada would merge. In 2003 a merger was agreed between the two companies, with Granada shareholders owning two-thirds of the new company. That the new company was in effect a takeover by Granada of Carlton was admitted in the first annual report of the new company, ITV plc, which treated the company as effectively a continuation of Granada plc (with the Carlton merger regarded as an acquisition) for accounting purposes.

The Granada name continues on as the official name of the North West ITV region and its on air regional news programme Granada Reports and was used to brand productions of ITV plc companies on channels other than ITV branded channels in the United Kingdom until it was replaced by the ITV Studios brand in 2009.

== Operations ==
At the time of the merger with Carlton Communications, Granada was mainly involved in the television business. It owned seven ITV companies – Granada Television, London Weekend Television, Yorkshire Television, Tyne Tees Television, Meridian Broadcasting, Anglia Television and Border Television. It also owned the ITV Digital Channels Ltd pay-TV business, which at the time offered two channels, Men and Motors and Granada Plus. ITV plc has since taken full control of GSB and closed down archive channel Plus in favour of ITV3. Granada also owned 50% shares in ITV2 and the ITV News Channel, and a 20% share of Independent Television News. It also owned 45% of TV3, Ireland.

Charles Allen was chief executive of Granada until 2 February 2004, when he became chief executive of the newly created ITV plc, a post he retained until 1 October 2006.

<text>The Greens () is a minor political party in Israel that emphasizes environment protection and quality of life. It was founded and formerly headed by Pe&#x27;er Visner. Although the party was never represented in the Knesset, it holds seats in many municipalities across Israel.

==History==
The Greens were established in 1997. In the 1999 Knesset elections the party received 0.4% of the vote, failing to win a seat. They received the same share of the vote in the 2003 elections.

In the 2006 elections, the party received 47,595 votes (1.52%). However, it was not enough to pass the 2% threshold, and they were ultimately the largest party not to obtain seats in the Knesset (Balad, with 72,066 votes, was the smallest party to obtain seats). Had the electoral threshold not been raised from 1.5% in 2003, they would have won seats.

Substantial gains in the 2008 municipal elections saw the Greens win over 50 seats across 22 municipalities. In Haifa, where former Green candidate Yona Yahav was re-elected for a second mayoral term, the Greens won four seats, while in Tel Aviv, where Green Party chair Pe&#x27;er Visner was deputy mayor, the Greens won three seats.

The Greens campaigned intensively for the 2009 Knesset elections. Some polls by a number of national newspapers had predicted that the party could win around 2–3 seats, putting Greens in the Knesset for the first time. However, a rival green party, the Green Movement was established in 2008, running in alliance with Meimad. The Greens received only 0.4% of the vote, again failing to pass the electoral threshold, whilst the Green Movement and Meimad received 0.8% of the vote.

In the 2013 elections the party&#x27;s vote share dropped to 0.2%, and again to 0.07% in the 2015 elections.

<doc id="182890" wikidata="Q192826" url="?curid=182890" title="Kronecker delta">
<text>In mathematics, the Kronecker delta (named after Leopold Kronecker) is a function of two variables, usually just non-negative integers. The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise:
formula_1
or with use of Iverson brackets:
formula_2
For example, formula_3 because formula_4, whereas formula_5 because formula_6.

The Kronecker delta appears naturally in many areas of mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science, as a means of compactly expressing its definition above.

In linear algebra, the formula_7 identity matrix formula_8 has entries equal to the Kronecker delta:
formula_9
where formula_10 and formula_11 take the values formula_12, and the inner product of vectors can be written as
formula_13
Here the Euclidean vectors are defined as -tuples: formula_14 and formula_15 and the last step is obtained by using the values of the Kronecker delta to reduce the summation over formula_11.

It is common for and to be restricted to a set of the form or , but the Kronecker delta can be defined on an arbitrary set.

== Properties ==
The following equations are satisfied:
formula_17
Therefore, the matrix can be considered as an identity matrix.

Another useful representation is the following form:
formula_18
This can be derived using the formula for the geometric series.

==Alternative notation==
Using the Iverson bracket: formula_19

Often, a single-argument notation formula_20 is used, which is equivalent to setting formula_21:
formula_22

In linear algebra, it can be thought of as a tensor, and is written formula_23. Sometimes the Kronecker delta is called the substitution tensor.

==Digital signal processing==
In the study of digital signal processing (DSP), the unit sample function formula_24 represents a special case of a 2-dimensional Kronecker delta function formula_25 where the Kronecker indices include the number zero, and where one of the indices is zero. In this case:
formula_26

Or more generally where:
formula_27

However, this is only a special case. In tensor calculus, it is more common to number basis vectors in a particular dimension starting with index 1, rather than index 0. In this case, the relation formula_28 does not exist, and in fact, the Kronecker delta function and the unit sample function are different functions that overlap in the specific case where the indices include the number 0, the number of indices is 2, and one of the indices has the value of zero.

While the discrete unit sample function and the Kronecker delta function use the same letter, they differ in the following ways. For the discrete unit sample function, it is more conventional to place a single integer index in square braces; in contrast the Kronecker delta can have any number of indexes. Further, the purpose of the discrete unit sample function is different from the Kronecker delta function. In DSP, the discrete unit sample function is typically used as an input function to a discrete system for discovering the system function of the system which will be produced as an output of the system. In contrast, the typical purpose of the Kronecker delta function is for filtering terms from an Einstein summation convention.

The discrete unit sample function is more simply defined as:
formula_29

In addition, the Dirac delta function is often confused for both the Kronecker delta function and the unit sample function. The Dirac delta is defined as:
formula_30

Unlike the Kronecker delta function formula_25 and the unit sample function formula_24, the Dirac delta function formula_33 does not have an integer index, it has a single continuous non-integer value .

To confuse matters more, the unit impulse function is sometimes used to refer to either the Dirac delta function formula_33, or the unit sample function formula_24.

==Notable properties ==

The Kronecker delta has the so-called &quot;sifting&quot; property that for formula_36:
formula_37
and if the integers are viewed as a measure space, endowed with the counting measure, then this property coincides with the defining property of the Dirac delta function
formula_38
and in fact Dirac&#x27;s delta was named after the Kronecker delta because of this analogous property. In signal processing it is usually the context (discrete or continuous time) that distinguishes the Kronecker and Dirac &quot;functions&quot;. And by convention, formula_33 generally indicates continuous time (Dirac), whereas arguments like formula_10, formula_11, formula_42, formula_43, formula_44, and formula_45 are usually reserved for discrete time (Kronecker). Another common practice is to represent discrete sequences with square brackets; thus: formula_24. The Kronecker delta is not the result of directly sampling the Dirac delta function.

The Kronecker delta forms the multiplicative identity element of an incidence algebra.

==Relationship to the Dirac delta function==
In probability theory and statistics, the Kronecker delta and Dirac delta function can both be used to represent a discrete distribution. If the support of a distribution consists of points formula_47, with corresponding probabilities formula_48, then the probability mass function formula_49 of the distribution over formula_50 can be written, using the Kronecker delta, as
formula_51

Equivalently, the probability density function formula_52 of the distribution can be written using the Dirac delta function as
formula_53

Under certain conditions, the Kronecker delta can arise from sampling a Dirac delta function. For example, if a Dirac delta impulse occurs exactly at a sampling point and is ideally lowpass-filtered (with cutoff at the critical frequency) per the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, the resulting discrete-time signal will be a Kronecker delta function.

==Generalizations==
If it is considered as a type formula_54 tensor, the Kronecker tensor can be written formula_55 with a covariant index formula_11 and contravariant index formula_10:
formula_58

This tensor represents:
* The identity mapping (or identity matrix), considered as a linear mapping formula_59 or formula_60
* The trace or tensor contraction, considered as a mapping formula_61
* The map formula_62, representing scalar multiplication as a sum of outer products.

The or multi-index Kronecker delta of order formula_63 is a type formula_64 tensor that is completely antisymmetric in its formula_65 upper indices, and also in its formula_65 lower indices.

Two definitions that differ by a factor of formula_67 are in use. Below, the version is presented has nonzero components scaled to be formula_68. The second version has nonzero components that are formula_69, with consequent changes scaling factors in formulae, such as the scaling factors of formula_70 in &quot;&quot; below disappearing.

=== Definitions of the generalized Kronecker delta ===
In terms of the indices, the generalized Kronecker delta is defined as:
formula_71

Let formula_72 be the symmetric group of degree formula_65, then:
formula_74

Using anti-symmetrization:
formula_75

In terms of a formula_76 determinant:
formula_77

Using the Laplace expansion (Laplace&#x27;s formula) of determinant, it may be defined recursively:
formula_78
where the caron, formula_79, indicates an index that is omitted from the sequence.

When formula_80 (the dimension of the vector space), in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol:
formula_81
More generally, for formula_82, using the Einstein summation convention:
formula_83

=== Contractions of the generalized Kronecker delta ===
Kronecker Delta contractions depend on the dimension of the space. For example,
formula_84
where is the dimension of the space. From this relation the full contracted delta is obtained as
formula_85
The generalization of the preceding formulas is
formula_86

=== Properties of the generalized Kronecker delta ===
The generalized Kronecker delta may be used for anti-symmetrization:
formula_87

From the above equations and the properties of anti-symmetric tensors, we can derive the properties of the generalized Kronecker delta:
formula_88
which are the generalized version of formulae written in &quot;&quot;. The last formula is equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula.

Reducing the order via summation of the indices may be expressed by the identity
formula_89

Using both the summation rule for the case formula_80 and the relation with the Levi-Civita symbol, the summation rule of the Levi-Civita symbol is derived:
formula_91
The 4D version of the last relation appears in Penrose&#x27;s spinor approach to general relativity that he later generalized, while he was developing Aitken&#x27;s diagrams, to become part of the technique of Penrose graphical notation. Also, this relation is extensively used in S-duality theories, especially when written in the language of differential forms and Hodge duals.

==Integral representations==
For any integers formula_11 and formula_42, the Kronecker delta can be written as a complex contour integral using a standard residue calculation. The integral is taken over the unit circle in the complex plane, oriented counterclockwise. An equivalent representation of the integral arises by parameterizing the contour by an angle around the origin.
formula_94

==The Kronecker comb==
The Kronecker comb function with period formula_95 is defined (using DSP notation) as:
formula_96
where formula_97 and formula_45 are integers. The Kronecker comb thus consists of an infinite series of unit impulses that are units apart, aligned so one of the impulses occurs at zero. It may be considered to be the discrete analog of the Dirac comb.

<doc id="182894" wikidata="Q1428856" url="?curid=182894" title="Philosemitism">
<text>Philosemitism, also called Judeophilia, is &quot;defense, love, or admiration of Jews and Judaism&quot;. Such attitudes can be found in Western cultures across the centuries. The term originated in the nineteenth century by self-described German antisemites to describe their non-Jewish opponents. American-Jewish historian Daniel Cohen of the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies has asserted that philosemitism &quot;can indeed easily recycle antisemitic themes, recreate Jewish otherness, or strategically compensate for Holocaust guilt.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The controversial term &quot;philosemitism&quot; arose as a pejorative in Germany to describe the positive prejudice towards Jews; in other words, a philosemite is a &quot;Jew-lover&quot; or &quot;Jew-friend&quot;.

==Concept==
The concept of philosemitism is not new, and it was arguably avowed by such thinkers as the 19th-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who described himself as an &quot;anti-anti-Semite.&quot;

Philosemitism is an expression of the larger phenomenon of allophilia, admiration for foreign cultures as embodied in the more widely known Anglophilia and Francophilia. The rise of philosemitism has also prompted some to reconsider Jewish history, and they argue that while antisemitism must be acknowledged, it is wrong to reduce the history of the Jewish people to one merely of suffering (as has been fostered by well-meaning gentile philosemites).

=== Religious philosemitism ===
Christian philosemitism, which has been associated with dispensational theology and Puritanism, promotes a positive view of the Jewish people for religious reasons (in contrast to Christian antisemitism). Christian philosemitism generally arises from a premillennial and an Israel-centered understanding of biblical prophecy, causing the belief that God still sees the Jews as his chosen people.

== Prevalence ==

=== In Europe ===

====Germany====
Iris Dekel writes that in twenty-first-century Germany, philosemitism &quot;is performed in three interconnected social domains: institutional, where state institutions declare their commitment to protecting Jews as a religious minority; group, where the contingent relations between love for the Jews and exclusionary statements about them appears, mostly in casting Jews as both strange and unknown and embraced; and individual, where individuals exhibit positive sentiments toward Jews as an ideal collective&quot;.

==== Poland ====

While Jews had lived in Poland since before his reign, King Casimir III the Great allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers and protected them as &quot;people of the king&quot;. About 70 percent of the world&#x27;s European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland due to Casimir&#x27;s reforms. Casimir&#x27;s legendary Jewish mistress Esterka remains unconfirmed by direct historical evidence, but belief in her and her legacy is widespread and prolific. South of the Old Town of Kraków King Casimir established the independent royal city of Kazimierz, which for many centuries was a place where ethnic Polish and Jewish cultures coexisted and intermingled.

==== Czechoslovakia ====
The case of the myths created around the supposed special relationship between Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the founding father of Czechoslovakia, and influential Jews from the U.S. or elsewhere, myths created by Masaryk and adopted in amended forms by Czechoslovak Jews, let cultural historian Martin Wein quote Zygmunt Bauman&#x27;s and Artur Sandauer&#x27;s concept of an &quot;allosemitic&quot; worldview, in which, in Wein&#x27;s words, &quot;antisemitism and philosemitism overlap and share stereotypes, producing exaggerated disregard &quot;or&quot; admiration for Jews or Judaism.&quot; In this sense, Wein quotes Masaryk&#x27;s statements about a decisive Jewish influence over the press, and him mentioning Jews and freemasons in the same breath, when it came to lobbies he allegedly managed to win over.

=== In the Americas ===

==== United States ====
Mark Twain&#x27;s essay &quot;Concerning the Jews&quot; has been described as philosemitic. Israeli scholar Bennet Kravitz states that one could just as easily hate Jews for the reasons Twain gives for admiring them. In fact, Twain&#x27;s essay was cited by Nazi sympathizers in the 1930s. Kravitz concludes, &quot;The flawed logic of &#x27;Concerning the Jews&#x27; and all philo-Semitism leads to the anti-Semitic beliefs that the latter seeks to deflate&quot;. Philosemitic ideas have also been promoted by some American Evangelicals due to the influence of Dispensationalism.

==== Brazil ====
A current of Jewish studies in Brazil has dedicated itself to studying the extent to which far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s professed philo-Semitism reproduces traces of anti-Semitism. This perspective, based on a study of the speeches of Bolsonaro and his mentor, the writer Olavo de Carvalho, suggests that the proclaimed sympathy of far-right sectors for the State of Israel and the Jews, often presented without distinction, reverberates anti-Semitic tropes in two ways. Firstly, by portraying Jews as a wealthy and powerful group. In this context, Jews are often depicted as pillars of capitalism, and therefore inherently hostile to the left. The second and most significant expression of antisemitism in the far right&#x27;s sympathy for Judaism would be inspired by authors such as Rabbi Marvin Stuart Antelman, and reaffirms conspiracy theories presenting left-wing Jews as a group seeking world domination, but which would ultimately undermine the Jewish nation itself. In this context, researchers demonstrate how the philo-Semitism of the Brazilian extreme right has been employed to divide the Jewish community. The designation of true Jews is thus reserved for those who espouse conservative or reactionary policies, while left-wing Jews are regarded as apostates or traitors.

=== In Asia ===

==== East Asia ====
Very few Jews live in East Asian countries, but Jews are viewed in an especially positive light in some of them, partly owing to their shared wartime experiences during the Second World War. Examples include South Korea, Japan, and China. In general, Jews are stereotyped with characteristics that in South Korean culture are considered positive: intelligence, business-savviness and commitment to family values and responsibility, while in the Western world, the first of the two aforementioned stereotypes more often have the negatively interpreted equivalents of guile and greed. The South Korean ambassador to Israel, Ma Young-sam said that, in South Korean primary schools, the Talmud should be mandatory reading. According to Mary J. Ainslie, philosemitism in China is &quot;part of a civilizationist narrative designed to position China as globally central and superior&quot;.

<doc id="182895" wikidata="Q1381587" url="?curid=182895" title="Eve 6">
<text>Eve 6, stylized as EVE 6 or EVƎ 6, is an American rock band formed in 1995 in Southern California, best known for its hit singles &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night&quot;. It disbanded in 2004, returned for numerous tours in 2007 with a new lineup, and finally reunited with all three original members in early 2011. It signed to Fearless Records in the spring of that year, and released its fourth album, &quot;Speak in Code,&quot; containing the singles &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Curtain&quot;, in April 2012. In 2021, it released a new EP, &quot;Grim Value&quot;, and in 2022, a full-length album, &quot;Hyper Relevisation&quot;, on Velocity Records. In 2024, the band self-released their sixth album titled &quot;Dream Fist.&quot;

== History ==
=== Formation (1995–2004) ===

The band originally consisted of Max Collins (bass, lead vocals), Jon Siebels (guitar, backing vocals), and Nick Meyers (drums). The band formed in 1995 in La Crescenta, California first as Yakoo, then Eleventeen; the name Eve 6 was only adopted later. Their first gig was at Eagle&#x27;s Coffee Pub in North Hollywood, Los Angeles. Eleventeen had secured a recording contract with RCA while the band&#x27;s members were still in high school and being managed by Jake Knight. After recording the unreleased &quot;Eleventeen&quot; EP, Meyers left the band, and was replaced by Tony Fagenson.

The band&#x27;s final name is a reference to &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Fagenson, a fan of the show, suggested the name after seeing an episode titled &quot;Eve,&quot; which included a character who went by the name of &quot;Eve 6.&quot;

The band issued the self-titled &quot;Eve 6&quot; in 1998, attaining platinum success with hit singles &quot;Inside Out&quot; and &quot;Leech,&quot; the former capturing the No. 1 spot on the Modern Rock charts, spending several weeks on the top ten list on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live,&quot; and crossing over successfully to pop/Top 40 radio. The album also includes &quot;Tongue Tied&quot; which was used as a soundtrack for the racing game &quot;Test Drive 6&quot;. More widespread recognition came with gold-selling sophomore effort &quot;Horrorscope&quot; (2000), which spawned &quot;Promise,&quot; &quot;On the Roof Again,&quot; and the Top 40 hit &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Night.&quot;

The band made appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&quot; &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman,&quot; &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!,&quot; &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; and &quot;TRL&quot; with Carson Daly, with their videos in constant rotation on MTV, most notably &quot;Here&#x27;s To The Night&quot; which sat near the top of MTV&#x27;s &quot;TRL&quot; countdown for much of the summer of 2001. The band then released the more experimental &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head&quot; in 2003, featuring top 10 Modern Rock hit &quot;Think Twice,&quot; but parted ways with RCA thereafter. Their rapid rise to prominence at an early age had led to mental and physical exhaustion, and in 2004 Eve 6 announced an indefinite hiatus.

&quot;There were parts which were fucking incredible, and amazing and awesome, and there were aspects that were terrifying and freaky that you don&#x27;t know how to handle. I feel like we did some growing up in public,&quot; says Collins. &quot;I needed to stop drinking. In order to do that, the wheels had to come off. I don&#x27;t think I could have done it if the band was still going.&quot;

=== Breakup (2004–2007) ===
Relatively poor sales of &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head&quot; resulted in Eve 6&#x27;s release from their contract with RCA. Announcing their breakup, Eve 6 played their final show together on July 15, 2004, under the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Collins had a short-lived project called Brotherhood of Lost Dogs, before Collins and Fagenson reunited to form a new band called The Sugi Tap. They recorded some demos and played shows throughout the California region during 2006. Collins and Fagenson also began writing and producing for other artists, including Puddle of Mudd&#x27;s &quot;We Don&#x27;t Have to Look Back Now&quot;. &quot;It was an inspiring time, going down different musical avenues together and trying things we wouldn&#x27;t have in Eve 6,&quot; reflects Fagenson. &quot;Ironically, when we did reform Eve 6 a couple years later, those experiments allowed us to progress the sound of the band more freely than if we had been in the band the whole time.&quot;

=== Reunion (2007–2012) ===
On October 1, 2007, after performing for over a year as The Sugi Tap, it was leaked that a newly reunited Eve 6 including Collins, Fagenson, and new guitarist Matt Bair would be going on tour. The Sugi Tap, as a result, was put on indefinite hiatus.

Collins and Fagenson played extensively as Eve 6 starting in 2008, with Bair temporarily replacing Siebels who was occupied with his project Monsters Are Waiting. The band spent the next three years touring, writing, and reconnecting with fans before signing with Fearless Records in 2011. A month within inking the deal, Collins and Fagenson finally convinced Siebels to return to the band. &quot;After going down some different paths it hit me that there was this thing out there that people wanted and wanted to hear,&quot; explains Siebels. &quot;It just clicked and made sense to me. After such a long break I was so happy to be playing with these guys again.&quot; Fagenson continues, &quot;The way [Siebels] hits the strings and puts that muscle into the chords is very distinctive to our band, and that was a welcome piece of the sound that we had missed. Songs that had been kicking around for a couple years got new life with his playing put into them.&quot;

Eve 6 then re-enlisted Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Dashboard Confessional, Good Charlotte)—who produced the first two Eve 6 albums—to helm the sessions for &quot;Speak in Code&quot;. The album contains a mix of compositions that began as far back as the side project, as well as recent works written in the months leading up to the recording process. &quot;We were really taking a &#x27;best of everything&#x27; sort of approach, almost like a band&#x27;s first album, in which there&#x27;s a lot of material to choose from,&quot; Fagenson notes. &quot;About half the songs were standouts from what Max and I had been working on and demoing over the years, and the other half were newer ideas that came with the inspiration of Jon&#x27;s return and all that was happening to us at the time. We have a unique process, where each song is sort of its own animal. Don was crucial in helping us tighten everything up, and inspiring Max to dig really deep lyrically and get to some root emotion down there.&quot; Collins explains, &quot;Neil Finn [of Crowded House] once said, &#x27;A great producer is someone whom you admire musically and otherwise, who you feel compelled to show up and show off for.&#x27; I feel like Don is that figure for me and the band.&quot;

=== &quot;Speak in Code&quot; (2012–2020) ===
Eve 6 released &quot;Speak in Code&quot; on April 24, 2012, their fourth full-length release. It contains the singles &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Curtain&quot;, the former receiving substantial airplay on the Modern Rock format in 2012. Music videos were made for both singles and were released on digital outlets such as Vevo and Music Choice. The band toured throughout much of 2012 in support of &quot;Speak in Code&quot;, including stints with The All-American Rejects and Everclear, and a headlining tour throughout the U.S. The song &quot;Lost &amp; Found&quot; was released as an advance single three months prior to the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Overall I&#x27;m really proud of it, and I think we&#x27;re doing right by our fans, who&#x27;ve waited a long time for us to make another record. I think we&#x27;re giving them something they&#x27;ll enjoy,&quot; says singer/bassist Max Collins. &quot;Once we got in the studio there was a lot of energy. There aren&#x27;t any filler moments; each song has its purpose. This is the strongest collection of songs we&#x27;ve ever had on one record.&quot;

&quot;In some of the songs frustration is a theme. I was sort of looking at difficult personal relationships with a humorous spin in some places, and with more earnestness in others,&quot; explains Collins. &quot;The title &quot;Speak in Code&quot; is a lyric from &#x27;Curtain,&#x27; and there was something kind of evocative about it. In that song, I&#x27;m referring to being newly sober and just feeling like an open nerve, feeling freaked out, having people and life being sort of overwhelming. It&#x27;s almost like people are speaking a language you don&#x27;t understand.&quot;

The band announced that they would release &quot;Eve 6&quot; on vinyl on December 9.

On April 7, 2018, drummer Tony Fagenson announced his departure from the group. The band then announced new drummer Ben Hilzinger, formerly of Beautiful Ben and the Unmistakable Stems, on Instagram. He is also the drummer of Fitness, which features Max Collins, as well as Kenny Carkeet (formerly of AWOLNATION).

=== &quot;Grim Value&quot;, &quot;Hyper Relevisation&quot; and &quot;Dream Fist&quot; (2021–present) ===
On February 4, 2021, the band released a music video for their new song &quot;Black Nova,&quot; the announcement came with a release of their new EP titled &quot;Grim Value&quot; and release date of June 25, 2021, through Velocity Records. The band released &quot;You Were Right&quot; a collaboration with Bass Drum of Death on February 19, 2021. In April, the band streamed a live concert that debuted the new song called &quot;Can We Combine&quot;, releasing a music video for that song the next day. Another music video for the new EP was released in August for the song &quot;I Wanna Bite Your Face.&quot; A cover and music video of Operation Ivy&#x27;s &quot;Sound System&quot; featured a collaboration by Eve 6 and We Are The Union was premiered on October 7 at Riot Fest. &quot;Good For You (Better Version)&quot; was posted on Facebook by the band on October 23. The new single &quot;Androgyne Friend&quot; premiered on December 5, and in an interview with &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;, Collins shared that they would release a new song &quot;on the eve of the 6th of every month, leading up to the release of the rock trio’s self-produced fifth studio album, &quot;Hyper Relevisation&quot; [Velocity Records], late next year.&quot; The latest single &quot;Get You&quot; was released on January 5, 2022.

In early February 2022, Eve 6 joined in Neil Young&#x27;s protest of streaming service Spotify. Collins told &quot;Fortune&quot;, “We&#x27;re grateful that Neil Young was able to cause this critical mass and get all of this attention on Spotify. That’s making our boycott effort possible ... It&#x27;s making people more receptive to our message, but at the same time it obscures the more interesting and devastating story, which is Spotify’s predatory business practices.” In protest of various Spotify business decisions, including the amount of money paid to artists per stream, the band changed their Spotify banner image in February 2022 to read &quot;DELETE SPOTIFY&quot; on a bright green background. In continuing their protest of Spotify, the band tweeted that their new song, &quot;Revolushow&quot;, a protest song, was &quot;available on Tidal and literally everywhere except Spotify and Amazon&quot;.

On February 9, they announced the Extreme Wealth Tour with We Are the Union, Field Medic, and comedian Jake Flores.

On August 10 the band announced their fifth album, &quot;Hyper Relevisation&quot;, would be released on September 23, 2022. In addition to the announcement, the album cover, the 10-song track-list and the song &quot;Mr. Darkside&quot; was also released. Pre-orders for the album were made available through the band&#x27;s label.

Beginning in 2023, the band set up a Patreon account to release their new music, cover songs and essays. On September 24, 2024 the band announced their sixth studio album titled &quot;Dream Fist&quot;, which was released on October 4, 2024.

== Twitter account ==
In December 2020, multiple media outlets took note of the fact that Max Collins had become a prolific poster to Eve 6&#x27;s official Twitter account, which was &quot;quickly becoming a trove of internet comedy,&quot; including queries to various public figures asking if they &quot;like the heart in a blender song,&quot; &quot;choice tidbits ... about his fellow washed stars,&quot; and &quot;generic observations about wallet chains, weight gain, and merch with palm trees on it, as well as a running bit about not knowing the difference between Vertical Horizon, Dishwalla, Matchbox 20, et al.&quot; Loudwire crowned Collins the &quot;new king of Twitter&quot; and &quot;the anti-Trapt of Twitter,&quot; the latter contrasting Collins&#x27; celebrated social media posts with those of Trapt lead singer Chris Taylor Brown.

<doc id="182896" wikidata="Q941276" url="?curid=182896" title="Warwick Castle">
<text>Warwick Castle is a medieval castle developed from a wooden fort, originally built by William the Conqueror during 1068. Warwick is the county town of Warwickshire, England, situated on a meander of the River Avon. The original wooden motte-and-bailey castle was rebuilt in stone during the 12th century. During the Hundred Years War, the facade opposite the town was refortified, resulting in one of the most recognisable examples of 14th-century military architecture. It was used as a stronghold until the early 17th century, when it was granted to Sir Fulke Greville by James I in 1604. Greville converted it to a country house, and it was owned by the Greville family (who became Earls of Warwick in 1759) until 1978, when it was bought by the Tussauds Group.

In 2007, the Tussauds Group was purchased by the Blackstone Group, which merged it with Merlin Entertainments. Warwick Castle was then sold to Nick Leslau&#x27;s investment firm, Prestbury Group, under a sale and leaseback agreement. Merlin continues to operate the site under a renewable 35-year lease.

==Location==
Warwick Castle is situated in the town of Warwick, on a sandstone bluff at a bend of the River Avon. The river, which runs below the castle on the east side, has eroded the rock the castle stands on, forming a cliff. The river and cliff form natural defences. 

When construction began in 1068, four houses belonging to the Abbot of Coventry were demolished to provide space. The castle&#x27;s position made it strategically important in safeguarding the Midlands against rebellion.

During the 12th century, King Henry I was suspicious of Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick. To counter the earl&#x27;s influence, Henry bestowed Geoffrey de Clinton with a position of power rivalling that of the earl.

The lands he was given included Kenilworth – a castle of comparable size, cost, and importance, founded by Clinton – which is about to the north. 

Warwick Castle is about from Warwick railway station and less than from junction 15 of the M40 motorway; it is also relatively close to Birmingham Airport.

==History==

===Antecedent===
An Anglo-Saxon burh was established on the site in 914; with fortifications instigated by Æthelflæd, daughter of Alfred the Great. The burh she established was one of ten which defended Mercia against the invading Danes. Its position allowed it to dominate the Fosse Way, as well as the river valley and the crossing over the River Avon. Though the motte to the south-west of the present castle is now called &quot;Ethelfleda&#x27;s Mound&quot; (&#x27;Ethelfleda&#x27; being an alternative form of Æthelflæd), it is in fact part of the later Norman fortifications, and not of Anglo-Saxon origin.

It was also at this time, that what is now Warwick School was founded in the castle - making it arguably the oldest boys&#x27; school in the country. It still resides just over the River Avon, visible from all of the castle&#x27;s towers.

===Middle Ages===

After the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror established a motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 to maintain control of the Midlands as he advanced northwards. Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11 urban castles in the 1086 survey, four houses were torn down to make way for the castle. A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound – on which usually stands a keep or tower – and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William II appointed Henry de Beaumont, the son of a powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle. In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick. He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127–28.

In 1153, Gundreda de Warenne was tricked into believing that her husband, Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick, was dead; she then surrendered control of the castle to the invading army of Henry of Anjou, later King Henry II of England. According to the &quot;Gesta Regis Stephani&quot;, a 12th-century historical text, Roger de Beaumont died upon hearing the news that his wife had handed over the castle. King Henry II later returned the castle to the Earls of Warwick, as they had been supporters of his mother, Empress Matilda, in The Anarchy of 1135–1154.
During the reign of King Henry II (1154–89), the motte-and-bailey was replaced with a stone keep castle. This new phase took the form of a shell keep with all the buildings constructed against the curtain wall. During the Barons&#x27; Rebellion of 1173–74, the Earl of Warwick remained loyal to King Henry II, and the castle was used to store provisions. The castle and the lands associated with the earldom passed down to the Beaumont family until 1242. When Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick, died, the castle and lands passed to his sister, Margaret de Beaumont, 7th Countess of Warwick in her own right. Her first husband, John Marshal, died soon after, and while she looked for a suitable husband, the castle was in the ownership of King Henry III of England. When she married John du Plessis in December 1242, the castle was returned to her. During the Second Barons&#x27; War of 1264–67, William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick, was a supporter of King Henry III. The castle was taken in a surprise attack by the forces of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, from Kenilworth Castle in 1264. According to 15th-century chronicler John Rous, the walls along the northeastern side of Warwick Castle were slighted, so &quot;that it should be no strength to the king&quot;. Maudit and his countess were taken to Kenilworth Castle and were held there until a ransom was paid. After the death of William Maudit in 1267, the title and castle passed to his nephew, William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Following William&#x27;s death, Warwick Castle passed through seven generations of the Beauchamp family, who, over the next 180 years, were responsible for most of the additions made to the castle. In 1312, Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall, was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, and imprisoned in Warwick Castle, until his execution on 9 June 1312. A group of magnates led by the Earl of Warwick and Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, accused Gaveston of stealing the royal treasure.

Under Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl, the castle defences were significantly enhanced in 1330–60 on the north eastern side by the addition of a gatehouse, a barbican (a form of fortified gateway), and a tower on either side of the reconstructed wall, named Caesar&#x27;s Tower and Guy&#x27;s Tower. The Watergate Tower also dates from this period.
Caesar&#x27;s and Guy&#x27;s Towers are residential and may have been inspired by French models (for example Bricquebec). Both towers are machicolated and Caesar&#x27;s Tower features a unique double parapet. The two towers are also vaulted in stone on every storey. Caesar&#x27;s Tower contained a grim basement dungeon; according to local legend dating back to at least 1644 it is also known as Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features murder holes, two drawbridges, a gate, and portcullises – gates made from wood or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.

The facade overlooking the river was designed as a symbol of the power and wealth of the Beauchamp earls and would have been &quot;of minimal defensive value&quot;; this followed a trend of 14th-century castles being more statements of power than designed exclusively for military use.

===15th and 16th centuries===

The line of the Beauchamp Earls ended in 1449 when Anne de Beauchamp, 15th Countess of Warwick, died. Richard Neville, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, became the next Earl of Warwick through his wife&#x27;s inheritance of the title. During the summer of 1469, Neville rebelled against King Edward IV of England and imprisoned him in Warwick Castle. Neville attempted to rule in the King&#x27;s name; however, constant protests by the King&#x27;s supporters forced the Earl to release the King. Neville was subsequently killed in the Battle of Barnet, fighting against the King in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. 

Warwick Castle then passed from Neville to his son-in-law, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence (brother of King Edward IV). George Plantagenet was executed in 1478, and his lands passed onto his son, Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick; however, Edward Plantagenet was only two when his father died, so his lands were taken in the custody of The Crown. He was placed under attainder, and so could not inherit the throne, by King Henry VII of England, being held by the King for fourteen years in the Tower of London until he was executed for high treason in 1499, supposedly for conspiring to escape with the &#x27;pretender&#x27; Perkin Warbeck. Edward was the last Earl of Warwick of the title&#x27;s first creation.

In the early 1480s, King Richard III of England (the other son-in-law of Neville) instigated the construction of two gun towers, Bear and Clarence Towers, which were left unfinished on his death in 1485; with their own well and ovens, the towers were an independent stronghold from the rest of the castle, possibly in case of mutiny by the garrison. With the advent of gunpowder, the position of Keeper of the Artillery was created in 1486.
When antiquary John Leland visited the castle some time between 1535 and 1543, he noted that:
While in the care of The Crown, Warwick Castle underwent repairs and renovations using about 500 loads of stone. The castle, as well as lands associated with the earldom, was in Crown care from 1478 until 1547, when they were granted to John Dudley with the second creation of the title the Earl of Warwick.

When making his appeal for ownership of the castle Dudley said of the castle&#x27;s condition: &quot;... the castle of its self is not able to lodge a good baron with his train, for all the one side of the said castle with also the dungeon tower is clearly ruinated and down to the ground&quot;.

Warwick Castle had fallen into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not initiate any repairs to the castle. Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1566 during a tour of the country, and again in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, left the castle to the Queen during her visits. 

When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle&#x27;s buildings, including the chapel.

===17th-century country house===
In October 1601 Sir Fulke Greville wrote that &quot;the little stone building there was, mightily in decay, the timber lodgings built thirty years ago for herself (Elizabeth I) all ruinous; ... so as in very short time there will be nothing left but a name of Warwick&quot;.
Greville was granted the ruinous Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604 and it was converted to a country house. The conversion of the castle coincided with a period of decline in the use of castles during the 15th and 16th centuries; many were either being abandoned or converted into comfortable residences for the gentry. In the early 17th century, Robert Smythson was commissioned to draw a plan of the castle before any changes were made. Whilst the castle was undergoing repairs, it was peripherally involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The conspirators involved awaited news of their plot in Dunchurch in Warwickshire. When they discovered the plot had failed they stole cavalry horses from the stables at Warwick Castle to help in their escape. 

When the title of Earl of Warwick was created for the third time in 1618, the Greville family were still in possession of Warwick Castle. Fulke Greville, who was himself ennobled as Baron Brooke in 1621, spent over £20,000 (£ as of ) renovating the castle, while occupying a suite of rooms in the Watergate Tower; according to William Dugdale, a 17th-century antiquary, this made it &quot;a place not only of great strength but extraordinary delight, with most pleasant gardens, walks and thickets, such as this part of England can hardly parallel&quot;.

On 1 September 1628 Fulke Greville was murdered in Holborn by his manservant: Ralph Haywood – a &quot;gentleman&quot; – who stabbed the baron twice after discovering he had been omitted from mention in Greville&#x27;s will. Greville died from his wounds four weeks later. The Watergate Tower, which is said to be haunted by his ghost, became known as the Ghost Tower.
Under Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke, Warwick Castle&#x27;s defences were enhanced from January to May 1642 in preparation for attack during the First English Civil War. The garden walls were raised, bulwarks – barricades of beams and soil to mount artillery – were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two cannons were obtained.

Robert Greville was a Parliamentarian, and on 7 August 1642 a Royalist force laid siege to the castle. Greville was not in the castle at the time and the garrison was under the command of Sir Edward Peyto. Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton, Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire commanded the Royalist force. William Dugdale, acting as a herald, called for the garrison commander to surrender the castle, but he was refused. The besieging army opened fire on the castle, to little effect. According to Richard Bulstrode:

The siege was lifted on 23 August 1642 when the garrison was relieved by the forces of the Earl of Essex, and the Royalists were forced to retreat to Worcester. After the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 – the first pitched battle of the English Civil War – prisoners were held in Caesar&#x27;s and Guy&#x27;s Towers. 

During the Second English Civil War prisoners were again held at the castle, including those from the Battle of Worcester in 1651. A garrison was maintained in the castle complete with artillery and supplies from 1643 to 1660, at its strongest it numbered 302 soldiers. In 1660 the English Council of State ordered the castle governor to disband the garrison and hand over the castle to Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke. The state apartments were found to be outmoded and in poor repair. 

Under Roger and William Hurlbutt, master carpenters of Warwick, extensive modernization of the interiors was undertaken, 1669–78. To ensure that they would be in the latest taste, William was sent to Dorset to make careful notes of the interiors recently finished at Kingston Lacy for Sir Ralph Bankes to designs by Sir Roger Pratt.

On 4 November 1695 the castle was in sufficient state to host a visit by King William III.


Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke, undertook a renewed programme of improvements to Warwick Castle and its grounds. The 8th Baron Brooke was also bestowed with the title Earl of Warwick in 1759, the fourth creation of the title. With the recreation of the title, the castle was back in the ownership of the earls of Warwick. Daniel Garrett&#x27;s work at Warwick is documented in 1748; Howard Colvin attributed to him the Gothic interior of the chapel. Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown had been on hand since 1749. Brown, who was still head gardener at Stowe at the time and had yet to make his reputation as the main exponent of the English landscape garden, was called in by Lord Brooke to give Warwick Castle a more &quot;natural&quot; connection to its river. Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank, stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees. A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance.

Horace Walpole saw Brown&#x27;s maturing scheme in 1751 and remarked in a letter: &quot;The castle is enchanting. The view pleased me more than I can express; the river Avon tumbled down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr Southcote.&quot;

In 1754 the poet Thomas Gray, a member of Walpole&#x27;s Gothicising circle, commented disdainfully on the activity at the castle:

Gray&#x27;s mention of Argyle Buildings, Westminster, London, elicited a connotation of an inappropriately modern Georgian urban development, for the buildings in Argyll Street were a speculation to designs of James Gibbs, 1736–40.

Greville commissioned Italian painter Antonio Canaletto to paint Warwick Castle in 1747, while the castle grounds and gardens were undergoing landscaping by Brown. Five paintings and three drawings of the castle by Canaletto are known, making it the artist&#x27;s most often represented building in Britain. Canaletto&#x27;s work on Warwick Castle has been described as &quot;unique in the history of art as a series of views of an English house by a major continental master&quot;. As well as the gardens, Greville commissioned Brown to rebuild the exterior entrance porch and stairway to the Great Hall. Brown also contributed Gothick designs for a wooden bridge over the Avon (1758). He was still at work on Warwick Castle in 1760. Timothy Lightoler was responsible for the porch being extended and extra rooms added adjacent to it in 1763–69. and during the same years William Lindley provided a new Dining Room and other interior alterations. In 1786–88 the local builder William Eboral was commissioned to build the new greenhouse conservatory, with as its principal ornament the Warwick Vase, recently purchased in Rome.

In 1802 George Greville, 2nd Earl of Warwick of the new creation, had debts amounting to £115,000 (£ as of ). The earl&#x27;s estates, including Warwick Castle, were given to the Earl of Galloway and John FitzPatrick, 2nd Earl of Upper Ossory, in 1806, but the castle was returned to the earls of Warwick in 1813. The Great Hall was reroofed and repaired in Gothic taste in 1830–31 by Ambrose Poynter. Anthony Salvin was responsible for restoring the Watergate Tower in 1861–63. 

===The fire of 1871===

The castle was extensively damaged by a fire that started in the early hours of Sunday, 3 December 1871, in Lady Warwick&#x27;s apartments above the library, to the east of the Great Hall. Lord and Lady Warwick were away. The flames spread rapidly, the recently restored roof fell in and the Hall and private apartments were completely destroyed. A few of the most valuable books and pictures were all that could be saved.
Art treasures and valuables, including paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens and Van Dyke, were rescued from other rooms in the castle.

The alarm was raised at 2 am. Two children, Eva and Sydney Greville, were snatched from their beds in a room above the dining hall by their nurse and carried to safety through smoke and flames, minutes before the main staircase collapsed. Fire brigades came from Warwick and Leamington, but efforts to fight the spread of the fire were hampered by an inadequate water supply and by the height to which it needed to be pumped. It appeared for a time that the entire castle might be lost.

Some weeks later, according to Lady Warwick, it was found that the fire had been started deliberately by their recently employed under-butler. On the Saturday, when the Warwicks were absent, he had asked the housekeeper&#x27;s permission to bring a friend to show him the castle. Between them the two had stolen all items of value from the private apartments, and the under-butler had started a fire to conceal the robbery.

Although the Great Hall and private apartments were gutted, the overall structure was unharmed. 
Restoration and reparations carried out by Salvin during 1872–75 were subsidised by donations from the public, which raised a total of £9,651 (£ as of ).

==Advent of tourism==

Individuals had been visiting the castle since the end of the 17th century, and this grew in importance through the 19th century. In 1858, Queen Victoria visited the 4th earl, with great local celebrations. However, by 1885 it would appear the visitors were becoming a nuisance, as the earl closed the castle to visitors, causing consternation in the town. A local report stated, &quot;One day last week eight American visitors who were staying at one of the principal hotels left somewhat hurriedly in consequence of their being unable to gain admission to the castle&quot;. It soon re-opened, again and by 1900 had a ticket office and was employing a permanent guide.
By 1936, Arthur Mee was enthusing not just that &quot;these walls have seen something of the splendour of every generation of our [English] story&quot;, with rooms &quot;rich in treasure beyond the dreams of avarice&quot; but also that &quot;their rooms are open to all who will&quot;. 

Through the 20th century, successive earls expanded the castle&#x27;s tourism potential. 

==Corporate ownership==

In 1967, Charles Greville, 7th Earl of Warwick, transferred the castle and other estates to his son and heir, Lord Brooke, who in 1978 sold the Castle to the Tussauds Group for £1,300,000. The castle had been in the Greville family for 374 years, and its sale caused a public confrontation between father and son. 

Tussauds kept the castle in use mainly as a tourist attraction, while making extensive restorations to the castle and grounds. In twelve of the apartments open to tourists after the sale, wax figures of historic people are presented. Those depicted here were guests at a weekend party in 1898 hosted by Frances, Countess of Warwick; the principal guest was the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.


The collection of armoury on display at Warwick Castle is regarded as second only to that of the Tower of London.
In 2001, Warwick Castle was named one of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 historic houses and monuments&quot; by the British Tourist Authority; the list included Tower of London, Stonehenge, and Edinburgh Castle. Warwick Castle was recognised as Britain&#x27;s best castle by the &quot;Good Britain Guide 2003&quot;. Around this time it was getting more than half a million visitors a year.
In March 2007, the Tussauds Group sold the castle to the Blackstone Inc. investment firm, and the site was then operated by Merlin Entertainments, a division of that Blackstone. In July of that year, Warwick Castle was sold again to the Prestbury Group but it continued to be operated by Merlin under a renewable 35-year lease.

===Seasonal exhibits===
Other tourist attractions include &quot;Falconer&#x27;s Quest&#x27;&quot; (a bird show, featuring bald eagles, vultures, and sea eagles), archery displays, Jousting,&quot;The Trebuchet Show&quot; and &quot;The Sword in the Stone Show&quot;. The Castle is also home to &quot;The Castle Dungeon&quot;, a live actor experience similar to that of &quot;London Dungeons&quot;. Warwick Castle is the subject of many ghost stories. One such instance is that of Fulke Greville who is said to haunt the Watergate Tower despite having been murdered in Holborn. The castle&#x27;s reputation for being haunted is used as a tourist attraction with events such as &quot;Warwick Ghosts Alive&quot;, a live-action show telling the story of Fulke Greville&#x27;s murder. Musical events at the castle have included carolling, with performances by bands such as the Royal Spa Brass.

At times during Summer 2018, the castle offered its War of the Roses event with jousting and other action. On certain dates in August, Dragon Slayer evenings were scheduled, with dining, a projection light show, pyrotechnics, fire jousting and live action stunts.

===Heritage protection===

The castle is protected against unauthorised change as a scheduled monument in recognition of its status as a &quot;nationally important&quot; archaeological site or historic building, and is a Grade I listed building together with its boundary walls, stables, conservatory, mill and lodge.

On 23 June 2006, a £20,000 stained glass window was damaged by teenage vandals and a ceremonial sword stolen, recovered soon after.

===Warwick Castle trebuchet===
In June 2005, Warwick Castle became home to one of the world&#x27;s largest working siege engines. The trebuchet is tall, made from over 300 pieces of oak and weighs . It sits on the riverbank below the castle.

The machine was built with drawings from the Danish living history museum Middelaldercentret, who, in 1989, were the first to recreate a fully functioning trebuchet. It was built in Wiltshire with expertise from the Danish museum.

The trebuchet takes eight men half an hour to load and release. The process involves four men running in tall treadwheels to lift the counterweight, weighing , into the air. It is designed to be capable of hurling projectiles of up to distances of up to and as high as .

On 21 August 2006, the trebuchet claimed the record as the most powerful siege engine of its type when it sent a projectile weighing a distance of at a speed of , beating the previous record held by the trebuchet at Middelaldercentret in Denmark.

On 10 April 2015 a thatched boathouse caught fire shortly after a burning cannonball was fired by the trebuchet. It was reported that a spark from the cannonball had started the blaze although a castle spokeswoman said the cause had not yet been established. Hundreds of tourists were evacuated from the castle, but the spokeswoman said they were not at any risk. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described the boathouse as &quot;historic&quot;, &quot;medieval&quot; and dating to 1896, when the 5th Earl had it built to house an electric boat.

The trebuchet was decommissioned in 2020 due to safety concerns, and was deconstructed and replaced with a comparable trebuchet in 2023.

==Layout==
The current castle, built in stone during the reign of King Henry II, is on the same site as the earlier Norman motte-and-bailey castle. A keep used to stand on the motte which is on the south west of the site, although most of the structure now dates from the post-medieval period. In the 17th century the motte was landscaped with the addition of a path. The bailey was incorporated into the new castle and is surrounded by stone curtain walls.

When Warwick Castle was rebuilt in the reign of King Henry II it had a new layout with the buildings against the curtain walls. The castle is surrounded by a dry moat on the northern side where there is no protection from the river or the old motte; the perimeter of the walls is long by wide. The two entrances to castle are in the north and west walls. There was originally a drawbridge over the moat in the north east. In the centre of the north west wall is a gateway with Clarence and Bears towers on either side; this is a 15th-century addition to the fortifications of the castle. The residential buildings line the eastern side of the castle, facing the River Avon. These buildings include the great hall, the library, bedrooms, and the chapel.

==Owners==

Over its 950 years of history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 different individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, and has been a family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.

==Grounds, park, accommodations==
Formal gardens belonging to Warwick Castle were first recorded in 1534. Landscaping in the 17th century added spiral paths to the castle motte during Fulke Greville&#x27;s programme of restoration. Francis Greville commissioned Capability Brown to re-landscape the castle grounds; he began working on the grounds and park in 1749 and had completed his work by 1757, having spent about £2,293 (£ as of ). on the project. The gardens cover . Robert Marnock created formal gardens in the castle&#x27;s grounds in 1868–69.

Started in 1743 and originally known as Temple Park, Castle Park is located to the south of the castle. Its original name derived from the Knights Templar, who used to own a manor in Warwick. Houses around the perimeter of the park were demolished and the land they stood on incorporated into the park. Attempts to make profits from the park in the late 18th century included leasing it for grazing, growing wheat, and keeping sheep.

A water-powered mill in the castle grounds was probably built under Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, on the west bank of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954.

The latest option at the castle is glamping, overnight stays in nicely decorated tents in an area labelled Knight&#x27;s Village. The units include no cooking facilities, so the fee for the stay includes a buffet dinner and a breakfast. The previously introduced accommodations in timber lodges also remain available in the Woodland Hideaway area.

==Incidents==

===Death of George Townley===
In December 2007, George Townley tripped and fell on a low section of the Bear and Clarence Bridge at Warwick Castle into a dry moat beneath. Mr Townley experienced a heart attack from the fall and died of a sustained head injury later in hospital. The bridge had previously been identified as a risk. Merlin Attractions were unanimously found guilty of health and safety laws at Warwick Crown Court, and were ordered to pay £350,000 in fines and costs. In response, the company indicated they would appeal the case.

<text>Izamal () is a small city in the Mexican state of Yucatán, east of state capital Mérida, in southern Mexico.

Izamal was continuously occupied throughout most of Mesoamerican chronology; in 2000, the city&#x27;s estimated population was 15,000 people. Izamal is known in Yucatán as the Yellow City (most of its buildings are painted yellow) and the City of Hills (that actually are the remains of ancient temple pyramids).

== Pre-Columbian Izamal ==

Izamal is an important archaeological site of the Pre-Columbian Maya civilization. It is probably the biggest city of the Northern Yucatec Plains, covering a minimal urban extension of . Its monumental buildings exceed 1,000,000 cubic meters of constructive volume and at least two raised causeways, known by their Mayan term &quot;sacbeob&quot;, connect it with other important centers, Ruins of Ake, located to the west and Kantunil, 18 kilometers to the south, evidencing the religious, political and economic power of this political unit over a territory of more than in extension. Izamal developed a particular constructive technique involving use of megalithic carved blocks, with defined architectonical characteristics like rounded corners, projected mouldings and thatched roofs at superstructures, which also appeared in other important urban centers within its hitherland, such as Ake, Uci and Dzilam.

The city was founded during the Late Formative Period (750–200 BC) and was continuously occupied until the Spanish Conquest. The most important constructive activity stage spans between Protoclassic (200 BC – 200 AD) and Late Classic (600–800 AD). It was partially abandoned with the rise of Chichen Itza in the Terminal Classic (800–1000 A.D.) until the end of the Precolumbian era, when Izamal was considered a site of pilgrimages in the region, rivaled only by Chichen Itza. Its principal temples were sacred to the creator deity Itzamna and to the Sun god Kinich Ahau.

Five huge Pre-Columbian structures are still easily visible at Izamal (and two from some distance away in all directions). The first is a great pyramid to the Maya Sun god, Kinich Kak Moo (macaw of the solar fire face) with a base covering over 2 acres (8,000 m2) of ground and a volume of some 700,000 cubic meters. Atop this grand base is a pyramid of ten levels. To the south-east lies another great temple, called Itzamatul, and placed at the south of what was a main plaza, another huge building, called Ppap Hol Chak, was partially destroyed with the construction of a Franciscan temple during the 16th century. The south-west side of the plaza is partially limited by another pyramid, the Hun Pik Tok, and in the west lie the remains of the temple known as Kabul, where a great stucco mask still existed on one side as recently as the 1840s, as seen in a colored lithograph after a drawing by Frederick Catherwood. All these large man-made mounds probably were built up over several centuries and originally supported city palaces and temples. Other important residential buildings which have been restored and can be visited are Xtul (The Rabbit), Habuc and Chaltun Ha.

After more than a decade of archaeological work done by Mexican archaeologists at Izamal, over 163 archaeologically important structures have been found there, and thousands of residential structures at surrounding communities have been located.

After the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in the 16th century, a Spanish colonial city was founded atop the existing Maya one. However, due to the immense effort required to level the two massive structures, the Spanish opted to place a small Christian temple atop the great pyramid and construct a large Franciscan Monastery on the acropolis. It was named after San Antonio de Padua. Completed in 1561, the open atrium of the Monastery is still today second in size only to that at the Vatican. Most of the cut stone from the Pre-Columbian city was reused to build the Spanish churches, monastery, and surrounding buildings.

Izamal was the first chair of the Bishops of Yucatán before they were moved to Mérida. The fourth Bishop of Yucatán, Diego de Landa lived here.

==Modern history==
The town of Izamal was first granted the status of city by the government of Yucatán on 4 December 1841. On 13 August 1923 it was demoted to town status. It regained its status as a city on 1 December 1981.

For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the henequen industry formed the basis of Izamal&#x27;s economy. When that industry declined in the 1960s, the municipal and state government began efforts to turn Izamal into a tourist destination, transforming the city&#x27;s appearance in the process. Izamal&#x27;s buildings owe their distinctive color scheme to Jorge Carlos González Rodríguez, mayor of Izamal from 1959 to 1961, who ordered the removal of the commercial signs that blighted the facades and rooftops of many buildings at the time, and the painting of those buildings in yellow and white. In 1965, Governor of Yucatán Luis Torres Mesías ordered the demolition of several buildings surrounding the San Antonio de Padua convent. He and his successor Carlos Loret de Mola Mediz also oversaw the conversion of Plaza Zamná from a public market into a park.

Pope John Paul II visited Izamal in August 1993, where he performed a mass and presented the statue of the Virgin with a silver crown.

==Present day==
Izamal remains a place of pilgrimage within the state of Yucatán, now for the veneration of Roman Catholic saints. Several saints statues at Izamal are said to perform miracles. An early colonial era statue of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (&quot;Our Lady of Izamal&quot;) is particularly venerated, and is the state&#x27;s patron saint.

The Yucatec Maya language is still heard at least as much as Spanish in Izamal. It is the first language in the homes of the majority of the people. Most signs are in both languages.

Major Fiestas are held in Izamal on April 3, May 3, August 15, and December 8.

Izamal is the home of a distillery which produces an eponymous mezcal from the hearts of the locally grown agave plants.

Izamal was named a &quot;Pueblo Mágico&quot; in 2002.

<text>The NeoStead 2000 (NS2000) is a bullpup combat shotgun developed by Truvelo Armoury of South Africa.

Production of the shotgun began in 2001 and the first models were made available in October of that same year. It is notable due to its unusual forward-and-back pump-action cycling motion.

==Design and production==
The NS2000 is a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun weighing just under , designed primarily for security and civil disturbance situations.

The firearm includes a barrel despite the overall weapon length of just . The short length makes the weapon easier to handle in close-quarters situations; however it can still remain accurate at relatively long ranges. The long barrel length is achieved by using a bullpup configuration, with a rear-fed tubular magazine.

Another aspect of the NS2000 is its dual six-round (6+6) magazine. The selector switch can be set to left, right, or alternating. In riot conditions, for example, less-lethal flexible baton rounds can be used with standard rounds in reserve.

A possible production variant of the NS2000 has a barrel in a weapon with an overall length of . The shorter barrel length reduces capacity to a dual five-round (5+5) magazine. This makes the weapon easier to import or licence in some countries.

Its pump-action mechanism operates in a forward-and-back motion due to its moving-barrel mechanism, instead of the traditional moving-action of back-and-forward motion. This method of operation is quite rare. Safety is increased by this method, since the pumping hand cannot accidentally slide in front of the shooting barrel.

The NS2000 has been available for civilian purchase since 2003, with the majority of sales in Europe.

<text>Georg Moritz Ebers (1 March 1837 – 7 August 1898) was a German Egyptologist and novelist. He is best known for his purchase of the Ebers Papyrus, one of the oldest Egyptian medical documents in the world.

==Life==
Georg Ebers was born in Berlin and was the youngest of the five children of an affluent family of bankers and porcelain manufacturers. The Ebers children were raised by their mother on her own, after their father committed suicide shortly after Ebers was born. His mother ran a salon popular among members of the intelligentsia, which included Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the Grimm Brothers, and Alexander von Humboldt.

At Göttingen, Ebers studied jurisprudence, and at Berlin Oriental languages and archaeology. Having made a special study of Egyptology, he became in 1865 &quot;Dozent&quot; in Egyptian language and antiquities at Jena, becoming professor in 1868. In 1870 he was appointed professor in these subjects at Leipzig. He had made two scientific journeys to Egypt, and his first work of importance, &quot;Ägypten und die Bücher Moses,&quot; appeared in 1867–1868. In 1874 he edited the celebrated medical papyrus (&quot;Papyrus Ebers&quot;) which he had discovered in Thebes (translation by H. Joachim, 1890).

Ebers early conceived the idea of popularising Egyptian lore by means of historical romances. &quot;Eine ägyptische Königstochter&quot; (&quot;An Egyptian Princess&quot;) was published in 1864 and obtained great success. His subsequent works of the same kind — &quot;Uarda&quot; (1877), &quot;Homo sum&quot; (1878), &quot;Die Schwestern&quot; (1880), &quot;Der Kaiser&quot; (1881), of which the scene is laid in Egypt at the time of Hadrian, &quot;Serapis&quot; (1885), &quot;Die Nilbraut&quot; (1887), and &quot;Kleopatra&quot; (1894) — were also well received, and did much to make the public familiar with the discoveries of Egyptologists. Ebers also turned his attention to other fields of historical fiction — especially the 16th century (&quot;Die Frau Bürgermeisterin,&quot; 1882; &quot;Die Gred,&quot; 1887) — without, however, attaining the success of his Egyptian novels.

Ebers discovered the Ebers Papyrus (&quot;ca.&quot; 1550 BCE) at Luxor (Thebes) in the winter of 1873–74. Now in the Leipzig University Library, the Ebers Papyrus is among the most important ancient Egyptian medical papyri. It is one of two of the oldest preserved medical documents anywhere — the other being the Edwin Smith Papyrus (&quot;ca.&quot; 1600 BCE). The Ebers Papyrus mentions more than 700 substances and medical recipes that include incantations and concoctions. Ebers published it as a facsimile with an English-Latin vocabulary and introduction.

His other writings include a descriptive work on Egypt (&quot;Aegypten in Wort und Bild,&quot; 2nd ed., 1880); &quot;Palestine in Picture and Word&quot; (&quot;&quot;), an 1884 translation of the English series &quot;Picturesque Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt&quot;; a life (1885) of his old teacher, the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius; and a guide to Egypt (1886). In 1889, the state of his health led him to retire from his chair at Leipzig on a pension.

Ebers&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot; appeared in 25 volumes at Stuttgart (1893–1895). Many of his books have been translated into English. For his life, see his &quot;Die Geschichte meines Lebens&quot; (Stuttgart, 1893); also R. Gosche, &quot;G. Ebers, der Forscher und Dichter&quot; (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1887).

Ebers was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

&quot;Arachne&quot;, which was published on 7 August 1898, was Ebers&#x27; last novel. It was written at the Villa Ebers in Tutzing, near Munich.

<doc id="182911" wikidata="Q649419" url="?curid=182911" title="Marylebone station">
<text>Marylebone station ( ) is a Central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in the Marylebone area of the City of Westminster. On the National Rail network, it is also known as London Marylebone and is the southern terminus of the Chiltern Main Line to Birmingham. The London Underground station is on the Bakerloo line between Edgware Road and stations, in Transport for London&#x27;s fare zone 1.

The station opened on 15 March 1899 as the London terminus of the Great Central Main Line (GCML), the last major railway to open in Britain for 100 years, linking the capital to the cities of Leicester, Sheffield and Manchester. Marylebone was the last of London&#x27;s main line termini to be built and is one of the smallest, opening with half of the platforms originally planned. There has been an interchange with the Bakerloo line since 1907, but not with any other lines.

Traffic declined at Marylebone station from the mid-20th century, particularly after the GCML closed. By the 1980s, it was threatened with closure, but was reprieved (press announcement on 30 April 1986) because of commuter traffic on the London to Aylesbury Line (a remaining part of the GCML) and from . In 1993, the station found a new role as the terminus of the Chiltern Main Line. Following the privatisation of British Rail, the station was expanded with two additional platforms in 2006 and improved services to . In 2015, services began between Marylebone and , via a new chord connecting the main line to the Oxford to Bicester Line and an extension to following in 2016. As of 2020, it is the only main London terminus to host only diesel trains, as none of the National Rail lines into it are electrified.

Marylebone is one of the squares on the British &quot;Monopoly&quot; board and is popular for filming because of its relative quietness compared to other London termini.

==Location==

The station stands on Melcombe Place just north of Marylebone Road, a straight west-to-east thoroughfare through Marylebone in Central London; Baker Street is close by to the east and south-east. It is in the northern, Lisson Grove, neighbourhood of the district, in a northern projection of the Bryanston and Dorset Square ward immediately south of St John&#x27;s Wood. North-east is Regent&#x27;s Park, north in a network of mostly residential streets is Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground and south, south-west and south-east are a mixed-use network of streets. Other nearby London termini are and .

A number of TfL bus routes serve the station.

==National Rail==
The main line National Rail station has six platforms: two built in 1899, two inserted into the former carriage road in the 1980s and two added in September 2006. It is the only non-electrified railway terminus in London. Marylebone is operated by Chiltern Railways, making it one of the few London terminus stations not to be managed by Network Rail.

Chiltern Railways operates all services at the station, accessing the Chiltern Main Line and London to Aylesbury Line routes; these serve , , Bicester, , , , , Birmingham Moor Street, Birmingham Snow Hill, and (at peak hours) . There are services to , via the Oxford to Bicester Line, and some services to , via the Leamington to Stratford branch line.

===History===

====GCR and LNER====

The early history of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)&#x27;s Great Central Main Line (GCML) extension into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no direct connection to London. Watkin was unhappy about transferring traffic to the Great Northern Railway and, when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a dedicated line between the MS&amp;LR and Central London.

The approach to Marylebone was the last section of the Great Central Main Line to be built. Progress was delayed in the 1890s because of objections, particularly as the line would pass through Lord&#x27;s, the principal cricket ground in London and home of Marylebone Cricket Club. Watkin promised that Lord&#x27;s would not be disrupted by the railway construction and an act of Parliament to complete the line was passed on 28 March 1893. The station was built on a site around Blandford and Harewood Squares, west of Regent&#x27;s Park. More than 4,000 working-class people were evicted from their homes to turn Harewood Avenue and Rossmore Road into approach roads; around 2,600 of them were rehomed in new apartments near St. John&#x27;s Wood Road. Watkin resigned the chairmanship in 1894, following ill-health, and was replaced by Lord Wharncliffe. The approach to the station through Lord&#x27;s was achieved by a cut-and-cover tunnel constructed between September 1896 and May 1897, avoiding the cancellation of any cricket.

The station opened to coal traffic on 27 July 1898 and to passengers on 15 March 1899. It was the terminus of the GCR&#x27;s London extension main line – the last major railway line to be built into London until High Speed 1. The Great Central Railway linked London to stations in , , Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Local services from north-west Middlesex, High Wycombe and Aylesbury also terminated at Marylebone. The GCR moved its headquarters to Marylebone from Manchester in 1905.

The station was designed by Henry William Braddock, a civil engineer for the GCR. It has a modest design owing to the GCR&#x27;s lack of money. The main booking hall is by . It is a domestic version of the &quot;Wrenaissance&quot; revival style that fits in with the residential surroundings with Dutch gables, employing warm brick and cream-coloured stone. The GCR crest was worked into the wrought iron railings in numerous places.

The original plan was for eight platforms, but half were designated as a &quot;possible future extension&quot; and the cost of building the GCML was greater than expected. The line leading to the station cut through of middle-class housing, including the Eyre Estate in St John&#x27;s Wood and the area around Lord&#x27;s, drawing protests and requiring a relocation of the track and station facilities. There was never enough money for the extra platforms and only four were built: three inside the train shed and one to its west (platform 4). As a result, the concourse is unusually long and had three walls for most of the 20th century. The northern wall was missing, as the GCR anticipated that the other four platforms, under an extended train shed, would be built later on. An office block was later built on the vacant site. The cost of the London Extension meant that the adjoining Great Central Hotel, designed by Sir Robert William Ellis, was built by a different company. The hotel operated for a relatively short time and was converted to offices in 1945, becoming the headquarters of British Rail from 1948 to 1986. The offices were restored as a hotel in 1993.

The GCR constructed an engine shed at the site in 1897, but it was short lived. A locomotive servicing area, consisting of a turntable and coaling stage remained in use until the end of steam traction at the station in 1966.

Passenger traffic on the GCR was never heavy because it was the last main line to be built; it therefore had difficulty competing against longer-established rivals, especially the Midland Railway from its terminal at St Pancras, for the lucrative inter-city passenger business. Low passenger traffic meant Marylebone was the quietest and most pleasant of London&#x27;s termini. The GCR was unhappy about having to use part of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s route to reach Marylebone and opened a new line to High Wycombe on 2 April 1906. The additional suburban services generated traffic for the station, which had previously been so empty on occasion that the staff outnumbered passengers. While passenger traffic remained relatively sparse, the line was heavily used for freight, especially coal; in 1914, 67% of traffic was goods-related. Trains ran from the north and East Midlands to the freight depot adjoining the station, which was marginally the largest in London.

The heyday of the line was between 1923, when the GCR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and 1948, when the LNER was nationalised to form the British Rail Eastern Region. As a result, many prestigious locomotives were frequent visitors to the line; these included &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, &quot;Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; and &quot;Mallard&quot; which ran on the East Coast Main Line. Special trains ran on the line to destinations such as Scotland. The station&#x27;s busiest use came after the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, when it was used to contain large crowds wishing to see the FA Cup Final. Special services ran from Marylebone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park the following year.

Unlike other London termini, Marylebone saw little direct damage during the Blitz. It was closed between 5 October and 26 November 1940, after the approach tunnels were breached and the goods depot was bombed on 16 April 1941.

====British Rail====
After the nationalisation of British Railways in 1948, Marylebone was initially kept open as a long-distance station. New services were introduced, including the &quot;Master Cutler&quot; service to Sheffield and the South Yorkshireman to Bradford, but they were not well-used. From 1949, all local services towards High Wycombe and Princes Risborough were routed into Marylebone, although the frequency of trains was reduced two years later.

The Great Central Main Line duplicated the route of the Midland Main Line and long-distance trains from Marylebone were scaled back from 1958, leading to the closure of the Great Central Main Line north of Aylesbury on 4 September 1966 in the Beeching Axe. 

The rundown of services began after the line was transferred from British Railways&#x27; Eastern Region to the London Midland Region, although the station and the first few miles of its route had been part of the Western Region from 1950. In 1958, the Master Cutler was diverted to and the East Coast Main Line. In 1960, all express services were discontinued, followed by freight in 1965. From then until closure, only a few daily long-distance semi-fast services to Nottingham remained. Marylebone&#x27;s large goods yard was closed and sold to the Greater London Council for housing. The last long-distance service ran on 4 September 1966, except for a brief reprieve the following year when Paddington was undergoing signal works.

Marylebone was then the terminus for local services to Aylesbury and High Wycombe only, with some services extended to . They were switched to diesel multiple unit (DMU) operation following the phasing out of steam. British Rail Class 115 DMUs were introduced to local services in 1962. The station was transferred from the Western Region to the London Midland Region in 1973. The Great Central Railway&#x27;s long-distance connection from Marylebone, via , was closed the same year.

====Closure proposals====

After the 1960s, lack of investment led to local services and the station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a high-speed busway, whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and been converted into a road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.

British Rail formally announced plans to close Marylebone on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process and closure notices were posted at the station. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations on the line and the closure was quietly dropped.

====1986 onwards – revival====

The station was revived under the control of the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail. The introduction of the inter-modal and unlimited use &quot;Capitalcard&quot; (now known as the Travelcard) led to a sharp rise in commuters into London, absorbing the spare capacity at Paddington and Baker Street, eliminating the possibility of Marylebone&#x27;s services being diverted.

Marylebone was reprieved from the threat of closure on 30 April 1986, and an £85 million modernisation and refurbishment programme of the station and its services was granted. This was funded by selling part of the station to developers, including two of the original four platforms at the west of the station and the third span of the train shed. In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The run-down lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first long-distance service into Marylebone since 1966. Initially, this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.

====Privatisation====
After rail privatisation, Chiltern Railways took over the rail services in 1996 and developed the interurban service to Birmingham Snow Hill. In 2002, a service to was opened. The line was restored to double track the same year and Marylebone was expanded in 2006, with two extra platforms in Chiltern&#x27;s Evergreen 2 project. A new platform (platform 6) was inaugurated in May 2006 while Platform 5 and the shortened platform 4 opened in September. Platforms 5 and 6 were built on the site of the goods sidings and a depot was opened near Wembley Stadium railway station.
In September 2007, the Office of Rail Regulation granted the Wrexham Shropshire &amp; Marylebone Railway (WSMR) Company permission to operate services from Wrexham in North Wales via , Telford and the West Midlands to Marylebone; they started in early 2008, restoring direct London services to Shropshire (Wrexham already being served by a Virgin Trains service to Euston), with five return trips per day on weekdays. This was reduced to four trains a day in March 2009. These services ceased in January 2011, after passenger numbers reduced; the closure was blamed on the Great Recession.

In December 2008, it was proposed to restart direct services between in mid-Wales and London, which last ran in 1991, with Marylebone as the London terminus. Arriva Trains Wales announced a consultation for two services a day, following the route of the WSMR connecting with the Cambrian line at Shrewsbury. This idea was abandoned following objections by Wrexham &amp; Shropshire.
In 2011, Chiltern Railways took over the to route from First Great Western; this was in preparation for the opening of a link from the Chiltern Main Line to the Varsity Line, on which Bicester Town station is located, which would see twice-hourly services from Marylebone to Oxford. Construction was expected to start in 2011, but was delayed until the following year after bats were found roosting in one of the tunnels on the Varsity line. Services to Oxford Parkway started in October 2015 and services to Oxford began in December 2016. In 2018, a survey found that commuters from Oxford preferred the Chiltern route to Marylebone over the Great Western route to Paddington via .

In 2017, Network Rail proposed an upgrade of Marylebone with 1,000 extra seats on trains approaching the station. These improvements are planned to be complete by 2024. Beyond this, improvements to Old Oak Common station are planned to relieve congestion at Marylebone.
In a study by Network Rail, it was said that any expansion of the station could cost up to £700 million, with Old Oak Common a more feasible alternative for capacity increase.

===Services===
The typical off-peak weekday service pattern from Marylebone is:
* 1 train per hour to 
* 1 train per hour to , with 1 train per 2 hours extending to 
* 2 trains per hour to 
* 1 train per hour to (stopping)
* 2 trains per hour to via , one of which continues to (stopping)

Additional services run in the peak hours and some Birmingham trains extend to .




===Station facilities===
The station opened with a dining restaurant and a buffet. The restaurant was changed to a self-service operation when British Rail took over in 1948. The Victoria and Albert bar opened on 14 December 1971. In the 21st century, the concourse contains a small selection of shops.

===Accidents===
On 28 March 1913, a train leaving for High Wycombe collided with another arriving from Leicester, killing one passenger and injuring 23 people on the incoming train. The cause was blamed on the intermediate starter signal being lowered before the main starter was ready; the view of the latter was obscured by the smoke.

On 11 December 2015, a train pulling into the station caught fire, causing it to be evacuated. The cause was believed to be a fault in its air conditioning unit.

==London Underground==

On the London Underground, Marylebone station is on the Bakerloo line between Edgware Road and Baker Street stations, along with the main line station above. It is sited in Transport for London fare zone 1. Access is via escalators from the main line station concourse, which houses the Underground station&#x27;s ticket office. Until 2004, a wooden escalator led into the station, one of the last on the London Underground system that had not been replaced as a consequence of the King&#x27;s Cross fire in 1987.

Marylebone has direct connections with just a single Tube line, unlike many other London termini such as and . There is no direct interchange with the Circle line, which predates the station by more than 30 years and bypasses it to the south. The nearest stations on the Circle line are Edgware Road and Baker Street away.

===History===

The underground station was opened on 27 March 1907 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway under the name &quot;Great Central&quot;, following a change from its intended name &quot;Lisson Grove&quot;. The railway terminated here until the extension to Edgware Road opened on 15 June. The station was renamed &quot;Marylebone&quot; on 15 April 1917. The original name still appears in places on the platform wall tiling, although the tiling scheme is a replacement designed to reflect the original scheme.

The present entrance opened on 1 February 1943, following wartime damage to the original station building that stood to the west at the junction of Harewood Avenue and Harewood Row, and after the introduction of the escalators. The old building, designed by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London&#x27;s architect, Leslie Green, used lifts to access the platforms. It was demolished in 1971 and the site is occupied by a budget hotel.

In August 2020, work began to install a third escalator in place of the present staircase, followed by replacement of the 1943 built escalators. The work is expected to be completed in 2023.

===Services===
The current Bakerloo Line service consists of:
* 20 tph southbound to Elephant &amp; Castle
* 11 tph northbound to Queen&#x27;s Park
* 3 tph northbound to Stonebridge Park
* 6 tph northbound to 

==Cultural references==
As one of the quietest London termini, Marylebone has been popular as a filming location. In particular, several scenes in The Beatles&#x27; film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; were filmed there in April 1964, as was the opening scene of the 1965 film of &quot;The IPCRESS File&quot; and the 1978 film of &quot;The Thirty-Nine Steps&quot; (standing in for ). The station continues to be so used according to Film London.

Marylebone is one of four London termini depicted on the British version of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game, along with King&#x27;s Cross, Fenchurch Street and Liverpool Street. During the time the board was designed in the mid-1930s, all the stations were being operated by the LNER.

<doc id="182912" wikidata="Q1018376" url="?curid=182912" title="Buzzword bingo">
<text>Buzzword bingo, also known as bullshit bingo, is a bingo-style game where participants prepare bingo cards with buzzwords and tick them off when they are uttered during an event, such as a meeting or speech. The goal of the game is to tick off a predetermined number of words in a row and then signal bingo to other players.

== Concept ==
Buzzword bingo is generally played in situations where audience members feel that the speaker is relying too heavily on buzzwords or jargon rather than providing relevant details or clarity. Business meetings led by guest speakers or notable company personalities from higher up the pay scale are often viewed as a good opportunity for buzzword bingo, as the language used by these speakers often includes predictable references to arcane business concepts, which are perfect for use in the creation of buzzword bingo cards.

Turkey bingo requires the winner to ask a question or make a statement using his/her winning bingo words, thus signaling the win to insiders while ideally prompting the speaker to respond as if the question or statement were real. An alternate variation requires the person who has achieved bingo to raise his or her hand and use the word &quot;Bingo&quot; within the context of a comment or question. Other versions of the game require actually yelling &quot;Bingo!&quot; To avoid the reprimands that would likely result from doing so, participants may resort to looking at one another and silently mouthing the word &quot;Bingo&quot; instead.

An example of a buzzword bingo card for a business management meeting is shown below.

== Creation and popularization ==
The game has existed for many years, though without a universally-used name, and it is likely that its creation can be credited to several people working independently. 

By 1992, college students in the USA were playing a game called &quot;turkey bingo&quot; where they guessed which classmates would dominate conversations in classrooms. This led to a variant popular in business schools called &quot;bullshit bingo&quot; based on overused business lingo. The Buzzword Bingo name was coined in early 1993 in an internal Silicon Graphics tool made by principal scientist Tom Davis in collaboration with Seth Katz, and popularized in 1993 in the first public web version by fellow employee Chris Pirazzi The 22 February 1994 &quot;Dilbert&quot; comic featured buzzword bingo in an office meeting.

One documented example occurred when Al Gore, then the Vice President of the United States, known for his liberal use of buzzwords in enthusiastically promoting technology, spoke at MIT&#x27;s 1996 graduation. MIT hackers had distributed bingo cards containing buzzwords to the graduating class. Gore, who had been informed of the prank, acknowledged it during his speech.

In 2007, IBM created a TV advertisement that was based on the concept of buzzword bingo. Video gaming website GameSpot hosted a video called &quot;Executive Buzzword Bingo&quot;, in which they held a running tally of buzzwords uttered during Sony&#x27;s &quot;PlayStation Meeting 2013&quot; conference event on 20 February 2013.

<doc id="182916" wikidata="Q918350" url="?curid=182916" title="Henry Kendall (poet)">
<text>Thomas Henry Kendall (18 April 18391 August 1882), was an Australian author and bush poet, who was particularly known for his poems and tales set in a natural environment. He appears never to have used his first name — his three volumes of verse were all published under the name of &quot;Henry Kendall&quot;.

==Early life==
Kendall was born in a settler&#x27;s hut by Yackungarrah Creek in Yatte Yattah near Ulladulla, New South Wales, twin son (with Basil Edward Kendall) of Basil Kendall (1809–1852) and his wife Matilda Kendall, née McNally c. 1815, and baptised in the Presbyterian church. His father was the second son of Rev. Thomas Kendall, an Englishman who came to Sydney in 1809 and five years later went as a missionary to New Zealand, before settling in New South Wales in 1827.

Kendall has also been known as Henry Clarence Kendall, for reasons unknown (however at the age of 5, his parents moved to the Clarence River area of northern New South Wales).
Journalist and fellow poet A. G. Stephens sought to correct the confusion in 1928, publishing a pamphlet which included proof that the poet was baptised Thomas Henry Kendall, but stated the name of Henry Clarence Kendall at his wedding.

He received only a slight education. When he was 15 he went to sea with one of his uncles on a whaling voyage and was away for about two years.

==Adult life==

Returning from his maritime experience to Sydney when 17-years-old, Kendall found his mother keeping a boarding-school; it was necessary that he should do something to earn a living, and he became a shop-assistant. He had begun to write verses and this brought him in contact with two well-known verse writers of the day, Joseph Sheridan Moore who published a volume of verse, &quot;Spring Life Lyrics&quot;, in 1864, and James Lionel Michael. Michael, who was a solicitor, took Kendall into his office and gave him the run of his library. He removed to Grafton in 1861 and Kendall was again employed by him for about six months during the following year.

Kendall made another friend in Henry Parkes, who was editing &quot;The Empire&quot; from 1850 to 1857 and published a few of his youthful verses. In 1862 he sent some poems to the &quot;London Athenaeum&quot; which printed three of them and gave the author kindly praise. In the same year his first volume, &quot;Poems and Songs&quot;, was published at Sydney. It was well received and eventually the whole edition of 500 copies was sold. Representations were made to the government, and in 1863 a position was found for the poet in the lands department. He was transferred to the colonial secretary&#x27;s department in 1864 and appears to have discharged his duties in a conscientious way; his hours were not long and he had some leisure for literature. His salary, originally £150 a year, became increased to £250 and he was able to make a home for his mother and sisters.

In 1868 he married Charlotte Rutter, the daughter of a Sydney physician, and in the following year resigned from his position in the government service and went to Melbourne, which had become a larger city than Sydney and more of a literary centre. Kendall&#x27;s decision to give up his position must at the time have seemed very unwise. But he had become financially embarrassed before his marriage on account of the extravagance of his family, and his wife found it impossible to live with his mother, who had joined the young couple. The elder Mrs Kendall was in fact practically a dipsomaniac, and the poet felt that the only chance of happiness for himself and his wife was to make a fresh start in another city. 

They travelled south to Melbourne where he was welcomed by his fellow writers, such as George Gordon McCrae, Marcus Clarke and Adam Lindsay Gordon. He and Clarke worked together to produce the short-lived satirical magazine &quot;Humbug&quot; (1869-70). Kendall, however, had none of the qualities of a successful journalist. Some of his work was accepted by the press and George Robertson published his second volume of poetry, &quot;Leaves from Australian Forests&quot;, soon after his arrival. The poem &#x27;Bell-Birds&#x27;, one of Australia&#x27;s best-known poems, was published in that volume. The press notices were favourable, one reviewer in his enthusiasm going so far as to say that &quot;Swinburne, Arnold and Morris are indulgently treated if we allow them an equal measure of poetic feeling with Kendall&quot;. Despite this, comparatively few copies were sold and the publisher made a loss.

The poet found that he could not make a living by literature and, probably by the good offices of George Gordon McCrae, a temporary position was found for him in the government statist&#x27;s office. Kendall, however, had no head for figures. He did his best but found his tasks hopeless. One day McCrae was called out into the passage to see Kendall, an agitated, trembling figure who told him he must go, he could not stand it any longer. Years later Henry Lawson was to write

&lt;poem&gt;::&quot;Just as in Southern climes they give
::The hard-up rhymer figures!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Kendall had indeed lost heart; he drifted into drinking and Alexander Sutherland in his essay draws a lurid picture of the depths into which the poet had fallen. It is true that he had the authority of Kendall&#x27;s poem &quot;On a Street&quot;, but years afterwards George Gordon McCrae reported that Kendall &quot;made the worst of everything including himself&quot;. McCrae had no doubt about Kendall having at times given way to excessive drinking, but stated positively that he had never actually seen him the worse for drink. McCrae was a good friend to Kendall and he had many other friends in spite of his retiring and sensitive nature. But his friends could not save him from himself, and his two years in Melbourne were among the most miserable of his life. A pathetic letter is still in existence, in which Kendall tells McCrae that he could not go to Gordon&#x27;s funeral because he was penniless. In December 1870 he was charged with forging and uttering a cheque but found not guilty on the ground of insanity. Unable to support his family, he was forced back to Sydney by poverty, ill health and drunkenness. Intervals of dogged literary effort alternated with lapses into melancholia. His wife had to return to her mother and Kendall became a derelict; in early 1873 he spent four months in the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane. In November 1873 Kendall was taken in by the Fagan brothers, timber merchants near Gosford, and was afterwards given a position in the business of one of the brothers, Michael Fagan, at Camden Haven. There he stayed six years and found again his self-respect. Writing in October 1880 to George Gordon McCrae he said, referring to his employer, &quot;I want you to know the bearer. He is the man who led me out of Gethsemane and set me in the sunshine&quot;.

In 1880 he published his third volume, &quot;Songs from the Mountains&quot;. It was an outstanding success, doing much to re-establish his reputation. The volume contained a satirical poem on a politician of the day and had to be withdrawn under threat of a libel action. The original edition is now very rare. The volume was reissued with another poem substituted.

==Final years==

In 1881 his old friend Sir Henry Parkes had him appointed inspector of state forests at a salary of £500 a year. But his health, never strong, broke down due to the required long rides in all weather. He caught a severe chill, developed consumption, and died at Redfern in Sydney on 1 August 1882. He was buried in Waverley Cemetery. His widow survived him for more than 40 years, and during the last sixteen years of her life received a Commonwealth Literary Fund pension.

==Legacy==

A posthumous portrait, painted by Tom Roberts, is at the National Library of Australia, Canberra. In 1938 his son, Frederick C. Kendall published &quot;Henry Kendall, His Later Years&quot;, self-described as &quot;A Refutation of Mrs Hamilton-Grey&#x27;s book &quot;Kendall Our God-made Chief&quot;&quot;.

In 1886 a memorial edition of his poems was published at Melbourne. A translation into German of selected poems by Henry Kendall taken from the book of his son Frederick C. Kendall appeared in 2021.

Comboyne Street in Kendall has a granitic sculpture to the poet (GPS ). 

His name is given to several locations: 

* The small village of Kendall on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales is named after him and not, as some suspect, after the similarly-spelled ancient town of Kendal in the County of Cumbria in England. 

* A street in Elwood, Victoria. 

* A street in Campbelltown, Padstow Heights, and Heathcote in New South Wales. 

* A street and a park in Tarrawanna near Wollongong, NSW. 

===NSW Central Coast===

On the New South Wales Central Coast, a number of locations are named in his honour:

* Henry Kendall Street in West Gosford is home to the stone building (now a museum known as &#x27;Henry Kendall Cottage&#x27;) where he lived for some time with the Fagans.

* A retirement village in the nearby suburb of Wyoming is also named in his honour: Henry Kendall Gardens (formally the Henry Kendall Village).

* Henry Kendall High School (also in West Gosford).

* The biennial Henry Kendall Poetry Award, run by Central Coast Poets Inc., has been won by poets Louise Oxley, Judy Johnson and Joan Kerr.

On the hillside above West Gosford, near &quot;Lookout – West Gosford&quot; is a stone monument located on a tight bend of the Central Coast Highway, built sometime before 1920. The marble plaque is inscribed:
&lt;poem&gt;TO KENDALL&#x27;S ROCK
There was a rock-pool in a glen
Beyond Narrara&#x27;s sands;
The mountains shut it in from men
In flowerful fairy lands.

But once we found its dwelling place—
The lovely and the lone—
And, in a dream, I stopped to trace
Our names upon a stone.&lt;/poem&gt;
::&quot;Henry Kendall&quot;
:R.A.H.S.

<text>John of Brienne ( 1170 – 19–23 March 1237), also known as John I, was King of Jerusalem from 1210 to 1225 and Latin Emperor of Constantinople from 1229 to 1237. He was the youngest son of Erard II of Brienne, a wealthy nobleman in Champagne. John, originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, became a knight and owned small estates in Champagne around 1200. After the death of his brother, Walter III, he ruled the County of Brienne on behalf of his minor nephew Walter IV (who lived in southern Italy).

The barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem proposed that John marry their queen, Maria. With the consent of Philip II of France and Pope Innocent III, he left France for the Holy Land and married Queen Maria; the couple were crowned in 1210. After Maria&#x27;s death in 1212 John administered the kingdom as regent for their infant daughter Isabella II; an influential lord, John of Ibelin, attempted to depose him. John was a leader of the Fifth Crusade. Although his claim of supreme command of the crusader army was never unanimously acknowledged, his right to rule Damietta (in Egypt) was confirmed shortly after the city fell to the crusaders in 1219. He claimed the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia on behalf of his second wife, Stephanie, in 1220. After Stephanie and their infant son died that year, John returned to Egypt. The Fifth Crusade ended in failure (including the recovery of Damietta by the Egyptians) in 1221.

John was the first king of Jerusalem to visit Europe (Italy, France, England, León, Castile and Germany) to seek assistance for the Holy Land. He gave his daughter in marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1225, and Frederick ended John&#x27;s rule of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Although the popes tried to persuade Frederick to restore the kingdom to John, the Jerusalemite barons regarded Frederick as their lawful ruler. John administered papal domains in Tuscany, became the &quot;podestà&quot; of Perugia and was a commander of Pope Gregory IX&#x27;s army during Gregory&#x27;s war against Frederick in 1228 and 1229.

John was elected emperor in 1229 as the senior co-ruler (with Baldwin II) of the Latin Empire, and was crowned in Constantinople in 1231. John III Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria occupied the last Latin territories in Thrace and Asia Minor, besieging Constantinople in early 1235. John directed the defence of his capital during the months-long siege, with the besiegers withdrawing only after Geoffrey II of Achaea and united fleets from Italian towns defeated their fleet in 1236. The following year, John died as a Franciscan friar.

== Early life ==
John was the youngest of the four sons of Count Erard II of Brienne and Agnes of Montfaucon. He seemed &quot;exceedingly about 80&quot; to the 14-year-old George Akropolites in 1231; if Akropolites&#x27; estimate was correct, John was born around 1150. However, no other 13th-century authors described John as an old man. His father referred to John&#x27;s brothers as &quot;children&quot; in 1177 and mentioned the tutor of John&#x27;s oldest brother, Walter III, in 1184; this suggests that John&#x27;s brothers were born in the late 1160s. Modern historians agree that John was born after 1168, probably during the 1170s.

Although his father destined John for a clerical career, according to the late-13th-century &quot;Tales of the Minstrel of Reims&quot; he &quot;was unwilling&quot;. Instead, the minstrel continued, John fled to his maternal uncle at the Clairvaux Abbey. Encouraged by his fellows, he became a knight and earned a reputation in tournaments and fights. Although elements of the &quot;Tales of the Minstrel of Reims&quot; are apparently invented (for instance, John did not have a maternal uncle in Clairvaux), historian Guy Perry wrote that it may have preserved details of John&#x27;s life. A church career was not unusual for youngest sons of 12th-century noblemen in France; however, if his father sent John to a monastery he left before reaching the age of taking monastic vows. John &quot;clearly developed the physique that was necessary to fight well&quot; in his youth, because the 13th-century sources Akropolites and Salimbene di Adam emphasize his physical strength.

Erard II joined the Third Crusade and died in the Holy Land in 1191. His oldest son, Walter III, succeeded him in Brienne. John was first mentioned in an 1192 (or 1194) charter issued by his brother, indicating that he was a prominent figure in Walter&#x27;s court. According to a version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, John participated in a war against Peter II of Courtenay. Although the &quot;Tales of the Minstrel of Reims&quot; claimed that he was called &quot;John Lackland&quot;, according to contemporary charters John held Jessains, Onjon, Trannes and two other villages in the County of Champagne around 1200. In 1201, Theobald III granted him additional estates in Mâcon, Longsols and elsewhere. Theobald&#x27;s widow, Blanche of Navarre, persuaded John to sell his estate at Mâcon, saying that it was her dower.

Walter III of Brienne died in June 1205 while fighting in southern Italy. His widow, Elvira of Sicily, gave birth to a posthumous son, Walter IV, who grew up in Italy. John assumed the title of count of Brienne, and began administering the county on his nephew&#x27;s behalf in 1205 or 1206. As a leading vassal of the count of Champagne, John frequented the court of Blanche of Navarre, who ruled Champagne during the minority of her son, Theobald IV. According to a version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, she loved John &quot;more than any man in the world&quot;; this annoyed King Philip II of France.

The two versions of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle tell different stories about John&#x27;s ascent to the throne of Jerusalem. According to one version, the leading lords of Jerusalem sent envoys to France in 1208 asking Philip II to select a French nobleman as a husband for their queen, Maria. Taking advantage of the opportunity to rid himself of John, Philip II suggested him. In the other version an unnamed knight encouraged the Jerusalemite lords to select John, who accepted their offer with Philip&#x27;s consent. John visited Pope Innocent III in Rome. The pope donated 40,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land, stipulating that John could spend the money only with the consent of the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem and the grand masters of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller.

== King of Jerusalem ==

=== Co-ruler ===

John landed at Acre on 13 September 1210; the following day, Patriarch of Jerusalem Albert of Vercelli married him to Queen Maria. John and Maria were crowned in the Cathedral of Tyre on 3 October. The truce concluded by Maria&#x27;s predecessor Aimery and the Ayyubid sultan Al-Adil I had ended by John&#x27;s arrival. Although Al-Adil was willing to renew it, Jerusalemite lords did not want to sign a new treaty without John&#x27;s consent. During John and Maria&#x27;s coronation, Al-Adil&#x27;s son Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa pillaged the area around Acre but did not attack the city. After returning to Acre, John raided nearby Muslim settlements in retaliation.

Although about 300 French knights accompanied him to the Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not see him as sufficiently eminent. John&#x27;s cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil by the middle of 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.

=== Conflicts ===
Maria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death triggered a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin (who administered Jerusalem before John&#x27;s coronation) questioning the widowed king&#x27;s right to rule. The king sent Raoul of Merencourt, Bishop of Sidon, to Rome for assistance from the Holy See. Pope Innocent confirmed John as lawful ruler of the Holy Land in early 1213, urging the prelates to support him with ecclesiastical sanctions if needed. Most of the Jerusalemite lords remained loyal to the king, acknowledging his right to administer the kingdom on behalf of his infant daughter; John of Ibelin left the Holy Land and settled in Cyprus.

The relationship between John of Brienne and Hugh I of Cyprus was tense. Hugh ordered the imprisonment of John&#x27;s supporters in Cyprus, releasing them only at Pope Innocent&#x27;s command. During the War of the Antiochene Succession John sided with Bohemond IV of Antioch and the Templars against Raymond-Roupen of Antioch and Leo I, King of Cilician Armenia, who were supported by Hugh and the Hospitallers. However, John sent only 50 knights to fight the Armenians in Antiochia in 1213. Leo I concluded a peace treaty with the Knights Templar late that year, and he and John reconciled. John married Leo&#x27;s oldest daughter, Stephanie (also known as Rita), in 1214 and Stephanie received a dowry of 30,000 bezants. Quarrels among John, Leo I, Hugh I and Bohemond IV are documented by Pope Innocent&#x27;s letters urging them to reconcile their differences before the Fifth Crusade reached the Holy Land.

=== Fifth Crusade ===

Pope Innocent proclaimed the Fifth Crusade in 1213, with the &quot;liberation of the Holy Land&quot; (the reconquest of Jerusalem) its principal object. The first crusader troops, commanded by Leopold VI of Austria, landed at Acre in early September 1217. Andrew II of Hungary and his army followed that month, and Hugh I of Cyprus and Bohemond IV of Antioch soon joined the crusaders. However, hundreds of crusaders soon returned to Europe because of a famine following the previous year&#x27;s poor harvest. A war council was held in the tent of Andrew II, who considered himself the supreme commander of the crusader army. Other leaders, particularly John, did not acknowledge Andrew&#x27;s leadership. The crusaders raided nearby territory ruled by Al-Adil I for food and fodder, forcing the sultan to retreat in November 1217. In December John besieged the Ayyubid fortress on Mount Tabor, joined only by Bohemond IV of Antioch. He was unable to capture it, which &quot;encouraged the infidel&quot;, according to the contemporary Jacques de Vitry.

Andrew II decided to return home, leaving the crusaders&#x27; camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although military action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.

The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May 1218. Although they seized a strategically important tower on a nearby island on 24 August, Al-Kamil (who had succeeded Al-Adil I in Egypt) controlled traffic on the Nile. In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III&#x27;s legate Cardinal Pelagius (who considered himself the crusade&#x27;s supreme commander) arrived from Italy.

Egyptian forces attempted a surprise attack on the crusaders&#x27; camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.

In late October, Al-Kamil sent messengers to the crusaders offering to restore Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth to them if they withdrew from Egypt. Although John and the secular lords were willing to accept the sultan&#x27;s offer, Pelagius and the heads of the military orders resisted; they said that the Moslems could easily recapture the three towns. The crusaders ultimately refused the offer. Al-Kamil tried to send provisions to Damietta across their camp, but his men were captured on 3 November. Two days later, the crusaders stormed into Damietta and seized the town. Pelagius claimed it for the church, but he was forced to acknowledge John&#x27;s right to administer it (at least temporarily) when John threatened to leave the crusaders&#x27; camp. According to John of Joinville, John seized one-third of Damietta&#x27;s spoils; coins minted there during the following months bore his name. Al-Mu&#x27;azzam, emir of Damascus and brother of al-Kamil, invaded the Kingdom of Jerusalem and pillaged Caesarea before the end of 1219.

John&#x27;s father-in-law, Leo I of Armenia, died several months before the crusaders seized Damietta. He bequeathed his kingdom to his infant daughter, Isabella. John and Raymond-Roupen of Antioch (Leo&#x27;s nephew) questioned the will&#x27;s legality, each demanding the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia for themselves. In a February 1220 letter, Pope Honorius declared John to be Leo&#x27;s rightful heir. Saying that he wanted to assert his claim to Cilicia, John left Damietta for the Kingdom of Jerusalem around Easter 1220. Although Al-Mu&#x27;azzam&#x27;s successful campaign the previous year also pressed John to leave Egypt, Jacques de Vitry and other Fifth Crusade chroniclers wrote that he deserted the crusader army.

Stephanie died shortly after John&#x27;s arrival. Contemporary sources accused John of causing her sudden death, claiming that he severely beat her when he heard that she tried to poison his daughter Isabella. Their only son died a few weeks later, ending John&#x27;s claim to Cilicia. Soon after Pope Honorius learned about the deaths of Stephanie and her son, he declared Raymond-Roupen the lawful ruler of Cilicia and threatened John with excommunication if he fought for his late wife&#x27;s inheritance.

John did not return to the crusaders in Egypt for several months. According to a letter from the prelates in the Holy Land to Philip II of France, lack of funds kept John from leaving his kingdom. Since his nephew Walter IV was approaching the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John&#x27;s absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the Holy Land to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.

The commanders of the crusader army decided to continue the invasion of Egypt, despite (according to Philip d&#x27;Aubigny) John&#x27;s strong opposition. The crusaders approached Mansurah, but the Egyptians imposed a blockade on their camp. Outnumbered, Pelagius agreed to an eight-year truce with Al-Kamil in exchange for Damietta on 28 August. John was among the crusade leaders held hostage by Al-Kamil until the crusader army withdrew from Damietta on 8 September.

=== Negotiations ===
After the Fifth Crusade ended &quot;in colossal and irremediable failure&quot;, John returned to his kingdom. Merchants from Genoa and Pisa soon attacked each other in Acre, destroying a significant portion of the town. According to a Genoese chronicle, John supported the Pisans and the Genoese left Acre for Beirut.

John was the first king of Jerusalem to visit Europe, and had decided to seek aid from the Christian powers before he returned from Egypt. He also wanted to find a suitable husband for his daughter, to ensure the survival of Christian rule in the Holy Land. John appointed Odo of Montbéliard as a &quot;bailli&quot; to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem in his absence.

John left for Italy in October 1222 to attend a conference about a new crusade. At John&#x27;s request, Pope Honorius declared that all lands conquered during the crusade should be united with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. To plan the military campaign, the pope and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II met at Ferentino in March 1223; John attended the meeting. He agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Frederick II after the emperor promised that he would allow John to rule the Kingdom of Jerusalem for the rest of his life.

John then went to France, although Philip II was annoyed at being excluded from the decision of Isabella&#x27;s marriage. Matilda I, Countess of Nevers, Erard II of Chacenay, Albert, Abbot of Vauluisant and other local potentates asked John to intervene in their conflicts, indicating that he was esteemed in his homeland. John attended the funeral of Philip II at the Basilica of St Denis in July; Philip bequeathed more than 150,000 marks for the defence of the Holy Land. John then visited England, attempting to mediate a peace treaty between England and France after his return to France.

John made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in March 1224. According to the &quot;Latin Chronicle of the Kings of Castile&quot;, he went to the Kingdom of León to marry one of the elder daughters of Alfonso IX of León (Sancha or Dulce) because Alfonso had promised him the kingdom &quot;along with her&quot;. The marriage could jeopardize the claim of Sancha&#x27;s and Dulce&#x27;s half-brother, Ferdinand III of Castile, to León. To protect her son&#x27;s interests, Ferdinand&#x27;s mother Berengaria of Castile decided to give her daughter (Berengaria of León) to John in marriage. Although modern historians do not unanimously accept the chronicle&#x27;s account of John&#x27;s plan to marry Sancha or Dulce, they agree that the queen of France (Blanche of Castile, Berengaria of Castile&#x27;s sister) played an important role in convincing John to marry her niece. The marriage of John and Berengaria was celebrated in Burgos in May 1224.

About three months later, he met Emperor Frederick&#x27;s son Henry in Metz and visited Henry&#x27;s guardian, Engelbert, Archbishop of Cologne. From Germany John went to southern Italy, where he persuaded Pope Honorius to allow Emperor Frederick to postpone his crusade for two years. Frederick married John&#x27;s daughter, Isabella (who had been crowned queen of Jerusalem), on 9 November 1225. John and Frederick&#x27;s relationship became tense. According to a version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, John got into a disagreement with his new son-in-law because Frederick seduced a niece of Isabella who was her lady-in-waiting. In the other version of the chronicle John often &quot;chastised and reproved&quot; his son-in-law, who concluded that John wanted to seize the Kingdom of Sicily for his nephew Walter IV of Brienne and tried to murder John (who fled to Rome). Frederick declared that John had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem when Isabella married him; he styled himself king of Jerusalem for the first time in December 1225. Balian of Sidon, Simon of Maugastel, Archbishop of Tyre, and the other Jerusalemite lords who had escorted Isabella to Italy acknowledged Frederick as their lawful king.

== Papal service ==

Pope Honorius did not accept Frederick&#x27;s unilateral act and continued to regard John as the rightful king of Jerusalem. In an attempt to take advantage of the revived Lombard League (an alliance of northern Italian towns) against Frederick II, John went to Bologna. According to a version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, he declined an offer by the Lombard League representatives to elect him their king. Even though this account was fabricated, John remained in Bologna for over six months. The dying Pope Honorius appointed John rector of a Patrimony of Saint Peter in Tuscany (part of the Papal States) on 27 January 1227, and urged Frederick II to restore him to the throne of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Honorius&#x27; successor, Gregory IX, confirmed John&#x27;s position in the Papal States on 5 April and ordered the citizens of Perugia to elect him their &quot;podestà&quot;.

Gregory excommunicated Frederick II on 29 September 1227, accusing him of breaking his oath to lead a crusade to the Holy Land; the emperor had dispatched two fleets to Syria, but a plague forced them to return. His wife Isabella died after giving birth to a son, Conrad, in May 1228. Frederick continued to consider himself king of Jerusalem, in accordance with the precedent set by John during Isabella&#x27;s minority.

The imperial army under the command of Rainald of Urslingen invaded the Papal States in October 1228, beginning the so-called War of the Keys. Although John defeated the invaders in a series of battles, it took a counter-invasion by another papal army in southern Italy to drive Rainald back to Sulmona. John laid a siege before returning to Perugia in early 1229 to conclude negotiations with envoys of the Latin Empire of Constantinople, who were offering him the imperial crown.

== Emperor of Constantinople ==

=== Election ===

The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent was needed to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was willing to accept the regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire suspected that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an ally of the Holy See.

After months of negotiation, John and the envoys from the Latin Empire signed a treaty in Perugia which Pope Gregory confirmed on 9 April 1229. John was elected emperor of the Latin Empire for life as senior co-ruler with Baldwin II, who married John&#x27;s daughter Marie. The treaty also prescribed that although Baldwin would rule the Latin lands in Asia Minor when he was 20 years old, he would become sole emperor only after John&#x27;s death. John also stipulated that his sons would inherit Epirus and Macedonia, but the two regions still belonged to Emperor of Thessalonica Theodore Doukas.

After signing the treaty, John returned to Sulmona. According to the contemporary Matthew Paris, he allowed his soldiers to plunder nearby monasteries to obtain money. John lifted the siege of Sulmona in early 1229 to join Cardinal Pelagius, who launched a campaign against Capua. Frederick II (who had crowned himself king of Jerusalem in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre) returned to Italy, forcing the papal troops to withdraw.

John went to France to recruit warriors to accompany him to Constantinople. Pope Gregory did not proclaim John&#x27;s expedition to the Latin Empire a crusade but promised papal privileges granted to crusaders to those who joined him. During his stay in France, John was again an intermediary between local potentates and signed a peace treaty between Louis IX of France and Hugh X of Lusignan. He returned to Italy in late 1230. John&#x27;s envoys signed a treaty with Jacopo Tiepolo, Doge of Venice, who agreed to transport him and his retinue of 500 knights and 5,000 commoners to Constantinople in return for John&#x27;s confirmation of Venetian possessions and privileges in the Latin Empire. Shortly after John left for Constantinople in August, Pope Gregory acknowledged Frederick II&#x27;s claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

=== Rule ===
John was crowned emperor in Hagia Sophia in autumn 1231; by then, his territory was limited to Constantinople and its vicinity. The Venetians urged him to wage war against John III Vatatzes, Emperor of Nicaea, who supported a rebellion against their rule in Crete. According to Philippe Mouskes&#x27; &quot;Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, John could make &quot;neither war nor peace&quot;; because he did not invade the Empire of Nicaea, most French knights who accompanied him to Constantinople returned home after his coronation. To strengthen the Latin Empire&#x27;s financial position, Geoffrey II of Achaea (John&#x27;s most powerful vassal) gave him an annual subsidy of 30,000 &quot;hyperpyra&quot; after his coronation.

Taking advantage of John III Vatatzes&#x27; invasion of Rhodes, John launched a military expedition across the Bosphorus against the Empire of Nicaea in 1233. His three-to-four-month campaign &quot;achieved little, or nothing&quot;; the Latins only seized Pegai, now Biga in Turkey. With John&#x27;s approval, two Franciscan and two Dominican friars wanted to mediate a truce between the Latin Empire and Nicaea in 1234 but it was never signed. In a letter describing their negotiations, the friars described John as a &quot;pauper&quot; abandoned by his mercenaries.

John III Vatatzes and Ivan Asen II concluded a treaty dividing the Latin Empire in early 1235. Vatatzes soon seized the last outposts of the empire in Asia Minor and Gallipoli, and Asen occupied the Latin territories in Thrace. Constantinople was besieged in an effort to persuade the defenders to gather in one place, enabling an invasion elsewhere. Although the besiegers outnumbered the defenders, John repelled all attacks on the town&#x27;s walls. Mouskes compared him to Hector, Roland, Ogier the Dane and Judas Maccabeus in his &quot;Rhymed Chronicle&quot;, emphasizing his bravery.

A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes&#x27; naval forces to withdraw, but after the Venetians departed for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235. John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, pleading for assistance. Since the survival of the Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.

=== Death ===

According to three 13th-century authors (Matthew Paris, Salimbene di Adam and Bernard of Besse), John became a Franciscan friar before his death. They agree that John&#x27;s declining health contributed to his conversion, but Bernard also described a recurring vision of an old man urging the emperor to join the Franciscans. Most 13th-century sources suggest that John died between 19 and 23 March 1237, the only Latin emperor to die in Constantinople.

According to the &quot;Tales of the Minstrel of Reims&quot;, he was buried in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote that John, who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi&#x27;s Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.

== Family ==

John&#x27;s first wife (Maria the Marquise, born 1191) was the only child of Isabella I of Jerusalem and her second husband, Conrad of Montferrat. Maria inherited Jerusalem from her mother in 1205. John and Maria&#x27;s only child, Isabella (also known as Yolanda), was born in late 1212.

Stephanie of Armenia became John&#x27;s second wife in 1214. She was the only daughter of Leo II of Armenia and his first wife, Isabelle (niece of Sibylle, the third wife of Bohemond III of Antioch). Stephanie gave birth to a son in 1220, but she and her son died that year.

John married his third wife, Berengaria of León, in 1224; she was born around 1204 to Alfonso IX of León and Berengaria of Castile. John and Berengaria&#x27;s first child, Marie, was born in 1224. Their first son, Alphonse, was born during the late 1220s. Berengaria&#x27;s cousin, Louis IX of France, made him Grand Chamberlain of France and he acquired the County of Eu in France with his marriage. John&#x27;s second son, Louis, was born around 1230. His youngest son, John, who was born in the early 1230s, was Grand Butler of France.

<text>The Dukes is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series based on the live-action television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; which aired on CBS from February 5 to October 29, 1983. Hanna-Barbera Productions produced the series in association with Warner Bros. Television, producer of the original series. 20 episodes were produced.

==Plot==
The series features the Duke boys and their cousin Daisy in an automobile race around the world against Boss Hogg, Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane, and Rosco&#x27;s dog Flash in a duel for the prize money which the Dukes hope to use to keep the family farm from being foreclosed by Boss Hogg. Meanwhile, Boss Hogg wants the money and the land for himself so he, Rosco, and Flash plans various schemes to keep the Dukes from winning. Most of the adventures are read from a post card by Uncle Jesse Duke to his pet raccoon Smokey.

The first season took place during the period of the live-action series&#x27; temporary replacement of the original actors with similar characters, Coy and Vance Duke, after Tom Wopat and John Schneider walked out over a dispute about royalties from related merchandise. Thus, the first season of this animated series featured Coy and Vance. Bo and Luke eventually replaced Coy and Vance in Season 2 Episode 1 (14): &quot;Boss O&#x27;Hogg and the Little People&quot; after Tom and John simultaneously returned to the live series following the end of the dispute near the end of the fifth season. This episode also featured a new introduction and voice over that reflected the change in characters.

The series followed no particular logical geographic path; for instance, consecutive episodes feature appearances in Venice, Morocco, the Arctic Ocean, London, Greece, India, Uzbekistan, Hong Kong and Scotland.

==Cast==
* Byron Cherry as Coy Duke (first season)
* Christopher Mayer as Vance Duke (first season)
* Tom Wopat as Luke Duke (second season)
* John Schneider as Bo Duke (second season)
* Catherine Bach as Daisy Duke
* Denver Pyle as Uncle Jesse Duke
* James Best as Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane
* Sorrell Booke as Boss Hogg
* Frank Welker as Flash, Smokey, The General Lee

Note: Live-action co-stars Waylon Jennings (narrator/&quot;balladeer&quot;), Ben Jones (Cooter Davenport), Sonny Shroyer (Deputy Enos Strate), and Rick Hurst (Deputy Cletus Hogg) did not appear in this cartoon version.

<text>Jena () is a city in Germany and the second largest city in Thuringia. Together with the nearby cities of Erfurt and Weimar, it forms the central metropolitan area of Thuringia with approximately 500,000 inhabitants, while the city itself has a population of about 110,000. Jena is a centre of education and research. The University of Jena (formally the Friedrich Schiller University) was founded in 1558 and had 18,000 students in 2017 and the Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena serves another 5,000 students. Furthermore, there are many institutes of the leading German research societies.

Jena was first mentioned in 1182 and stayed a small town until the 19th century, when industry developed. For most of the 20th century, Jena was a world centre of the optical industry around companies such as Carl Zeiss, Schott and Jenoptik (since 1990). As one of only a few medium-sized cities in Germany, it has some high-rise buildings in the city centre, such as the JenTower. These also have their origin in the former Carl Zeiss factory.

Between 1790 and 1850, Jena was a focal point of the German Vormärz as well as of the student liberal and unification movement and German Romanticism. Notable persons of this period in Jena were Friedrich Schiller, Alexander von Humboldt, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Novalis, and August Wilhelm Schlegel.

Jena&#x27;s economy is largely built upon its high-technology infrastructure and research. The precision optical instruments industry is its leading branch to date, although software engineering, other digital businesses, and biotechnology are of growing importance. Furthermore, Jena is also a service hub for its regional environs.

Jena lies in a hilly landscape in the east of Thuringia, within the wide valley of the Saale river. Due to its rocky landscape, varied substrate and mixed forests, Jena is known in Germany for the wide variety of wild orchids which can be found within walking distance of the town. Local nature reserves are maintained by volunteers and NABU.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===

Until the High Middle Ages, the Saale was the border between Germanic regions in the west and Slavic regions in the east. Owing to its function as a river crossing, Jena was conveniently located. Nevertheless, there were also some more important Saale crossings such as the nearby cities of Naumburg to the north and Saalfeld to the south, so that the relevance of Jena was more local during the Middle Ages. The first unequivocal mention of Jena was in an 1182 document. The first local rulers of the region were the Lords of Lobdeburg with their eponymous castle near Lobeda, roughly south of the city centre on the eastern hillside of the Saale valley.

In the 13th century, the Lords of Lobdeburg founded two towns in the valley: Jena on the west bank and Lobeda – which is one of Jena&#x27;s constituent communities today – to the south on the east bank. Around 1230, Jena received town rights and a regular city grid was established between today&#x27;s Fürstengraben, Löbdergraben, Teichgraben and Leutragraben. The city got a marketplace, main church, town hall, council and city walls during the late 13th and early 14th centuries making it into a full-fledged town. In this time, the city&#x27;s economy was based mainly on wine production on the warm and sunny hillsides of the Saale valley. The two monasteries of the Dominicans (1286) and the Cistercians (1301) rounded out Jena&#x27;s medieval appearance.

As the political circumstances in Thuringia changed in the middle of the 14th century, the weakened Lords of Lobdeburg sold Jena to the aspiring Wettins in 1331. Jena obtained the Gotha municipal law and the citizens strengthened their rights and wealth during the 14th and 15th centuries. Moreover, the Wettins were more interested in their residence in the nearby city of Weimar, and so Jena could develop itself relatively autonomously.

=== Early modern period ===

The Protestant Reformation was brought to the city in 1523. Martin Luther visited the town to reorganize the clerical relations and Jena became an early centre of his doctrine. In the following years, the Dominican and the Carmelite convents were attacked by the townsmen and abolished in 1525 (Carmelite) and 1548 (Dominican).

An important step in Jena&#x27;s history was the foundation of the university in 1558. Ernestine Elector John Frederick the Magnanimous founded it, because he had lost his old university in Wittenberg to the Albertines after the Schmalkaldic War. During the Little Ice Age, wine-growing declined in the 17th century, so that the new university became one of the most important sources of income for the city. The same century brought a boom in printing business caused by the rising importance of books (and the population&#x27;s ability to read) in the Lutheran doctrine, and Jena was the second-largest printing location in Germany after Leipzig.

The list of the so-called &quot;Seven Wonders of Jena&quot; was composed by students of the university at this time, supposedly as a test of local knowledge in order to confirm that a person who claimed to have studied in Jena was actually familiar with the city.

Beginning in the 16th century, the Ernestine dynasty saw many territorial partitions. Initially, Jena remained a part of Saxe-Weimar, but in 1672 it became the capital of its own small duchy (Saxe-Jena). In 1692, after two dukes (Bernhard II and Johann Wilhelm), the dukes of Saxe-Jena died out and the duchy became part of Saxe-Eisenach and, in 1741, of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, to which it belonged until 1809. From 1809 to 1918, Jena was part of the Duchy (from 1815 Grand Duchy) of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, which from 1871 was also part of the German Empire.

=== 18th century ===

Around 1790, the university became the largest and most famous one among the German states and made Jena the centre of the self-centred, idealist philosophy of ‘Ich&#x27; (with professors such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Schiller, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling). It was also home to the early Romanticism (with poets such as Novalis, the brothers August and Friedrich Schlegel, and Ludwig Tieck).

In 1794, the poets Goethe and Schiller met at the university and established a long lasting friendship, based on their love of Shakespeare. Consequently, the reputation of the University and the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach as liberal and open-minded, but severely self-absorbed, was established and enhanced.

=== 19th century ===
On 14 October 1806, Napoleon fought and defeated the Prussian army here in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, near the district of Vierzehnheiligen. Resistance against the French occupation was strong, especially among the students. Many of the students fought in the Lützow Free Corps in 1813. Two years later, the Urburschenschaft fraternity was founded in the city.

During the later 19th century, the famous biologist Ernst Haeckel was professor at the university. The expansion of science and medicine faculties was closely linked to the industrial boom that Jena saw after 1871. The initial spark of industrialization in Jena was the (relatively late) connection to the railway. The Saal Railway (&quot;Saalbahn&quot;, opened in 1874) was the connection from Halle and Leipzig along the Saale valley to Nuremberg and the Weimar–Gera railway (opened 1876) connected Jena with Frankfurt and Erfurt in the west as well as Dresden and Gera in the east. Famous pioneers of the Jenaer industry were Carl Zeiss and Ernst Abbe (with their Carl Zeiss AG) as well as Otto Schott (Schott AG). Since that time, production of optical items, precision machinery and laboratory glassware have been the main branches of Jena&#x27;s economy; Jena glass is even named after the city. Zeiss, Abbe and Schott worked also as social reformers who wanted to improve the living conditions of their workers and the local wealth in general. When Zeiss died in 1889, his company passed to the Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung, which uses great amounts of the company&#x27;s profits for social benefits such as research projects at universities etc. This model became an example for other German companies (e.g. the Robert Bosch Stiftung). In 1898 it was agreed on with several personalities from the Jenaer industrial sector that the city was in need of an electricity generator and in the first years of the 1900s an electrified tramway was founded in Jena.

=== 20th century ===

Industrialization fundamentally changed the social structure of Jena. The former academic town became a working-class city; the population rose from 8,000 around 1870 up to 71,000 at the beginning of World War II. The city expanded along the Saale valley to the north and the south and its side valleys to the east and the west. In 1901, the tram system started its operation and the university got a new main building (established between 1906 and 1908 on the former castle&#x27;s site). After the foundation of Thuringia in 1920, Jena was one of the three biggest cities (together with Weimar and Gera, while Erfurt remained part of Prussia) and became an independent city in 1922. The modern optical and glass industry kept booming and the city grew further during Weimar times.
During the Nazi period, conflicts deepened in Jena between the influential left-wing milieus (communists and social democrats) and the right-wing Nazi milieus. On the one hand, the university suffered from new restrictions against its independence, but on the other hand, it consolidated the Nazi ideology, for example with a professorship of social anthropology (which sought to scientifically legitimize the racial policy of Nazi Germany). Kristallnacht in 1938 led to more discrimination against Jews in Jena, many of whom either emigrated or were arrested and murdered by the German government. This weakened the academic milieu, because many academics were Jews (especially in medicine). During World War II, the Germans operated two subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp in the city, and a subcamp of the prison in Sieradz in German-occupied Poland.

In 1945, toward the end of World War II, Jena was repeatedly targeted by Allied bombing raids. 709 people were killed, 2,000 injured, and most of the medieval town centre was destroyed, but in parts restored after the end of the war. No other Thuringian city suffered worse damage, except Nordhausen, whose destruction was utter. Today most of the city consists of buildings from before World War II. Jena was occupied by American troops on 13 April 1945 and was left to the Red Army on 1 July 1945.

Jena fell within the Soviet zone of occupation in post-World War II Germany. In 1949, it became part of the new German Democratic Republic (GDR). The Soviets dismantled great parts of the Zeiss and Schott factories and took them to the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the GDR government founded a new pharmaceutical factory in 1950, Jenapharm, which is part of Bayer today. In 1953, Jena was a centre of the East German Uprising against GDR policy. The protests with 30,000 participants drew fire from Soviet tanks.
The following decades brought some radical shifts in city planning. During the 1960s, another part of the historic city centre was demolished to build the Jen Tower. The Eichplatz in front of the tower is still unbuilt and its future is still the subject of ongoing heated discussion. Big Plattenbau settlements were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, because the population was still rising and the housing shortage remained a perpetual problem. New districts established in the north (near Rautal) and in the south (around Winzerla and Lobeda). The opposition against the GDR government was reinforced during the late 1980s in Jena, fed by academic and clerical circles. In autumn 1989, the city saw the largest protests in its history before the GDR government was dissolved.

After 1990, Jena became part of the refounded state of Thuringia. Industry came into a heavy crisis during the 1990s, but finally it managed the transition to the market economy and today, it is one of the leading economic centres of eastern Germany. Furthermore, the university was enlarged and many new research institutes were founded.

Especially between 1995 and 1997 several far-right crimes were committed in Jena. The city&#x27;s far-right scene of the 1990s gave rise to the National Socialist Underground (NSU) terror group. However, the city is no longer considered a far-right hotspot.

== Geography and demographics ==
=== Topography ===
Jena is situated in a hilly landscape in eastern Thuringia at the Saale river, between the Harz mountains in the north, the Thuringian Forest/Thuringian Highland in the southwest and the Ore Mountains, in the southeast. The municipal terrain is hilly with rugged slopes at the valley&#x27;s edges. The city centre is situated at 160 m of elevation, whereas the mountains on both sides of Saale valley rise up to 400 m. On the eastern side those are (from north to south): the &quot;Gleisberg&quot; near Kunitz, the &quot;Jenzig&quot; near Wogau, the &quot;Hausberg&quot; near Wenigenjena, the &quot;Kernberge&quot; near Wöllnitz, the &quot;Johannisberg&quot; near Lobeda and the &quot;Einsiedlerberg&quot; near Drackendorf. On the western side, there are the &quot;Jägersberg&quot; near Zwätzen, the &quot;Windknollen&quot; north of the city centre, the &quot;Tatzend&quot; west of the city centre, the &quot;Lichtenhainer Höhe&quot; near Lichtenhain, the &quot;Holzberg&quot; near Winzerla, the &quot;Jagdberg&quot; near Göschwitz and the Spitzenberg near Maua. The mountains belong to the geological formation of Ilm Saale Plate (Muschelkalk) and are relatively flat on their peaks but steep to the valleys in between. Due to its jagged surface, the municipal territory isn&#x27;t very suitable for agriculture all the more since the most flat areas along the valley were built on during the 20th century. At the mountains is some forest of different leaf trees and pines.

=== Ecology ===
32 species of native orchids can be found in the Jena area. One of the best places to see them is Leutratal, to the south of the town. Bee orchid &quot;(Ophrys apifera&quot;) even grows at a few locations within the town. On the &quot;Hausberg&quot; close to Ziegenhain a few specimens of the rare true service tree (&quot;Cormus domestica&quot;) can be found. Firefly can be seen in the meadows in Paradiespark as well as a variety of native wildflowers. Wildlife on the surrounding mountains includes raven, sand lizard and wood ants. Heron, beaver and muskrat have been seen on the Saale, within the town. Pine martens sometimes come into the town at night, from the mountains, to raid bins. It is documented that the European wildcat occurs near Jena.

=== Climate ===
Jena has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;). Summers are warm and sometimes humid; winters are relatively cold. The city&#x27;s topography creates a microclimate caused through the basin position with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ) and heat and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long. During the Middle Ages, Jena was famous for growing wine on its slopes. Nowadays, the next commercial wine-growing areas are situated down Saale river. Due to its distance to coastal areas and position in the Saale valley, wind speeds tend to be very low; predominant direction is SW.

The Jena weather station has recorded the following extreme values:
* Its highest temperature was on 20 July 2022.
* Its lowest temperature was on 22 January 1850 and 2 February 1830.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was in 1882.
* Its least annual precipitation was in 1911.
* The longest annual sunshine was 1928.8 hours in 2003.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1108.6 hours in 1960.
=== Administrative division ===
Jena abuts the district of Saale-Holzland with the municipalities of Lehesten, Neuengönna, and Golmsdorf in the north, Jenalöbnitz, Großlöbichau, and Schlöben in the east and Laasdorf, Zöllnitz, Sulza, Rothenstein, Milda, and Bucha in the south and the district of Weimarer Land with the municipalities of Döbritschen, Großschwabhausen, and Saaleplatte in the west.

The city is divided into 30 districts. The inner-city districts are Zentrum, Nord, West, Süd, Wenigenjena (east of Saale, incorporated in 1909), and Kernberge, other big districts are Lobeda (incorporated in 1946) and Winzerla (incorporated in 1922) in the south with large housing complexes.

The residual districts are from a more rural constitution:

=== Demographics ===
Over the centuries, Jena had mostly been a town of 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants. The population growth began in the 19th century with an amount of 6,000 in 1840 and of 8,000 in 1870. Then, a demographic boom occurred with a population of 20,000 in 1900, 50,000 in 1920, 73,000 in 1940, 81,000 in 1960 and 104,000 in 1980. The peak was reached in 1988 with a population of 108,000. The bad economic situation in eastern Germany after the reunification resulted in a decline in population, which fell to 99,000 in 1998 before rising again to 107,000 in 2012.

The average population growth between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.47% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Jena. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders.

The birth surplus was 62 in 2012, or +0.6 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +4.0 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Jena migrants are rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries such as Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

Like many other eastern German cities, Jena has a small foreign-born population: circa 4.0% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 6.2% are migrants (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Jena are Russians, Chinese and Ukrainians. During recent years, the economic situation of the city has improved: the unemployment rate declined from 14% in 2005 to 7% in 2013. Due to the official policy of atheism in the former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. 15.9% are members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 6.6% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census).

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==
=== Museums ===
Jena has a great variety of museums:
* The &quot;Optical Museum Jena&quot; at Carl-Zeiß-Platz shows the history of optical instruments such as glasses, microscopes, cameras, and telescopes. 
* The &quot;Phyletisches Museum&quot; at Neutor hosts a natural history exhibition with focus on evolution and fossils. 
* The &quot;Stadtmuseum &amp; Kunstsammlung&quot; at Markt square shows the city history of Jena and hosts furthermore an exhibition of modern and contemporary art.

=== Cityscape ===
Most of the city consists of buildings from before World War II. The historic city centre is located inside the former wall (which is the area between Fürstengraben in the north, Löbdergraben in the east, Teichgraben in the south and Leutragraben in the west). There are only a few historic buildings in this area (e.g. at Oberlauengasse), due to the destruction during World War II and modernization projects in the following decades. The Eichplatz, a big sub-used square covering a large amount of the centre, has not been built on since the 1960s and the discussion about its future is still in process. The wall&#x27;s defortification took place relatively early in the 18th century – and the first suburbs developed in front of the former city gates. In these areas, some historic building structures from the 18th and early 19th century remained in western Bachstraße and Wagnergasse, in northern Zwätzengasse and in southern Neugasse.

The later 19th and early 20th centuries brought a construction boom to Jena, with the city enlarged to the north and south along the Saale valley, to the west along &quot;Mühltal&quot; and on the Saale&#x27;s east side in former Wenigenjena. Compared with the city centre, later substantial losses were much slighter in this areas. During the interwar period, the construction of flats stayed on a high level but suitable ground got less, so that new housing complexes were set up relatively far away from the centre – a problem that remained until today with long journeys and high rents as consequences. Today&#x27;s Jena is not as compact as other cities in the region, and urban planning is still a challenge.

A peculiarity of Jena is the presence of a second old town centre with a market square, town hall, and castle in the former town of Lobeda, which is a district since 1946, located approximately to the south of Jena&#x27;s centre.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture plays a small role in Jena, only 40% of the municipal territory are in use for farming (compared to over 60% in Erfurt and nearly 50% in Weimar). Furthermore, the Muschelkalk soil is not very fertile and is often used as pasture for cattle. The only large agricultural area is situated around Isserstedt, Cospeda and Vierzehnheiligen district in the northwest. Wine-growing was discontinued during the Little Ice Age around 1800, but is now possible again due to global warming. Nevertheless, the commercial production of wine hasn&#x27;t yet resumed.

Industry is a great tradition in Jena, reaching back to the mid-19th century. In 2012, there were 80 companies in industrial production with more than 20 workers employing 8,300 persons and generating a turnover of more than 1,5 billion Euro. The most important branches are precision machinery, pharmaceuticals, optics, biotechnology and software engineering. Notable companies in Jena are the traditional Carl Zeiss AG, Schott AG, Jenoptik and Jenapharm as well as new companies such as Intershop Communications, Analytik Jena, and Carl Zeiss Meditec. Jena has the most market-listed companies and is one of the most important economic centres of east Germany.

With companies such as Intershop Communications, Salesforce.com (after the acquisition of Demandware) and ePages as well as several web agencies, Jena is a hub for E-commerce in Germany. Other IT players with regional offices include Accenture or ESET. Jena-Optronik, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, develops components for spaceflight or satellites in Jena.

The city is among Germany&#x27;s 50 fastest growing regions, with many internationally renowned research institutes and companies, a comparatively low unemployment and a young population structure. Jena was awarded the title &quot;Stadt der Wissenschaft&quot; (city of science) by the &quot;Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft&quot;, a German science association, in 2008.

Jena is also a hub of public and private services, specially in education, research and business services. Other important institutions are the High Court of Thuringia and Thuringia&#x27;s solely university hospital. Furthermore, Jena is a regional centre in infrastructure and retail with many shopping centres.

Together with the photonics lab Lichtwerkstatt and the Krautspace there are makerspaces and hackerspaces enabling start-ups to create their product ideas and realizing their first prototype and business models as well as networking.

=== Transport ===

==== By rail ====

Jena has no central railway station with connection to all the lines at one point. What is relatively common in many countries is quite unusual for a German city and caused on the one hand by the city&#x27;s difficult topography and on the other hand by the history, because the two main lines were built by two different private companies. The connection in north–south direction is the Saal Railway with ICE trains running from Berlin in the north to Munich in the south once a day stopping at Paradies station and local trains to Naumburg and Saalfeld stopping at Zwätzen, Saalbahnhof, Paradies and Göschwitz. The connection in west–east direction is the Weimar–Gera railway with regional express trains to Göttingen (via Erfurt and Weimar) and Zwickau, Glauchau, Altenburg or Greiz (via Gera) and local trains between Weimar, Jena and Gera. The express trains stop at West station near the city centre and Göschwitz, the local trains furthermore at Neue Schenke. The junction between both lines is the Göschwitz station, approx. south of the city centre.

When the Nuremberg–Erfurt high-speed railway opened in 2017, the city lost its connection to the long-distance train network. As compensation, there are new regional express train services to Halle and Leipzig in the north, and to Nuremberg in the south.

==== By road ====
The two Autobahnen crossing each other nearby at &quot;Hermsdorf junction&quot; are the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt–Dresden) and the Bundesautobahn 9 (Berlin–Munich), which were both built during the 1930s. The A 4 runs quite next to the Lobeda housing complexes and the Leutra district. Therefore, it was rebuilt in the 2000s and got two tunnels to protect the residents and the environment against noise and air pollution. Furthermore, there are two Bundesstraßen crossing in Jena: the Bundesstraße 7 is a connection to Weimar in the west and Gera in the east and the Bundesstraße 88 is a connection along Saale valley to Naumburg in the north and Rudolstadt in the south. Furthermore, there are some roads to Apolda via Isserstedt, Blankenhain via Ammerbach and Stadtroda via Lobeda. Most parts of city centre inside the former walls are pedestrian areas.

==== By aviation ====
The next local airports to Jena are the Erfurt–Weimar Airport, approx. to the west and the Leipzig/Halle Airport, approx. to the northeast, which both serve mostly for holiday flights to the Mediterranean and other touristic regions. The next major airports are Frankfurt Airport, Berlin Brandenburg Airport and Munich Airport.

==== By bike ====
Despite the hilly terrain in some parts, Jena is a cycling city, due to the many students. Cycling has become more popular in Jena since the 1990s when good quality bike paths began to be built. There are bike lanes along some main streets, though, in comparison to other cities in Germany, there are deficits.

For bicycle touring there is the &quot;Saale track&quot; () and the &quot;Thuringian city string track&quot; (). Both of these connect points of tourist interest: the former along the Saale valley from Fichtel Mountains in Bavaria to the Elbe river near Magdeburg, while the latter follows the medieval Via Regia closely and runs from Eisenach via Erfurt, Weimar and Jena to Altenburg via Gera.

==== Trams and buses ====

The Jena tramway network was established in 1901 and enlarged after the German reunification. It connects the major districts with the city centre; there are 5 ordinary lines served in different intervals between 7,5 and 20 minutes. Nevertheless, there are some old single-track segments interfering the services. Furthermore, there is an extensive network of buses, run (such as the trams) by the &quot;Jenah&quot; organization, a pun on Jena and the German lit. &#x27;public transport&#x27;. Buses of the JES Verkehrsgesellschaft connect Jena with cities and villages in the region.

=== Education and research ===
After reunification, the educational system was realigned. The University of Jena, established in 1558, was largely extended. Today there are approximately 21,000 students at this university. Another college is the Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena, a University of Applied Sciences founded in 1991 which offers a combination of scientific training and its practical applications. There are also nearly 5,000 students.

Further there are six Gymnasiums, five state-owned and one Christian (ecumenical). One of the state-owned is a &quot;Sportgymnasium&quot;, an elite boarding school for young talents in athletics or football. Another state-owned Gymnasium (the Carl-Zeiss-Gymnasium Jena) offers a focus in sciences also as an elite boarding school additionally to the common curriculum.

The various research institutes based in Jena include: 
* The Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology is an important research center and offers a Ph.D. program
* The Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History
* The Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry
* The Institute of Photonic Technology
* The Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering (IOF)
* The Leibniz Institute for Age Research, a research center with a Ph.D. program
* INNOVENT - a private research center
* The Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology
* Friedrich-Löffler-Institute of Bacterial Infections and Zoonoses
* Friedrich-Löffler-Institute of Molecular Pathogenesis
* The Jena Center for Bioinformatics

== Quality of life ==
In 2013, according to a study by Kieler Institut für Weltwirtschaft, Jena was ranked as the fifth-most livable city in Germany.

According to the 2019 study by Forschungsinstitut Prognos, Jena is one of the most dynamic regions in Germany. It ranks at number 29 of all 401 German regions.

== Politics ==

=== Mayor and city council ===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Peter Röhlinger of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), who served from 1990 to 2006. In 2006 he was succeeded by Albrecht Schröter of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Schröter was defeated seeking re-election in 2018 by Thomas Nitzsche of the FDP, who has since served as mayor. The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, with a runoff held on 9 June, and the results were as follows:

<text>Eyewitness to History was a Friday night CBS Television Network public affairs program. It was initially hosted by veteran broadcaster Charles Kuralt (1960–61), followed by Walter Cronkite (1961–62), and then Charles Collingwood (1962–63). It aired from September 30, 1960 through July 26, 1963 in the 10:30 pm time slot. Sponsored by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, the series concentrated on the most significant news story or stories of the previous week. Major events reviewed included the Kennedy-Nixon 1960 Presidential campaign, highlights of the Kennedy administration, the Bay Of Pigs invasion, the space race, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the civil rights movement.

The show&#x27;s title was shortened to Eyewitness in 1961. Coincidentally, many local CBS affiliates adopted the branding &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; for their local newscasts in the 1960s. 

Leslie Midgley and John Sharnik were the producers. 

One of the show&#x27;s producers, Av Westin, went on to become executive producer of &quot;ABC Evening News&quot; and, later, &quot;20/20&quot;.

<text>Spynet is a CBC Television children&#x27;s show, which features Sam, played by Kim Schraner, as a spy operative for a fictional Canadian spy agency, the National Espionage Task-Force (NET). It started as an ultra-low budget segment, of short length, but increased modestly in budget and length, to a half-hour format. It aired on February 25, 2002 to 2004 and is directed by Michael Kinney

The episodes, built to be educational with a plot, vary in their content-action ratio.

==Show format==
Originally, the show had only one visible regular, known under her code name of Sam. However, as the budget and length of the show increased, a number of recurring characters appeared, although the focus is still heavily on Sam. Sam works in a white, windowless van parked in an anonymous city, which she hops around, trying to stop crime. The van is filled with lots of high-tech spy gadgets and computer equipment. The show is mainly filmed in downtown Toronto, and makes great use of the CBC&#x27;s extensive, private building, which many of the scenes are filmed in.

When started, the show had a fairly standard format, geared to education. Each episode, Pendleton&#x27;s voice is heard over a speaker, introducing the mission. She talks briefly on what she expects from the mission; this is to encourage students to evaluate and plan. The mission will then lead to Sam calling up a training video or NET file archive interview, relating to the topic that the mission indirectly deals with. Often she, shows another clip, to continue the preparation. She then heads off on her mission, in which is acted normally without interaction with the viewer; another clip will then be shown, and she will wrap up her espionage. Back in the van, she reflects on the mission in her web-cam video diary; this is to encourage students to reflect on work and stories, and identify their mistakes or weaknesses. She then talks directly to the viewer once more, continuing to reflect, and wraps up the episode, usually drawing conclusions on the subject that the show was themed to.

The short documentary-like videos help give background information to the viewers, without Sam divulging a lecture on the topic. The videos cover both espionage tactics and historical applications of the concept that it highlighted in the episode. Highlighted topics range from bugs, internal spies, codes, hidden cameras and stealth devices.

However, as the show has expanded in length, it has moved closer to a typical spy drama, and is less focused on education, and more focused on entertainment.

==Characters==
===Sam===
Graduating at the top of her NET Spy School class, Sam is especially skilled at surveillance, hand to hand combat, disguise and radio/video operations.

Her parents disappeared without a trace when she was only eight years old, their whereabouts are unknown to Sam. She has, however, received a videotape of her father, wishing her good luck with her life. It was taped shortly before he was dispatched as on a new, top secret mission. With the vanishing of her family, she moved in with an aunt, uncle and two young cousins. All of this family has been continuously scrutinized by authorities for their criminal activities. Sam maintains very little contact with this family.

To prove her worth after failing the Armed Forces Black Ops training, she successfully enrolled with the National Espionage Taskforce. She is quite eager to prove herself, making her an excellent agent; however, this same attribute also causes her to threaten security, as she tasks many unnecessary risks. In the NET, she reports to Pendleton, her Field Operatives Supervisor.

Sam&#x27;s personal life also plays a role in some episodes. One mission, she is to break into an independent spy/thief&#x27;s house, in order to prove or debunk the suspicion that his children are also becoming involved in the illegal trade. The family will be away for 48 hours, so she has perfect opportunity to break into their house. She finds that it is actually her uncle&#x27;s abode, and finds a video in one of the children&#x27;s closets in an envelope. It contains a message from her father who she hasn&#x27;t seen in years. He too is a spy, and the video wishes her all the best, as he knows that this may be their last contact as he parts on a long-term mission. This then allows her to somewhat emotionally divulge her childhood loneliness, which sent her into the spy industry. The whole mission, she concludes, was staged by her boss Pendelton, to allow her the chance to receive such a sensitive VHS video tape.

In one episode, Sam was investigating a clone. She ended up discovering the clone looked exactly like her. However, it was revealed that Sam may have been a clone.

One key element to this show is how Sam never uses weapons, like MacGyver. The enemy spies and terrorists use weapons whenever appropriate, but she either lets them escape or quickly disarms them.

===Pendleton===
Pendleton is a &quot;Field Operatives Supervisor&quot; for the NET. He assigns cases to his operatives, including Sam. He prides

<doc id="182927" wikidata="Q7764593" url="?curid=182927" title="The Skatebirds">
<text>The Skatebirds (onscreen title: Skatebirds) is an American live-action/animated package program produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and broadcast on CBS from September 10, 1977, to January 21, 1978.
It has many similarities to &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;.

==Overview==
The Skatebirds consisted of three large costumed birds on roller skates: Knock-Knock, a woodpecker (voiced by Lennie Weinrib); Satchel, a pelican (voiced by Bob Holt) and Scooter, a penguin (voiced by Don Messick). Their nemesis was a cat named Scat Cat (voiced by Scatman Crothers).

The live-action sequences featuring The Skatebirds mostly revolved around the nasty Scat Cat perpetually chasing the roller-skating trio and trying to get the best of them. Unlike the &quot;Banana Splits&quot; live-action segments, the Skatebirds were filmed in a variety of theme-park locations, rather than running around in a single studio.

The show was divided into four short segments introduced by live action wraparounds with The Skatebirds characters which included three animated segments (&quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot;, &quot;Wonder Wheels&quot; and &quot;Woofer &amp; Wimper, Dog Detectives&quot;) and a 10-minute live-action segment (&quot;Mystery Island&quot;). The appearance of the characters and the show&#x27;s format was similar to &quot;The Banana Splits&quot;. Unlike its similar predecessor and most Saturday morning children&#x27;s shows produced in the 1970s, &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; did not contain a laugh track.

A total of 16 episodes of &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; were produced in its original run from September 10, 1977, to January 21, 1978. In the fall of 1979, the show returned to CBS in a shortened half-hour version with &quot;Wonder Wheels&quot; and &quot;Mystery Island&quot; segments (&quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot; and &quot;Woofer &amp; Whimper, Dog Detectives&quot; segments had been spun off into a separate half-hour) and broadcast on Sunday mornings from September 9, 1979, until January 25, 1981. In the late 1980s, a different syndicated half-hour version of &quot;The Skatebirds&quot; with &quot;The Robonic Stooges&quot; and &quot;Wonder Wheels&quot; segments was shown on USA Cartoon Express and later resurfaced on Cartoon Network in the 1990s and Boomerang in the 2000s.

==Opening and closing credits==
The opening credits for the original one-hour version with voice-over narration by the show&#x27;s recording director Wally Burr:

The music featured in the closing credits is the &quot;CB Bears&quot; theme which was also later used as the ending credits for &quot;Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels&quot;.

==Segments==
===The Robonic Stooges===

The characters of The Three Stooges – Moe (voiced by Paul Winchell), Larry (voiced by Joe Baker) and Curly (voiced by Frank Welker) – as clumsy crime-fighting bionic superheroes who are given assignments via film projector from their boss Agent 000 (voiced by Ross Martin) who runs the Superhero Employment Agency.

===Wonder Wheels===

A high school journalist named Willie Wheeler (voiced by Micky Dolenz) and his girlfriend Dooley (voiced by Susan Davis) solve crimes with the help of his shape-shifting superhero motorcycle Wonder Wheels. Whenever Willie goes into action, his beat-up motorcycle transforms itself into a flashy version with a mind of its own.

===Woofer &amp; Wimper, Dog Detectives===

A shortened and re-titled version of &quot;Clue Club&quot; featuring two talking bloodhounds – Woofer &amp; Wimper (voiced by Paul Winchell and Jim MacGeorge) – who help solve mysteries with the Clue Club detectives: Larry (voiced by David Jolliffe), Pepper (voiced by Patricia Stitch), D.D. (voiced by Bob Hastings), and Dottie (voiced by Tara Talboy) which usually ends with the bad guys arrested by Sheriff Bagley (voiced by John Stephenson). The original half-hour episodes of &quot;Clue Club&quot; were cut-down to 10 minutes to showcase both dogs as the show&#x27;s main characters.

===Mystery Island===

The adventures of a plane crew consisting of pilot Chuck Kelly (portrayed by Stephen Parr), computer expert Sue Corwin (portrayed by Lynn Marie Johnston), her younger brother Sandy (portrayed by Larry Volk), and their robot named P.O.P.S. (voiced by Frank Welker) who stranded on a remote island by the evil scientist Dr. Strange (portrayed by Michael Kermoyan) after he used a tractor beam to bring their airplane down onto Mystery Island. Dr. Strange hopes to capture P.O.P.S. and use it in his quest for world domination.
